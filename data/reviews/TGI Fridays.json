{"text":"I love TGIF ever since but I never wrote a review.  The food is good, the dessert is not to miss and their happy hour on drinks is cherry on top.  This one inside The Orleans is great place to dine after or before going to the movies or bowling (or to gamble for the gamblers)."}
{"text":"Good service but not so good food. I already ate on many tgi Fridays and this is the first one where the food was not good. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Loud people. It was Sunday Night football in the bar area. The restaurant was not that busy and our waitress mostly stayed at the table next to us talking with another customer."}
{"text":"OMG never again, the quality of food had went down way way down and to top it all of they charge for soft drinks refill?really???i asked for lemon wedges and they brought out lemon that was squeezed and placed back on the plate.  The table was sticky, the new look for the menu is nice well that if it was clean I had dried sainted pages, washing your hands is a must. I'm being generous enough to give them one star, over priced crappy food."}
{"text":"Food was delivered quickly and overall atmosphere was nice. Bartender did a swell job."}
{"text":"My expectations for Fridays are pretty low because it's a chain restaurant.  I don't go in expecting to have the best meal of my life.  I mainly go in expecting to not get food poisoning.  And, in reality, I guess that my expectations were met.

I do, however, expect to have at least semi-decent service.  I'm not saying that you have to take my order immediately after I close my menu; however, I don't think it's an unreasonable expectation to want my Waiter to take my order during my first half hour in a restaurant.  This is especially true when it's in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and the restaurant is hardly at its busiest. 

In addition to expecting my order to arrive on time, it would also be nice if the Waiter didn't practically throw my plate of food at me.  Maybe I expect too much?  Or maybe I was just bitter because I left all my money in a slot machine outside the door?"}
{"text":"Steak was ok, baked potato was ok, but onion rings were not so good! They were like they came from a frozen bag from the supermarket and not freshly made! Service was very slow. It's pretty bad when you have to wait 10 to 12 minuets to get a draft beer when your table is right next to the bar! It took over a half hour to get our food and the place was not even crowded! Not coming here anymore!!"}
{"text":"I go here before Pens games or shows. Drinks are amazing and so is the food! Sometimes it's hard to get the bartenders attention...sometimes you have to walk around and find her/him. Overall, it's a cool place to come before or after events at Consol."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting TGI Fridays restaurants for years but have not been able to eat at one for around  six months.  Last weekend I had the opportunity to eat at this one and was surprised at some of the more recent TGI Fridays policy changes.  If you order a cheeseburger and want to change from Swiss to American cheese (or vice versa), it's a dollar upcharge.  We found out any changes (not just add ons) were a dollar upcharge.  Want an extra sauce?  it's a dollar upcharge.  I understand raising menu prices due to inflation and food costs, but the unnecessary upcharges seem a bit much.  There are a lot of similar restaurants in this genre.  If TGI Fridays keeps this up the other business's will be getting those customers.  As is, it will be awhile before my family will be willing to walk back into a TGIF restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to go TGIF's in Concord off of Concord Mills BLVD, for dinner last night with my boyfriend because I had really been craving a burger, and I figured maybe TGIF'S would have some good burgers. The do not take temperatures on the burgers, meaning the beef isn't good beef because if they don't cook it well done then it wouldn't be okay to give to a guest, they could get sick. I know this because I have worked in restaurants as a server for years and still do. I don't like well done (burnt) burgers. They are dry and disgusting, every time. This burger was the same. But that's not the part that made the experience un-enjoyable, the servers right next to us at they're server station talking extremely loudly, cussing, saying horrible things about other people, is what made this experience so unpleasant. I know TGIF's is not fine dining in any sense, but I also didn't think the place would be so trashy. So my boyfriend and I decided to leave early because of this. I was appalled. I work at a fine dining restaurant, and if you were to act this way in front of guests you would be fired on the spot. When I asked for the server's name who was cussing, saying awful things about people, who made our experience so bad, they said her name was Ashley Keeetman. Please, if you must go to this embarrassment of a restaurant on Concord Mills BLVD in Concord, NC, and get Ashley as your server, ASK FOR A NEW SERVER, or leave. I guess it was my mistake for picking a TGIF's to eat at any way, but we will NEVER, be back. Big thumbs down for Ashley Keetman, and management for hiring people so appalling."}
{"text":"Went here to watch football. The happy hour prices during the game are great! All appetizers are $6 plus only $4.25 for vodka Red Bull! The bartender was very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give LESS than one star as this was the WORST dining experience I've EVER had. Food AND service were BEYOND terrible. We had salmon with lobster and steak with lobster.  No amount of steak sauce or ketchup could improve the taste of the rubbery food. These miserable entrees took OVER 35 minutes to arrive and were BOTH cold!  The waitress, Autum, had no explanation for the delay and did not return to our table to refill our almost $4.00 drinks! She further dragged her feet with with the bill. Took almost ten minuets to bring the bill and another to charge us.  The manager offered free desserts as compensation but I did NOT want to waste any more of my time or taste any other awful dishes from this establishment, which I will never return to."}

{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night and it was TERRIBLE! The restaurant felt dirty and the first thing our waitress said to us was, \"Ughh I am having a terrible night, what do you want to drink?\" Like great way to greet someone!? Then we ordered our food we got an appetizer, the spinach artichoke dip it was COLD! Not even warm! Then we noticed a French fry sitting in the chips, we were both disgusted and didn't even eat it. The waitress really asked us how it was we both just looked at her and said we were finished with it, she didn't even ask why we didn't eat it! Then our meals came my burger had cheese that was hardly melted and my wife's salad had brown lettuce in it. We picked at it a little and asked for our check and got out of there as soon as we could. WE WILL NEVER RETURN!!! Such a waste of money our night was!"}
{"text":"Fail. Total fail. The subterfuge of culture that is (suburban) Pittsburgh is graced with many an identical TGI Fridays, I'm sure... But this place is just overall terrible. 

I travel constantly and I know what to expect from all chains, both in the 'burbs, and in the cities - but this place was just awful. I waited almost 15 minutes (late at night, empty bar) to have my order taken, and the food seemed to have been heat-lamped for several hours prior. I don't expect much at a TG's, ever, but this place fell short even within that mental framework. Just avoid it and try to get to Bonefish Grill down the street if at all possible. Similar prices and FAR superior food/service... Ugh."}
{"text":"We had a large group on Sunday. I ordered endless apps. The waitress asked if we wanted our apps as an appetizer and if ee did it would bump the rest of the tables food. I guess the cook can't  fire apps and entrees at the same time? Food was sub mediocre and they served two of the guests soup with a teaspoons, however one guest did get a soup spoon with her soup. The only items that looked good were the salads. I won't be back"}
{"text":"It's a Friday's so overall the food is decent. The service here sucks. You will wait, you order may not be right and management is not the best when it comes to correcting mistakes."}
{"text":"Was shopping at NL.  Decided to have dinner there.  They had a great deal pick 2 items for only $10.  I chose the pear seared pot-stickers. love my dumplings!  For my entree I ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta.  One the best bargain budget meal I had. Service was EXCELLENT !  You can't ask for anymore good meal, great value and very good service.    Great Job ! TGI Friday's at Northlake location."}
{"text":"We are staying at Sam's town and ordered a Jack Daniel's sliders to go. When we got to the room to eat, the sliders had burgers, cheese, onions, and mayo sauce. \"NO Jack Daniel's glaze!

Called the restaurant letting them know that our sliders lacked the jack daniel's glaze. They offered to deliver the glaze to our room, but the person that brought us the glaze told us that the JACK DANIEL'S Sliders did not come with the glaze.  If the Jack Daniel's sliders was not supposed to have the glaze, then which part of the sliders is Jack Daniel's? 

https://www.tgifridays.com/menu/appetizers/jack-sliders/1053/

Warning! Never order the Jack Daniel's sliders , especially at this restaurant. You will not get what you order and they will tell you you're wrong.

Our server was nice."}
{"text":"Went in around 1200pm and was seated in the bar area. Not busy at all. There were only 2 other tables that had other customers sitting in them. Bartender was friendly and took our order. It took about an hour to get our food. After we received our food, the service stopped completely. Waited after we were done with our food for quite some time for them to even pick up our plates. Then after that we waited again for the check. After receiving the check we put our currency in it and placed it on the side of the table. And again, waited and watched as the bartender did other side duties. Finally came and picked up the check and we booked it out of there. TGI finally over with."}
{"text":"I travel to Champaign nearly every week and will often eat here.  The food is good and the waitstaff are very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Worst worst worst service in the world! Been here three times and it takes 25 min to even get a person to your table then another 20 to get your drink back!!! Food is usually good but that's if you ever get it!"}
{"text":"This place is the filthiest restaurant in Henderson. I usually visit a different property but today we stopped in this unit. I was concerned when I went to the wash room and trash was overflowing, no seat covers, tile work dirty and when I went back to the table and waited for our meal I noticed what I thought was a stain on the table. I used the napkin and began rubbing the table, I had 4 napkins full of grime! 

I mean like nothing that we have ever seen. I asked for the manager on duty. I told him and showed him the condition of the table and he said thank you for brining it to my attention. I suggested that he clean the facility and scrub the tables. He thanked us and walked away. 

It was 2 in the afternoon and the facility was nearly empty. I owned and operated restaurants and hotels all of my adult life - I would have been so embarrassed if any of my properties were in this condition. But let's just say that I had had this type of customer interaction - I would have had a utility person or heck, I would have scrubbed down the tables immediately! The entire unit has a ring of filth around it. If you look at the booths - the wooden sides are disgusting from years of dirty mop water being slopped on the sides of the booths. The wash rooms are the same.

I am not going to write about the food quality - it was very sad and they have a new restaurant that has opened around the corner from them and one would think that they would step up their game or at the least clean up the place. This unit is disgraceful."}
{"text":"This place is an Oasis from the nonsense and noise that generally is Las Vegas. I arrived in town 3 hours late due to nightmare traffic on I15 with two picky kids in tow. Nearly everything else was closed. The staff here we're friendly, prompt and accommodating, even at 11pm on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Our server what just flat out RUDE. 

I get people have bad days and maybe she was having one but don't expect a great tip if you're acting like an a$$hole"}
{"text":"We usually get a great service but this time it was horrible. Our server was Owen. Owen has no personality at all. He did not smile just directly took our order and thats it. We ordered nachos as an appetizer but it took 25 mins. Then we need refills, we already almost done with nachos still he hasnt refilled our drinks. Then our food came out. We ordered jack daniels chicken and shrimp and baby back ribs. The chicken and ribs was delicious but the shrimp was awful, the breading was blan and over powered the flavor of the shrimp. It was like the breading double the amount of shrimp. The manager could also do table visits. He looked at our table at least 5 times while not stopping by once."}
{"text":"I been here so many times!! This review is particularly for the bar area...the service is consistently terrible.. But tonight was the night that made me wanna write a review! To go to a business and hear employees complaining that you're there is almost enough to deserve one star! We ordered some Stella on draft.. We watched the bar and waited for them to start on our drink.. Then they took a pre poured glass of Stella out of the fridge and served it to us! Omg how long has it been in a glass, in the cooler?!?! Then someone else ordered beer, and we saw two glasses 50% foam/head, 50% beer! They sat for a while.. Then an employee poured two half glasses of foam and walked off.. He came back and combined the two and served them!!!!! Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner or just a quick mid day meal. Service is great and timely."}
{"text":"Service is great and the atmosphere is cool.
My gf and I are fans of TGI Friday and have been to multiple ones in Vegas. I just hate to say but the food at this one was not nearly as good as the other ones. We were disappointed because at places like this you look for consistency but this one wasn't prepared as well as when we went to the others. The service and everything were great which is why I gave it a 4 star but I will definitely just go to the other ones."}
{"text":"Went last night with the family (6 adults and 1 baby).  Wait was long, but that's expected on Friday night.  Food was excellent. The new menu had good choices. We really liked the soft pretzels and the hummus for appetizers.  We had to get a second round of pita for the hummus it was so good.  The Caribbean rum ribs were great.  The pasta was also delicious."}
{"text":"absolutely fricken the worst. after waiting over 45 minutes due to some party that decided to have their gathering there of like 50 people, which dominated most of the staff and cooks, we finally got seated. our waitress was the BOMB, she was great. too bad we could not say the same for the food. i got this philly cheesestack double stack burger, supposed to have all this stuff on it. the picture looked like i would have to unhinge my jaw to eat it. what came was a far cry from it. missing about half the ingredients on the list. it was a sorry site for hungry ladies waiting long. i would not recommend them. there are better places in vegas for this kind of crap."}
{"text":"Imma be honest - I usually go here to drink and for dinner I just get multiple appetizers. I can usually do a lot of damage for around $30. For a chain restaurant its OK. Nothing special but I do enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went to eat.  Waited for several minutes to be seated and no one acknowledge me or my party.  Well, they saw us standing but did not say they would be with us.  Two different associates did this, one noticing us several times.  Eventually we gave up and walked away.  We specifically drove her to eat at Friday's.  Ended up at the buffet.  Which was alright but not what I had in mind.  Wanted my sizzling chicken and mashers."}
{"text":"This T.G.I. Fridays was horrible!!! Waited forever to get my food. The waiting staff was too busy laughing and joking around with each other. We sat across from the kitchen, they obviously didn't wear hair nets. I found a long hair strand in my dipping sauce. Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The whole staff needs to be fired. Even the host didn't smile. I would recommend that place to a homeless person."}
{"text":"Hands Down, This Is My Favorite Restaurant To Eat At! Amazing Food! Amazing Customer Service! I Cant Wait Until I Am 21 (1 More Year To Go) . Then I Get To Have The Bar Experience. I Always Get Their Red Bull Slush & They Make It Perfect Everytime! I Probably Come Here About 4-5 Times A Month. If I Could Eat There Everyday For The Rest Of My Life, I Really Would. TGI Friday's Is The Best!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill since my last visit a few years ago. It is generally very dirty and bathrooms were as filthy as a truck stop in the interstate. While the service was friendly it was very slow. The food was okay."}
{"text":"Food was more than usual good, even by Friday's standards. I personally had the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese, while my mother had some Salmon/rice dish I can't remember. Server did forget to bring out both our French Onion soups (which were still good and served hot), but he realized until after I mentioned it and gave us a free dessert in compensation. I didn't care at that point - if you've ever had the Brownie Obsession, you know it's worth the cavity.

It's 24-hours here at the hotel and I'm most likely going to visit again because of that fact. At least I know what to expect out of Friday's."}
{"text":"Don't go to this TGIF!!!! The atmosphere and manager's attitude are both despicable.  My friend and I stopped in after 7 pm and the restaurant was partially crowded, so we were seated immediately. We saw the bus boys cleaning the table and seats with the same cloth; we saw employees using their cell phones while working; the talking/noise was unusually loud; the atmosphere was scary. We could hardly eat for looking around at the other clientele fearing for our lives.  We didn't know if someone was going to shoot or not.
  We complained to the manager about what we were experiencing,  he didn't care, didn't apologize for any of it and was very nonchalant. He simply walked away. 
    Because we were so appalled with the atmosphere and what we saw, we called him back and asked for the GM's name/card. He became indignant, started getting loud and still did not care or apologize. When asked his name he said Chad (no last name)........cause he would be too easy to find on facebook.......hahaha!! \"He's the only Chad at that store and the only manager in the company named Chad.\" Still no last name.......still he didn't care nor apologize......The total atmosphere at this TGIF has drastically changed!!!!
   And oh, the hostesses at the front dot even know the manager's name.....they don't know who they are working for........and they also ask for Id when you are over 18 and not sitting at the bar!!!!! Wth???
      1 star.......and won't be back........"}
{"text":"I'm not one who cares for giving 5 of 5. This isn't one of those occasions.
     I had a half rack of the Jack Daniels rib and they were perfect! The food was served hot, as it should have been. Our server, was the best I've had in quite a long time."}
{"text":"Ok food but the service suks rotten eggs. Huge Fail."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and drink. Happy hour 24/7 in the bar area with half prices appetizers, $6 margaritas & $4 beers. The food is fantastic. I haven't tried anything that was not good. Service is if-y and depends on the time of day and who's working."}
{"text":"I'm on a very restricted diet so it's difficult to eat out.  Our waitress Alicia P. went above and beyond to make sure I left with food in my belly, and a smile on my face.  She took a crazy amount of time working with me to create a delicious meal that was Ideal Protein Plan friendly.  So remember,  just because something isn't on the menu,  doesn't mean they won't create it for you!  (chicken breasts, garlic shrimp,  and spinach with mushrooms on the side)  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Barmaid was excellent while busy.  If any employee can show great customer service during a rush is amazing.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Rebecca is an excellent server. Mozzarella sticks are delicious and they are quick with the drinks and refills. Though we were told they're is a thirty minute wait on a Friday night, it was actually around fifteen so not too bad considering it's in a casino in aliante. Definitely recommend this place over the aliante buffet and over any other tgi Friday location. Didn't give five stars because their plastic cups are cracked and look unprofessional but they don't leak or anything, just need new cups."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas just last week, April 16-20, and we stayed at the Orleans, which is where this particular Friday's is located.  If I could, I would give a \"0\" star rating.  It will be a very long time, if ever, before we return.  

We decided to eat at Friday's on Friday evening, April 19, which was our last day in Vegas. After having a drink or two at the Alligator Bar, we decided we wanted something to eat.  We walked over to Friday's and it was only about 11:45 p.m.  We were the only 2 people waiting in line and the hostess was nowhere in sight.  We saw people cleaning up tables and mopping the floors, and finally a gal looked over and asked us if we'd like to be seated.  That should have been my first indication that the dining experience was only going to go down from there.  

We were seated, and Sara, a server, came over to take our drink order.  After a few minutes, she came back to take our dinner order.  My husband ordered a chicken dish and also a Caesar's salad.  Sara placed our food order and that was  about the last time she paid attention to us.  She totally forgot about my husband's Caesar's salad.  Evidently she felt it was more important to stand in the hallway and take pictures of some balloons that were up front.  Besides Sara, there were 4-5 other Friday's employees doing the same thing.  It was more important that they look at the pictures on their cell phones instead of paying attention to their customers!  

Considering the restaurant was hardly busy, we waited about 30 minutes before our food came out.  When it did, it was just absolutely horrible.  My husband's chicken dish was so salty he could barely eat it; and the cheese that covered the chicken was totally burnt in many places.  I ordered Korean tacos (I think that's what they were called) and I was not impressed at all.  Very little meat; too many greens carelessly tossed inside the corn tortillas; and it didn't look or taste anything like the way it was described in the menu. Right before our food came out, Sara came over to our table to tell my husband that she \"just realized\" she forgot his salad!  Of course she did, because the cell phone was far more important to her!  Thankfully, we were not charged for the salad.  

In the meantime, two more diners came into the restaurant.  They, too, were totally ignored by the employees.  Finally, the gentleman had to literally chase down a server and asked them if Friday's was still open!  Finally, after about 5-7 minutes, this couple was seated.  

By this time, my husband and I were so upset we decided that we needed to speak to a manager.  Sara came over to ask how our food was, my husband said it wasn't a good experience and he wanted to talk to a manger.  Sara did get the manager and we expressed our displeasure.  The manager was nice enough to not charge my husband for his dinner and she did give us some gift certificates for complimentary appetizers and desserts.  However, the entire experience left me with very negative feelings about Friday's.  

I don't know who does the training at this particular Friday's, but something is sorely missing.  Since when does a hostess station remain empty on a Friday night?  Customers should NOT have to chase down employees in order to get seated.  And the servers should not be standing in the hallway looking at pictures on their cell phones!  This is not \"service\".  After we complained to the manager, all of a sudden, the servers were doing their jobs.  It shouldn't have had to come to that!  Sara was one of the worst servers I've ever had.  If she's that poor of a server on a relatively slow night, I cringe to think how she is when it's busy!  Needless to say, Sara was not given a tip.  We do not tip for poor service and forgetfulness.  

We've eaten at this Friday's in the past and we always had good food and service.  What happened on the Friday night we were there was just inexcusable.  If Sara and company don't want to work on a Friday night, they picked the wrong industry.  I do not recommend this Friday's at all, unless you enjoy being ignored, forgotten and served sub-par food.  I don't, and that's why I won't be returning to Friday's when I stay at the Orleans in the future.  I'd rather get a bag of junk food from the Orleans' gift shop before I go back to Friday's!"}
{"text":"Very good food, service, drinks, only 4 stars cuz there's always room for improvement and I can't give 4.5. Jack Daniels chicken ribs and shrimp is a plus. It's the babes favorite place and it's \"Sunday\"..cheers"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place zero stars I went here with a friend of mine we actually used to work at this location. Crazy how so much has changed anyways we were seated pretty quickly but it took our server 10 min just to great us and he's had very little menu knowledge . After he greeted us and grab our beers which were flat as hell we didn't see him for another 10 mins to take out order after our order was taken we sat there for 30 mins waiting for aSalad and a pasta dish  so we had the manager on duty come over and we discussed what had happened she couldn't care less so we just got up and left but know I see why the service is shit it starts with your management if they don't care you servers don't care and that's what we saw. Worst service I have ever gotten EVER!! Will never give this place my business again get your shit together and take care of you customers even if you don't care act like you do to make your customer feel more comfortable . If the manager would have expressed actual concern it would have been a little different ."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!! We will definitely be back!!! They have the best happy hour in Las Vegas, $6 appetizers you can't beat that! And the hosts were exceptional."}
{"text":"OMG stay away run for your life!  Says a customer who has been sinking in the quicksand they call a \"table\" Run"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative I would.  AWFUL service.  Waited 25 minutes for part of our order and even that was not edible.  Waitress took off before we could ask for the items that were supposed to be on the burger.  She brought the rest of our meal (in a to go container) and got irritated when we complained.  She said a manager would come but never saw him and we left hungry.  Avoid this place if you are hungry."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down. My boyfriend and I walked in around 8pm on a monday night. We were seated pretty quickly the hostess was very friendly, she seated us in the bar area, we waited about 10 mins for a server to acknowlege us he finally came over and asked had we been waiting long? huh. we said its been a little minute so he just looked at us and asked what could he bring us to drink. we both told him sweet teas. he came back quickly with the drinks then asked us for our order, still not mentioning his name. I order one of the stacked burgers without onions he told me that i couldn't alter the burger so by this time I was really aggravated so i just said ok. My boyfriend ordered a burger also. The food came out in about 30 minutes, the burgers were ok, the fries were lukewarm. He didnt come back for another 13 or so minutes with the check. No refills or anything. We will definitely not be back at this location. A manager was not seen. I hope they start to improve on customer service soon."}
{"text":"I was weary at first just because of the area! Hoping my food would be cooked, hoping I would have a decent waitress or waiter! I was very please with both my waitress and the manager!  Chris(waitress) she was very helpful in ordering my food, she was sweet and she had a very bright personality. I knew they were busy so I didn't expect her to actually listen to what I was ordering I did not feel rushed at all! The manager(kicking myself for not catching her name) was so sweetl! she was helping her staff out running meals,  checking on everyone! I had to hug her!!! Definitely recommend anyone!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill out. My girlfriend & I came at 11pm on a Sunday, it was still happy hour until midnight. We ordered Jack Daniels Sauce Chicken Wings, Shrimp & Margaritas. I was full & a little tipsy when i left. Our server was great very friendly and attentive :)"}
{"text":"We go here often and usually it is great!  Today so bad - never again.  We waited on ourselves!!! We got our own silverware...had to ask for service & were forgetten.  We told the manager who did not seem to care.  We got our bill after going & asking for it.  When our change was brought it was someone else's check.  If you want awful service - this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Omg.... Went to dinner friday 3/9 nite....This one SUCK! 
They had way too many hostess standing around doing NOTHING ....but flipping or playing with their hair.....took FOREVER for our food ...and it was horrible ...I had appetizer for a meal ...JD nuggets were DRY no sauce on them ...my friend had 1stem of a broccoli ...1 tablespoon of loaded mash potato ...not even loaded ...her daughter wanted cucumber they bring tablespoon of diced cucumber !!!!  Not worth going back ....57$ I would rather have went to McDonald's !!!!! I gave 1 star for my skinny long ice tea!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to grab a quick bite with the kiddies after school. Was greeted by the host which was nice. Told me my server will come shortly wait 5-8 min until another server was nice enough to take our drink order. Than our \"original server\" came. The kids got the kids ribs and I got a buffalo grilled chicken sandwhich. It was dry and you can really taste the charcoal. Overall it was ok. It wasn't busy and we only got refills on drinks if we asked for them. They have good music and sports channel to watch, so the waiting wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"Great food and the bartenders are pretty cool. Me and my girl friend every once and a awhile I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"So I don't really know where to begin but I have been coming to this restaurant for a few years now since it's so close to home, generally I get good service. Never had a problem with the food or drinks... maybe a waiter/waitress or 2 will be not so customer service oriented but all in all decent service.  Well this last time proved me wrong.  Went to have dinner with my daughter in law and I am a Stripes member with TGIF so I let the waitress know I wanted to use some of my stripes to cover one of the meals ( nice perk) so at the end of it all I got the bill and noticed I was charged for both meals but at this point our waitress was no where to be found so instead of going round and round I decided to just pay for the bill and call it a night.  Well the next day I noticed that she did deduct my points for the meal BUT I was still charged for it. A little upset so I call the restaurant to speak to a manager and of course 2 days in a row and on all shifts the manager is conveniently \"unavailable\".  So I email corporate.   A week or so later I get a reply from corporate apologizing for the inconvenience and letting me know that a manager would be contacting me with 24-48 hours.  So it's been more than a week and STILL no call from the manager.  So I email corporate YET again and of course no response.  May not be a big deal to most people but how any of their customers have they done this to and will continue to do this to if no one complains or brings it to their attention."}
{"text":"Server was very polite and helpful. But wen we consumed our French Onion soup it was just warm barely and toast was too hard when it came in. I think it's still frozen or don't know why. After a few minutes it's soft and eatable. We are first customers and may be the kitchen equipment are not ready to work 100%. Oh by the way they charged hot water as hot tea too."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE FOOD !!!!
This place sucks, management is rude and so are workers.
Beware of the fat pig manager if you have any problems, she will
want to call the police on you."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered to-go food and when we picked it up, we had an issue with the gift cards we wanted to use. The manager, Melissa, was super helpful and polite and demonstrated superb customer service. We ordered a steak, lobster tail, and chicken bruchetta. My husband loved the steak; the lobster tail was a bit on the small side but cooked perfectly and tasted great. The chicken bruchetta was alright, and the moz. sticks were great. Thank you Melissa for your superior service!"}
{"text":"Wow. Two pretty simple things I didn't think could be ruined- terrible- ribs and a tomato mozzarella salad. The chicken was ok. Fries were ok. Since there is a better version down one of the terminals, take the time and go there if you have it!"}
{"text":"Service was VERY slow.... one of the people in our party never received the Unlimited appetizer that he ordered.  Will not go back and do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"How to loose a customer in 3 easy steps  

Just wanted to share our experience at Fridays tonight and let you know that the marketing department and restaurants don't seem to be on the same page.

Step #1: Send out 2 for 1 coupon

Step #2: Decide that Soup and Salad is not an entree.

Step #3 Fail to empower store manager (Shawn @ Fridays on Sunset in Henderson Nevada) to take any action.

Just in case a bit more explanation is needed:

We received this coupon in the mail OR newspaper, I don't remember which.

Also received a free appetizer or desert via email

Decided to go to Fridays for hubby's birthday. Knew in advance we can use one coupon or the other but not both. Check to see if our location is excluded. It is not.

Order chicken sandwich and ask waiter if there is a soup and salad. We are told yes.

Give server coupon and are told that Endless Soup and Salad are not included. Pointed out that there was no endless, simply one salad and one cup of soup.

Pay bill, leave tip.

Ask to speak to manager on the way out.

Shawn (the manager) said \"Well you had ENDLESS soup and salad. That is not included\".

Pointed out there was no \"endless\". Showed coupon and asked where it specified no soup or salad.

Was asked \"Well what would you like ME to do about it.\"

Realized Shawn was either clueless or powerless to satisfy the customer.

Left and will not be back."}
{"text":"This place always has great food! Very impressed that our server Lance and his co workers handled our huge party of 28! Some seemed a little overwhelmed at first but it was pretty smooth rolling. Its always good to have a server that is laid back with a good sense of humor :) Loved the beer combinations. I had the snakebite. Great combo! Can't beat the Jack Daniels Burger! Yum! Kudos to the staff!"}
{"text":"We were about to eat at Oyster Bar, but there wasn't a table to seat 8 people, so we went to TGI Friday's.  Wow, the food was actually pretty good.  Food from the kids' menu is just as big as the normal entrees.  If you have kids, order the ribs for $7, and you'll get more than a half-rack of ribs for half the price.  

I ordered ribs and lobster.  The ribs were slightly overcooked.  I completely forgot that I was supposed to dip the lobster in the melted butter until we left.  I also tried the lobster carbonara pasta, which was the best out of all dishes.  The grilled shrimps from other entrees were nicely seasoned and grilled.  Overall, I enjoyed dinner."}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment no stars I would...horrible customer service starting with the manager,waiters,busers, & ending it with the cooks.. these people don't know anything about having a clean and respectable establishment. Bathroom was the hands down the nastiest i have ever seen. Not only that but way too expensive."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at this location for a few years, with no complaints. Sadly, that has changed. A recent visit, was more than disappointing. Went early to avoid the dinner rush. Was seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waitress to even come take our drink order. Took her more than 15 minutes to also get the drinks. Ordered right away, when she returned. Waited 30 minutes for appetizers. Canceled the dinner order and left after appetizers. This was before 5 pm and there were only a few customers in the restaurant. Don't know what the hold up was, but not willing to wait an hour for dinner."}
{"text":"Four servers went to every table in our section except for the one we were at twice before anyone came to our table. It was not busy maybe 5 or 6 tables of people and I saw people just leave their table and the restaurant due to lack of service. Our server was good but the food was terrible and definitely not worth the price. My husband became violently ill shortly after we left and I assume it was the lobster as that was the only thing he ate that I didn't."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today with my grandchildren,  aged 4 and 1. We asked for a booth and a high chair and booster chair. After being seated at a booth and given menus,  we were informed that we couldn't have a high chair because it would impede the walkway. We were moved to a table with narrow wooden chairs. We expressed concern about using a booster chair since there was no way to secure it. The hostess basically shrugged and walked away. My granddaughter ended up sitting on her knees at the table. I will say that the food was great as always. As we were leaving, I spoke to the manager and expressed my concern and disappointment about the seating. Her response was that 'lots of people sit their children at booster chairs at the tables.' I really don't care what other people do.  I don't want my grandchildren falling off a chair at booster seat height. And I would like to see a little more concern than just a shrug."}
{"text":"Great servers and good food. Nice place to bring the kido or on a date night with the husband."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday early afternoon, and the host, and waiter were great. Very good service!
The Jack Daniel's chicken was great, as well as the raspberry lemonade drink I tried.
It's a great location inside Sam's Town, easy to find!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for lunch. I don't particularly like burger joints but I knew of several items I liked prior to going. So I was fine with this choice.

While yes it was lunch hour there was an abundance of empty tables more empty than filled. The service here was terrible it was slow unpleasant and honestly the staff couldn't get our order right. On chance of luck we sat close to the soda fountain and we had to fill our own drinks because well you know the SERVICE SUCKED. 

My food did not come out with the rest of my parties meals ... I ordered a burger and fries... But after the 30 minutes it took my family to get food what's another 15 minutes for my own right? So when I finally got my meal the fries were cold and over seasoned whatever that's what ketchup is for let me just mask this terrible food with ketchup! So after picking at my ketchup fries I decided to take a bite of my assumed delicious jd bbq burger... As I bit in and realized I was biting into disappointment the burger was burned and dry with hardly any sauce but whatever that's why ketchup was made right!?! You betcha! 

The calamity doesn't end. While I'm saving face trying to enjoy this dry unappetizing now ketchup drenched meal so not to cause any issues my brother and father are having their own problems. I mentioned service sucks right? So on top of having to get our own drinks our server wasn't paying attention and grabbed the plate my brother was eating off of touching his food and knocking it over onto him. He was still eating at it.  Of course this was quite offensive to us but by this point we just want the meal over with. 

So after I was finished with my jd ketchup burger © I washed it down with my leftover ice water and my family wrapped up their meals... Oh our server was real quick to bring us the bill and receipt and mention her tip though sadly my father was paying and left the crappy server a tip 

I didn't bring management into this as it is really just a lesson learned don't ever go back here 

Crappy food terrible service and dirty looking atmosphere"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is okay kind of slow. Decor is due for an update. Great deals though."}
{"text":"Walked in one evening with some family and could feel a strong racial tension. The white hostess who greeted me was RUDE! It is very clear that the white employees of this Jim Crowe establishment don't recognize their illicit white privilege."}
{"text":"We went here last night on a whim.  Very friendly staff from the moment we entered the door.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  Food was good, but portions were noticeably small.  I did get the 12 shrimp as was listed in the menu, but came with about, no exaggeration, 20 tiny fries.  No other side was included.  Again, food was very tasty, but the prices, in my opinion for what you get, are high.  We split two appetizers, each had an entree, I had two draft beers and my wife had a drink from the bar.  With over 20% tip, $87.  Not a terrible experience or anything, but a bit pricy.  I don't think I'll be back immediately, but again to reiterate; the staff was great."}
{"text":"Hostess, Kevin, was THE BEST! Hilarious and helpful throughout our entire meal. Appetizers for dinner, but they were phenomenal. The entire staff was friendly and we witnessed them helping each other. Not something you see often. The guacamole was better than the Mexican restaurant across the street!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for after work to hit up the happy hour. The bar staff is great and always attentive to make sure my glass is fun and by the time the check hits, so is my stomach!"}
{"text":"So we ate here before a Pens game because I rarely visit the Uptown/Hill District area I had no idea where else to go. We debated between here or hitting the Burgatory stand in Consol. I'm actually glad we picked Friday's, because we haven't been to Burgatory yet and the extremely abbreviated menu/pre-made food probably wouldn't have given us the best impression.  

Anyway, our server was lively and the food was standard (I don't review chain food unless it's \"special\" in some way). We got several appetizers  and drinks -- we were in and out in 45 minutes for about 30 bucks. 

We got to sit by a huge window, which was excellent for people watching on 5th."}
{"text":"Fridays has gone down. The food used to be good. This place was extra crowed and hot. Everybody looked hot and mad when you walked in. The host/greeter was over it. He didn't smile nor was enthused to be there. Nobody said hello or appeared friendly luckily I'm an aggressive and demanding type of person and don't wait around. Although it was busy and extra crowded does not excuse lack of customer service I think when it's busy your and take the time to care is when service counts the most. Don't just treat people anyway because you're busy learn how to work under pressure. This place was packed like every table was taken people were waiting inside and outside. The food was nasty. The chicken was dry, the broccoli was stale and they forgot what I asked for and paid for. I won't be returning to this location due to bad service and I don't like the food. I had to throw it away. I don't know who they have cooking in there but they need new cooks"}
{"text":"Roy the server in the bar area was very angry. The people next to us closed out their check and walked out. Roy came by to clean their table and glanced at his tip. He slammed the bill against the register and said fucken cheap as fucker loud enough that it got out attention. Guessing he didn't like his tip. Very unprofessional on his part."}
{"text":"We all know TGIFridays so there's little need for introduction. So I'll hop straight into the food (that's why we all are here right?)

Eggs were not scrambled properly. More correctly they were stir fried. Sausages were alright. Bacon was ok too (can't really go too wrong with bacon right?)

The French toast were nothing to wow about. What bugged us most was that our food was served to us at \"room temperature\". Which i felt was a failure on their part since a at minimum you'd expect a restaurant to at least serve hot food.

Overall I'd not recommend you come here for breakfast. Maybe lunch or dinner. Go to Ping Pang Pong for dimsum instead. It's way better"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!! We stopped to have a beer before going to our hotel next door. Our waitress did actually speak to us. As she was walking away from our table, she said \"I will be right back.\" Then she just disappeared for a while then just walked past our table without making eye contact. My husband walked to the bar and, after a very long wait, finally got us a beer. Also, there were several tables that were uncleaned when we got there. They were still uncleaned when we left. We did not check ratings because we were just getting a beer. Next time, I will definitely check the ratings no matter what. Lesson learned. Sad that anyone would be so rude."}
{"text":"I wanted to let my son have a birthday dinner where ever he wanted and he choose this place. When we get there the line was long as expected. We sign our name up and were told we had a ten to fifteen minute wait. After about 25 minutes we were told they missed placed our name in the order and we had an additional 10 minute wait. Not to mention with an attitude from the male hostess. Very rude. My family and I will not be going back to this place. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I called three separate times to be put on hold and forgot about every time! I even told the last person who picked up that it was my third time being placed on hold so please don't put me on hold again. \"Ok, hold please\" smh! Went there to see a facility that was not too busy and a whole bunch of lazy employees! I consider myself a very patient person however, this was completely ridiculous . They need a complete overhaul of management and employees. Way too complacent. I love Fridays but come on now."}
{"text":"Ashley is an amazing server! Always SO friendly and nice and helpful by far thee best server ive ever had the pleasure to meret. I ask for her every time I come to this location, she makes me feel very welcomed and appreciated! Thank you Ashley for always making my dining exprience wonderful!! See you next time girl"}
{"text":"Sizzling Shrimp, more like 12 shrimp on a bed of BURNT cheese! Manager, took $5.00 off because I did eat the shrimp. If they had advertised burnt cheese on the menu I would never have ordered it.  Meal was not enjoyable at all. Meal should have been comped."}
{"text":"Went about a week ago. Food was good and came out quickly. Overall had a wonderful experience didn't see our server much but I think he was busy with a big party."}
{"text":"Went to Friday's on a Saturday night, second choice because Texas Roadhouse next door had an hour wait. Service was terrible, food was just ok and price high for what you get. Kids mac and cheese was brought out cold and we had to wait a very long time before the server came back to check on us. By that time we were almost done with our meals. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"this place was great, on Valentines Day night. We had a very romantic dinner. The wait was minimum. The service great. its funny they all call you \"Sugar\".  It comes off as contrived. Not natural. Great food. I won my dinner money back by playing 1 hand of black jack. I hit 21 and got up. I like the parking at this casino. we were there around 10:30 pm at night. My wife claimed some woman with her man was staring at her while we were leaving. we are black and so was the couple. silly if you ask me. I love the whole time there."}
{"text":"I live near here so I've been here a handful of times. Every single time the service was lousy. Slow and unspectacular. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"We ordered the Jack Daniel's burger along with the combo fries.  The burger was good but the Jack Daniel's flavoring was a little too sweet and thankfully they put it in a separate container.  I'm not a seet potatoe fries kinda guy but they were ok as well.  The service was good and the refills on our soft drinks were constant.  They even offered to make us a drink to go if we wanted to which is kinda cool."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelmed. Bleach from bathroom was nauseating. No plans to return to this location."}
{"text":"It was empty when we got there. The waitress made a passing comment about how the size of the menu usually affects the quality of the food, which should have been our red flag. Our entire table had to send the food back and get a refund. They were nice about it at least but food wise I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Meh, it's Friday's. Never a first choice of mine any of the times I have been here. Unfortunately, my friends that I was with have different standards than I do when it comes to dining out, lol. However, there are 2 things here that I enjoy. The broccoli cheddar cheese soup & the spicy Korean tacos with Jasmine rice.

The handful of times I have been here we have usually sat in the bar area. Melody was our server on this particular visit. She was really sweet & very accomodating. So, becauseof her, I would definitely recomend sitting in the bar area."}
{"text":"Good food! And I think the service is good

I strongly recommend sweet potato side, that's great! And angus steak is tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for a pow wow for a military event, had about 8 ppl at a 6 person table... in the middle of everything... not very happy about that,.. but then then i ordered a cobb salad and wow that place was a whole new place after i had gotten the salad!! Amazing! the dresing was a balsalmic and everything was fresh! ther sevice was ok i had nothing to drink and the ppl around me were getting 2 and 3 drinks served... but all in all it worked out."}
{"text":"I have to say the night we went here was one of the worst nights ever! the service was slow the server should have written down our order because she messed it up and my friend i was with had to send her order back 3 times b4 the mgr came out and still didnt get the burger right... we ended up sittitng there for 3 hours and they didnt offer to take the bill then said ok we will give you free dessert... but when the bill came the dessert was on there... again had to talk to the mgr and he said \"sorry\" once again took off the dessert but still had issues with the bill... you would think at this time they would just comp the whole meal after all the run around we had to go through, but nope they didnt.  I was disapointed at this experience and will be along time before i go back,"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service!  Quality of food is declining.
Server was Not attentive. Had to have food returned twice, and no manager came by to check on the problem .  Place is Terrible!"}
{"text":"This place always has really good service. The line was long today but it was a busy night. I can see the restaurant was filled and the people in the front did acknowledge us and assured us that they were waiting for a booth for us. It made me feel at ease to know that we weren't being ignored and that they are trying their best to get us a table as soon as they can. 

Once we sat down, the server was so friendly and accommodating. He asked us for our beverage of choice and quickly came back with them.  We already knew what we wanted to order and he gladly took our order with a smile. I can tell it was a very busy night for him but he still treated us with personal service. I would love to give him a shout out but he didn't have his name tag so I have no idea what his name is.  

I give this place 5 happy stars. It was super busy but the service was great, the food was delicious, and once again the price was just right!"}
{"text":"Don't order the rib eye steak. The cut is all fat. No center. Have had good steaks before, but they must be cutting corners and still charging a higher price. Have had a great rib eye at Tony romos on Fremont for less the price."}
{"text":"We decided come here since it was next to the mall. The place was not even that busy. The food was okay. But the service was bad. We sat there for about 20 mins until our waitress came by our table. After taking our orders she came back with the drinks. By the time we got the food the order was wrong and the waitress was no where to be found. When we ask someone if they can find our waitress another 15 minutes went by. At that time my aunt decided she's going to eat it anyways since it took forever. Then we over heard the table next to us asked her about their food. She told them she forgot to put in their order. Next time we are going else where."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this TGIF several times in the dining room. Most dine-in experiences are uneventful but an overall positive experience - consistent food, fair price, good service. I just don't understand why that doesn't translate to the takeout area. On several independent occasions an order for a pair of salads come out just wrong enough to really annoy me. Twice they forgot to include extra dressing, once no dressing at all, once the wrong salad, and this week no chicken on the Caribbean Chicken salad. I like their salads but a little more focus from the salad makers would be much appreciated. 

Word of advice...check your togo orders before leaving - don't be in such a hurry to get home or you'll find yourself frustrated in your kitchen with a chicken-less chicken salad."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.  We have been going here 2 or 3 times a week and tonight we had the worst experience ever. After our meal was served they seated two girls with a young child behind us, this child was crying to the point he was choking, gurgling and gagging and we lost our appetite.  I asked they please move them since we were in the middle of dinner, nothing was said or done. Another person in my party asked and again nothing was done. I asked for the check and placed it on their table since they ruined our dinner, the \"mother\" finally took the alcoholic beverage out of her mouth and flung the folder at me and started yelling at me. The man at the table behind her then piped up with we looked like we could skip a few meals (pretty ignorant and none of your business to begin with so keep your opinions to yourself)  and the manager asked us to pay the bill and leave!!  We were not happy that we should pay for food we could not eat and to our surprise there were 5 security guards waiting for us.  WOW, really  you let other people in the dining room throw things at us, insult us and ask us to leave. I will never go here again after being treated like this. Security asked which one of us took off our belt and threatened the other table, REALLY and who made up that story, the manager no doubt. We let security know what happened and of course the cameras back up our account that there were no threats made and they were very understanding.  I have complained to the corporate office and I can only hope the other couple dining at the next table who said they were glad we said something because they were about to will speak up as well.  Just because this is a tourist town there are people who live here and we like to dine out and enjoy ourselves, we don't drink, we are not ignorant but we can always tell the tourists whose attitude is hey they will never see us again so who cares. Well I am here to tell you, we do, how can you bring small children into smoky, noisy casinos, why not go the a place for kids or leave them at home."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest or most friendly chain location I've been to. However as the saying goes you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"The 4 stars is a ginal rating of 2 stars for a visit 3 weeks  ago and 5 stars for mondays visit.  3 weeks ago.  . .  We were seated for 15 mintutes at lunch before going to see the hostess about our server . . . It was not busy at all, maybe 3 tables in the whole restaurant . . No explanation etc, and meal was underwhelming.  We visited monday, the server came over immediately and helped with our selection and special requests . . Super nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Used to go here a couple times a month service was great everyone knew us. Then these last two times we went it was AWFUL! All the good servers have either left or changed to the graveyard shift all the new servers are TERRIBLE!! My friend watched one put down our plate.. notice the hair on it and just leave it there! The server after that was absent and rude! And the next was lacking personality and again gave us a plate with a hair on it!! When we tried to get the managers attention about it he acted like he didn't hear us after looking right at us! And then had the nerve to charge me for another plate! Safe to say these once regulars are NEVER going back!"}

{"text":"My daughter and I had a dissapoining late lunch experience on Friday April 3rd. She wanted to go there because she loved the potato skins. When they sat them down, they were totally different and about half the portion size as before for 8.20. I asked the server about the change and they said a new Franchise had purchased them and made a lot of changes. How everyone was fighting in the kitchen and he couldn't wait to leave. How the Manager was a b.... and he couldn't stand them. Anyway,I felt cheated and not satisfied and will not be back to this location, ever."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a TGI Fridays in years (after having a bad experience there), but I thought I'd give it another chance.  This was, after all, my first time at this location.  

I made a reservation through OpenTable on a Saturday night for 7:15, but that seemed to mean absolutely nothing.  We stood waiting for 30 minutes for a table... the same wait time they were giving everyone else.  Our waiter was very friendly, but our food did not come out for another 30 minutes.  Therefore we were waiting an hour from the time we arrived at the restaurant until our food was brought to the table.  With 2 little ones, that was almost unbearable for them.  Other tables around us had ordered endless appetizers, and we watched as plate after plate were delivered to their tables, while we continued to wait for our food.  Now I know that if you actually want to eat there, get endless apps or don't bother.  The food was ok, but not worth the money and certainly not worth the wait.  You'll never see this family at a TGI Fridays again."}
{"text":"Service was superior. Food was scrumptious. And had the pleasure of being served by the one and only, sexy creature goddess,  Zoe Saldana. Only in Las Vegas, ladies and gents! Top drawer, top drawer!"}
{"text":"The only reason I went here was for a book club meeting.  I've been here several times and the food is very sub-par.  Didn't much like the steak, and the fries were terrible.  How hard is it to master french fries?  The service was slow.  It was over an hour before we got our entrees, and they weren't that busy.  And then, the server interrupted our conversation and gave us some long winded sales pitch that totally pissed me off.   I think they were selling some discount card or something, I was too annoyed to listen."}
{"text":"I love coming here and I always get good service but today I got the worst service ever!!!! Waited 30 min for the check when I finally got it and had the card ready no one came waited another 15 min I decided to just  get up and go look for the girl and give it in her hand. We never got our drinks refilled either."}

{"text":"Zero stars or negative to this tgi fridays location, the worst tgif I ever been, they almost kill me that night. Last weekend october 1st 2016 Saturday late night after watching Celine Dion Show at Caesars palace,me and my gf came here to eat before we go to our room to rest,we ordered chicken wings,garlic bread and shrimp/scampi alfredo pasta with drinks too.The waiter named justin was nice took our order and after a long wait finally our food is served, I got one bite of Alfredo pasta and while swallowing it I was struggling and choking, my gf said drink water but I felt something different in my throat ,in keep pushing it out while choking I thought it's a piece of shell or cover of the shrimp and I cannot even push it in or out in my throat and finally I decided to grab it with my right hand because I'm having hard time to spit it out from my mouth,and I got it.and I was so surprised and my gf and I put it on the top of the table napkin and look at it ,it was a piece of metal string \"steel wool\" that they use to clean the pot ,i turned red and and my gf was shocked too.i was choking with this steel wool ,I'm then the waiter justin came to our table and asked it's everything ok? And I told him no,and I showed him the piece of metal and told him what happened and he was shocked too and he told his manager, the manager came a lady didn't get a chance to get her name ,apologized and she said that they will take care of the check or tab , and she took the piece of metal and the pasta right away ,and I didn't get a chance to take a picture of it ,because I was shocked and choking. We ended up not to eat anymore ,our server justin came back to apologized and he said that we are nice people...ever worst experienced I ever had eating in the restaurant and thanks God nothing happened to me ,It's unforgettable experience..."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awful. They do not pay attention to anyone at the bar and are constantly breaking bottles as they attempt to do flair bartending. Waiters don't seem particularly nice either. Odd for a TGIF. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I want to be clear that all Friday's are not created equal, but the one located in Aliante Hotel in Las Vegas has to be the worst in the country...0 stars is still too many for this dump, but you have to give it one to post a review!  The only thing about this place that resembles a TGIF is the sign out front and the menu.  Talk about rush you in, rush you to order, rush you to eat, give you the fake smile, the high pitched thank you, & rush you out with a foot up your rectum.  I would compare this particular Friday's about the same as eating from gut truck on the side of the road.  
The story begins...My family and I at this particular TGIF for the first time ordered an appetizer, soups, a salad, and about 5 minutes later...2 dinners.  First mistake, the appetizer, soups, and salads came out all together a few minutes later.  Second mistake, the appetizer was old or had been sitting awhile and the soups (French Onion) were either twice baked or burnt, probably both.  I personally didn't have a salad, but was told the lettuce was room temperature or possibly warmed by the plate having just come out of the dishwasher, third mistake.  Anyway, after choking down the first few bites of the appetizer...here comes the server (not our waiter) with the main course which looked as if it had been plated in a prison cafeteria, you know where the guy in the movie slams the food on the plate so hard it looks like it was dropped from the balcony...mistake four & five.  Keep in mind this before we even had a chance to experience the horrible soup and salad.  Basically all four courses came out at the same time and were lined up on the table like an assembly line.  At this point I'm getting pretty perturbed and here comes the manager, I guess it was a manager.  \"Is everything OK?\" she asks...keep in mind the table is an assembly line of food...I looked down and said \"what do you think?\"  After looking down, she replied with the usual restaurant BS...\"oh, I'm sorry...can I take care of the soups for you?\"  \"No\" I replied, \"I didn't come here for a free meal\".  I mean what's paying for a couple soups going to solve...insult...mistake number...oh what are we up to now six, oh whatever, five, six, twenty...too many to keep track of!  Then she tells me that the timing between courses is done by the computer when the order is entered.  If that were the case and we ordered the dinner five minutes after the appetizers, how could the dinner come less than five minutes after the appetizers when they weren't even entered at the same time.  After all that, after explaining to both the manager, server, and waiter we don't like to be rushed...now they are rushing the plates from the table one at a time in lickety split fashion before we can even finish chewing the last bite.  I think the table was ready for the next patron before we even got up to leave or shall I say pushed out the door.  
SO POTENTIAL PATRON BEWARE!  I have been in Las Vegas most of my life, since 1980 in fact and know a few things about tipping...this is the first time in my lifetime that I wouldn't leave a tip.  As far as fast food joints go, I would put this restaurant at the bottom of that list, it failed every step of the way...from beginning to end.  This crap food and service cost me sixty bucks...what a joke!  How bout you plug that into your fancy computerized ordering system.  Both of my company's are in the service industry as well and I understand the need for the business to make money, but at the expense of its guests?  Restaurants are run by people...the computers are only there to help, not run the place.  Both the waiter and manager blamed my bad service on a computer...really?  Hopefully this review finds corporate and/or the owner's and certain policy's will be rethought when it come to its guests.  After all without us you don't have a restaurant...oh sorry, I mean fast food joint!  I will never return..."}
{"text":"Terrible even for a TGIF. French onion soup was tepid at best, missing any onions, and tasted like straight au jus. French dip was sloppily put together and amazingly had no flavor other than salt. Food took much too long for what it was and the restaurant was completely empty. Took only a few sips of the soup and already feel sick. Do not recommend. Las Vegas Buffet across the parking lot might have better food."}
{"text":"i will give them 2 stars my endless apps wings were great . this is where it goes downhill i ordered the potato skins  2 peices where literally served to me rotten n spoiled. i told the manager she did offer to make me a new one .  why the hell would i want a new one after i gotta a rotten one think people."}
{"text":"I have no clue why people are rating this restaurant so low. I think it's a good place to go, eat and have fun with friends.

I was just there and the the food was great, the server was friendly and the prices are very reasonable. The restaurant is clean, it has a ton of sport on their TVs... overall a great place to go."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner here and even though the food was cold, the manager (Gayla) did everything possible to make our evening great and she succeeded!  Gayla was pleasant and professional.  Our waiter (Ace) was friendly and did a good job as well.  Thanks Gayla!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price and nice place inside the casino.
I have been there 2 years ago and now the quality still good."}
{"text":"Long wait for a drink , no silverware and the most disgusting bowl of what they call clam chowder. Booooo"}
{"text":"We came here and the service was slow silverware was dirty.  We all ordered Turkey Burgers and the burger had a funky taste.  We all took one bite and could not take another.  The manager offered us another option but at that point we were all scared because we felt the place was dirty and did not care for food service."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 7 and had an okay experience. Waitress came out with waters but kept forgetting our other drinks. First she brought the coke then we had to remind her about the lemonade and so on and so on. 

After taking our order she didn't even pick up the menus which were taking up space. We piled them up on the side for her too. No refills. And when we were done it took forever for the check. 

Food was okay but much better than our service."}
{"text":"Went there today with my wife. Ordered two cheese burgers, took forever to get and then they failed to put cheese on them , told server and she came back with two slices of cold cheese on a cold plate then we had to ask her to have it put on our burger and heated up . Had to flag her down for every little thing like a refill of lemonade and the check even. She complained about the cook, but should have paid attention to what she brought to the table."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk inside this restaurant you can feel the bad vibe, but decided to give it chance. As we awaited for a server to come and greet our table or to atleast come by say will be with you in just a moment but NOTHING! Anyway we waited then finally a waiter came by, took our drinks and food order didn't even bother to bring water! Once again we waited and then finally decided to bring water along with the drink order gesshh! Waiter didn't look busy at all and gave the worst service EVER!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visit this has been our worse experience ever on a Tuesday night. The only thing I appreciated was the urgency the night manager took in trying to rectify the incorrect meals (to include food ordered not arriving). 
Unfortunately at the point when you have to speak with a manager the evening is ruined and appetites are gone. 

To 30 mins before first drinks, house salads coming after the meals after repeated request, incorrect appetizer and plate comes out with no ribs and a burnt steak. 

For a birthday dinner at a well established restaurant we regret this decision."}
{"text":"Good times at happy hr after 9 on Friday and Saturday!! 
And the bartender Jason is awesome!"}
{"text":"Started going here in college with my roommates when they had $5 burger Tuesdays.  Yeah its a chain but they seem to do it right. Menu has the standard fare,  with noticeable twists. They recently changed the recipes for some of their apps,  not for the better in my opinion,  but the green beean fries are my favorite.  Waiters are generally really good, and their stripes card gets you free chips and salsa,  as well as points for free food and desserts.  Vanilla bean cheesecake is a wonderful way to end your tgif dining!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst from the management all the way down I'm predicting this place will be lucky to last 2 Years!!! The place is never busy which I see why staff is lazy,slow, and rude will never return this place needs to be shut down for good - not a good staple for the community advice to poor management staff have a more open mind keep in mind when dealing with the general public everyone will have a different perception!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took all day with my food the waitress never checked on us. To make it worse everytime our food came out it was Luke warm smh."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just left this place we didn't even order the two people at the door looked at us like we didn't belong there and made the time of us being there really awkward for us after waiting to be sat at a table we waited   for somebody to come by and get our drink orders she walked right past us so we decided to leave the service and the way they treated us was very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Reposting to warn people to stay away. I really hope all these people lose their jobs. \"F\" terrible! My wife got sick on a piece of chicken. The waitress \"I think she said she was from Buffallo\" completely abandoned our table. I mean disappeared. I stood at the bar for no less than fifteen minutes trying to get someone's attention but just got the backs of their heads. So I had to get my wife outside, she was getting sick, then I was going to go back in and try again to pay the check, and i hadn't made it back from the car when a cop comes out of no where and rudely started accusing us of skipping out on the bill and made a rude comment about my poor wife being drunk. Who has a dick head cop waiting around to harass customers? She doesn't drink. The story didn't get better when I dealt with the blonde headed manager who had been ignoring me at the bar. Being mean doesn't make you less ignorant. Bottom line, poison food, angry wait staff, possible illegal collusion. It was like being set up by a bunch of crack heads. These people don't like their jobs and have no business in food service. Or with working with the public. Don't hire them at the zoo either. Those poor animals don't deserve it either."}
{"text":"Food totally sucks. Steak and baked potato was over cooked its like eating bricks. Mashed potatoes tasted like they were a few hours old. Food was also not warm just luke warm. Service is good though but not food. Beware."}
{"text":"Never, never again!!! Food was overcooked and not even fresh !!! Horrible service !!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location last night and had the worst restaurant experience ever. The hostess told us that the wait would be twenty minutes, and after waiting that long she brought us to our table, dropped the menus on the table, and walked away without saying a word (a foreshadowing to how awful the rest of our experience would be). Numerous waiters and waitresses served the tables surrounding us without even giving a glance at us. We waited fifteen minutes, watching server after server pass us as if we were invisible. 

My boyfriend, whom I was with at the time, is an experienced waiter himself and was completely appalled by the service. After waiting the fifteen minutes he decided to ask the hostess about our lack of service. She was not apologetic in the slightest, she said she would get us drinks and then walked away right after. She did not only fail to apologize but she failed to take any proactive action at all and find our waitress. 

Again, we waited fifteen more minutes being completely ignored. 

At this point we were both starving and fed up, so my boyfriend asked to talk to the manager. The manager made his way over to our table and asked what the problem was. We explained the situation of not being helped by a server in the long amount of time we had been seated, to which the manager had the audacity to point to our drinks and question us how we had gotten those, as if we were lying. We explained how we had had to go to the hostess and request help and she had gotten the drinks. The manager did not utter one apology, he turned to a waitress helping the table next to us (who had walked past us at least a dozen times) and asked if she could help us. She claimed she had not seen us and the manager walked away without saying another word. The waitress did not apology either, she only proceed to tell us that we could not share an appetizer or we would be charged for two. 

No one in the entire restaurant apologized to us for our experience, or tried to make it right in the slightest. Instead they over-charged us, ignored us, and created such a hostile atmosphere that made us never want to come back. DO NOT COME TO THIS RESTAURANT if you value your time or self-respect."}
{"text":"O.k., so first I would ask if Joey Stevenson was managing that night you show up. If so run, and don't  look back. He will ruin your night even after you have paid/tipped and have left the establishment well over an hour. After a long dinner...only because food/wine took so long to deliver to table for a 4 top. I ordered for 3 more friends and 4 bottles of wine.... security was called on my brother and myself. For \"stealing an empty bottle of wine and a empty wine glass that was meant for a commemoration for the group experience. Usually I buy a bottle of wine and two glasses were given to me when doing so. I assured my brother taking the empty glass/bottle wouldn't be a big deal. About an hour later we were passing by the TGI's entrance on our way out of the casino and m brother waves and says \"by, and thank you for the good food\" when Joey starts behind him and says\" Hey! is that our glass? We can't give those away! Security!\" So while already on the way out....he calls security to escort us out....which none ever came. He just followed us all the way out of the casino accusing us of stealing a wine glass...how embarrassing...considering I felt so warm to my first visit to TGI's by being offered a wine glass for my first purchase of wine ever in my life. I will never return to the Sam's Town Casino TGI's or probably any other again ever. I'm a general manager who takes much pride in my job to establish a great relationship with each and everyone of my regular and new customers, so that if I ever left them feeling un-welcomed like I feel now, I would completely understand if they never returned again. I urge upper management to check tapes and see what kind of General Management you hire and train. Thank you and goodbye TGI's, consider me one less problem, and thief you will never have again Joey and TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"Tonight is the second and last time I attempted to eat at the restaurant.  The first night my boyfriend and I had the door locked in our face at 11:45, we figured that when the kitchen closed at 12 and the bar at 1 it would be open until then. However we went back and won't make that mistake again. At 11 tonight we went in and waited at the host stand for 10 minutes and were ignored before we sat ourselves in a booth and were ignored for another 10 minutes before someone told us to move so we did and then ANOTHER 10 minutes later they told us the kitchen was shut down already. I will never go back."}
{"text":"As I am writing this review I'm sitting at TGIF.... Our service sucks!!!! Waiting 20 minutes for a damn drink. We decided we wanted to order an appetizer, but our waitress never came to check on us to see if we needed anything after we told her that we were going to think about the appetizer. 3 other parties came after us! But they got all there drinks already. She has been to one of the parties twice!!! Worst service ever!!! Find another TGIF... I live on this side of town but after today I will be driving to another TGIF!!!! Our food came out before our drinks!!! This place doesn't even deserve one star!!!!! DONT GO HERE!!!!!! They weren't even busy and we got this shitty service! Just imagine of they were busy!"}
{"text":"It wasn't just because we were starving, it wasn't just because we had been talking about wanting Friday's wings for days for some odd reason...but this was honestly the best experience I've ever had at any Friday's ever.

We had just come from the Billboard Awards and we were STARVING. Took a cab over to the Gold Coast and was promptly seated and scarfed the best wings ever! 

No, we weren't drunk. Yes, the cab driver was confused that he was taking us to Friday's for wings instead of Buffalo Wild Wings, but the taste buds want what they want. 

Our server, I hate that his name slips me, was great. He was friendly, funny and helpful. The hostess was so nice and pleasant. Her smile was so warm and inviting. Seriously, either all the stars aligned in the universe that night, or this is easily the best Fridays in the country. Well, at the very least, it's the best Fridays to go to on a Sunday night after hours of waiting and your stomach hurting from laughing at Miguel almost take a few heads off during a failed attempt at stage diving/stage hopping. 

Take your pick :) 

Either way, for us, we couldn't have ended our night happier."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday had the Dragon fire Salmon it was yummy, presentation was good, and overall service was good.  Had a couple of cocktails a Midori Palm Tree and an Hawaiian which was my fav.  Friend had a Jack Daniels Burger which was good also.

Went back later in the evening and had appertizers Potato Skins and Chicken Quesadillas which were way to spicy we asked the waitress about this she said they marinade then in chipotle sauce but was too spicy for us so I opened mine and added some sour cream and some of the pico de gallo in it and that made it bearable.

Service was good both times. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"They do not have any of the special 2 or 3 course menus. Not worth the drive to this location. I would go to Sahara and Decatur or inside the suncoast. Def will not be coming back to this location. Don't want anyone else to waste there time coming here. Hope this helps"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went on Super Bowl night and after being seated we waited for 15 minutes without  even one server coming to our table to greet us much less take our order. We saw 5 servers watching the game instead of doing their job so we left. On the way out we spoke to the  hostess about the problem. She apologized, but they need to do a better job."}
{"text":"Went to Fridays last night with a party of 9 adults. Went for appetizers and drinks only on this visit. We all tried the endless appetizers option and they were all excellent. Service was very efficient and all of the apps were served hot. We must have tried everyone on the menu. Tastes were very nice and presentation was excellent. All were satisfied with their drinks. Prices were very reasonable. Look forward to returning and trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I took my two children to sample the $10 appetizer menu as advertised .... What a disappointment the boneless chicken wings were poor quality chicken nuggets..... I won't be returning for a long time...

Very disappointed customer on quality"}
{"text":"Family in town = more than usual eating out.  I just ordered an appetizer myself because there was so much eating out, I wanted to tone it down.  I had the spinach flatbread.  It was very tasty and actually made a nice meal.  I might add a smalls side salad if I did it again.

I was very impressed with the way everyone else's meal looked.... well, maybe not the burger so much...  it seems kind of small and the serving of fries was very tiny.  It's potatoes people!  Load em up!  Not expensive for the restaurant and makes the customer feel like they're getting lots for their money.  I love value!

Back to being impressed...  Even the kiddie meals looked good.  They had lots of options, mix & match sides.  One kiddie got grilled cheese & orange slices, which looked very yummy & she dug it!  The other got chicken fingers & fries, which looked like quite a bit of food.  He even shared a finger.

A couple people had steak & lobster, which looked surprisingly good for a chain.  Good looking sides on the dinner entrees all around...  sweet potato fries, tomato/mozzarella salad & tortellini.  It looked more elegant than I'd expect at Fridays."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here to get the Jack Daniels burger. The host was very quick and very nice. After being seated we looked over our menu and sat there and waited and waited and waited. After 10 mins of being ignored not one single staff member stopped and talked to us. What a shame and an embarrassment to have customers walk out."}
{"text":"I don't understand how people pay money to eat here, you can find everything on that disgusting menu in the frozen foods in a grocery store, well any way i went there just recently with some friends and to put things in a nut shell, service was horrible & the food was horrible. It took them over 30 minutes to bring us our food, the waitress was so rude! The only good thing about this was the host really cool guy forgot his name but what a nice guy! I will never go back to any of these restaurants."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow. We had two children and waited 45 mins for our food with no crowd in the restaurant. Endless apps were over 30 mins apart from the kitchen. Poor quality service and professionalism across the board. Food was just fine, not amazing. Pass this place by if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"The TGI Friday's I'm used to going to is nothing special. But this one is great!

First the place looks really nice. It doesn't look like a tacky family restaurant. It's  has a very fresh, sports bar atmosphere. Their beer and drink selection is excellent, the server was great, and the food is delicious. My burger was great and I tried some of my friend's food. I was jealous! His was even more delicious. 

The only problem I had with this restaurant is their desert selection was really limited."}
{"text":"Just came home from TGI Fridays on W Sahara. Absolutely the worst meal AND service I have experienced in quite some time. I ordered a New York steak (med rare) and fried shrimp plate. The steak was well done and the shrimp was also overcooked. The cole slaw side dish was almost unrecognizable to the point that I found a whole spinach leaf in mine. When I sent the entire meal back and asked to have it removed from my bill, I thought surely a manager would respond, but no and even when I told the food server that I would never come back again still no manager!!!. Service was mediocre at best and the fact that no one seemed to care about the issues we experienced  makes this review easy There are too many restaurants  in Las Vegas to ever put up with this bad of a meal."}
{"text":"I've been there often and have seen a decline in the past couple of years. The food is very greasy and fatty and the restaurant seems to be less clean with every visit. There is a very unpleasant smell that seems to concentrate in the bar area. As another reviewer indicated, the floors and the menus are sticky.  The staff is very nice though!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.

Granted I don't expect much from this type of chain restaurant but, thanks to Ashley, I will never go back to a TGIF again. Completely forgot the appetizer order. Pawned off actually taking our entree order on the poor bartender (Laura was great btw). Then didn't see her again until it was time to drop off the check. Had to get our own drink refills. Missing requested condiments. When her lack of service was pointed out, she made some faint excuse about acting as a Spanish translator when she didn't know the language.

The food wasn't much better than the service.

With all of the other options in this area, steer clear of this poor excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I feel like a fool. I've continued to dine at this place despite to it's horrible service.  NEVER AGAIN!

To make a very long story short,  we got the same server as our last visit.  The same server that attempted to short my change.  Tonight it took her 24 mins just to take our order and it wasn't until we asked for the manager did we get our meal (another 51 mins).

They obviously don't want our business. That's  fine, we dine out 3-4 times a week and there are lots of other choices.

The manager in his way  tried to make it right by offering us a free meal but that doesn't address the  horrible service.

Maybe I'm expecting to high. After all its Friday's."}
{"text":"We've been coming here a little more lately as they've seemed to pick up the customer service, but Aug. 18, the wheels came off. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait for three of us. We sat down and waited without about 10 other customers. I counted 22 empty tables! Why in the hell are people waiting for a table when a good 1/3 to 1/2 of the restaurant is empty? During the time we we waited (about 10 minutes) we saw a couple walk about saying they had waited 30 minutes so far for a seat in a half empty restaurant. We left immediately after they did. The hostess didn't seem to care in the slightest and didn't even offer a \"sorry\" as we left. I sent an email to corporate about it and hope they will take notice."}
{"text":"endless app for $10 and $3 house magarita,long iceland ice tea on  thruday night it awesome and good deal.bartender is very fast and nice.food is hot and good.be back again"}
{"text":"My family and friends used to go to Fridays all the time. Then, it seemed that the prices started going up every time we would visit, but the food quality was going down. We haven't been there in awhile so last week we decided to go back and visit again. As soon as we walked in the waitress asked if we wanted a table or a booth. We said a booth, and she asked \"would you like happy hour side or non?\" Of course the happy hour, love their potato skins, to which she replied that happy hour side only has high tables available. Considering that we have two kids and my boyfriend has bad knees which makes it harder to sit on a high chair we said that we would wait for a booth or if they would honor the happy hour on the other side of the restaurant that only had one booth taken. She said \"you can't wait since we are slow and you have to sit on that side by the bar for happy hour\". We said fine, we will stay anyway. The waiter was extremely rude, did not listen to our order since he had to come back twice to rewrite his order notes, and we waited twenty min just for water. They brought soup which we didn't order, never brought the salads we did order, and then tried to charge us for them. He had to go and double check with the other waiters that they didn't clear the salad plates off of our tables when they brought the food before he would take it off the check .I'm really sad that we can't go there anymore since it used to be our favorite place, but after the service and attitude we will not be coming back. Plenty of other places to try that would appreciate their customers!"}
{"text":"I come to this location because it's close to home, located inside Aliante Casino. Friendly staff and there's enough on the menu to satisfy the healthy and unhealthy patron.  Usually my experience here is good until recently.  I ordered a steak medium rare which came out well done.  Somehow I get the feeling it wasn't the chef's fault but the waiter not listening and probably writing the order down wrong. For example, I ordered a \"to go\" box, which he said he'll bring one but after a lengthy wait he returned empty handed and asked me if I wanted a \"to go\" box for the food as if I never asked him for one.  Hmmm. Also,  I drank all of my water at the beginning of my meal and was never given a refill. This wasn't a haunting experience by no means but it was an experience nonetheless. Hence the 3 stars due to my good experiences in the past saving this review from being 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke and my next visit will be 5 star worthy, which I'll properly edit."}
{"text":"On Friday, 8.26.16, around 3:00pm.  My husband and I wanted to eat at this TGI Friday's in Charlotte, NC on Northlake Mall Dr.  It was not the best service that day that we had experienced on previous occasions.  The greeter was less than friendly.  We spoke first, he barely spoke at all and did not smile at all. He did however seat us rather quickly, because it was not busy at that time.  Once seated, we waited 15 minutes and no one came to take not even our drink order.  We decided to leave and went to PF Chang's.  The experience there was night and day.  We were very pleased at PFC's."}
{"text":"If I could give minus stars, I'd give -10!
Worst service EVER!!!!! Server kept saying that it costs
.49 for a refill, when we couldn't even get our first drink. We ordered wings, potato skins, cheese sticks and a salad. We asked for bone in wings, and they were boneless. Cheese sticks soggy. Potato skins were gross. When we talked to the server about the service, she said they were short staffed, that 3 team members were pregnant and on maternity leave. She said that there were some good reviews on trip advisor, because she posted it. We had a 3rd guest come in and have a drink with us, then 5 different different servers come up and ask if we needed anything, then the manager came up and asked us to move tables. We couldn't even get 1 server to get our order right and timely.
Rude! Rude! Disappointed. We said we would never come back and we we're just at The Orleans for a meeting and thought we would give it a try again. Horrible!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"great service, very good food the AYCE apps awesome deal, and there not small apps there full size, good deal Fridays for doing that."}
{"text":"Went in for my birthday dinner.

Service was poor.

Steak All fat
Felt rushed

Very disappointed.
Use to be one of my favorite places"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. I don't remember the name of our server, but he was awful. They were not busy when we arrived after seeing a movie, they were not busy during our dinner and business was only picking up just as we were leaving. He got our orders wrong twice, when my food came out, it was cold and my steak was over cooked and he didn't want to take it back, we waited 20+ minutes for our appetizer and then 30+ for our entrees even though we ordered everything all at once, and he gave us such a bad attitude even though we were really very friendly. Then he over charged us on the check, and when he came back with it I told him to split it evenly down the middle because I was paying cash and my friend was paying with card. He said okay, came back 10 minutes later and tells us he put the $40 in cash I gave him towards the bill and then rest on the card! I brought up that I told him to split it evenly and he told me \"Oh well\". So ultimately we didn't tip him and left. Never going back. Worst service I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Holy cow the food was amazing. I went there for lunch and decided to get the Jack Daniels Burger lunch special, or whatever it's called. I got a huge burger and loads of fries for $7 I believe. The Jack Daniel sauce was A-MA-ZING and I was tempted to ask for a bottle of the stuff and an extra straw. Definitely try it, it's life-changing!"}
{"text":"I order a burger it was cold and no test at all not a very good jack Daniel burger and they didn't give m my sauce"}
{"text":"The food at this place is never consistent. 

The servers are clueless. 

Ordered a pasta that in its description said \"in wine sauce\" um they should change it with \"in 4 lbs of SALT sauce\" so gross couldn't even eat it. 

Came in at 3am and no one comes to my table for drinks or anything for a whole 30 mins?

Food portions are smaller at this place than other TGIFs too.

$6 for 3 sliders? And that's happy hour price? Eeyeah. Doesn't come with fries or anything either."}
{"text":"Never going there again! My wife and My 8 yr old son got food poisoning the last time we were there, my son got it from the kids pizza and carrots with ranch, and my wife got it from their chicken fingers with fries with ranch. As soon as we left there they had a really bad stomach ache and started throwing up everywhere and had to rush to the nearest restroom."}
{"text":"Had a cheese burger and fries too much salt .The burger was way too greasy but tasted ok. When i asked the bartender for a coffee to go only a half cup i will give a one star.service ok"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years so wife and I decided to go for change of pace.  Big mistake.
Way overpriced for terribly average food and small portions.  Server was trying too hard to be nice but otherwise service was fine.  

I know most of these type of chains are overpriced for the quality and quantity but TGIFridays has definitely dropped to the bottom of that list. 
Definitely will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Fast, polite and the food was good.  The Thai Tacos and fried Mac&Cheese was yummy.  Great burgers as well. This is no culinary stop but good fast food."}
{"text":"Slowww service the food is great!!! But getting the food and getting the check getting our drinks it was all just alll slowww"}
{"text":"Ordered potato skins and the shrimp skillet.  Pretty good.  On my lunch break, enjoyed the music while relaxing with some great food.  Teresa, was great."}
{"text":"Staff is attentive and friendly. The food is okay. The ribs are small but come with plenty of wet naps. The fish n chips were awful and not worth ordering. Their salads are winners."}
{"text":"My family of four went after 10pm on a Tuesday night. There were only two other tables with people, the rest of the restaurant was empty. Our server reminded me of a teenager who thought he was funny, but came off as a smart azz, especially when he wondered why I showed my I.D., after not hearing that I ordered a cocktail. The first round of drinks took too long, and simple water was forgotten and when asked about the water again, the server asked if we still wanted it. They were out of one item, which was understandable. The next time we were asked about drinks was when our food was almost finished. I noticed a bar in the restaurant and thought it would've been quicker just to have ordered our drinks there. Next time we go to Sam's Town, I would rather go to their casino snack bar than TGIF."}
{"text":"Very fast and prompt service, especially for a Saturday night. Our waitress was fair, not super friendly but not rude either. I'd return for another visit."}
{"text":"Horrible food no flavor I went with my boyfriend he had gotten the boneless buffalo chicken wings and I got the shrimp and chicken pasta and we shared the Mac and cheese appetizer bites he had a couple of bites of my food and on the way home I started feeling sick when we got home he felt the same way and turns out he's got food poising I wouldn't go here again!"}
{"text":"The food was ok in total but the service and the beverages were not up to sanders .The water tasted like tap water. The srawberry smoothie was a dark dark purple color. The slushy was a little bit of crushed ice and the drink . The lobster was really good. The ribs were the best. Really good barbecue sauce. 

My cousin got a sundae and the middle of the two scoops was a glop of whip-cream almost like they ran out on ice cream. I recommend this place when your not starving because it will not meat your I WANT FOOD NOW standerds.

                              IT IS OK"}
{"text":"Well tonight the staff sucks.  Asking for something 3 times and you are ignored.  Customer service has went to hell these days."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night with my sister. Dinner was great . We ordered endless apps they came out pretty quickly, our server was Mindy she was awesome, great customer service very happy we had her she made the night very fun! We will be back definitely thanks to the great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I had not been to this Friday's in a while and it will be a long time until I return. This rating is only for my dinner. We were seated promptly. There were lots of empty tables at 6:00. The table was good for a party of 5. We ordered 3 dinner salads, a salmon dinner and I had the shrimp which comes with fries. Tables around us got their food much quicker (even though they ordered apps first). The shrimp were the size of quarters and like the cheap kind you find at a grocery store, which doesn't justify a price of $14 . The whole plate was the same color...tannish. Taste average. It took the server a long time between taking our money and coming back with change.  This is NOT the Fridays experience of past visits although seem in line with recent reviews."}
{"text":"Really bad service, we waited 40 min for our sever or any one, to take our order.  I even call in and asked to get a server after another ten min we just left. 

Sad, I was my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Our family stopped in for a quick dinner over the July 4th weekend, and the visit was a pleasant one, our server was great! Everyone was in the mood for meat, our server was Mya, she told us about the rib special, a whole rack for $12 or so, with the sides. My son's ears perked up, and his order was decided before we sat down in our booth. Steaks were cooked just as we requested (medium, and medium rare) which Mya had us cut into before she was off taking care of her other tables. Chicken Cesar salad was like the countless other ones ordered before, no complaints. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but did pick up while we were there. Mya was friendly, and on the move between her tables, doing whatever necessary to make sure everyone was happy. A better experience than we've had in the past. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, a bit dry, and my broccoli was cooked well, not grey and deathly looking."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite and that's what I got. Server was fast and seem like she could be a manger. Food was decent for the price."}
{"text":"Bad service today.  Took 15 minutes to get a drink and didn't bring our dessert.  Food is usually good but not today."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. .. Got ignored.. I walked into TGI Fridays on South Tryon Charlotte NC about 5 pm on a Sunday .. Not busy at all, and wanted to place a To Go order .. I went to the bar with only 1 lady seated there... 2 different people came behind the bar, did something with the register and walked off .. I stood, stood there, stood there and then left .. On the way out I asked the greeters if the people behind the bar could take my order and they said yes .. why didn't they I have no idea but I won't be back"}
{"text":"The food is decent and it's open very late, 2AM weekdays, 3am on weekends.  Since many of the restaurants in Vegas aren't open late at night, it's a very reliable standby to get some decent food late at night.

The Southwestern Mahi Mahi  or Shrimp Key West is great if you want something light, as many of the dishes tend to be on the heavy side, with alfredo-type sauces or cheese. I've also had their California Club (has avocado in it, very good) and one of the steaks (can't remember which one, but it was good).

They have a ton of different drinks, but if you don't drink alcohol, try the cherry limeade slush, very yummy & refreshing."}
{"text":"The food here was so gross. All of our 6 meals came out at different times and all cold. Waitress was apologetic and kind but to be honest this place has really and truly gone to the dogs. Won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"They ran out of boneless wings so they cut up chicken fingers and put sauce on them, while never informing me. After sending them back twice because they were terrible, they comped me traditional wings that then had a hair on them. It clearly was not mine or my girlfriends. This was followed by just bad service in general. 
I live super close so I was a customer quite often, but in recent months this place has been absolutely awful. This was the final time I will go to this location or quite possibly Friday's altogether."}
{"text":"While our server was fantastic, the drink and meal were not. Despite the great service, None of us were impressed with our food. I suppose it is what is to be expected from a chain. The Long Island Iced Tea was loaded up to the brim with ice, and the liquors were not mixed properly. A salad that was ordered was so loaded with dressing, it was overpowering. Another meal's portions were so small, it was difficult to justify the cost. Our appetizer was yummy, though. Overall, a very ho-hum experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but the food was good and our server, Russ, really made our experience a great one. He was super attentive and went out of his way to make sure we were happy. Wonderful way to end a girls night with my daughters. Thank you Russ!"}
{"text":"The food was really warm and delicious! They have way better breadsticks than Olive Garden. The staff was extremely friendly even late at night... shout out to the manager Brian for checking up on us and making sure we were good. And they have a really dope playlist"}
{"text":"I went there around 10 pm. The waiter was great and the food came out quickly and was good."}
{"text":"Firstly, they are obviously understaffed. The servers are so busy we had three separate people bringing us the food. Two of our party ordered medium rare burgers, which came out medium well. Multiple sides appeared to vegan for the non-meat eater in the party, however both the potatoes and the steamed spinach were covered in cheese. To top it off, it took more than 15 minutes to return our cards AFTER paying for the meal. The servers we had were nice and good at their jobs, so its a shame that the workers in the back would give such a sub-par experience to us. 2/10"}
{"text":"This was our second and last visit to this chain franchise. The place was understaffed , a long wait for a table when a number of open tables were visible was the start of our journey.

Once seated we waited 15 minutes before our waitress came by. She seened polite and personable, and took our order for soup and appetizer.

15 minutes later we asked a passing waiter if the kitchen had problems . \" it's Saturday\". Well yes , but it was 9:30, well after dinner rush ?

5 minutes later as we were preparing to walk out , our food arrived. The soup had been sitting for a while , but the microwaved appetizers had cooled and congealed. Melted cheese is not supposed to look like lumps of wax !

Our waitress appeared after 20 more minutes and asked us if we wanted the bill. 

Yes. And your tip will be commensurate with our terrible experience..."}
{"text":"Had the steak and lobster tail, bowl of chowder and onion rings.  Pure garbage.  This food appears to be heated from frozen and tasted bad. I have had the ribs at this location before and they were good. Also had a hamberger here a few weeks ago, it was passable.  My bill came to over $30.00 for just me, for the above items.  Gold Coast should have stuck with their own restaurant which was always good. It appears to be all about Greed. P.S. the server tryed hard but of course has no control over the garbage coming from the kitchen.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"the food was ok, the 2 stars is more for the bad experience. 

I understand that its a huge restaurant, but management can at least give proper coverage to the  tables to ensure that all customers get a great experience while dinning. 

We we're seated quick which was awesome, but after that everything else was on a snails pace. It was very disappointing. Our server was tending to almost 30 people which made the service very slow.. I was so thirsty and waited for my drink refill and water for a long time!! They we're faster clearing our table after than tending to our needs."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. Thought the store front was a lil small but still cool. Good was fresh drink were on point to. Would come back"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium hamburger. Got a well done one with cold fries.  Service was questionable.  Recommend you stay away."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, quick service, and sat us down immediately. We ordered the endless appetizers. $10 each!"}
{"text":"Had a great time watching the Cubs and the Blackhawks games while the bartenders Blake and Katie kill it behind the bar! Best bartenders EVER! Since I'm here on business I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't like the restaurant portion of this TGI Fridays so I always order to go at the bar (live right across the street).  I always order the same salad but tonight I found a large kinky pubic like hair in it.  Absolutely disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Started the night with the Tuscan Spinach dip and it was ok. The portion size was very small. The New York Cheddar and Bacon Burger had a good taste, but nothing very special. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!  We will never return!  Broccoli was dumped out of the Costco bag - carrots had started to white over and was wrinkled due to dehydration.  Burgers were cold and the bill was TOO high for the quality of the product!!!!  So disappointed with this food chain - they use to be good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location Thursday evening with my two little children as we do occasionally. We waited about 15 minutes before our server Brittany introduced herself. My husband ordered a Long Island and endless apps which you choose 3 out of a list in addition to him ordering a burger and everyone else also ordering meals. My daughter received her salad but was not given silverware so after waiting about 10 minutes I went to the hostess stand and asked for some because at this point she is eating with her hands lol. The hostess comes back to tell me they are rolling it and they will bring it over. A couple minutes later out waitress tosses them on our table and walks away and a food runner drops off our mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were so cold the cheese was already congealed in the center but at this point we did not care since we have been there for 50 minutes and we were just ready for food. About 10 minutes later another food runner brings out meals. We still haven't seen our waitress and my husband was never asked for another drink so he's drinking my water. I explain to the food runner we still haven't received our other apps in addition. The runner must have told our server because our server comes back and states she has to wait until we finish our first app before she can place our second app in the computer and she is still waiting for them to come out. It at this point was a good bit of time ago. I asked for boxes because we were now there over a hr and just got our food, my children are now cranky and my husband and I were so frustrated. She comes over and throws the boxes on the table no apologies and said she's gonna bring our other two apps out and she'll be back. She came back and put them on our table and handed my husband the check. I wanted to speak to a manager but my husband was so aggravated he just wanted to go. My husband and I have been in customer service and we actually met working in a restaurant, that being said this was the worst service we have ever had."}
{"text":"Since two stars seems to be a common review of this restaurant, I guess I'm not alone in my disappointment.  Have been dining here off and on for the past 10 years and lately it seems to be sliding downhill.  Appetizer (Chicken Quesadillas) was tasty, but we were not given plates when it came to the table.  Absolute WORST margarita I have had in 40 years--could not drink it and server did not notice that it continued to sit on the table.  Steak was average and much tougher than in the past -- disappointing.  Strawberry Fields Salad with salmon looked good when brought to table but was not good.  Salmon had funny taste, and I was glad to not feel sick after eating some of it.  Very loud person at bar also.  Unfortunately we will NOT be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service all the way around at TGI Friday's on West Sahara!! Great food,  great service and the manager is fantastic!! Our server Teresa was excellent! !"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I think the service was Great, from the hostess with the extremely low cut shirt on (i'm not a jerk, it was very low, too low for her, and too low for my liking, she had horrific stretch marks all over her breasts, keep those things covered!), to the waitress, who's attitude was friendly. Both girls were very nice, especially the one with the low cut top on, which made up for the fact that I had to witness all of her \"Goodies\". I couldn't help but stare! The food was plentiful, but it wasn't good. The \"fall off the bone\" ribs weren't falling off the bone and they were badly burnt! I'm giving them 3 stars due to the service, service was a five, food was a Zero!"}
{"text":"We came in here on a Saturday late and our server Allison was AWESOME! Food came on time and service rocks!"}
{"text":"Tonight was horrible! I've been here a few times with friends, but this was the worst experience I've had. We were seated immediately, however our server was not a good one. I believe his name is Chris... He took our drink order and didn't ask if we wanted any apps or wanted to put in any orders. Once we got it drinks, it took him a while to come back to take the order. He never came to check on us once we got our food or asked if anybody wanted to order another drink. Before he brought the checks I asked for 2 of the Tennessee whiskey cakes. He then brought the checks and didn't add the cakes in. My total was $19.52, so I paid with a $20 and we were all going to leave a tip collectivity. I was the only person that paid cash. When he returned to the table, he brung everyone else their cards back, kept my change and receipt, and didn't return with my cake. He said y'all have a good night. I then asked him where my cake was because at that point I wasn't worried about the change. He says \"oh, damn... I didn't put it in. You still want it?\" DUH! That was the purpose of me telling you I wanted it! He put the order in, brung the cakes, then says y'all have a good night. I'm thinking that because he had such horrible service, the cakes were free because he didn't bring a check. He watched us get up and leave out. Next thing i know...He chased us to the car to get me to pay for them. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is awful! My husband and I were given water no straws. I ordered a steak, I asked for A1 and was brought an empty bottle. Please don't order a drink in a shaker. It's mostly melted ice and only enough for one glass, nothing left in the shaker. When I asked the manager why the drink was less than what I'd normally get she told me because my drink was made in the kitchen and not at the bar. They use different methods to measure drinks in the same restaurant. The couple sitting across from us had to wait 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by a server. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Love Fridays & this one is extra special, my boyfriend & I had my first date here :) !! He was very shy the bartender hook us up with good drinks and food... been going their for a year now once a week !! Great service food is amazing & drinks they make very good !!"}
{"text":"This place it's great and the food out of this world, but the service sucks. The first thing I did when the waiter took our drink orders was asked for an appetizer.30 min passed we got our entrees. 7 mins later we got the appetizer now, I thought an appetizer was a small dish before the main meal. Ps the whole time I was there I did not felt like I was being serviced."}

{"text":"Food is always amazing, service was always one of the best until today. Alyssa was our server didn't like her service at all... first we asked hostess for booster seat for one of my kids... didn't get it. Server comes we asked for it again... she asked about our drinks and we ended up ordering everything and I don't think she like the fact that we order since she was only asking for drinks anyhow she comes back and still no booster seat I had to ask for it again. Long story short food was great she didn't come back to check on us so we needed more drinks finally brought them and we asked for boxes to go and dessert...  never came. We asked a different server for a box and immediately was brought to us we had to go look for the server to cancel dessert.
She did bring the check right away!!!!!!!
So I guess she didn't like us or she was having a bad day."}
{"text":"Food was \"okay\" I guess. Nothing special.  Girlfriend got the chicken sandwich and wasn't impressed with it. My American cheeseburger wasn't anything great either.  Only decent thing was the broccoli cheddar soup. Probably wouldn't go back unless they brought back the three course dinner special"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch with my mother. The male server (never told us his name) was in such a hurry, we felt rushed to get out of there. My mom told him her chicken wasn't very good and his response was \"oh\".  I watched him almost spill food on several other servers and guests because he was literally running with the food plates. We flagged him down to get our change from the bill, mind you after he passed us twice, he continued walking and yelled from half way across the restaurant that the manager would give it to us. The manager walked over, also did not introduce himself, gave us our money and with the complaint about the food had the same reaction! A few lessons in customer service go a long way!!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of chain restaurants but my sister and I decided to grab dinner at Fridays when we were at the Orleans last night.  We were seated immediately and experienced perhaps the best service I have had for a long time.  A young gentleman named Mars.  He was prompt and the perfect blend of efficient and friendly.  We both ordered the Parmesean-crusted chicken and were not disappointed.  Everything on the plate was awesome.  Some of the moistest chicken breast I have ever eaten.  I will eat there again when I am at the Orleans."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I just moved to the area and was super excited there was TGIF close by, but was soon disappointed. Our server was awful, I don't know if it was at the end of their shift or they were stoned, but she was nowhere to be found. It took us 30 mins to even order our drinks. When our food finally arrived it was cold and gross. Lets just say she didn't get a tip and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was wrong, didn't bring drinks or refills in timely manner, lobster was served cold but they did give us dessert since they messed up the order so bad."}
{"text":"Food was good. Server was ok, maybe just in need of some communication skills."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dessert while staying at the Orleans.  Service was awful.  The server forgot to bring us essentials such as napkins and forgot to check on us to see if we needed anything.  The servers don't actually know the price of their alcoholic beverages b/c the price changes daily.  You have to ask for the price each drink you might possibly be interested in.  The server then checks the computer for the price.    I think they ran out of orange sherbert for one of the smoothies and tried to fake the drink anyway using orange juice.  Three/four of our desserts were OK, so they get a couple of stars for that."}
{"text":"It's a TGIFridays people. Don't get your hopes up for the food quality or service. They're both pretty average. However, if you're a sports fan and looking to get away from the craziness and crowds usually found at the strip casino sports books, then this is the place for you. Tucked away in the Gold Coast Casino, TGIFridays provides the perfect sports get away for intense sports fans. My buddies and I came into town for the NCAA tournament and couldn't come close to finding a seat at any of the strip casinos. As a result, we made our way down to Gold Coast's TGIFridays and were able to get four spots right away at the bar. The place has a ton of TVs and cheap big beers. During Happy Hour times (3-7PM) there are goods deals on food and drinks, as well. Since then I've gone back a handful of times to watch games and each time I've been able to get an easy seat and my game on any TV I wanted. The sports book is also right next door if you need to make a quick bet and the gold coast is usually pretty empty so there are no long lines to wait in. Give it a shot if you're looking for a laid back viewing experience!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!!! I came here 2 nights ago with some friends. They sat us with Jaime. I noticed all of the customers around us were complaining to the manager and I was like I don't want to be like them... Boy was I wrong and understand why. The burger meal was DISGUSTING, the soda had no carbonation, there was hair in my friend food, and only thing I enjoyed out of my $27.33 meal was my $10 mozzarella sticks. Even the free dessert they gave my friend was terrible."}
{"text":"Great Server, Thank You Jessica!!! You Saved the night -- I would have left One Star except, I heard yelling in the kitchen- Those Frigin Morons behind the Window argued with Her about every simple little Thing!!! I tried to tip the hostess to be sat in a good section (she didn't take it) But Apparently I was put in the right section --- FYI, a bun should never be cold and I've learned to tip people ahead of time for good service- My Girl Said You Saved the Night"}
{"text":"We normally love Fridays and I would have given them four stars but last night was far from good at all. Let me clarify, this was not the bartender's fault at all and she was AWESOME! The mudslides were great! Hubby got the endless apps and kept getting prompt refills on his drinks and apps. 

My dinner was another story. I ordered the parmesan chicken dinner. I would have never thought anything of it, but it came out covered in mustard and bacon, none of which were described in the menu. I hate being someone to send something back and I asked the bartender if it was supposed to come with mustard. She had to ask 5 people to get a correct answer and that in fact it does come with mustard. She had them re-fire the piece of chicken without mustard. 

After almost 40 minutes of waiting for a piece of chicken and my husbands last app (loaded baked potato skins) it finally came to the table. I took one bite and the manager came over and asked how it was. I told her it was way overcooked (sawdust) and tasted burnt. She took the dinner off the table, but this is all just a ridiculous.

Corporate needs to make sure they tell people exactly what is on anything on the menu. I never would have ordered this had I known of the mustard. This could have ended up horrible if someone was allergic. 

I knew I shouldn't have sent the chicken back and just had them take it off, but as someone who has been in the restaurant industry, it doesn't take 40 minutes to cook a piece of chicken and a re-fire takes a precedent over everything else. Who ever was running the kitchen last night needs some refresher courses on cooking chicken. 

The manager and bartender were nice and I will come back eventually. The staff is friendly but the kitchen needs help and like I said corporate needs to add better description to the food items."}
{"text":"Normally, this place is really good and I've never had a complaint before. Most recent visit was a different story. Food came out fast, but wasn't as warm as it should be. Steak was undercooked, fries were coated in salt. 
The staff wasn't as friendly as usual. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Came here just to grab some appetizers until our room was ready.  The place was not packed at all except for one large group.   We ordered two appetizers a spinach dip and the  crisp ahi tuna. Twenty minutes later the dip comes out (plate was extremely warm, meaning it was sitting under the heating lamp for awhile), seriously, 20 min for a spinach dip. Then 10 min later the tuna. The waitress had the audacity to blame it on the group, which was being attended to by another waitress and they were half way through their entrees. Im sorry but 30 min for two minimal appetizers is not ok.   Never refilled our drinks, manager never came over, and no compensation what so ever. 
Took another 10 min to pay and get out of there as fast as we could."}
{"text":"What can be said about TGI Friday's that hasn't already been said? Nothing. The correct answer is nothing. If you've been to one, you've been to all of them. No one is high-fiving about going there. No one is dropping to their knees in the rain crying \"NOOOOO!!\" with outstretched arms, either. The atmosphere is kitschy, the food is good but not great, the noise level is fairly high, the specials are decent. 

If you've never been to a TGI Friday's before (and if you have, I don't know why you're reading this), don't expect amazing things. Expect a meal you'll neither regret nor remember three days later. They do average better than anyone."}
{"text":"First time there. Great service from James and fantastic appetizers.  And the draft beer was COLD. Very nice experience."}
{"text":"While the food was delicious, the customer service was terrible. The server, Brittany, obviously did not want to be there on this past Sunday afternoon. Rude and snappy at anytime that we even spoke to her. After we finished our meal, my friend clearly told her that our bill was together; Brittany brought back two separate receipts. Not a big deal, but she rolls her eyes after we asked for one bill. To top it all off, she returns to the table with the nastiest attitude, stating that my friend's Visa card had been declined. Clearly something is wrong here. My friend was like, I know that's not right. Let me call my bank.\" I said, \"I'll take care of it.\" So Brittany snatches MY Visa card, comes back and and loudly says, \"This card is declined, too...SO WHAT Y'ALL PLAN TO DO?!\" OMG! Really?! First of all, who are you speaking to, Young Lady?! I can't stand rudeness at all...especially when I know that both of our cards had more than enough funds to cover the meals. So I give Brittany ANOTHER Visa card, and this one went through. She almost throws it back on the table when she returns. I stated that obviously there was either an issue with Friday's machine or Visa. She just walked away. Even after dealing with her rude and disrespectful demeanor, I still left her a tip, even though she didn't deserve one at all. Overall, it was just the way that the situation was handled. Why would we visit a restaurant if we didn't have the money to pay for our food? Maybe Brittany had a bad experience in the past with non-paying customers, but you shouldn't judge everyone on past experiences with them. I started to speak with the manager, but it wasn't even worth it. Yelp is on point with reviews. I will start to pay more attention to them. I don't care if the food was delicious; if the customer service is poor, it's a wrap. My friend and I went on to have a great day, and to utilize both of the cards for the remainder of the day that were \"declined.\" I will never eat at this Friday's again."}

{"text":"Friday's on a 'Friday night' interesting. As chains go this Friday's restaurant is ehhh just one bad day away from being a two star  eatery. There was nothing exceptional about tonight's dining experience, and I say that because I traditional eat at this Fridays on a rather regular basis, and the service and appearance, seem to be on a slippery slope to life support. With that said let's dig in. 'roll that beautiful bean footage' shall we. 

My wife had the Jack Daniels shrimp and steak garnished w/sweet potato fries (@ $18.30) and she was quite pleased (I know because ALL throughout dinner she continually said I told you to get what I have) go figure.  Eating machine's I and II had chicken fingers (@ $5.49) with a  rather adequate side salad (my wife always tries to sneak healthy in on my mini T-Rex's) and two frothy cups of chocolate milk mmm good and as I have said in the past. How do you mess up chicken fingers.

Now for the main event. I ordered what so deceptively appeared to be a man sized meal. Rib-eye @ $18.50 (10 ounces of THEIR most tender cut...POPPY COCK), with fresh spinach, and mashed potatoes. The spinach was magnifique, it was warm,  buttery, and inviting. The portion was solid and like a cold cold beer on a sultry July day, it went down smooth, easy, and fast. The spuds they were also done just right. Warm, moist, a hint of seasoning (maybe garlic) and scallions. This good people is were the love fest ends  

The prime rib was 10 ounces of hell on earth. It looked AND tasted like shoe leather and fought back like a 12 ounce boxing glove. It was hard to cut, and after chewing each bite for what felt like a weekend, I CHOKED it down.  In the menu it seemed huge, however on my plate I need a search and rescue team to find it. What it lacked in size and girth, it made up for in fight. Will I eat there again sure with our current history, I can't just bail. However as they say in baseball it's one two three strikes your out at the north hills Friday. Oh and I won't have the 10 ounce jaw buster next time."}
{"text":"As always the food and service was very good.  We eat there quite often.  Never had a bad meal there.  My wife likes their Jack Daniels ribs and I like their salmon and chicken."}
{"text":"As my office is not far from here, I frequent this resturant for their lunch specials. Usually the service is excellent. Yesterday, I had an experience with a waitress who only had two tables, was slow with service, rude and not that intersted in her job.

I had to wait so long for the check that I finally just plopped down 20 bucks on the table and left, leaving her a much bigger tip that I wanted to but I had to get back to work.

When I informed the host of the terrible service he just kind of shrugged at me and said \" sorry about that\"

Come on people it was 11:30 am on a Tuesday only two occupied tables in the whole joint. Had to wait almost 20 minutes for my lunch and it was lukewarm.

Needless to say, wont be going back."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a TGI Friday's. Happy hour is good, all the food is tolerable, and the prices are good. Spent 40 minutes at the end trying to sort things out because somehow the computer wasn't happy that we got the $22 three-course meal and also used an $8 stripes coupon. The manager ended up comping the offending portion of the meal, and I blame this one on corporate, because it was clearly a problem even the manager couldn't resolve within the computer system.."}
{"text":"Went to Fridays inside the Alliante casino. Was in a rush trying to catch a movie after so we sat in the bar. Ordered shrimp cocktail and potato skins for appetizers and each had steak dinners. The shrimp was great, however the potato skins came out after we received our steak dinners. A bit disappointing but the bartender took care of it and removed it from the bill! Amazing. She was also very nice and helpful and made great drinks as well. Even though the potato skins came out late, she still made service great. Even the manager came out to check on us. Definitely going back.

{"text":"I'd give them no stars if possible.  Twenty open tables yet we couldn't get sat.  Round table with six chairs 10 feet away from the waiting area, yet I'm told there aren't tables that can seat six.  Took a young lady 5 minutes to clean a booth.  Slow and inept.  We left after waiting 15 minutes.  A group of 4, that came in after my party, was say at the aforementioned table that would seat six.  Don't waste your time.  Manager down to the table bus staff were all terrible."}
{"text":"There's always a lowered level of expectation when dining at a chain restaurant. TGI Fridays can usually be counted on to deliver a tasty, reasonably priced meal. This location fails at that. 

Whereas the menu offerings here promise flavor in the description, the food itself is really quite bland. There is a serious dip in quality from where this chain was just a few years ago. Cheaper ingredients are apparent and even the famed Jack Daniels barbecue sauce has lost it's zip.

Add to the fact that the food was disappointing, the drinks are watered down. I know times are tough and changes are part of the climate, but the prices which once seemed reasonable, now seem too high for the mediocre food.

I would suggest that it's not only the failing economy that is contributing to a nearly empty restaurant at 5:30 on a Saturday evening. There are other chains delivering better food at the same price. Hopefully Fridays gets back on track."}
{"text":"While on a job out in Las Vegas, I ate a couple of times at this TGI Fridays which was in the hotel/casino. I had tried going to vegetarian places around town, but they were either out of business or I couldnt find them among the numerous strip malls ands vast signage that makes up this town.

Fortunately TGI Fridays has a veggie burger that they actually make themselves instead of heating up a frozen store bought garden burger like most mega chains. It is made from black beans, spices, and some other goodies, and will more than likely fall apart while you are trying to eat it, so I suggest having a napkin, fork and knife on stand-bye. 

Since I was in town on my own, and everyone I knew was busy, I decided to take it up to my room. They allow you to purchase beers and take the bottles up with you, which is pretty cool because I didnt feel like hanging out at the bar by myself while I had a beer or two.

Overall I am glad that they are there, but I really wish places would have more selection than one item for vegetarians. Salads dont count, everyone expects vegetarians to eat a salad."}

{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh from Ohio. Went to this Friday's at around 11.

The three elements of a good restaurant (food quality, service, appearance/ambiance- are the three I use for reviews and I will average the ratings of each respective element)

Food Quality- Ordered a Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The consistency of the chicken was rubbery, but had a bold tone of crust. The Mac and Cheese pairing was bland, but edible. (2.5/5 stars)

Service- The server was nice and had a warm personality. Though, he didn't check with us throughout the meal. (Side Note- Other employees were acting inappropriate). The server was ok. (3/5 Stars)

Appearance/Ambience- Good use of decor. Interesting decorations. Average ambience, but restaurant had a lot of personality. (3.5/5 Stars)

Average- 3/5 Stars. Decent."}
{"text":"Dined on 080715. Started with tomato basil soup, absolutly delicious and hot. The lukewarm clam chowder was thin and runny with a very strange, off taste, we sent it back and got the cheddar broccoli soup, which was tasty, but still could have been hotter. Entree was the pecan-crusted chicken salad. We liked the mixed field greens, pecans and cranberries and the vinegarette dressing was perfect. The chicken was tender and moist, but the pecan crust had a reheated in the microwave feel. Overall, the salad was so good, it was like a party in my mouth, no dessert was needed."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. horrible service. Took 21 minutes to get our alcoholic drinks.  26 minutes to get ONE appetizer. They were not even busy on a Sunday at 2:30pm. Save your money!!! Don't even waste your time going."}

{"text":"Just because someone orders water does not mean they will not tip you.

This was one of my wife's favorite places to eat until one night about a month ago when the waitress. Came to our table about 10 mins after we sat down to ask us what we wanted to drink. It was mid after noon not busy.

Then she never came back a runner had to bring us our refills and take our order and being us our food. In fact our waitress did not come back until we were done with our check.

We saw the waitress go to the two other tables that had people so maybe three tables were two many. 

Mind you I'm the kind of guy that will tip 25-50% if my service is good 
But because of the service I got I only left 3 dollars

{"text":"This place is horrible at everything. The bartender couldn't even poor a beer correctly, it took her 3 times and I only got a half a cup of beer and a half a coup of foam. Food was dry by the time it came out. And the funniest part is the price for the steak and lobster, it's $25 for it and the steak was as small as my girlfriends hand. This place has turned into a joke. Don't waste your money or time here."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give no stars this would have been my choice. The food was lackluster to say the least but the service was outstandingly horrific. After waiting almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive with nary a server to explain the debacle our food finally arrived. Still no acknowledgement of the long wait for the food although it did arrive hot. It's temperature is about the only positive thing I can mention. My 3 pattied big burger arrived with a single lonely little patty covered in a heaping amount of pungent onions. Had I not requested no onions this may have been a good thing. As I look over at my daughter's chicken and shrimp sizzler I saw a familiar sight. Onions. Had she not requested no onions this again, may have been a good thing. I inquired as to where my other patties were from my long lost server and she said she could take away my meal and have it fixed. I said thank you anyway I'll keep what I have but would love it if you could bring me back the correct burger. I was afraid I may suffer from starvation before the correct burger arrived. After a few moments there's a man standing at the end of my table staring at me. Didn't say a word just stared. I looked up and said, \"Yes?\" He replied with, \"You had a problem with your burger?\". I explained to him the situation and his response was nonexistent. With a mere \"Sooooo... Do you want to keep your burger then?\" My $14 hamburger that could have been a candidate for carbon dating as it was cooked to oblivion (I told you it was hot) was less than stellar. As well as the rest of my family's dinner.  What I can only assume was the manager explained a lot of why this place has averaged 2.5 stars. The service was atrocious and without apology. You can almost deal with a bad meal if at least the service is exceeding or at least meeting par. There was no saving grace to be found here. Except for maybe the Wendy's that was across the street that we were able to order Frosties to wash down this horrible experience. (Just in case you're wondering, they did not one single solitary thing to rectify the situation which in any situation would have left us saying $@&! happens no big deal, instead we left never to return and warning others to stay far far away.)"}

Getting the drinks and food took way too long. The food I ordered, Korean tacos, looked great when they arrived. I hadn't any lunch so I was starved and ate them up. Unfortunately a few hrs later I had bad stomach cramps and umm, well let's just say I'm not eating here again!"}

{"text":"All I want to eat at TGI Friday's is the Baby Back Ribs, but my husband talked me out of it, and we did the appetizer \"grazing\" thing.  I was pleasantly surprised.  We had the Thai Pork Tacos, Parmesan Meatballs, Bacon Mac and Cheese Bites, and the Loaded Potato Skins.  It was awesome!  

Our waiter was VERY attentive and offered to re-fill my soda several times.  He was right there when my husband finished his beer and quickly offered to get him another.  

I soooo miss TGI Friday's in Hawaii!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and the service has been ok at best at best some of the food I very much so enjoy if you want to get a steak you want to go somewhere else e... never ever ever have I gotten steak cooked correctly there. I I ordered to go and when I arrived there i found out there was no to go parking or curbside things like most other restaurants of its kind I was told to go in the bar that was filled with smoke because I guess they allow smoking in there there and was told to look for the bartender to get my food... Boy do I love smelling like cigarettes when I leave a restaurant.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Friday's around 8:30pm on a Friday night. Good time for them to be on their A-game, right? Not so much. 

Let me start by saying that during our 15 minute wait to be seated we witnessed the same waitress come up to the host stand about 3 times complaining very loudly about her life, her customers (awkward for us - hope we don't get seated in her section as to not bother her...at WORK) and her job. .......... That's incredibly unprofessional no matter where or who you are. But you can literally tell everybody hates working at this place.

It took the server (not the Debbie Downer yay!) about 10 minutes from the time we sat at our table to even greet us and ask if we wanted anything to drink. Time it out. The next time you go to a restaurant see how long 10 minutes really is for the initial greeting. I gave him the benefit of the doubt though...it was busy on a Friday night.

 I asked the server if they had alcoholic lemonades. He thought for a second and then said \"no, we don't.\" But suggested the \"Electric Lemonade\" some blue drink so I got that. ....I later opened up the drink menu to find a whole page titled \"LEMONADES\"  lol yeah I should have looked cuz I definitely had the time but.....maybe he was new. Gave him the benefit of the doubt.

We ordered the beef cheese dip for an appetizer and it was pretty tasteless. I only ate the cheese part, but there was barely any beef on it, and the cheese tasted really artificial. 

We all know we don't come to Friday's to eat healthy, but if we're going to be fat kids, the food should be worth the calories. Just saying.

I ordered the Salmon with langostino lobster on top. ..... I observe Lent so no meat on Fridays...the only reason I ordered salmon at Fridays - let's be real. The langostino was GROSSSS clearly had been defrosted and not prepared properly. it was just mushy and weird. The salmon was decent...clearly frozen salmon. The menu stated it came with a garlic alfredo sauce... yeah it definitely didn't come with that. It was some weird brown sauce with mushrooms that was not even enough to eat each bite of salmon with. Got the mashed potatoes...which tasted more like butter than anything else, and the garlic parmesan steak fries were gross. They were shiny with oil and it pooled at the bottom of the dish. That's not ok. They were clearly coated with some artificial garlic sauce or whatever that made it taste more tart than anything which was really awkward, and the 10 little pieces of shredded parmesan that actually made it on to the fries had no taste.


I don't expect miraculous food at Friday's but on a Friday night during peak hours, I expected better than what we got. I would not come back here if it were my choice."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here after a movie. Walked in the front door and the place was nearly empty (3:00pm Mother's Day!)
We were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated! Honestly, the place was half full and plenty of tables were available. 
We asked if we could sit at a small table in the bar area (which was TOTALLY empty) and were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.
A little puzzled, we asked about getting food while sitting at the bar. Hostess told us that would be fine.
We decided to leave. Before we left I asked the Hostess , \"Why the wait? The restaurant is half full?\" 
Her response was, \"Because my kitchen is backed up\". I said, \"Wait, we can get food without a wait if we sit at the bar, but the kitchen is backed up and you are half full.\" This does not make sense?\" She just got mad so we left. Went to Sammy's Pizza in the same area, great food, great service, even a glass of champagne for Mother's Day. We called the manager of TGIF from the restaurant and asked her about the \"wait\". She told us there was no wait and no back up in the kitchen.
\"You need to let the hostess know there is no wait\". Manager did not really care.
This place should be packed on Mother's Day-every other eatery on Sunset was packed.
This TGIF's is on its way to closing unless the owner gets a grip on his staff. ..Call in the Restaurant Recovery program! This staff is killing what should be a successful franchise!"}
{"text":"Tried it twice and shame on me the second time. Both times I was there with a friend/friends for Happy Hour. The bar was not crowded either time and the service was still terrible. Our wings were overdone and the bread on the sliders was stale. The real turnoff was the bartenders setting drinks out for the waitstaff and putting the sales slip on top of the glasses.  Can you say nasty??  I have had good experiences in other Fridays here in the Burgh as well as in other cities and will continue to visit others. Just not this one ever again."}
{"text":"Great server, she was very attentive. The food was very good here. We had the green bean appetizers and chicken club sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Looking over these reviews I am so surprised at so much negativity. Besides the amazing appetizers, I absolutely love their ribs, burgers, and salmon! The french onion soup is also a must have. Seriously, besides maybe boneyard, I haven't been able to find ribs that I enjoy more anywhere else. The staff is great and so friendly. Catie is one of the best bartenders and servers there. She is so sweet and always so accommodating. We have never had a bad experience here! Make sure you get a seat when they do the bar tending competitions! It's very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or energy and be prepared to have bad service and questionable clean/safe food and drinks. Take it from a local and try McMullans   restaurant/bar across the street for dinner and drinks instead!"}
{"text":"TGI Friday's is not the most exciting place to go to, but it had the right price for us and we shared 2 plates that filled us up.

I ordered a shrimp and chicken alfredo pasta and shared it with my boyfriend who ordered a sampler plate. They both tasted good. We also had a blue raspberry iced drink that was still syrupy even after we mixed it.

The environment isn't very appealing, and for some reason I felt like our waiter didn't really want to serve us, or wasn't paying attention to us when we spoke to him.

Oh well, not a memorable experience."}
{"text":"TGI Friday's currently has a share and taste menu featuring dishes that are some what similar to tapas in concept.  This is good, because you can get allot of variety at a reasonable price for two people.  

Buried within this menu is the ahi tuna crisps. The picture in the menu shows generous slices of sushi style ahi tuna, on with a touch of guacamole. and some jalapeños garnishing... What you get is a wafer thin slice of tuna under a melon ball worth of guac and a jalepeño.  Upon eating your tongue doesn't even hear a rumor of tuna taste. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Go here all the time for the Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp. Service is usually a 20 min wait but worth it. Good tip is to take a light jacket or sweater. Always seems to be cold."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and has crappy service. They try and get over on large groups with a service charge that is 2x higher than the normal 18% tip for 8 or more guests...."}
{"text":"Bad service we waited for 20 minutes for someone to attend our order but no one paid attention to us despite the fact that the restaurant was empty! We left"}
{"text":"Great location and staff.  We enjoy our times there.
Ask for the check (and another round) just as the food comes out.   Save ya about 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite TGIF location. The main reason is the service. Michelle H. Is my bartender for life. She is so nice and pleasant to be around with, The appetizers are great and the rest of the staff is super friendly. I personally like the onion rings, they are cooked perfectly all the time. Fridays !!!!! I love this location."}
{"text":"Only giving it 1 star because I can't give it zero. Horribly dirty and really poor service. We had to ask another server to get our kid's drinks. Our server then came by 10 minutes later and said she would grab them! We told her we didn't need them anymore. Never dine here!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and service is quick. The Jack Daniels glaze is awesome and is one of my favorite marinades. Friday's has awesome happy hour deals. The only negative thing today was the pretzel appetizer was a little over cooked."}
{"text":"I usually get great service back home. So I expected the same when I was on vacation with the family. We decided to go to Friday's on our last day in Vegas for the appetizers and to avoid the crowds. We were a party of eight so I expected a long wait. When I arrived the \"greeter\" didn't greet us. She just said \"How many?\" She immediately said \"It's gonna be a while\" but didn't say how long. She looked stressed so I didn't follow up. My wife then asked and she told her 30-45 min. When we were finally seated they gave us a table in the back which was empty. We were sitting for ten minutes before we grabbed a hostess and asked her for an appetizer menu. She said she would get one for us but never appeared again. The waitress finally came and we still hadn't even been served water. I asked for water for everyone and she disappeared for another 5-10 min. She came back with the waters and took our orders. We waited another 10 minutes for our drink orders to arrive and 40 minutes for our food. When the drinks arrived one of the drinks was wrong. My son had to wait another 15 min for his Arnold Palmer. A few of our meals were endless appetizers but because of our poor service we put in a refill on the appetizer order and that took an additional 25 min to get. Overall I'm dissatisfied with the service. The food was great but because of the service I didn't enjoy it at all."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time today at Friday's. Jazzy was our server in the bar area. She was pretty badass. She kept our drinks full and made sure we were well taken care of. Plus she cracked us up. She was out favorite person we've met in Charlotte. Being out of towers, we get a lot of haters, but we felt right at home. Thanks for a great experience jazzy."}
{"text":"Once a month I bring a friend to this restaurant for lunch. We usually sit at Bridget's table. Bridget is always amazing. She's always friendly and upbeat. She is also knowledgeable, polite, and professional. She comes to the table to take our drink order soon after we sit down. After she takes our food order she comes back frequently to make sure everything is ok and to see if we need anything. We never have to hunt her down or wait a long time for her to return, which is nice. When a coworker needs help, she says we're a team and is always willing to help. Most importantly she's nice to my friend. My friend has down syndrome. Whenever I take him out to eat, most waiters/waitresses totally ignore him. Bridget does not. Bridget talks to him, is patient with him, and treats him with respect and as a human being. I keep coming back (with my friend) mostly because of the positive experience Bridget creates. The food comes out quickly. It's always good, never over cooked or undercooked. It's seasoned just right. The portions are good size. There's a lot of different foods on the menu, so everyone can find what they like. The place is always clean. It also doesn't hurt that we can walk football (or whatever sport) while we eat. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I'm full. Terrible service. Rude waiters and bartenders. I think racism might play a part in that. Waited 24 minutes after finishing my meal to get the check. Have had better service. Great steak and shrimp though. They probably did something to it but I don't care it was finger licking good. Bartender referred to our waitress as \" the little mexican\" ,she later then confirmed she is mexican."}
{"text":"Standard service. My jack Daniels burger was served on a some kind of flat board instead of a plate, that was interesting. Good was good but it took a while to get my food, like almost 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times over the yrs. The visit I made on my birthday Jan 2016, was the absolute worst.  From the time we walked in, we waited about 5 mins for a host to come seat us. He asked if we wanted a table. When we requested a booth it seemed to irritate him. After getting to the table, it took another 10 mins or so for a waitress to assist us. She took the drink order, and the drink my wife ordered came AFTER she was done with her meal. This after they brought her the absolute wrong order. Then it was loud, due to people, and the bartenders.  To end it all the waitress, took a cash tip, and over charged my girl's card  an extra $10, which we found out the next day. Waiting on a call back from the manager till this day. No call back=no going back."}

At the end of meal the wait staff came and sang Happy Birthday to a very surprised little girl :) Didn't have room left for all the ice cream, loved the attention"}
{"text":"I went an ate here for my lunch and the food was good but the service was really slow. The worst part of all is I saw the manger grab a piece of cake with her bare hands and stick it on a glass and go serve it to the customer. Then I saw a different employee grab a different ready to eat food with her bare hands and give it to another customer."}
{"text":"Only came here because the kids needed something simple to eat. (Rokne's was closed.) 

We asked if we could do plain noodles & meatballs and they said yes. It ended up costing $18.50 for that ONE kids meal (Plain spaghetti, no sauce, & 3 meatballs. They said they had to combine 2 adult meals to do it).  Wow. 

The other kids meal was fine... $5 for a plain hamburger w/ a side oranges. And both kids had unlimited lemonade with the purchase of  the first glass, which was great

My breaded Fridays shrimp were barely edible. I only ate them because I was starving. 

The server was very friendly which was the upside. 

Sorry thank god it's Fridays.... I'm praying to god I never have to visit you again.

Service: Incredibly unprofessional server. He complained to us about how the day was going.  He took forever to get us drinks. There were 4 of us. He brought out 3 waters and realized his mistake but then it was another 10 minutes before we received the final water. My friend ordered a soup and fries and requested it be brought out together. That did not happen. My other friend ordered her second drink and just never received it. That drink was also put on her bill despite her never receiving it and that was another problem with the bill. I've also never been asked to hand over all dirty plates to him directly and have to grab all my food and drinks out of his hands. That was a first. We ask for the checks and for our 30%discount to be applied because of where we work. He told us no it's 20%. 15 minutes later we get our checks with no discount. He blames his manager goes back and 10 minutes later we get it back with 5% discount. We give him our cards, and he brings everything back. And he charged my food to my friends card. And 2 of my friends meals to my card. At that point we were so annoyed and already so late for our movie we just leave. 
Food: Chicken was really dry. Artichoke dip was dry. Everything else was bland."}
{"text":"I will give this place the worst possible rating I can due to management. The food was good, the price was a little too high though, the waitress was great, but the manager who I think his name was Paul on Monday night about 3 weeks ago was an absolute jerk! The staff obviously hated him and even said poor things about his personality. Watched him yell at a waitress over a ridiculous matter. We eat out all the time and are close to this location but will never come here again or any tgif's if they have managers like that. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Advice to Service Manager: Don't put new-hires alone on a Saturday night shift
Advise to New-hire server:  Don't blame the kitchen and bar for your incompetence


We arrived on a Saturday night and were seated right away.  We didn't wait too long for initial server visit, and I could tell by her fumbling through notes that she was probably new.  When she couldn't tell me what the seasonal draft was, but quickly told me that they only had bottles, I should have asked for another table.  We ordered our appetizer and boys' food first, then our entrees.  

The food came out in a timely manner, but then we didn't see the waitress for a while.  We were all hoping for a refill and I kept looking around, but never saw her even walking near the registers.  All the other wait staff were moving around, checking on tables, but ten minutes goes by before even see her, and had to flag her down.  

I asked for refills on sodas and water, and for a draft of another brew, then another ten minutes goes by before she returns with refills and news that all the draft beers were back in bottles.  

What? 

\"They don't have any more drafts.\"  Fine, another bottle.  Still no entrees.  Five minutes later she returns with a bottle, puts it on the table, walks on.  We have empty plates and cups sitting on the edge of the table, and start looking around for her again.  No sign.  

Finally, after flagging her down again and ASKING about our food, she goes into the back, then comes out and tells us that our food has been delivered to another table, and would we like the kitchen to start plates for us to eat in or take-out. 

 Blank stare.  

I asked if the kitchen almost had ours ready since there was a mix-up.  No, she says, she has to tell them if we are taking it out. I ask \"What did the manager on duty say?\"  She said \"He's in the kitchen.\"  Blood begins to boil: \"We will Not be eating in OR take-out, please just give us our check.\"  Comes back a few minutes later, bill is $49+ and she walks off.  I look over the ticket: double charged for drinks, charged for draft brews that apparently didn't even exist, and No response from the manager.  

I ask the nearest server if she could could kindly summon the manager for me.  He was out in less than a minute, very courteous, and asks what is wrong.  I explain, in this much detail, what had happened.  He informs me that he has no knowledge of any misdirected food NOR has he taken anything off our ticket.  He then took the ticket and cleared it out except for the two bottles of re-bottled draft.  I left a minimal gratuity based on charged beverages alone; I hate being lied to.

Will not be returning to this location. We MAY try another franchise, but with so many other restaurants that actually TRY, why should I bother?  The chain as a whole has lowered standards too much to be taken seriously as a restaurant.  They are pretty much a bar with extra tables nowadays."}

That all changed this evening when I came to the realization that I'veI had it all wrong all these years.  Thank God It's Fridays was a cute concept, but from this day forward those 4 letters strung together will stand for \"This Guy is Full.\"  The spread the wonderful folks at Friday's laid out in front of me for supper this evening led me to conclusion, and I can't thank them enough for showing me the light.  Turkey Avocado BLT, need I say more?  Probably not, but I will anyways.  Upon my first bite a bold check mark was immediately placed in the box next to each of the 3 S's i'm looking for in every and any dining experience.  Scrumptious, check. Succulent, check. Special, yep you guessed it, check.  I love a good BLT, and usually order one when I'm hungry but not starving.  Just looking for a little something to wet my beak not stuff my gullet.  What the visionaries behind the scenes at Friday's have achieved with this creation accomplishes both.  If you're looking for a sure thing, this is as sure as they come.  Don't believe, that's your choice.  Be unhappy, and believe what you want. I mean there are people who are still convinced the earth is flat.  The only reason for a lack of the 5th star is that service was not up to par with the standard I have come to expect from Friday's.  Since it was a busy Saturday night and they provided not only this delectable treat but unmatched conversation and atmosphere, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.  Friday's keep up the good work, and rest easy tonight knowing that you're exceptional culinary work has opened up the mind of at least one royal patron to question everything they thought they knew about the 4 simple letters T.G.I.F."}
{"text":"My family and I were going to watch a movie at the Orleans, We decided to stop here at TGIF Friday's to have dinner as soon we sat down our server was Nady she's friendly and nice took our order.Our food didn't take that long , I ordered their steak and lobster special, My husband ordered Jack Daniel
Chicken,and Mac and cheese for my baby.Food was good ,Excellent service.Would be coming back here again."}
{"text":"It has been couple of years since I have been to a Friday's. Either my taste got much better with age, or this chain just really stopped trying. The unsweet tea was loaded with sugar. The pretzel appetizer was a frozen roll that was microwaved for couple of minutes. The sliders were so hard, my son lost his wiggly tooth and it actually made a knocking sound when it was dropped on the table. The water with lemon, however, was excellent. The kids meal hamburgers are sliders. My daughter  could  not eat her burnt slider so we asked for a regular  burger that came back burnt as well. That's what you get for going to a Friday's on  Wednesday. Something tells me the day of the week  would not make a difference."}
{"text":"So I was not expecting a 5 star meal and I was so darn HUNGRY that pretty much anything sounded delicious but what I got when I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp was just sad. I rarely leave half my food on the plate even when I am not famished but I just couldn't bring myself to knaw on another bite. The picture in the menu showed two juicy chicken breast filets smothered in garlic and sauce resting on sautéed peppers and melted cheese nestled next to plump shrimp with seasonings and a side of creamy mashed potatoes. What I got was two flat white oblong discs with no seasoning, dry shrimp and two lumps of mashed potatoes that looked like they were right out of an ice cream scoop. Did I mention that there was no sizzle? Nothing, the plate was warm but just enough to keep the cheese from congealing.  The sautéed peppers were ok but the cheese was barely melted and you could plainly see it was a square of processed orange cheese product, not even shredded. I was running on less than 4 hrs sleep in a 48 hr period and a couple of granola bars and just wanted to get some real food and go to bed but I guess I will have to wait on the real food part for another restaurant. On a side note, the brownie a la mode was pretty good."}
{"text":"With tickets to the Penguins vs. Coyotes game on leap day, the Consol Center website suggested many restaurants nearby, we saw how conveniently located the TGI Friday's was to the game and made the decision to have dinner and drinks after the game.

Upon entering, there were two young women at the door and at first glance did not appear to be hostesses or waitresses at all because of their body language. One was sitting slouched on the bench where you wait for your table to be ready, and the other had her head resting on two fists on the podium. The hostess with her head still in her fists asked us if we would like to have a table or sit at the bar? We point towards the bar because we immediately knew the service would not be great and headed that way.

We get to the bar and sit down and many minutes pass by with no acknowledgment and then a quick sigh of relief as an employee dressed in black approaches the taps to fill a beer just as two older gentleman or sat next to us ready for a drink with money down on the table, and he said to them, \"I'm not the bartender, I'm just helping out.\"

We walked straight back out the door.

I just walked out of the Consol Energy Center were a record turnout Pittsburgh Penguins game of over 18,000 people in attendance (standing room only) and just unbelievable what we experienced, and it was still an hour and a half until closing. Perhaps it was why there was surprisingly hardly any customers which made us make the choice of going in, before the crowds we thought.

I'm pretty sure a lot of research went into the investment of this store location and to be managed poorly, with almost zero customer service does no good to waste advertising dollars to promote the business and get people in the door. To be fair I've been to other TGI Friday's chain locations around the country and never had such an experience."}
{"text":"My gal friends and I went to TGI Fridays today to get together and have a GNO even though it was early. We had a blast. We ate, talked, drank and laughed a lot. The waiter we had was a good sport and kept it entertaining for us. He made a few suggestions and took the time to explain everything that the margaritas were made of, what was in the dishes that we had, and a few of the desserts that were good choices. So I had this one margarita that he said was the best.. I was called the Ultimate Margarita Platinum...it was DELICIOUS. It was kinda strong, but after a little while, I was good to finish it. As we sat chatting and drinking our margaritas, our food came. I had the Dragonfire Chicken.  A fire-grilled breast glazed with Chinese Kung Pao sauce, served over slow cooked coconut jasmine rice with pineapple pico de gallo, Mandarin oranges and fresh steamed broccoli. Shortly after that, I had a Strawberry Shortcake Icecream. Man I am full. When I go back, I think I will be getting this again. I was really amazed with the customer service that the waiter provided.."}
{"text":"We were staying at Sam's Town in Las Vegas, and there is a TGIFridays inside. 4 of us went to dinner there. We waited 10 minutes till the waitress showed up! She took our order and our food showed up 25 mins later!! All of us got cold food! My husband ordered the nachos grande, and was very disappointed.  We were all waiting to order desert, when the waitress came dropped off our check and left! Would I go back? NEVER! Very very dissatisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were at the Orleans for a dance/cheer competition the weekend of February 17, 2017.  Bryan, the manager of this restaurant, and his staff went above and beyond to accommodate the many large groups that were trying to eat during that busy weekend.  Our group originally was supposed to be 30 people, then grew unexpectedly to over 50 people.  Bryan and his staff handled this situation beautifully and accommodated everyone so they could sit in the same room.  I know we were a very difficult group, and I appreciate the efforts of Bryan and his staff for dealing with us.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Although the location and servers are great THE GENERAL MANAGER: Maneira, is terrible! She completely destroyed my eating experience to the point to where I could not enjoy my food. All my father and I could do was talk about how bad the experience was. I asked my waiter to speak with her being that I seen her the previous night I was there which they forgot to put points on my account and she refused to come to my table (not a surprise because the night before my Fiancé and I waited 30 minutes for her to come to our table to redeem our free dessert coupon but she never came so our waiter eventually just went ahead and did it). Soon after our waiter attempted to get her, I seen her blatantly stand near the kitchen and watch him take our order clearly staring with the meanest look on her face. Eventually I stopped her as she walked past my table to ask about my points which she was not personable, extremely rude and not helpful AT ALL. You would think with her knowing I'm a repetitive customer she would show some sort of customer service. Instead of just saying \"I'm the general manager\" as if her title made any difference, if anything it made it worst! She provided no solution and as an Executive myself I was extremely blown away at how someone can treat there customers. I can only imagine how she treats her employees! Simply a bad representation for TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"Gone here many times in the past and had no problems in the past. We have even had numerous company meetings there. Now under new management and new staff, they are very rude and slow. We left without even ordering our first drink or food. Management is horrible!! I do not recommend at all!!"}
{"text":"I am i person who loves tgi Fridays. I tried this location for the first time. I am happy to say I'll never be back to this one again. I got the potato skins which they are fried ! It tasted like old oil and was just overall bad. We told the server she said she would let a manager know. The entree was decent nothing to go on about really. Most of the time watched some guy winning at this lord of the rings machine. I will not be coming back to this tgi Fridays though"}
{"text":"This is probably the go to place for a hangout eat or just a late night grab... came in with a good size group of friends at 8pm. Most of our group had the endless apps , a go to choice by many. I had the steak and lobster with two sides... Their food was prompt and accurate; however, my order took 41 minutes. Not only was everyone else on their 4th appetizer by the time I received my food, it was not cooked as ordered. My fries were soggy with blood,  and the lobster tail was grilled from the outer layer and raw underneath. After bringing it up to the waiter's attention he just said he would take it back without any acknowledgment to the mistake or wait time.  Decided to bring it up the manager,PAUL,for constructive criticism and before I finished explaining everything he interrupted with \"the appetizers take a while\" . .. I don't know where he usually dines at or how long he's been in customer service but that's unacceptable. There is no way you can tell me that you'll serve the whole table until they can't eat anymore before putting in my order. I'm a paying customer, I shouldn't have to wait for the fourth round of endless apps to get my order. Another tip, before you give a customer a ridiculous excuse.... it wouldn't kill you to address the issue and apologize for the inconvenience. Just $25 down the drain, if you're considering TGIF just make sure you're not hungry if you're ordering anything that doesn't fall under endless apps."}

{"text":"Have had a couple not so great experiences at this restaurant a few months ago, but since it is so close to home, I decided to give it another chance. I am so glad we did because our last three experiences were wonderful! We usually sit in the bar area and I must say that the bar staff is the reason we keep coming back! The service is always friendly and efficient regardless of how packed the section is, and sometimes every table and bar stool is filled. The food has been much better and twice now I have gotten a perfectly medium burger as I ordered. I've found it extremely difficult to get a good cook on a burger at most chain restaurants, but last week I ordered the New York Bacon Cheese Burger and it was perfectly cooked and really delicious. They have a good selection of drinks at reasonable prices that is matched in quality with the service! We will be back to this locations often and telling others about our great experience!"}
{"text":"Been craving beer and spinach dip so decided to stop by during happy hour and sit at the bar. The bartender was attentive and professional which is important to me. She remained busy the whole time I was there but still made sure I was takin care of and my drink wasn't empty very long. Kudos to her for a great job. Nowadays reviews can make or break a place so whenever I have a good or bad experience  I make sure to jump on yelp."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad but they didn't bring the dressing out. I told the waiter however I had to wait 10 minutes for the dressing. I finally got the dressing and began eating. Everything tasted great however the service lacked again when me and my wife ran out of drink. The waiter brought my wife a refill but not me so we shared that. The waiter just wasn't friendly nor did he ever apologize. I'm torn because the food is always great but the service always seem to be lacking."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family which was not bad till I get home and check my charges on my card. Had 4 different charges. The one charge that was close to my total was because my waiter decided to add his own tip to my bill after I closed my  receipt with the total (because I left the tip in cash)...It's been 6 days and still waiting to hear from a manager regarding the other 3 charges. I keep getting told they have to wait... Never, ever again will I go back here again!"}
{"text":"The hostess yawned about 5 times while taking our name and on our way back from the restroom while waiting to be seated, I saw at least 8 tables open and no one getting seated. Not a good start so we left and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"this is a fun place to have dinner with your loved one or with friends. Food is good, and service is always friendly. I dont crave it very often though, its not very different from an applebees or chilis per say, but its a nice place."}
{"text":"I hated Friday's..... Until yesterday. The food was great or should I say amazing. The drinks came in a timely manner . What actually made our dinner though was our server Bailey. She was great. Typically I hate this place because it just doesn't have the menu or the service I expect however she truly made the experience the way a Friday's experience should be. My steak (yes I ordered a steak) was cooked perfectly... My daughter loved her food just as much. I just want to say YES! Finally a good experience from this chain! We will all be coming back again! Thank you Friday's!"}
{"text":"Bar has worst service ever If your going to place an order to go get ready to wait 10 minutes on hold today is the third day in a row"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! We were sitting for 40 minutes with no update on our food or appetizer. This was our 3rd time we tired this TGIF's with horrendous service and terrible food. Wow!!! 
Going to try the Bickiwick next door next time at the Orleans."}
{"text":"Food was great and waitress was so helpful with helping us pick something great! Definitely would go here again and food was delivered much faster than other places!"}
{"text":"Just drove 26 miles to location 2180 in Aliante casino Las Vegas and we were told their franchised and do not honor the endless app deal. It's bs that this is the only location I go to , I get an email as a rewards member and will never go back here. The manager let 4 people walk out over not honoring it ... So now, I will make sure everyone knows this location is FRANCHISED so they don't follow any specials you see or get emails about. ... I will never step foot in here again. Funny thing is that it's all over their Facebook page... Endless apps. Telling everyone!!"}
{"text":"Walking in the door is got a serious attitude from the hostess. We sat for a good 15 minutes before the server showed up, again with an attitude.  I asked for potato skins with half without Bacon. She told me no. Funny how the fridays close to home has no problem. Can't wait to see how bad the rest of our experience will be"}
{"text":"10/27. TERRIBLE. My husband and I went here for dinner having not been in a few years, I will still expecting a good meal and drinks. Drinks? They were great. Food? RUN RUN RUN! First off-site our potato skins were burnt, and severally lacking. Harley any cheese, bacon, and no green onions. The ones you buy in a grocery store are actually better than what we had here. 

Here's where it for really bad. I ordered their cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. It looked amazing, however the very first bite I must have apparently made an obvious fave because my husband instantly knew. 
It honestly tasted like the ocean it was so fishy. I was really like eating shrimp in, an ocean sauce. I don't know if I can eat shrimp again for a long time it was honestly that bad. The waitress took it off the check but it was terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered the Spicy Pub Cheese Burger with the jalapeños and not only was it overcooked (asked for \"pink\" I.e. medium) it was the biggest slop house of a burger I've ever eaten.  Couldn't even pick it up to eat.  A train wreck of a burger if I've ever eaten one.  Do yourselves a favor, folks.  AVOID CHAINS LIKE FRIDAY'S LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!  I've had better sandwiches at McDonald's.  At least they bothered to comp me a dessert and gave me a free app for next time.  Too bad I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We've always had great experiences at other TGIF's locations, but not this one!  You couldn't pay us to come back here.  Terrible service - had to ask mulitple times for everything.   Food took forever to come out and I can't believe the waitress thought it was ok to serve us that!  Cold fries, rubbery hard reheated chicken, just gross.  Couldn't eat it.  We are at Aliante every week and will eat anywhere else but TGIF.    Aliante; get rid of them and put something else in that space please."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. The waiter was kind of rude and short with me through out the entire dinner. In the end it was my fault, I thought the waiter was a guy. Oops."}
{"text":"This location has been declining on the food quality for several months (don't order the Mac and cheese or steak) but I keep coming back for the jack Daniels glaze... however I dined here on 12/29 and waited over 30 mins for chips and salsa that I had to ask a manger for, then nearly an hour for two burgers.. the server Jason seemed new and stretched too thin to service his tables.. I don't plan to come back to this location ever again. 

Update"}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner and although the food was good I don't think I'll ever go back because the service was that bad! I've worked in the restaurant industry my whole life especially serving, so I know that things happen that are beyond our control and sometimes your so busy that things get forgotten. However there is no reason we should have had to wait over ten min for drinks or ask for a side of ranch twice within a fifteen minute span only to have our waitress bring it over and slam it down annoyed for having to get it for us. We also had to ask her for the check and when she never brought it asked another server to bring it to us. Then we waited another fifteen minutes for her to bring the card back. It shouldn't take two hours to eat a meal here. Like I said I won't be back."}
{"text":"0 stars. Their happy hour (after 9 I think) appetizers are a good deal. Had the fish and chips - Mrs Paul's is probably better. Chicken finger dinner was nearly as bad.  2 apps, 2 bad dinners, a soda and one drink = $43 - $50 after tip for absolute junk. The manager's consolation was a free app coupon. Left it on the table. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service is good not to be confused with great, the happy hour specials are awesome draft beer for 3 bucks you cant go wrong , clam chowder is dismal , overall it is ok , waitress could have upsold the beers and explained all the specials a little more .."}
{"text":"Good prices, fast service. great option if you're hungry past 10 or want to eat before a movie at Sam's town. Desert menu is really good too. Try and sit by the bar instead of a table so you can take advantage of the happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Came for family nite specifically for the kid discount and they wouldn't comp a kids meals with the two for $20. The food has gone down hill as well, terrible all around (except the mozzarella sticks). My husband kindly talked to the manager about their refusal to honor the kid meal ad and she acted like she couldn't do anything, HA! We had even called ahead of time to be sure they still had the family night special. I worked at TGI for years as a server, what a crock. It's ridiculous that the management pulled that crap. Worst birthday dinner ever. I'm sad to say we would choose Denny's over this--never going back and neither should you."}
{"text":"So far disappointed. We ordered potato skins and they came out looking fried and a blob of cheese that tasted microwaved.nothing like they used to serve. So far terrible."}
{"text":"An update a year later. Went tonight for dinner. Was seated in the little room facing the road that's behind the greeter. Wow, it's loud in there. 

She again had the chicken bruschetta dish and liked it a lot. I had the classic cheeseburger and sides of mac and cheese and coleslaw. The coleslaw was very good, crisp and cold, not swimming in dressing and a very nice tang. 

The mac and cheese was an obvious re-heat because the top was crispy but under the canopy of crust there was small lumps of unmelted cheese and lukewarm pasta.  I think the burger was also reheated. It wasn't hot, just lukewarm, a little rubbery and on the dry side - like you get when reheating burgers. Service was attentive and friendly and prompt, no troubles there.  One less star than last time, perhaps if we go again I'll go back to the ribs."}
{"text":"Wife, kid, and myself arrived at 6:30pm. We expected a 30 minute wait. It was 60 minutes. I though I would try the $12 endless apps. Got the boneless chicken wings. Nothing special with them. Pretty typical for bar fare. I then ordered the potato skins. We waited for 25 minutes. My wife finished her meal then they brought them out. They were overlooked and lacked flavor. They tasted like they were frozen and not fresh. 

The waitress was very nice and provided good service."}
{"text":"Bad food and bad service. We started with the crispy brussel sprouts and pot stickers. The brussel sprouts were absolutely horrible. They were soaked in a sour tasting oil and I couldn't eat it. The pot stickers were undercooked and mushy. 

I ordered the half order of ribs and crispy shrimp. The ribs barely had any meat on them and what they did have was crunchy bits of meat. The shrimp were coated in some weird breading that tasted like flour. The side coleslaw was sour and again not eatable. The only good part of this meal was the baked potato. 

I had a Cape Cod as my well drink and it was served in a large glass and watered down. The service wasn't much better. We had to flag down the server three times to get refills. I would recommend skipping this TGI's as it's over priced with bad food and bad service."}
{"text":"It's not that the food was terrible but it wasn't great, either.  Salmon with langostino lobster had overlooked salmon; jack ribeye with shrimp scampi had overlooked shrimp and was way too salty; while the steak would have been good except for being overdone."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago with a coworker since I had an Entertainment coupon for buy one get one free lunch.  We both ended up having unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks.  Food was great, service was great, management came by to chat and was really friendly.  
Cheap, good food and plenty to eat....super combo."}
{"text":"I guess In 2016 it's reasonable somehow that I could speak to two employees at the greeting kiosk at Friday's via phone while attempting to place a
Simple pick up order and nether employee has any idea of the items on their own menu. This went on for over ten minutes.  

Despite calling the item by the exact name it appears by in the menu, despite ordering it at the same location earlier that day, despite telling them what page on the menu the item was in, I actually had to walk in and place my order In Person because of the incompetent phone staff. I approached the two \"staff\" and they had the menu open In front of them to the page the item I tried to order was on. 

I asked them if they were the two employees who couldn't find this(showing them the item) and they explained that the menu has so many pages that they don't really know what's on the menu. (Really???)


Ridiculous that two employees and ten minutes of my time plus an onsite visit was needed in order to place an order for a menu item dinner entree.


Ridiculous.

Update despite all of the above I was given wrong food."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came to TGI with our toddler for appetizers and some margaritas, yummy! 
We came on a Tuesday so we were expecting it to be slow and would get our food quick, not ! 
Every app we received was cold except for the mozzarella sticks, and there was a long wait in between ordering our apps and receiving them. We weren't in a hurry but we didn't understand why everything took so long I come out. Love the endless apps though, great option $10 to eat till you can't no more."}
{"text":"Having eaten at many Friday's around the country, this one has the best decor I have seen.  Most Friday's seem to go overboard with the memorabilia.  The mural on the wall is great link to the community.  I need that artist to come paint something similar in my son's room.
As for the service, they were very busy for a Friday night.  But with so many tables, my wife, 2-year-old son and I were seated within 10 minutes of check-in.  The hostesses were very friendly and even talked to my son.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us regularly.  However, other waitresses did seem frazzled and lost.  We had one stop by our table to ask to see the kids' menu.
Our appetizer (chips and salsa) came out quickly with very fresh chips.  Shortly after the chips were gone, our food arrived and was very good.  My only complaint is my steak (ordered medium-rare) was slightly overdone but not to the point requiring it to be sent back.
Overall, it was a great experience and we'll return soon.  Now they need to bring back the fried mac 'n cheese  and cherry limeade slushes."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a TGIF in a while.  This one is weak. The service was weak and the Blue Moon beer on draft clearly was past its freshness date.  Same for the Yuengling on draft.  And no drink prices on the menu.  And what's with a 14 ounce \"pint\"?  The menu said to ask the server about local beers but she didn't have any knowledge that they had any.  I guess I am not doing Friday's again unless, like tonight, its the only apparent choice.

Oh, and what is with Fox News?  I don't mind news on a TV (but prefer not), but let's not have partisan channels, either from the right as with Fox or from the left such as MSNBC."}

{"text":"Orlando our waiter was awesome.  Fantastic customer service and his recommendations were spot on.  My boneless chicken wings with Jack Daniels sauce were delicious and a bonus for $6 during happy hour. Would definitely recommend it and return"}
{"text":"Yum, love the menu here. The hot pretzels with beer-cheese dip are excellent. For lunch or dinner the service here is always good. The menu seems to regularly evolve and it's fun to try something different every time you visit."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place yesterday as a family get together..  food was alright I got the turkey burger it's was pretty good love there sweet potatoes fry my wife had jack Daniels chicken she didn't not like the chicken it had a rubbery texture.. really nice place to dine..  the reason I gave it 2 starts was because our server had a little attitude going on..  didn't appreciate that.. overall ok.."}
{"text":"Hopeless - dirty restaurant, slow and sloppy service, drinks took forever to come, food longer. Don't go there! And when I submitted a complaint of an unsatisfactory experience, they did nothing."}
{"text":"Service here depends on who you get as a server.The manager ended up comping our entire meal because the service stunk.He also ended up comping several other tables that our server had."}
{"text":"I love coming to TGI Fridays!!  A fun thing that me and my husband do is, invite another couple and go sit in the bar during happy hour!  We don't drink, but we all order appetizers, usually 4 or 5 is plenty, because it's half price!  Happy Hour is from 3pm to 7pm every day!!  Last night we ordered the nacho grande, buffalo bone in wings, sesame jack chicken strips, the giant onion rings and philly cheesesteak egg rolls.  Plus we got free chips and salsa, because I'm a rewards member!  You get chips and salsa FREE EVERY TIME you come in!!    The nacho grande is always good!  The portion is a little small for the full price, but at half price, it's worth it!!  The men loved the wings and my husband is s but of a snob!!  The sesame jack chicken strips are always a fav!  The giant onion rings were crispy and delicious!  I didn't love the dipping sauce, but used ketchup instead.  The big disappointment was the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls!  They lacked flavor and I couldn't find the meat.  The cheese sauce was ok, but not great!  
On a side note, we are about 50/50 on whether the server actually brings us our free chips and salsa.  If they do bring them, it's usually with our meal instead of before, which kind of defeats the purpose!!  But they typically keep our drinks full!"}
{"text":"I never like leaving one star but I truly feel like this place was avoiding me and my friends on purpose. 

When we walked in the
 server/ bartender was bringing food to another guest and we sat down he immediately let us know that they ran out of food in the kitchen so now it was closed, we thought it  was odd seeing that it was only 12:30 am and we read the sign outside the restaurant letting us know that it was opened 24 hours and food til 5:00am (when reiterated by the server). 

Then I asked for the managers name and number and the staff seemed weird about giving it to me then a female manager came out and let us know there was a maintenance issue with the kitchen which was OPPOSITE of what the server/bartender said!!! 


The general manger 
Paul McClellan needs to get it together I'm in the service industry and this place needs better customer service!!"}

It was a Sunday and my Godson's First Communion Day.  So we came here after Church.
We were greeted right by a wonderful man, who right away acknowledged my Godson as to his First Communion.  ( he could tell from the Outfit).
Our Server was incredible! His name was Seth. Seth made sure we had an incredible time and we did.
Our drinks were brought out immediately and he explained all the questions that my sister had about the menu.  
He made a fuss of Caleb(The Boy's special day)
Our food was amazing!! Friday's has really changed it up.
We started with appetizers.  We had Fried Green beans, Boneless Chicken wings, and Potato skins.  They were all incredible.
I had for the dinner, Salmon with Langustos, and the rest of the family had Steak, shrimp and Ribs. They all said they were fantastic!
Our wonderful server Seth even got Caleb any dessert of his choice. We all got a dessert and they were Great! We had a wonderful time and the Food , the service, and the atmosphere were lovely.
Even the restrooms were clean and lots of parking."}
{"text":"My bf, sister and I came to eat, late night, on Thursday 11/13. Gabriel was outstanding and the service was, over all, phenomenal. He promptly guided us through the entire happy hour menu, and suggested some of his favorites. Since he was unable to accept our cash tip, I decided to give a shout out for his excellent service. Will definitely be back! Thank you so much for the great hospitality."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour and I can say it's a legit happy hour. The appetizers are 6 dollars and beers are from 4-6. I had a sam Adams and a bbq flatbread. The only complaint Is the pizza had a lot
Of cilantro and a small amount of chicken. The taste was good and for 6 dollars it was ok. 
Ill come back again to try the other appetizers"}
{"text":"Was there yesterday. Ordered 3 appetizers and a drink. the food and the drink was good. The Hispanic/Latina/Mexican waitress needs help with her English and especially her customer service skills. We used a digital coupon. She looked confused and had to consult a manager. Manager came over handled coupon issue. Bill was 31.77 after coupon.  

We threw $40 down. She wanted to know if we wanted change. Even though we told her to keep it, as it will be our \"never come back to this place again FEE\" 


*(opinion only)*  to us she felt like she didn't wanna be there and encourage us to come back."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain.  And I try to avoid chains, when I can.  We had a gift card that needed to use.

I can't ignore how good my most recent experience was.

We had ordered several items from here recently.  The Korean Steak tacos were fantastic --- spicy, fresh, different from what's available in nearby places. They weren't as good as Edgar's in the strip, or Pgh Taco Truck but they were close.  Pretty darn good for a chain!

Other standard items like buffalo chicken tenders, a strawberry salad, cobb salad were also good.  The cobb salad has been \"updated\" and isn't as good as it used to be here.

This location is constantly busy.  It's been this way for over 20 years.  I did notice that they've changed the menu recently, including adding new menu items."}
{"text":"Ewe. I guess I just need to come to terms with I'm just not rich enough to afford good food that won't make me sick. 
That or I just need to stay far away from anytg fried. Probably actually a little of both. 
Went tonite for the 2nd time of my life. 
I got the grean bean things and the pretzels. Not worth the money. I know they are trying this new \"gimmick\" $4 & $7 thing.....but it's just not worth it. If I had to guess, they probably pay about  $35 ish dollars for an entire case of the pretzels....so their money is made after about 7 or so orders. 
At 2 pretzels per order. ....which is very chinzy in my opinion... this place is just very cheap...

They need to clean their menus also. Gross@!!
So, the waiter was allright. Obviously he's wasn't going to make a big tip on our table with alcohol sales and dinners....and it showed.
 
But back to the food. 
Yuk. I got sick again. It's almost 5 am the same night--- been on the pot twice allredy. (Sorry for TMI)....
Like I said, I'm just not rich enough to afford the palette I have. 
I've just gotta stop giving these chains my money. 
When will I ever learn?? Well one thing is for sure, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My fault for not yelping this place before I ate here. THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE. if u go here -  have a drink and go somewhere else for dinner.  Service is excellent, food sucks!"}
{"text":"We like to go to Fridays on Mondays and get the two for one movie special. We went on July 4th and asked if they were doing the special, the waiter said yes they were doing it, so we ordered. Around a half hour later the manager came to our table and said that they were not going to honor the special. We said we would cancel our order. She then said they would honor it this time only and walked away. A few minutes later our waiter came over to our table and said\" I got shit for this, but you got the special\" I don't ever want to go back to Friday's."}
{"text":"I've been to Fridays from here to Maine and in most states down to Florida. Weirdly enough, they are NOT the same experience, as most chains are.

This one was one of those times. The worst Fridays we've eaten in is in Westchase, just north of Tampa. This will be the second worst, and it's unfortunate, because I really do like getting the deals on my Stripes card. 

The food wasn't bad. Well, the paid for food, anyway. The chips that come with the Stripes card were cold, wet (soggy from cold oil), and unsalted. The salsa was fairly bland, too.

I had a 6oz steak with lobster bites. The husband had a free Stripes meal of ribs. 

I had the steak fries with parmesan for the first time and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were tasty, and I enjoyed the sauce that came with the lobster bites.

The husband ate all his ribs and most of his fries, so I'm assuming he enjoyed his, too. He was just very put out by the wet chips.

Our biggest complaint was the server. She acted like we were the biggest pains in the you know what all because I asked her about the coupon I had brought to use, and if she needed my phone number to add my new points to my Stripes card, being that I don't have an actual card to give them. I'm sure they get stiffed on tips by people who don't account for the discounted meal, but for the attitude she had, we should have just stiffed her for that alone! Maybe we'll try another one in the area, or, if worse comes to worse, just go back to Youngstown and eat at that one there with the family. 

(P.S. We did tip her based on what the actual cost of food was, not the discounted amount, but she certainly didn't deserve it!!!)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come in and get a steak last night! As we all know they have one of the greatest steaks hands down! Plus the service at this place was amazing! No complains there! Very attentive and friendly! My server Erica was a doll! Very nice woman! Their piña colada smoothie was great too! Definitely will stop by this TGI when I'm back in town! Enjoyed my food and time there."}
{"text":"My BFF Sherrie and I went this past Friday 3.13.15 to celebrate her birthday. We initially sat on the bar side, but our waitress waited on some cute guys that came in AFTER we did.  So, we went to the dining area...WOW, what a difference!
Our server was the most excellent Daniel. He was very informative and provided OUTSTANDING customer service! 
Everyone was great! Jessie, Auntie Liz, Liz II and last but not least...Joe! 
We had Delicious Chocolate Martinis and took advantage of the endless appetizers... YUMMMM !!! 
We had pan-seared pork potstickers, sriracha boneless wings, Memphis barbecue boneless wings and barbecued chicken flatbreads. Very filling. Every item was delicious. 
We had a drink called \"Dark Sin\" made with Rumchata(which we had never tried). It was just what the doctor ordered! I recommend it highly!
We were surprised when they came out and sang the Birthday Song to Sherrie and gave her an ice cream sundae!
\"Service with a smile\" should to be their motto! Everyone was smiling and very cordial. 
I recommend TGI Fridays to EVERYONE, if you're looking for great food, great prices and OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Long wait tonight. Also my daughter and my food was completely burnt. I will never eat there again. Horrible service on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I really hate to write bad reviews but wow our experience here was bad...the staff were nice and food was decent but everything else was pretty bad...our 2 kids got their kids meals first within 10 minutes and it took forever...like half an hour to get our food. So the kids were just sitting there bored, they even had already cleaned out their dishes. We were so close to just canceling our order and paying for theirs since it was taking so long. It also took forever to get drink refills. I had to ask 2 different employees for silverware. Silverware like really shouldn't it already be on the table when we get there?? My mac and cheese got cold because of how long I had to wait for a fork. It was pretty busy but come on I've been in busier restaurants and had better service."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Manager looked sloppy and when he spoke seemed uneducated. The service was worst than horrible. Was not busy for a Friday yet the waitress seemed to always come up short. We had to ask for refills. Ordered the rib eye medium rare and it came to the table dry and over cooked. Upon the arrival of the food I could tell my steak was over cooked so I immediately cut into it to show the waitress. She then took it back and disappeared.  My boyfriend had to make eye contact with her in order for her to come to our table. She was talking with another waitress or hostess.  15 mins  past and  y boyfriend was done with his food so I said if my steak is not ready cancel the
Order.  She quickly returned with a steal -completely RAW! She asked to take it back AGAIN, to which I responded no thank you.  To take a steak back more than once says a lot!  The manager on duty (I hope he was a supervisor) then came and asked if I wanted him to take it back and 'fire it up' to which I said no. I told him I dislike having to send food back especially since it was the 2nd time. I honestly doubt that if I sent it back it would have helped, it only would have pissed off the chef.  Basically we are NEVER coming back to this location and I would not want anyone to experience what I went through tonight. Come on TGI FRIDAY it's a Friday night in Las Vegas and that was your best? Pathetic."}
{"text":"Came here last night and sat in the bar area with a groups of girlfriends.  I understand it was a Friday night and busy but the wait to get my order for a drink and appetizer was ridiculous.  2 of my friends arrived earlier a little earlier in the evening and 3 of us arrived 15mins  before  \"happy hour\"  end.  Our waitress didn't even come by until happy hour ended (15-20mins after we sat down).  So we were a little disappointed we arrived in time and didn't get any of the benefits.  It took another 15 mins to get our drinks and appetizers.  Our waitress didn't come to check on us so needless to say we didn't get the chance to order another round of drinks before we left to go somewhere else.  Pros: drinks and food good.  Cons: service too slow!"}
{"text":"Food is good - nice selection and consistent quality.  The highlight of the night of our afternoon was Bryan, the bartender.  Witty, hilarious, and excellent drinks! Keep my drink refilled without even having to ask. My personal favorite is the electric lemonade...it will knock your socks off without tasting a drop of alcohol."}
{"text":"BLAND!!!  Cajun chicken and shrimp was just plain boring.  Cayenne and black pepper were the only flavors to the sauce.  Chicken was tasteless.  Wife had the chicken skewers.  The \"miso\" sauce tasted of too much soy and burned sugar.  It had absolutely no flavors you'd expect out of a Japanese sauce.  My daughter ordered the garlic chicken and shrimp... The cheese was processed nacho crap, and again the chicken had zero flavor.  The mashed potatoes had decent texture but were so dry!

Some of the big chain restaurants have made great strides to make better quality food.  Friday's still serves substandard crap with an expensive price tag."}
{"text":"Angelina the waiter was completely out of it, she didn't bring the order complete. She seemed to have an attitude as well. We asked for two separate checks from the beginning, so when it was time to pay, she brought one check. I asked her to get two checks and gave her two credit cards. So when She brought the cards and checks back to sign, each party signed and we left, but when I got home I found that she only charged both checks using my corporate card which now I have to explain to my company why I have two different charges from the same restaurant with two different amounts ... Can't be any dumber! If there is anything lower than 1 star, I would have put it."}
{"text":"A good place to have a beer or a casual dinner/lunch. The service is ok. Nice place to order a takeout though."}
{"text":"Greeted promptly at the door with a smile. Server (Lori) was enthusiastic and pleasant. She suggested I sign up for \"Stripes\" program - which I did. She was waiting on me, a three-top, two-top and a four-top and none of seemed to suffer for it. She delivered my food (JD chicken). It was hot and cooked well. Everything tastes as expected. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good service, but we thought the food and drinks were overpriced.
I had the steak and salmon which was $25. It was basically a strip of salmon and small steak with 2 sides. I had the broccoli and tomatoes. For $25 I would expect a larger piece of salmon. 
The waitress was nice and helpful. 
There were no beers in tap....whaaaaa? And a bottle of Heineken was $6!
Atmosphere was not very comfortable. 
I don't think we'll go there again."}
{"text":"Billing and Fraud

Overview.. The food order was wrong threatened that I had to pay for it or he would call the police... I left, he did...

9:30 pm 12.3.2015

Was seated... Waited 10 minutes for the server to take order..

Ordered a Cobb salad with flat iron steak.  The steak was listed as a 4 dollar upgrade over base Cobb salad with chicken

The waitress asked what two sides I wanted.. Thought It was funny at the time, but it is their restaurant...

The waitress came out and said steak and sides were ready, but was waiting on salad... Did I want the steak brought out... I said no I wanted on top of the salad the way I ordered it...

She brought out two plates of food steak on one and a salad on the other... 

I cleaned my plates and asked for the bill... On the bill I was charged for
Two beers
Cobb salad
Steak dinner..

I pointed out on the menu was, I asked for she said she would fix it and then came back and said the manager said because I ate I had to pay for it.

When I asked for him.. He would not address the issue... I should have known that what was brought out was not want I wanted...  I asked him to fix the bill or I was leaving... He said I would have to pay for it and then started walking to the front.. I followed... He was out the door at that point calling 911... 

I left walked back to my hotel room... I do not know if this was intentional to pressure folks into higher checks, silliness on their part or thus rude customer service..."}
{"text":"Just received delivery from here. My boyfriend ordered nachos for 10.99 and there were maybe 7 chips that came with the order. I ordered soup of the day and asked for tomato basil because there were two options. I asked for a breadstick and they could charge me for it. I also ordered a Ceaser salad and it said that the salad came with a breadstick. When I received the meal there was tomato soup and a Ceaser salad and then the small order of nachos. The only reason they get 2 stars is because I liked their soup and luckily I had a breadstick from another restaurant that I had left orders from. I will definitely not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"First and foremost..Horrible service. I witnessed a bartender curse out a customer for wanting to use a coupon. Our waitress kept forgetting items we ordered and got irritated when we asked for them. She then proceeded to never check in with us after the food came out. I saw her sitting in the waiting area texting on her phone. There was a family sitting across from us who the waitress treated poorly also. Positives...the food was great. Unfortunately because of the service, we won't come here anymore."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever received at a FRIDAY's!    Our waitress was the best but they had her serving the whole damn restaurant!  This is ridiculous I am very pissed off"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some preflight drinks . Just find an open table and seat yourself, a waiter will be by shortly with menus. We ordered the spinach and queso dip and two doses of mimosas. Everything came out quickly and was good."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into the doors I knew I had made the right decision. I sat down at my table and was handed a menu to order from. Looking at all the different options was like enjoying the finest eye candy. I ogled the different choices and could feel my saliva glands starting to wet my mouth. I carefully mulled over the tantalizing options until I made my choice - a nice plate of wings and a burger. 

Waiting on my big hunk of meat to arrive was excruciating. The 30min wait seemed like eternity. It's like being forced to watch adult images without letting off some pressure. But alas, I had no choice. 

After what seemed like hours I was finally delivered my platter of ecstasy. I carefully picked up the burger and sunk my teeth into it. I could feel the meat in my mouth, the warm juices running down my cheeks. Having hot beef sitting on my tongue never felt better. 

Next came the wings. I grabbed one off the plate and carefully slid my tongue up and down the side, licking up the moist buffalo sauce. I sucked all the meat off that hard bone and enjoyed every tantalizing second. 

The meal was getting better and better as the evening went on... 

The true climax of the meal was when my drink was brought out. The hot and cold contrast of the meat and drink was enough to make a person lose their mind. Let's just say... the sweet slushee ended the meal well. 

All in all 6/9 dining experience."}
{"text":"Let's just say right on time. Sunday night with my lady happy hour almost everything. The staff on top of there game for a Sunday Funday. Relax drink eat an appetizer and caught up on espn with friends or whom ever. This TGIF was prefect for being on this inside of a casino."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in years, and I suppose that will be the same way again. 

Our waitress was nice and got us our drinks right away, but finding her after that took 15 minutes and flagging someone else down. The sandwiches that my friend and I ordered tasted amazing, but they didn't make up for the onion rings I was served. Now, 5 dollars for onion rings is a pretty normal price, but for 4 overcooked onion rings that I couldn't pull apart without the aid of a knife I wouldn't spend any money on. They tasted like really bad calimari, and not once throughout my meal did my waitress appear. It took flagging down someone who was walking by to get her attention. It was one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life and if you ever happen to get Karly as a waitress, run for the hills."}
{"text":"Great experience! Our server, Jeniffer did an amazing job today. Will be definitely coming back here. She was knowledgeable and recommend exactly what we've been looking for. She was very attentive but not too over the shoulders, perfect service!  Keep up the hard work."}
{"text":"TGI  friday's
One of my favorite places for a casual meal in a bar atmosphere!
Mostly a fun place with mostly bar food. they're always busy so I give waiters a break if they take extra minutes for this or that.
The food is always good I have tried almost everything on the menu and enjoyed every bite of it. This time I had the sirloin and baby back ribs and it was delicious. The desserts are out of this world and prices are down to earth. This is not a fast food restaurant, slow down and enjoy life! Try this place you'll enjoy it. Thank God I did."}
{"text":"I usually love this Friday's but tonight my server Miguel sucked he never came back to check on us it was like he kept trying to avoid our table.A waitress came and brought us our food which was fine but we needed napkins,refills we got nothing we had to ask another server to get us all that I know he was busy with a lot of tables but damn come check on all your tables  smh.I will be calling corporate because something needs to be done about the sucky ass service or hell I will just take my business else where."}
{"text":"Stay away! No greeter at the front, someone finally came 5 min later. Service sucks I'm sure food will too, we left as soon as another table got their food before we could order, and we were here way before them! Never again!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here one night because we didn't have time to look around for a good local place - we found out we really should have taken more time. I know it is a chain and it is nothing special but I also know it is usually decent and you know what you are getting at TGIF.
Food was bland, and not really filling. We went out later and picked up sandwiches because there really wasn't much food on the plate. Service was good, place was a bit loud but that is TGIF.
Overall, edible food but I was really disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Well what can i say it's Friday's. As long as you stick to appetizers, desserts and soda your good, if you stray watch out. We have a love hate relationship with Friday's its like im rooting for them but they always fail. The menu always looks sooo good and i get suckered into trying something new and it always disappoints."}
{"text":"From start to finish family nite out was thumbs up!! Out guest made a special request before being seated and was accommodated immediately. Our waitress CONNIE was AMAZING!! She was very warm and inviting, her personal knowledge of the menu mixed with her suggestions made our choices so much easier. The bathroom and common areas were clean and well maintained. She was very nice and joked with is during our time there... Even my 14yo gave her a rave review!! Definitely a place to recommend!! We don't get to praise the cook but this CHEF did a wonderful job on everything from steamed broccoli to succulent ribs!!"}
{"text":"Mice, food was cold when given to me. Eat elsewhere. If you get a gift card for Friday's, go to a different one"}
{"text":"Food was just OK but the portions were MUCH smaller than they used to be and the prices much higher.The service was less than good despite the restaurant being slow. Went for my son's birthday and regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Maggie is the best bartender hands down. Joe, the manager is the best as well. Great place for lunch, dinner or just a quick drink."}
{"text":"We came in to eat the steak and lobster special from 3-6 pm for $13.99. Food arrived promptly and was hot. This meal normally cost $25.00.  The server was polite and followed up on us to make sure everything was good.  Overall a good return experience. Our servers Audrey and tyler were very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"The service was way better than the food until a large party came in, then the waiter couldn't handle the 3 tables he had. The drinks, (which was a Washington Apple) was served in a extra large shot glass instead of a martini glass. Worst of all, it tasted like cranberry with a squirt of Crown!  Last Friday's for me!"}
{"text":"The staff and service management are on point, friendly and engaging. So we will begin with 5 stars just on that alone. I have frequented this location so this review of staff is based on 10+ visits. The kitchen tonight wasn't executing on quality. Not only was my medium steak well done it was cut numerous times and overly drenched in sauce. My husband had to slice his own chicken and peppers in the pasta which was plopped on top of a bed of noodles and sauce when it arrived at our table... Minus 1.5 stars for that.

They must have ran out of glasses so our fountain beverages came out in bar glasses that weren't clean minus .5 star. The floor looked as if a 5 year old took to it...food, sticky substances you name it so .5 of a star loss. I get that its Sunday and it was busy and they were short staffed so .5 star gained for effort. 

All in all it seemed chaotic and wasn't worth the 45 minute wait so for experience I subtracted 1 more star. I would visit this location again for convenience but not by choice."}
{"text":"TGIF's is one of my favorite restaurants!! But this visit I was a little disappointed & sad, that's why unfort. I have to rate this a 2 Star. :-(
I've been to this location before without any issues so not sure what has happened over time or this night??
The lobster tails are my favorite dish on the menu! I always order them when I have gone  there the past few times. I never get them grilled because having them grilled tend to dry them out & then they don't taste so good! The other option is boiled or steamed?? I can't seem to remember, I must have lobster brain now! lol 
But with this visit @ this location I got a loaded baked potato with my tails & it was shockingly ice cold. Really?? I have no idea how this could of happened but I told our server James right away, well the new one he brought me was steaming hot & much better! I found the lobster tails to be smaller then usual. (You get only 2) & a little drier then normal. Thank God for the high cholesterol causing melted butter to dip them in & make them taste much better! 
The broccoli wasn't so yummy as it always is! 
I've been a strips card member for years!! It's free to sign up & you accumulate points every time you eat or drink there then get coupons via email offering money off your meals & free food. I used my 20% off coupon & saved my date $11.00 off the bill. We also got to try out some free chips & salsa before our meal (thanks to a strip offer). My date said the salsa wasn't spicy @ all, which I agreed with him on this & the chips were blah. They weren't the greatest so I would never order them & pay for them. I like freebies & it gives you a chance to try stuff out esp. if you have never had them before! 

The place was really busy for a Sunday night. There was no hostess when we arrived (6pm) & we had to wait a few minutes for her to show up! Also our food came out really fast (I mean it is lobster tail), our waiter James was fabulous! Very friendly & you could tell he enjoys his job! He was sympathetic when I had to tell him my baked potato was ice cold & took care of it right away! Though a little surprised a manager didn't come over like @ most restaurants when there is something wrong they stop by...?? He kept our drinks filled, asked us how are meals were, offered dessert & brought our check over right away & took care of cashing us out quickly cause no one likes having to wait for their check, change or CC receipt when they are ready to leave!!! 

I've also have had their hamburgers & Jack Daniels grilled chicken which are other favorites of mine! Some of the pasta dishes I have tried have been good too! Hopefully if I ever hit this location again in the future the food will be better!"}
{"text":"Today i sit here to enjoy happy hr ... recently someone introduce me to the fried string beans which were off the chain so i decided on those as well as sum buffalo wings .while i sit n ponder on my choices n decisions"}
{"text":"T.G.I. Friday's at Monroeville thought it was appropriate to give me another person's hardly touched meal in a clean bowl.  A big group of us went to dinner.  My husband and I are vegan, so we did our best to not be difficult and chose the kid's pasta as our meal.  Because our party was so large, my pasta came out first and they lost my husband's order and had to make a new one.  So my pasta comes out in a bowl pre mixed and with a spoon in it.  I thought nothing of it because I was starving so I ate it.  When I finished, my husband's pasta came out completely different then what was presented to me. He had pasta in a bowl with marinara poured on top. Nothing was pre mixed no spoon in it.  That's when I knew they gave me another child's meal that was hardy touched.  THANK T.G.I. Friday's!"}
{"text":"Went to this location to grab a bite to eat after a long day at work...get seated, and after 20 to 25 minutes, no one even bothered to take my order or offer me something to drink...totally awful experience."}
{"text":"It's Friday's, so my expectations aren't very high. And if you're reading a Friday's review you probably just want to know if the service is good and the food is hot. Well, this is definitely not a model Friday's, it's pretty lackluster. Service is friendly but nothing exceptional. Waitress was very nice but definitely gave my mom my sweet potato fries and forgot my wife's spinach altogether. And when I did get my sweet potato fries, they were not the full effort. Too soft, not hot enough. Actually in general the food could have been hotter. All that said, not a disaster. Bbq chicken flatbread was solid, pecan crusted chicken salad was solid, ribs were solid. Mozzerella sticks were good. Overall, I wouldn't say totally avoid, but come on, you know you have better options."}
{"text":"5.25.17 11am Turkey Burger was fantastic, my star is for that.  I got a call from my dad to pick him up, but my food wasn't ready yet so I asked Audra to hold it, I'd be right back.  About 15 minutes or less, I got back and got my lunch.  The Turkey Burger was hot and surprisingly great!  Instead of fries, I got broccoli, except the brown broccoli looked horribly disgusting.  As a chef or server, seeing it I would've said something like, let's get her some better broccoli? 

Audra said maybe it was cause the broccoli was out for so long when I left... hmm.  I cook broccoli at home all of the time and it's sat out and never turned brown... The chef should never have sent it out like that period.  I would not even pick through it and eat the good pieces how bad the dish looked.  The lemon was even strange and squished to death.  The manager Claudia came out and said that since they changed their recipe to include lemon, it's been like that and she'd mention it to the chef.  She apologized and credited our card $3.00 back.  

I have been here often, only since bringing dad to the Veterans hospital.  Before that I hadn't been in a TGIF for at least a decade.  I can appreciate a server seeing this mess and doing something about it, not making an excuse for it, but saying something like, 'you're right, let me show the chef.. sorry about that.'  My other point is this, what chef would be ok sending this out?  I can't believe someone would serve something like that!  My dad said it looked like what he sees on 'Kitchen Nightmares.'"}
{"text":"Alert... There is portion control now at TGI Fridays.  Burgers are portioned and shaped to look exactly like a frozen patty.  Also no rare-well done option.  Can only pick Pink or No Pink?!?! Is this a restaurant or fast food joint.   Also don't ask for any extra cheese..... They are out of 8 of the 10.   Order drinks over the phone before you arrive .... 15mins for a draft beer 20+ mins for cocktail.  Also watch out if you wear flip flops or open toe shoes.... Utensils and huge pieces of food under the table.  Stepped on a steak knife when I slid into the booth.  Waitress was a sweetheart wasn't her fault the restaurant is poorly managed."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate graduation. 

They were very busy, but still provided amazing service! It's been a long time since I've had a waiter or waitress who was this level of kind, attentive, and funny. Our drinks and food came quickly and everything was handled with ease. 

Food was pretty good, and drinks weren't anything to write home about. 

5 star service + 3 star food = 4 star review!"}
{"text":"Endless appetizers every time... And for the third time and eight months I've been told that the thermostat is broken that's why they can't heat up the restaurant.  I don't understand why management will put that kind of burden on their staff who was also complaining that they were cold... I don't think that will be back in fact we talked about not coming back while we were there this time."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, can't expect alot, but worse than expected.  You'd think they could at least get the drinks right, but hubby ordered a Corona, when asked for a second one got a Corona Light (yes, very different!)  The Mule I ordered tasted light very bad lime juice from a bottle...nothing else.  Ordered a Vodka Gilet and I guess they can't afford Rose's Lime juice, used bad sweet snd sour.  Dinner was pretty bad too, just saying."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of chains, we got roped into going here by another couple, on our last night in Las Vegas. 

We asked the hostess if the appetizers were still half price at Happy Hour. She said they were, but neglected to tell us one has to be seated at the bar to take advantage of the half price offer. 

We only ordered one appetizer, and shared it: the shrimp cocktail... and unfortunately it appeared to have been made ahead of time as the shrimp were very dry. They weren't \"bad\", they were just dried out, which can happen quite quickly in low humidity and air conditioning. So it would have been OK at $5 for 11 smallish dry shrimp, but not OK at nearly $10. 

And unfortunately our friends ordered two appetizers (expecting half price); the potato skins and the dry shrimp cocktail, and also ordered a side of Onion Soup.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the steak and lobster special all four of us had. It was excellent. We all ordered it with a fully loaded baked potato and a side of Chef's veggies. The steaks were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. 

Our waiter was Chris, and he did his best for us in a crazy busy setting.

Our bill came to $41 (we only had water with our meals), and our friends bill came to over $75 (they had drinks). So in all the four of us spent about $120 plus a tip. The manager was not willing to adjust our bill for half price appetizers even after our waiter told him the Hostess failed to tell us we had to be seated in the bar. Oh well. If he had, this would have been a 4 star review."}
{"text":"The staff was absolutely fabulous! But the food was horrendous, I found plastic in my food. The steak was poorly cooked, I do not recommend the Dragon salmon. Best part of our meal was the service and our waters."}
{"text":"I just moved here from LA and this is the first time I ate at this location and the service was wonderful. I will definitely be coming back with my daughter. I love TGIF!"}
{"text":"We are very disappointed in the service we received tonight. We came in with a party of about 12 people. We asked our server before she even took drink orders if it would be possible to split checks. As a server myself I always cringe at that question, but in an effort to please the customer I always oblige. Our server was a little reluctant but agreed to do the best she could with splitting the checks. She got busy and the service slowed down. It was taking about 15-30 minutes to receive the drinks we ordered and such. We get it. The place was busy and she had a lot going on. We finally asked for our check and she took almost an hour to get it to us. When I looked over the check, we were charged for 2 extra beers. I mentioned to her that we were drinking a different type of beer than was on our check and she said it didn't matter because they were the same price. Again, that's fine but when I told her we only had 6 instead of the 8 on our check, her response was \"no you didn't\". Sadly she continued to tell us that we were wrong and that she had been keeping track. She kept track so well she couldn't even put the proper brand of beer on our check. If she had just looked at the check of another group in our party she would have realized she gave us their beers. It would have been an honest mistake that could've been easily remedied, instead she continued to tell us we were wrong. Being a part of a big group we realize some of the items may have been confused. The part we were disappointed with was her repeatedly telling us we were wrong in front of our friends. If this is how T.G.I. Friday's wants to treat their customers, we will definitely not be back. We've been to this location many times and have never been treated so disrespectfully."}
{"text":"Honestly, you can't expect much from a TGIF's inside the Gold Coast...but come on. Service is super slow for no apparent reason and the already bad food tends to come out cold. I visited this establishment on two different occasions and ended up with the same disappointing experience. The first time was with some friends who were on a 1-hour dinner break from their WSOP tournament. We notified the server we were on a time crunch and specifically ordered items that we were told would be prepared quickly. Was it quick? No. One of the dishes even came out cold, either from being undercooked or was sitting out for who knows how long while our server was doing who knows what.

The second time I stopped in for a late night meal and again, service was slow when there was almost nobody dining there. My boyfriend and I decided to share the chicken & beef fajitas, which took forever to come out and ended up being cold. The sides (guacamole, salsa, etc) were never served to us nor did we have any utensils. When the server finally came around to our table, the BF was fed up, so he sent it back and asked for a new dish to be made, complete with all the sides and utensils ready. Our server complied, apologized profusely, took the plate back, and eventually brought out a new piping hot sizzling dish. We cautiously picked at our meal, unsure of what may have been in it since you never know what happens behind the kitchen when you send food back -_- But it seemed safe enough so we finished our meal and then asked for the bill. To our surprise, we were charged twice for the fajitas despite our waiter having said before, and I quote, 'that cold dish should've never been brought out for you guys'. After bringing it up to him, he claimed to simply have forgotten to change it. Regardless if it was intentional or not, service here sucks and I'd only come back out of desperation for the spinach & artichoke dip appetizer, which is the only tasty thing I've had here."}
{"text":"Unlimited Apps are $15 now, are you flipping kidding me. $10 was okay because it just barely crosses that double digit threshold and carried many options but now its just the loaded pot. skins, boneless wings, pot stickers, meatball, and mozz sticks. That is it! Most disappointing and, to sound uneducated, SAD! I did not get a menu with this information on it until I had ordered and it was too late. I found this out on my phone. Now to Brooklyn. I was with a friend and we could not decide where to go and we were too close to get on the highway and go to Red Robin as I wanted. So we went here, mind you, this is on the Friday after Thanksgiving. The restaurant was empty and we sat at the high tops by the bar as I typically do. Our waitress, whose name I will not mention, came by and took our drinks. So far so good. My friend got some tea and I got the typical sink water. Then she returned briefly to take our orders and then she was out of lives like those who we knew were sick but were nearing the end of life but it is never enough to satisfy the answers to letting go. 

I got my order and so did my friend after about 20 minutes which is long for apps but whatever. She was no where to be found. I wanted to order my next refill and my friend wanted some more cheese for her pretzels. Our waitress was in sight and we made eye contact but no return. I wonder, did I say something wrong or use too much personality that is it scaring her away? So I decided to stare directly into her soul. Nothing. So finally my friend hollered and she returned and asked if someone took my order for a refill. Nope, that is what you do. She acknowledged our requests and said BRB. She was out of our lives like that fleeting summer wind that directs patronage ambitions of being a summer bird. 
She finally came back after 20 minutes and when I was dying for water and more apps. So I ordered more and then she left again like the air from the lungs of girl screaming after a plunder down a daisy hill. 

Point is, we got awful service and we decided to leave after only three orders because we could not wait much longer. Now I have friends in food and swear that you should tip any service. Eat my shoe. I refuse to give someone 20%+ when they do a poor job. I cannot do a half job and send results out to cure a disease. She is not curing disease but I have to work to make the money she will receive and I cannot condone supporting poor performances when there are people looking for her position. So we both are typically good tippers, she better than me being a nurse, but we both left a few singles and left. I am not returning so this joins Harry Buffalo Parma Heights as a location I refuse to visit. Do not go here even if they offer you candy."}
{"text":"5 stars!!  My friend and I went here last night and I had a blast!  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were wonderful.  They were very busy but were able to keep up with the orders and maintain a good sense of humor the whole time.  Our bartender asked us if we would like to try a drink he had been creating.  Of course we will!  It was really good.  My friend who is strictly a beer drinker even liked the mixed drink.

The decor is very nice and chic.  another thing I noticed was that it is not really loud inside like the old location.  At the old one I would have to yell in order to be heard.  it is all open and looks nothing like the Chevy's that used to be here.

We ordered appetizers.  Some kind of chicken Asian skewers and loaded potato chips.  I loved the skewers.  They were made with cilantro and I love cilantro.  The Asian Cole slaw that came with the skewers was really good too. The loaded potatoes were OK.  My friend liked them.  I probably would not order them again but she would.

I really want to go back and have dinner sometime.  The prices are average among other dining establishments in the area."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service was just okay. At first, our waitress was great but then after we ordered our food the service went down hill. No more drink refills and she completely forgot about our order of sliders. When we asked her about the sliders she didn't apologize and she said they were on there way. 
Overall, the food is super yummy! I love the pecan crusted chicken salad."}
{"text":"So when you are at the Orleans for a cheer competition and you need lunch and a Bloody Mary STAT you find yourself at TGIF's. We aren't big chain restaurant fans but there wasn't much else that we could find...
Immediately the hostess gave us attitude and we almost left, but with no where else to go we tucked our tails and sat down. From then on we were pleasantly surprised.
Our waitress was fabulous, cheery and helpful. Our food came quickly and it was pretty decent. Salmon can be scary at diners but my husband said his was great. My salad was fresh and tasty and my Bloody Mary was excellent. My daughter had a burger, it was a little lukewarm but the burger itself was tasty. 
Just put someone a little less annoyed with life at the front desk and you will be a fine establishment ;)"}
{"text":"Nice place for quick service and good food.  Never have to wait and that's great.  Desserts are presented well"}
{"text":"Slow service, was not greeted and had to go to the bar and ask for help. Waitress then came over. I ve told the hostess and server that I was going to be need quick. Bar tender is friendly.."}
{"text":"I only come for the drinks and happy hour.  Service always sucks and appetizers are  ALWAYS over cooked (except the ribs)"}
{"text":"My mahi mahi was completely burnt. The server neglected to visit our table until everyone had completed their food. That was the only time. We were left with empty drinks and food that I would have requested been taken back. There was a child screaming at the next table for a solid hour and also would have requested to be moved since the family wasn't going to do anything about it. Nobody in the restaurant apologized or offered to reseat us. I enjoy this location a lot but will not be coming back anymore. Once the food was eaten it took 30 minutes for our server to come and give us our check. I understand this isn't a 5-star restaurant but this is ridiculous. A Sunday a 2pm when the place is 3/4 empty? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"How this place gets a two star and others get a 4 rating mystifies me. The food is predictably good. It isn't a top line steakhouse, but you don't pay those prices. Not to mention that it is designed to accommodate sports fans with the numerous televisions. 
The staff is courteous and they have great specials. We had steak and lobster for $15. We took advantage of the special a couple of times while there. I like TGIF's in general, and this being in a great casino, Orleans, is just an added benefit.
I will definitely go back the next time we visit in a few months!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice in the last three months, and had bad food both times. The first time was the extremely greasy potato skins. They were unbelievably bad. I made a complaint after that, and was given a couple of free appetizer cards for complaining online.

The second bad meal was the Jack Daniels chicken. My boyfriend and I ordered the same meal. Mine was fine, and his was awful. His chicken had the weirdest texture, and his mac n cheese  was totally dried out to the point of being crunchy. We said something to the waitress, who sent the manager over. The manager removed the meal from our bill.  

We eat at TGI Fridays a lot, in different locations, since we generally really like the food. This particular location is a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Late night happy hour brought us here.  I got the 4 chicken ghost pepper sliders.  They were really good.  My friend got some pizza that was also very good.  Couldn't beat the happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow drink service. Each drink took about 10 minutes to get to the table. Food was just okay and after all the waiting and poor service we were given a bill of 64 dollars for one app and 4 drinks. My double skky mixer was 12 dollars. Aka a full price single simply doubled, which, as a bartender I can tell you makes no sense. After expressing our concerns, the manager came over and was nothing but confrontational saying that was just the policy and too bad. I said okay that's fine just run my card and he continued to explain things away when I clearly had no further desire to talk to him. Pretty brutal experience."}
{"text":"A homeless man in a wheelchair approached me for a dollar.  I told him, I would buy food for him.  He didn't want Panda as he claims it causes his stomach to bleed and suggested a kids meal from TGIF.  I agreed.  We went into TGIF to look at the menu, but the kids menu didn't have the steak he wanted.  He asked the hostess how much the steak was and decided it was too expensive and wanted to order the chicken instead.  The price was a couple of dollars difference, so I insisted that he order the steak.  The hostess, Lace took my card and came back with a note that the meal was on the House.  I really appreciate the generosity of this TGIFs.  On the other hand, the poor gentleman said he lost everything due to his cancer that has spread all over.  This was a great way to end 2017.  Thank you TGIF!!!"}
{"text":"this is a bit of a late review but I was trying to figure out our bartender's name.. I couldn't but whatever :) 

well first off, this was my first time here and boy was our happy hour HAPPY! we came in search of some beer, apps, gaming (me) and football (her) and all of that we got!

the happy hour here is amazing, that and the gaming comps. my good friend an I are happy hour hoppers so we were stoked on this place. we will definitely be back!

thanks bartender lady! 
(she was super sweet and caramel-skinned)"}
{"text":"Good food, fantastic service, really cold beer. Never had a bad experience here. And the casino doesn't reek of smoke walking through to get to Fridays."}
{"text":"When walking into this TGI Friday's I wasn't greeted by hostess instead I was in line behind several people who were waiting to be seated and all had no clue of where the hostess was. Now it was about 7 o'clock at night and there was only three tables with guests so I didn't expect to wait over five minutes just to be seated when they weren't busy at all. After waiting almost 10 minutes our server came over to us and looked very disorientated (as if he was frustrated) I ordered an amaretto sour and he instantly asked me \"what's that?\". I was really confused because shouldn't the bartender know but anyways I told him what was in it. After a couple minutes he came back to the table and asked me again and what brand of amaretto. I finally got my drink after several more minutes  and then we were ready to order. I ordered the French onion soup and I specifically asked for it to come out before my meal and I ordered an entrée as well. After 18 more minutes are food finally came out. My soup and entrée came out together and not only was I upset because I asked for it first but the soup was cold and very tasteless. While eating our dinner the hostess and waiters had no problem using their phones to Snapchat, Facebook, and text and fool around. Looking around the restaurant I could see tables that needed to be cleaned, floors that needed to be swept. I've been looking for my server for another five minutes just to get a water when I originally asked for a water with my beverage in the beginning. If you want to go to a restaurant were everything takes a long time, the food is mediocre and overpriced I would recommend TGI Fridays. If not go to Denny's, Chili's, or Olive Garden they never fail."}
{"text":"The whole meal was brought out wrong. We asked for sweet tea, got unsweetened. which was not the worst. My wife ordered bourbon barrel chicken and what came out was the bourbon barrel Mia Mia, we sent that back. Then I ordered the Jack Daniel's New York strip and Shrimp, got the steak but no shrimp. Over all we will no be going back. The place was not even busy, there is no excuse for this."}
{"text":"Went 8/12/17. Our server Kevin was really nice and attentive and the manager was great too. Awesome experience"}
{"text":"finally found a burger worth spending money on!  the service was great (the kitchen forgot my extras), and was impressed by how well the burger was cooked! but the chairs are so  uncomfortable... I will order from here again, but only as take-out."}
{"text":"Food was okay, server was a nightmare. Bless her heart, she forgot our order and then when we ordered dessert, she sent it to the table boxed to go...ummm we didn't order it to go...so we ate it out of the styrofoam box...not the most welcome feeling in the world."}
{"text":"Don't follow national prices or happy hour specials. Food was dry, service was lacking. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Great TGI, great drinks, long Island is amazing the perfect froth. Food is perfect, hot and fresh, service super friendly. Erika is an awesome bar tender, love her, and super cute too!!"}
{"text":"Love their dinners with the jack Daniels sauce! Nice atmosphere and they have some yummy mixed drinks. The waitress I seem to get a lot is super nice. The only downside is that this place is a bit pricey for a burger, but their deals are good."}
{"text":"I was somewhat pleased with the service, but then again it was Saturday afternoon and wait time was ridiculous- not as bad as Northlake though.  I took my daughter to eat and this was the second Fridays we went to because of wait time.  Server was nice however she was so busy to check on us as much as I would've liked.  I did however enjoy my food, I had the Grilled Salmon, which was great.  Platter was a bit small but I can't complain because I was there because I redeemed points,  so my meal was free.  I did tell the server before hand that I had the coupon but she still rang it up incorrectly and it took about 7 minutes for her to come back to correct the issue.  I'm glad that I didn't have any immediate needs to leave because I would've been more upset for waiting even longer.  I am just glad that my daughter enjoyed her meal. I will try again during non peak times to see if I change my mind about service."}
{"text":"Been to this Friday's twice in the past 2 months thinking the first time was just a fluke...bill was wrong for the special we ordered.The manager fixed it after waiting for 30 min for the fix.This visit was very slow service...30 min waiting for additional salad dressing...maybe 1/2  tsp on the salad just dosent get it....very small servings for the special...put the call server button on the ziosk and 20 min later he showed up so we could get the bill then 30 more minutes for him to bring the bill...all the while an employee stood against the wall with her arms crossed.i guess her job was to hold up that wall...she did it well. More empty tables than occupied tables and now I know why
Won't be back to this Friday's"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had. Not only did I get uncooked mozzarella sticks but when they remade them they tasted horrible. I ordered a steak and asked for medium, when they first brought it out it was so rare I had to send it back and then when I got it back it was still very rare but I didn't want to send it back due to the service being so slow and everyone else had pretty much already finished their food by the time I got the steak the first time. To top it off my silverware was dirty and they got one of my friends orders wrong and they took forever to give us out checks and even longer to come back and run our cards."}
{"text":"We used to go to Fridays fairly often several years ago.  We started having really bad service the last few times we went.  We decided to take a break and started going to other places.  After 2 years , we decided last night to go to the strongsville location because we got gift cards for their.  When we arrived, it was packed (a positive sign that it may have improved).  I walked up to host to put in my name and was completely ignored.  Others walked up and he was taking names of others but in no particular order!!!!  Once we were seated, waiter came by right away and took our drink orders.  Took about 15 min for him to come back with drinks and take our order!  Food came out in decent time.  However, waiter never came back to see if we needed refills or to see how our food was!!!! Also, by the time we were leaving the wait was still about an hour.  Although, there had to have been at least 5-6 empty tables with no one ever being seated!!!!There turnaround time is horrid!!!! Never once saw a mgr when their!!! Perfect example of improper training of employees!!!! The mgr should been out and about making sure all was going as it should and getting the turnaround of customers in/out running like it should!!!!"}
{"text":"This place always has the slowest service! Food is mediocre... This location in particular always seems extremely short staffed."}
{"text":"When 2 people order soup with their meals shouldn't both soups come out at the same time? Well apparently they didn't think my husband needed his. Nor did we need prompt drink refills. I don't know if I was more annoyed there were 2 bartenders and 3 servers in the bar that had no clue what they were doing or the fact we were continuously passed up and not asked if we needed something. This location blows!"}
{"text":"This place is very hit or miss. On my last visit, I was promptly greeted and sat. The server was attentive and polite. The food tasted fresh. Usually the fries here are pretty bland and old, but this time they were fresh with just enough salt. Also, the presentation of one of my friends pasta dishes was impressive. Very good experience.

The other times before that were completely different experiences. Food took forever. Never received drink refills. Servers tried to avoid eye contact so they wouldn't have to come back to tables. A server even swept the floor with a broom then used it on the booth seats. Sure didn't seem very sanitary. 

After my last experience I might give it a few more chances. We will see how it goes. I love Friday's overall so I'm hoping this location can keep up the positive experiences."}
{"text":"This location has gone very down hill I've been going there for ten years.  Food is so bad!!  I never give bad reviews first ever!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on Monday last week for lunch before my appointment I had the southern fried chicken sandwich and my driver had the turkey avocado BLT we both had seasonal fries. 

The southern fried chicken sandwich and seasonal fries were cold the sandwich was burnt did not look like it was cooked. I even had to send it back to the kitchen with no lunch 

The turkey avocado blt was ok not what you expected everything was store bought like I could make it at home.  My driver was the only person that got food.

I have contacted the manager to advise them what happen they failed to do anything or make this right. I won't return to this Friday location or any T.G.I. Friday's"}
{"text":"Exceptional service. The manager Amy J and our server  Ashley are amazing. They went above and beyond to make sure our party of 8 was well taken care of and made sure we felt welcome.  The food arrived in a timely matter and it was great!!!   I would recommend this Friday's to all friends and family. Thank you Amy J and Ashley for everything!!!"}
{"text":"It's a Chain Restaurant, so I can never go full-on 5 stars, but the host and the waitress that were working last Monday were on point some of the best restaurant workers I have run into.  The host sat us down at a back table, invited us into conversation, and made us feel welcome as we waited for our friends who were running late.

The waitress, who was more beautiful than anyone we've met in Los Angeles (where beautiful people are supposed to reside [but not as beautiful as my lady, let me make note]) was nice and competent, which is two traits that are hard to find together in servers around the city of Los Angeles as well.  So, far, before we even ordered, this TGI Friday's experience was a breath of fresh air.

Our friends arrive, and they had been to this Friday's a week prior and the waitress not only remembered them, but remembered their order.  We commandeered the table for an hour past our welcome, but they staff was always friendly, and we never felt rushed.  I really enjoyed our time here for lunch.

Kudos to the staff."}
{"text":"Place was very busy.  There were 5 of us.  Ordered the 2 of the $5 appetizers, boneless wings and the flatbread. Both were delicious.  The complimentary chips and salsa was nice.  Ordered the ribs, Cajun shrimp and chicken, hibachi chicken and the Parmesan chicken.  All was great.

Attentive waitress!"}
{"text":"Save your money and eat elsewhere! By far the worst customer service and food at any TGI friday I have been to. 

To start out we were neglected by our waitress, we saw her 2 times, the last us having to ask someone else to please send our server over. 

I ordered the 10oz Ribeye medium and when i got it, it was over cooked and tasted burnt. My husband got the steak and lobster deal and his was over cooked as well.

We waited over 20 mins for our waitress to come by so we could send the food back but she was no where to be found. Finally after waiting 30 mins we flagged down another waitress to send ours over so we could pay and leave because i had to head into work. the funniest part was when we asked for boxes she didn't ask if anything was wrong with the food since we boxed up whole meals. 

I would defiantly avoid this place. bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"My father and I went to the restaurant after watching a movie at the theatre.  I ordered the fried shrimp while Dad ordered the ribs.  Abraham, our server, brought the food and was supposed to bring the utensils and the extra napkins, but the extra napkins and the utensils did not turn up.  We waited and waited.  We wanted to know where our server vanished.  I had to get up and flag down the server and call to his attention that we were missing the utensils and extra napkins that we were supposed to get with the food.  Finally, we received the extra napkins and the utensils.  There was no restroom within the restaurant.  I had to go outside the restaurant to use the restroom.  The food was good, but the service was poor.  If we are spending money, we want to be taken care of."}
{"text":"I came on Sunday and it was great. Although there weren't many people there then, they place seemed lively. The server was really nice. I got a chicken salad and it was very filling. I would order it again!"}
{"text":"the best burgers around paired with some good red wine and of course great service. they also have some low calorie auntrees so it's a win win place to go."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this place. Like most chain restaurants, they change their menu often.  The menu prices seem much higher than usual since the last menu change. They've also rid some of the combination deals you may be used to. Basically, if you haven't been here in awhile, be prepared to spend more money than you were used to. 

However, I still enjoy the food here, although due to the prices, I can't dine here as often as I have in the past. I have also become vegetarian recently so it's hard to find dishes that suit us herbivores in my zip code. 

That hasn't been a too much of a problem the two times I've been here since though. The first time, I ordered a salad with grilled chicken, asking to have it without the chicken. Although the waitress gave a funny look (which I'm used to by now), she was still very helpful, offering to add other veggies or black beans. They even gave me a side salad with it for only a dollar, which was nice. Some places act as if they've never heard of a vegetarian and panic when I ask that they just leave out the meat. Others scoff, and others even charge MORE to leave out meat!?!? This place has handled it well so far.

The second time, I was very happy to see that they had a black bean burger on the menu and I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Their smoothies are good too. 

Every time I've come here (for years), the staff has been friendly. 

It can be and feel a bit crowded at times, as they pack in as many tables and chairs as possible and you have to dodge them just to walk to and from your table (depending on where you're seated in the building as the tables to the right of the entrance are more crowded than the left side). 

I've never had to wait forever for food. It's always been quick to average. 

My girlfriend's daughter got a \"kid's\" chicken sandwich, which not only looked very delicious (for a dead chicken), but was large enough to even make me full if I had eaten it. It was only around $5.00 to boot. She loved it."}
{"text":"Slow Service with an Attitude.  Our server Jamillion (sp) was really friendly but took over 20 minutes to bring a box and our check.  We went to the Manager who told us she had just gotten there so she didn't know what was going on.  When we asked the server she she finally returned, she said she was 'in a meeting'   I'm not kidding.  And when we reminded her it took 20 minutes she got an attitude with us because hey, that's how things are today.  I will never go back, I recommend you not go either."}
{"text":"Took advantage of happy hour and got steak and lobster for $13.99. Portions were small but that's to be expected for the price. They seemed super busy so service was slow and water never got refilled. Only came here because we had a dining credit since we were staying in the Orleans and it was kid friendly so we wouldn't go out of our way to come back."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad night but no one at the host table when i came in and once I was seated eventually no waiter ever showed up to my table. Might want to avoid :("}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes till a waiter came to take our order after we had to flag her down. People were seated after us and go served food before we even ordered. Service sucks! I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received from the bartender."}
{"text":"I wish I could give separate ratings for service and food. The service would receive a 5 star and the food a 3.5. 
Veronica  (Ronnie) was great. She went above and beyond to try to make sure I  was happy regarding something she had no control over. 
I odered the bacon onion jam on my burger and didn't get it, I thought. Turns out its not really anything resembling a jam and I couldn't find the bacon. I had so many onions on my burger because I also had ordered caramelized onions. I couldn't tell the difference between them. Ronnie first brought a side of the \"jam\" and then a side of bacon after she saw me trying to pick bacon out of my side of \"jam\". TGIF's really needs to either fix the jam or re name it. 
Also their au jus for the French Dip? The onion soup? Really? They can't be bothered to make an au jus? 
But the turkey burger itself was well seasoned, if slightly dry, which I expected. Overall, I enjoyed my sandwich. The French Dip is too small and as I said the Au Jus really isn't. 
The service saved this visit today from being a three star review. So someone needs to give some thanks to Ronnie. She is great."}
{"text":"It's a typical TGI Fridays, except that, it has all day happy hour. Why you'd still call it a happy is beyond my brains reasoning.

Anyways, this particular one has a pretty cool bar area, it's decorated in the newer TGI Fridays look, rather than the old outdated California ones.

Can't say much else, expect that it's fairly close to the strip, and not touristy at all. My gf and I came here this past Saturday around 12am and she was shocked to see NO ONE was in the restaurant, but as soon as we got seated and ordered, the bar area started flooding with locals. I guess they have extra drink specials past 12am."}
{"text":"So service was spot on tonight, personable staff and quick turning tables.  The sizzling chicken is sizzling and stayed hot, good size portions. The Cobb salad was perfect size and green goddess dressing was very tasty.  Sweet tea refills kept coming and was perfectly sweet, got one for the road too.  Used to love this place 30 years ago, so the chain must be doing something right still, the staff again made this a nice night out."}
{"text":"Erika is the greatest bartender in the history of TGI Fridays. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Worse management.  Walked in to a huge wait with half the restaurant shut down on a Sunday peak hours.  We were told lack of staff.  As people that did eat were leaving some told us they would never eat there again, they said food was served cold and mushy...  No host for 15 mins.  When he finally showed up he was a kid akodnd said his manager was out back.    After waiting 20 Mins with no movement, we walked out along with 4 other parties waiting.  Wish I could have wrote review with 0 stars.  1 is too good."}
{"text":"No WiFi ! 

No Friday's points, Friday's coupons or Friday's gift cards. 

What makes this place a Friday's?  

Never again !!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was Okay until I had a problem with my chicken. I told the guy that was Bring our food and serving our table that my chicken wasn't cooked right. He gave me a smart tone and took my plate and brought the manager. I told the manager my chicken wasn't cooked right. She asked what was wrong with it. I said it was undercooked. I didn't pay for the full price of my meal but other places I've gone that do a mistake like that they give me atleast free dessert. The manager had an attitude as well. I definitely do not recommend going there. I've been to other tgi Fridays and they have a great customer service the food is great."}
{"text":"I waited for 30 minutes not even a glass of water came!! They had 10 ppl party that shouldn't slow the service like this, i never experienced this in my life!! Just being ignored i totally discourage any person of coming here"}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes after we were seated for our server to come to our table and ask us if we'd like to order any drinks or start off with an appetizer.  It took another 15 minutes to get our drinks and appetizer.  When our food came, he messed up on one of the orders.  Our server did not come back to check on us after receiving our food to see how it was, or check on our drinks.  The food tasted mediocre and the service at this place is horrendous."}
{"text":"Claryssa is such an amazing person and great server. By far the best experience I've had in a long time. Super pleased."}
{"text":"Food was terrific, but it was the service that really irritated me. It took us about 10 minutes just to get our drinks ordered. We then proceeded with our orders (I ordered from there 2 for $20.00 which includes one appetizer/ two entrees which was perfect for my sister and I). We decided on the mozzarella cheese sticks for our appetizer and I got the fries and shrimp combo for lunch. As I said food was delicious and we finished within 15-20 minutes. As soon as we got our food however we never saw our waitress until we received our check. Not once to see how we were doing or if we needed a refill.  Took them even longer  just to give us our check! Several workers had passed by and even a manager. Overall we stayed there for almost an hour and a half majority of that waiting for their slow service. Not to mention it wasn't even a busy time for them."}
{"text":"Recently re-done, this location never fails. My personal favorite location to meet up with friends. Right on Sahara it's a 10 min drive to downtown. Eat then head downtown. Free parking in lot adjacent to restaurant. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My beef aficionados gives the Jack Daniels hangar steak 2 thumbs up. Nice size steak. Ordered rare and got it rare plus.... it was perfect  I ordered the Cobb with 3 oz hangar steak. Delicious and filling. Also an Oreo er, the Oreo cookie dessert was a must!  It didn't disappoint  Our server was super attentive and efficient. It was Saturday at 2:30pm tall strawberry blonde."}
{"text":"The waiter Omar skipped our table and would not refill our drinks. And it was just water. He helped the other people out. Maybe because we are an interracial couple I do not know. I hope the other tables tipped you. With that attitude you won't get far. Wish I could give 0 stars. And my fries were half of what my husband had on his plate."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with our visit this morning. The server very noticeably sighed at my request for some additional veggies on my omelet.

The omelet was over cooked, the veggies absolutely sopping with oil and our server never came to check on us. 

I'm not normally a complainer at restaurants, but this was so horrible that it needs to be shared."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food... Chain food is all the same regardless of the name of the business (Denny's. Applebees. Chili's. TGIF)

First  - Great Happy hour!! Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.

Second  - Bartender!!! I don't know the cutie pie's name but !MAN O MAN! It was like watching Tom Cruise in Cocktails. But better. This guy is so talented and entertaining. He was able to throw those bottles and shakers and glasses around while making the perfect drink..

Third  - Service was quick. Well, in the bar area....

All in all, I would return if I wanted cheap chain food and the handsome and talented bartender was working."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Waited a long time to be seated bcuz the hostess was in the kitchen...?
Anyways we asked to sit at the bar then waited longer for the bartender...?
Anyway...food was good.  Bartender was friendly. 
Womens bathroom was disgusting...tp on the floor and nothing looked wiped down.   
The whole place was sticky n needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time and dinner! Ordered the steak and lobster with a baked potato and sweet potato fries and I was close to heaven. Customer Service from our waitress was beyond superior and our food was properly made and came out pretty quick. The only downside I would say is that the waitress did take a long time to check back on our table. We forgot to ask for steak sauce but was pretty much done with our meals before she came back to ask if we needed anything. Overall, great environment and food."}
{"text":"I feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!

This particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.

The seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.

Sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entrée, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.

I'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home."}
{"text":"I gave TGI Friday's a good review back when it was a great value.  Well, things have changed.

My mother is a seasoned citizen.  She collects her coupons from Smith's grocery store, and loves to use them.  One of the coupons is a two-fer-one at TGI Fridays.  Her youngest son was going out of state for about six months, and she wanted us to send him off, with full belly off a comped meal.  Oh my, she was in for a surprise.

In the past, if four adults had two coupons, two could eat free.  The coupons were laid out on the table, and the waiter (very polite...we can't kill the messenger) advised only one coupon per table.  When confronted with value versus togetherness, value won, and we sat at different tables.  Seems a little silly, huh?  It didn't stop there.  This TGI Fridays advertises steak and lobster for $13.99 if you are there before 6:00 p.m.  When me and the hungry wife both ordered that meal, the waiter swooped in with more bad news, since we were using the coupon, we would be charged the regular price for the steak and lobster!  So, now it's $18.99 for two steak and lobster dinners.  Well, we'd get some of that back, because we had the kid with us, and kids eat free on Tuesday night.  Well, not exactly.  The waiter offered the final apology, stating that the customer must chose one promotion.  If the kid eats free, then the steak and lobster dinners will be charged. 

This was quite upsetting to my mother.  She loved to land upon this restaurant and abuse the freebies.  

Okay, on to the food.  The steak was tiny, but it was cooked right.  It had  garlic butter on the top.  A nice, tasty addition.  The lobster tail was also tiny, but tasty.  They didn't gyp on on the baked potato, it was big.  There was some steamed broccoli, most of which was neglected.  Maybe they should promo \"all you can eat steamed broccoli\"?  The broccoli was fine.  The wife had a margarita.  It was still happy hour, and the waiter had no bad new for us on the discount for that, $5, and a good value.  

I'd say that we got what we paid for.  This meal at full price is not worth the money.  For those of you who frown upon coupons...you better bring them, and try to use them, if you are going to try to get value at this place."}
{"text":"Love love love the fajitas. And the fried shrimp is fantastic! Reminds me of back in the day when I practically lived here."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write because I happen to like TGI Friday's. My husband and I started going about once a week when we lived in CA; the food and service was consistently great. However, since moving to Vegas, we have struggled to find a location that makes us happy. The location on Sahara has terrible service, in the Aliante the service is slow even when the restaurant is empty, and at Sam's Town the food was not good. So, we have taken to visiting the location at Gold Coast.

So, here is the review for the TGI Fridays at the Gold Coast.  The food is inconsistent. As a general rule, the items that I order are fine but my husband always orders the macaroni & cheese and it never seems to be the same. Sometimes there is not enough cheese or the chicken has too much fat on it or the breading is burned. Honestly, how hard can it be to bake mac & cheese?

The service is generally horrible. We often visit at odd hours of the day when very few patrons are there and we still cannot get good service. Some of the problems have included the order being wrong, not refilling drinks, and a lack of personality. I rarely fail to tip - even for bad service - but I have started doing this since moving to Vegas simply because of the terrible customer service. 

In addition, on this particular visit, the cashier/hostess was so unprofessional it was just annoying. As she was correcting my check - since the waiter had overcharged me - she was chatting with a waitress, answering the phone, and muttering to herself (loudly). It was amazing.

So, I have a dilemma. The food is fine - better than some, worse than others - but I have their rewards card so I am always receiving coupons. Do I continue to eat there when the service annoys me so just to save money or do I throw in the towel and try to find another restaurant where my husband can eat mac & cheese? I think I just need to keep exploring my Vegas options. It is just that I am tired of paying for bad service and mediocre food. Hmmm."}
{"text":"I was informed by one of the managers that the unlimited apps will only be available for a limited time as this is not a corporate location and they can stop the promotion anytime they feel like it.."}
{"text":"No impressed.  I hate going to chain restaurants, but my brothers wanted to come here for dinner so I got dragged along.  We did the call-ahead seating and even after we arrived, we still had to wait over an hour.  I finally had to go yell at the people at the front to find out what the heck they were doing.  After waiting all that time, they STILL couldn't even get us a table together!!!  WTF??  The food was mediocre too, nothing to write home about..  Just greasy bar food that you'd expect.  Do yourself a favor and go to a non-chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"There's a good reason why there are no reviews at this place. Anyone with any brains would not eat here! Unfortunately the other place in the airport with sit-down food was closed for renovations so this was the only option. Don't eat here if you can help it!"}
{"text":"Good service at the bar. Generally very nice and attentive staff. Drinks are good but food is just okay. As far as quantity, it's a good deal for the price but quality is a different story. Veggies are always overlooked and some stuff tastes stale"}
{"text":"We visited TGI Friday's during our lunch break from work.  The place was pretty dead and we were promptly seated.  Normally, I would love a table by a lot of windows.  However, it was winter and it was almost as cold inside as it was outside.  If I wasn't afraid of spilling my lunch down my leather jacket and scarf, I would have worn both of them during my entire meal.

Trying to eat a healthy, lightish lunch, I ordered a Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad because it sounded the best of all the salads.  It had an \"RPRP\" label next to it (Right Portion, Right Price) and was cheaper than the other salads, though, so I was afraid it was going to be a tiny salad and I'd still be hungry.  Thankfully, it was pretty huge and, therefore, filling.  I really enjoyed it and everything on it looked very fresh.  

We only chose Friday's for lunch because I had a buy one get one free coupon.  Otherwise, I would have gone somewhere else because Friday's DOES NOT HAVE ANY LUNCH SPECIALS.  You heard me.  I think they're the only restaurant I've ever been to that does not have a differentiation between lunch and dinner options and prices.  Do I want to spend dinner prices at lunch?  Hell no.

So while we had really good meals and great service for our lunch, dinner prices at lunchtime and a freezing cold dining room deserve the removal of two stars from this review.  Shame on Friday's for not offering lunch specials to its dining guests."}
{"text":"I seldom visit Fridays, but I saw that they opened up online ordering so I placed an order for my family. I ordered a salad, my husband a burger, and my daughter mac & cheese with broccoli. Some of my salad greens were rotting and mushy. I selected no cheese for my lactose intolerant husband, but he had to scrape two slices of cheddar off his patties. My daughter's supposedly steamed broccoli was hard and too difficult for her to eat. To add to it, my husband pulled out a dark wavy hair from his meal carton that definitely did not belong to anyone in our home. Find a different Fridays location or eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really disappointed, So I work for a Restaurant and when something happen we make sure the manager come out and talk to the customers to show great customer service. Well I guess they miss that part in the business... everything was okay till my girl found hair in her food which is really Nasty, we told the server and she said I am sorry and we will fix it and she did. BUT when we got our bill it was 48 and we ask the lady why she said because for them to remake her 
food she had to ring it up again, So I ask to talk to the Manger Cause for one he never came by to say I apologize for that r anything,he walk pass us twice(did not know it was him till I told the server to get the manager smh) when he came over n I told him about the hair all He said was Stuff like that HAPPEN!!!! WTF you don't tell no customer that, While I am talking to him he get a attitude and walk away...He the server drop the receipt off... I wish yelp had a -star If you go here make sure PAUL THE MANAGER IS NOT WORK CAUSE HIS CUSTOMERS SERVICE SUCK!!!! When something like that happen we at least take 10%percent off or jus take it off the bill Nothing.... Retraining Your manager"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because their bartenders are usually good. Every time I've ate there outside the bar service has been terrible. Just left and it took over an hour just for appetizer.  25 minutes to get them, our wings were cold, then another 25 minutes for more wings and they bring back a wrong order. We were very polite the entire time and our server talks sh*t as she's leaving when she brings a wrong order. This seems to happen every time, and even the manager says it only takes 6 minutes to cook them. If you go here, ONLY go to the bar."}
{"text":"Good value for an airport! Got the wedge salad which was delicious. Also the flatbread which was not very crispy but the flavour was excellentl. 10.50 for a 9 oz glass of nice wine. My 2 starters were 12 bucks total. In and out fast.  Super friendly service. I don't know everyone's name but Dante was my server. I asked to split my check *after* he'd already run the bill and he was all \"no problem!\".  
Now I (finally!) know where I can go to eat when flying through Pittsburgh. So long, horrible \"the Burgh bar\" or whatever it's called."}
{"text":"Well we ve been sitting for 40 minutes waiting for our salads.... All I see is the girl behind the bar sharing something on her phone will the other employees.  They're laughing, I'm thinking a call to corporate!"}
{"text":"So I went here last week with my wife I do not recommend anyone going here worst one in town.
The lady wants to sit us in the bar up against the railing right next to machines that people are smoking.
Who in their right mind wants to be enjoy your dinner with their wife while people are next to you smoking cigarettes gambling.
Second problem sit down at the table tables dirty seats are dirty we had to clean ourselves.
Third problem we're sitting there about 10 minutes before anybody offers us a drink or anyting it's our server comes up we order our food we ordered drinks 10 minutes later no drinks no silverware no nothing. Everyone was so worried about getting everyone else to go boxes and so worried about bullshiting on their phones and staying around talking with each other but obviously we didn't matter to them.
And as of now I will never ever recommend anyone or ever stepping foot in their establishments ever again it's sad because this place is awesome but when you have employees that don't give a fuck about your customers then I don't give a fuck about your selfish man and I most definitely will let people know the honest truth I had to put one star just so I can put a review I wish I could have put negative thousand stars"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waiter slow 2 bring water and so called endless apps! Wtf gota wait 30min to reup??
Don't feel I got my 12$ worth! Then suggested my gratuity! Horrible! I'll try another Fridays! Hope it will be better!"}
{"text":"Based on the other Friday's I have been to this one is by far below the standard. We only seen our waiter three times and it took forever to place an order and get our food. Luckily, I wasn't starving or I would have had a bf and that would not have been pretty. It got so bad that when a to go order was placed we walked up to the bar to do it. We got our to go order before our waiter even came back for our cards this was truly annoying and I won't be back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch because we are staying at the KOA next door that's adjacent to the casino. We really wanted to get away from the smoky smell in the casino and we were lucky enough to get a booth far away from the entrance. Greeted by a friendly hostess and seated in a booth in the bar. 

Our server was prompt to come take our drink order and to my delight this part of the whole Sam's Town had Coke. Hubby ordered lemonade. The menu at TGI Fridays is pretty big so it took some looking to figure out what us hungry hippos were up for. Everything sounded amazing. 

I was disappointed the half sandwich build your combos were only available Mon-Fri, naturally. So I had to settle on an appetizer for my small appetite, or small stomach. Husband ordered the salmon Cobb salad and I had the spinach flatbread appetizer. 

Our server was very nice, he told my husband that the salad was his favorite although I wonder if they all say that, but he seemed sincere. Then my husband wanted to wash his hands before eating after being in the casino and he said there wasn't one in the restaurant he'd have to go back out into the casino. Odd not to have a restroom in a restaurant. But he brought us hand towelettes although my husband still hoofed it to the restroom. 

Then onto the food. Husband said his salad was amazing, salmon was perfectly cooked, not dried out, moist drizzled with balsamic vinegar, an abundance of greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, hard boiled egg, bacon, blue cheese and other veggies. Looked amazing and he cleaned his bowl which was a great portion. My flat bread was covered in cheese, spinach and diced tomatoes with just enough crispness to the crust to make it so it wasn't soggy as some flat breads are. Very flavorful and yummy. 

4 stars because of the bathroom situation and lingering smoke smell otherwise very good service and very good food."}
{"text":"Basically what you would expect from Friday's, no surprises. If you want standard mass produced pub food that you can expect from any chain this is the place. Lots of choices on the menu. Our chicken dishes tended to be dry and over cooked. Burgers are a better option. French onion soup was ok, nothing special. My 12 y/o was happy with his ribs. Server & staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Best happy hour around. Great service!! BJ, Brian and Jonthan all rock!

Also no smoking in the bar area. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"This is my late night after class spot. Erika is the, check her mon-fri for a great time and plenty fun...."}
{"text":"Mind you, we were at the TGIs at Sunset earlier this week, had a wonderful server and A+ service. This TGIs is reportedly under different management and it is a disadvantage: We were not permitted to receive wings with different sauces at the same time, nor were we permitted to take our left overs home. Never mind the fact that we waited for a hostess to appear at the hostess stand- staff is very polite, however I think the new management needs to be replaced. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"(Summary: Messed up order, varied customer service, overwhelmingly sweet milkshake, and persisting food poisoning.)

This is the first time I've been to TGI Friday's in a year or two, and I was coming here as a celebration with my cousin.

We walk in the door and see that it's not too busy, but the host is on the phone. We wait for about 5 minutes bedoee before being seated. We're immediately served drinks, which is nice. 

I order the bacon wrapped shrimp (entree, not side!) And my cousin orders potstickers and a burger. They bring out our meals and I have a small plate with 6 pieces of bacon wrapped shrimp. For $15, this doesn't feel right. My cousin checks, and I was mistakenly given the side dish. We're told to keep it and that it will be taken off the bill. Okay, sure. I was asked if I'd like to order another meal, so I ordered a chicken and shrimp meal.

It was average, but nothing special. I get a smores shake for dessert and my cousin gets a brownie. The shake was overwhemingly sweet. I have a sweet tooth and I didn't even get through half. 

We get our check and the shrimp is still on there for $10. What? We ask the waiter and he says he asked his manager and he wouldnt take it off. We call the manager over, and of course he takes it off, providing us with a few coupons. 

I applaud that, but the fact is that it's a day later and I've got some kind of food poisoning that hasn't gone away."}
{"text":"We just went for a Father's Day meal at this location and I must tell you it was a terrible experience. The portions were tiny with very high prices. there wasn't one appetizer less than $12 and the portions are exceptionally small. I then went on to order the salmon and the salmon was about the size of my thumb and I'm not exaggerating. I would not suggest going here to anybody who wants to get their money's worth. and the food was not that tasty at all and on top if it,the service is less than desirable.  Don't waste your money or your time here."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago only because we had a BOGO coupon. Hadn't been here in quite some time and never had any complaints. The parking lot was a bit deserted and the dining room was pretty empty. Seeing this, our expectations weren't real high. We both opted for strip steak combos, one with shrimp the other with ribs. The steaks were flavorful and cooked just right. The breaded shrimp were small, but also cooked right. The ribs were not real meaty, but tender and flavorful. Over all our meal was good, side dishes and all. The dining room and decor are looking quite tired and outdated. Will definitely put this back on our list of places to go."}
{"text":"I killed 5 flies b4 even being served !!! Management offered me a free desert !!! Server Crystal was awesome!! Ya gotta do better !!!"}
{"text":"French dip was decent but small for the price. Service was pretty sloppy. Don't expect much."}
{"text":"I've visited this TGIF before and never has it really disappointed me as it did tonight. Our server was nice but never asked for refills, we actually had to ask for refills ourselves. The food came out quick but the spinach dip we ordered was only decent. The chips for the spinach dip were oversalted as well as the rest of our food. There was so much salt that none of us could finish any of our meals. I will probably never visit this TGIF again."}
{"text":"Went in at about 830pm on friday.  The place wasn't packed, lots of empty tables.  The service was so bad. It took forever to them to get the food out. Even trying to get drink refills took a while. 

We ordered appetizers and after they brought it to the table we still had to wait since they never brought us any napkins or utensils. The rest of the meal was pretty much the same..... super slow."}
{"text":"We read a bunch on how tgi fridays has changed and is listening to guest.  I would like to say the food and service was great....BUT we go in there and there is a manager, hostess,  and a waiter at the hostess both.  We decided to sit in the bar area in a booth.  There were four avaible in the four corners of the bar area.  We walked to each one of them and they were all dirty.  Then as I walk up to the hostess booth to ask for them to clean it... there is now 3 managers and at least 3 to 4 other employees standing at the booth just talking.  I was so upset that they were standing there...  that I told them why we were leaving.  The manager did offer to clean a table personally... but it would of been nice to have a table cleaned instead of walking around a bar to find nothing while they are just chit chatting... sad..."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here after debating about here and alexanders steak house. Since we havent ate at the new location we picked here. The food was excellent we got the 3 course appetizer pot stickers, wings, and pretzels. Then i ordered the 10 oz sirloin and he ordered the jack daniels ribeye with shrimp scampi meal. Our waitress was also very nice and attentive. After receiving our food we ate mine was cooked the way I wanted it (medium rare), my boyfriend ate all his food and left his steak for last. He then cut into the steak and it was a purple red color definately rare and not Medium like he had asked. He immediately called the waitress over after I convinced him to because he was just not going to eat it. She was nice and explained that they could either refund him or cook him a new one. Since we didnt want to wait another half hour to cook a steak and he was pretty full from everything else he just asked for a refund. The waitress explained she would have to get the manager, the manager came over and basically grilled my boyfriend on why he didn't let someone know earlier about it not being cooked how he liked. We explained that he ate everything else including some of my stuff and saved that for last. He even told the manager it was no big deal and that he would pay for it and that he just wanted to let them know so he could tell the cook staff. The manager said no its fine we will refund you. So the waitress brings the receipt over he doesnt even look at it and just hands her a 100$ bill. When she brings it back i looked at the receipt and they took my 13.99 meal off and not his 22.00 meal. He underlined the right meal on the receipt and wrote that they marked the wrong one off, and that it wasnt the waitress's fault. AND he left her a 15$ tip, she was very nice. It was the manager who was very rude. We obviously should of went to Alexanders for steak, with all that being said we will not be going back there again, which is sad because I love their pot stickers! :("}
{"text":"I come in here to catch up with my bud and occasionally have a bite.  I love it great service Larissa the bartender is super cool.  Very chill and good food."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Our server, Gabe was nice. We enjoyed our time at this location."}
{"text":"Caucasian female bartender is awful!  Not only is she very rude and curt with customers, she refused to honor my free dessert coupon via my mobile phone.  She told me I had to go home and print it out, even though the coupon says that I could use my device to redeem it.  I told the manager, who was eating lunch at the bar.  She wouldn't even stop eating to see what my concern was.  Finally, she waved me over to over to her seat. WHAT? I guess my concern wasn't important enough for her to get her butt off the barstool and come to me.  Geeez!!!!"}
{"text":"I order a black & blue ribeye with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I get a well done ribeye. Obviously, they don't know how to cook a freaking steak."}
{"text":"The nastiest food I've ever had!  Waited almost 15 minutes before we got our drinks.  Our apps and meal came within 2 minutes of each other and were cold!  I had to ask the waiter for a refill and a straw because I never received one.  We choked down our food and my husband stood up while he was waiting for the waiter to bring back our debit card and final receipt....some lady came up and asked if everything was ok she said \" looks like ya\"ll are about to run for the door and not pay, go ahead and run I won't stop you.\"  Are you kidding me?  We just had a horrible experience at your restaurant and now we get accused of looking like we want to run.  Given the kind of customers that were in there I'm not surprised if people take off.  I will never ever step foot in this crappy place again and they ruined all other Friday's for me!"}
{"text":"Good place for dinner or lunch. We enjoy all the beverage concoctions the bartenders whip up. The staff is friendly and efficient. The black bean burger is my favorite. They also have an amazing selection of appetizers. It is always a great time at TGI FRIDAYS. The atmosphere is relaxed, but if you need anything, the wait staff is so prompt in providing you with excellent service. The a/c is also always good here. A great place for a weeknight break."}
{"text":"Ok, even though it may have been a management thing the other day, i feel it always is an isolated event.

So today strolled in.. Chad my server was awesome.. service was as great as anywhere.. Chipotle Chicken Salad with extra romaine on the side was one of the better salads that I have had.  It had sligtly sweet notes, tang from lime, avocados, tomatoes , just enougg crispy broken tortilla chips,, shredded well seasoned chicken , but the dressing was just soicy enough to make this very enjoyable.  The best part, Chad checked in when i started, middle of meal and end; inquired if i wanted dessert or anything like coffee etc... I declined..and he didnt just hand me a check like 98% of servers, he returned with the check later..50%+ tip for Chad... hope you read this because you were fanatstic as a server..."}
{"text":"I love the food here it's so good... and this is the second time I get Larry as my waiter.. he's so friendly so are the other staff members but he's the best.. my family will keep coming back 
That Jack Daniel sauce tho"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 30 min for waters then waited another 30 for a simple ceasar salad meanwhile while being ignored by my waitress to ask for silverware. Got up left and went to the cortez room where service is great. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Been waiting to get our food for 45 minutes.   Says they are busy but the restaurant is at 1/2 capacity.   Way to go Fridays!!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant so disappointed!
I'll not be back here EVER. We were rushed through our whole meal and then a dessert was plonked on the table for a birthday that we were celebrating and I was still eating my entree.
My Moms coleslaw was bitter and in general the food was not very good."}
{"text":"Go for happy hour and sit in the bar. Really strong drinks for a great deal. Hubby ordered the Wednesday special rack of baby back ribs. Well worth it. I had the salmon (dry and full of spicy pepper). The wait staff likes to congregate and chit chat in the corner. (Big hint for management)."}
{"text":"GREAT place to go to eat!! My server Paige was too cool. She helped us decide on what we should eat, and recommended the Hawaiian Volcano drink...sooo good. Overall Fridays has a great friendly atmosphere and we can't wait to come back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty bad in customer service our server seemed like she did not want to be there it took a while to get our drinks refilled. 
The food was good as always if we ever go back there we will request a different server"}
{"text":"Saw the commercial, sounded good... so lets stop for some food!  Located by the Galaxy Luxury Theatres.  We've previously stopped in after seeing a movie.  That makes it really convenient for a late night snack or drink.  

But this visit was for my 'linner'.  Walking in you'll notice the banners advertising the $6 appetizers all day in the bar area.  This area is very large so there usually isn't a problem getting a booth or table in there.  Small draft beers are only $2 also which makes the hubby happy! We decided to try the Nachos Grande off of the 2 page appetizer selections.  It was a great choice! Piled high with cheese, chicken, jalapeños and pico.   It also is served with sour cream and guacamole on the side.  Yum.  Great deal.  Great appetizer.

Since it was still during lunch hours, I ordered the lunch cobb salad.   This was the perfect size with perfect toppings.  The chicken, bacon, blue cheese crumbles and avocado makes this my favorite salad to order at any restaurant.  It definitely hit the spot!

Our waitress was awesome.  Our drinks were always filled and empty plates were always picked up right away.  I know there are so many restaurants to choose from in the area but I still enjoy some of the chain restaurants!  Thanks Fridays!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, our waitress was so helpful and personable. The food was great and was quick getting to us. Ordered a couple of drinks that were tasty and they did not skim on the alcohol. I will definitely be back on future visits."}
{"text":"$1 We had a very good lunch over at TGI Fridays. I had prime rib sandwich and my wife had the chicken salad. I believe The waitress name was Lametri. She was very pleasant and food came quickly. The area was clean and everybody seem to be working on the same team I would recommend this for a great lunch"}
{"text":"This was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a TGI Fridays. It was a Saturday evening visit, and it was one of those days...
First off, I've been to this Friday's before, and it was decent. This time, it went bad. Starting off, the atmosphere was awfully loud with a few drunks at the bar, @ 530?!? The food however started ok, and progressively got bad. We ordered two appetizers and our main courses. Apps were ok, not great, but our fried green beans were luke warm at best and our dip was ice cold. We got Ribs and Chicken, and the Ribs were tough and very meatless for the cost of the dish. The chicken was soggy, and tasteless. Our waiter, he was very attentive, but too attentive, coming back every 2-3 minutes asking if everything was ok. It seemed like he knew there was a bigger problem than we thought.. It was a disaster on date night, and very disappointing."}
{"text":"If you visit this particular restaurant, plan to be there for quite some time as customer service IS NOT a priority! It took forever for the server to make an appearance at our table. No mention of specials was communicated either. My steak was chewy and tough. The baked potato was the only tasty item. We were unable to get a refill on our drinks since the server disappeared.
The menu is wayyyyyy overpriced for the quality offered.
We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Super convenient and yummy. Good happy hour. Great service. Some of the most friendly people in the casino. We come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it's all pretty good. Good lunch specials. Sit at the bar for the best service!"}
{"text":"After the movies, we decided to stop in for lunch and I was very impressed with the food and service at this location. 

The hostess was so adorable! She welcomed us in, immediately walked us to our table and then said she hoped we enjoyed our visit and our waitress would be over soon. It is so refreshing to have nice host and hostesses when you walk into a restaurant. In my opinion it sets the tone for the visit. 

Our waitress came over right after and took our drink orders, I tried the blue raspberry lemonade. They are made with a mix and shaved ice...a little pricey at just over $3 but they are unlimited so enjoy as many as you can! I loved it...very refreshing and light and had a very unique taste! 

For the meal I opted for the Pick 2 for $10. I had the fried mozzarella and Friday's shrimp. The fried mozzarella came out hot and crispy, the cheese melted after each bite and it was a lot in the basket! I was very impressed!

The shrimp were delicious again they came out hot and it was a full order, so the shrimp covered the fries....I always ask for  a side of that yummy Jack Daniels sauce on the side...which were a great compliment for the shrimp. 

Our service was great from the moment we walked in the door and the food was hot and prepared just as ordered. In my opinion, this was an excellent visit and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of our late night places to go after work.  The food is fair.  The service is good,  and it's a step up from fast food and other late night places.  I like the black bean burger. I prefer this to blueberry Hill or IHOP."}
{"text":"OMG, i always try to find the best in a restaurant. but i COULDN'T here. We came in on a monday afternoon around 3pm. It was virtually empty, so i thought we'd get some great service, not... Our waitress always seemed rushed, walking back and forth all over the place.

i ordered the steak & lobster (lobster was kinda tough, but hey, it's Friday's right?) and my friend also got the steak, and his girlfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich, and we all ordered strawberry lemonades. the lemonades came out in dirty cups, and my lemonade tasted like soap or idk, so i asked for water.

our food took quite a while to come, but at the time we were in no rush. when we got our food we had asked for some steak sauce and sour cream for my baked potato (tried the steak, wasn't that great on it's own, made me sad) let's just say that my friend had already eaten his steak, and the waitress came and asked if everything was okay. umm, NO where the heck is my steak sauce.

she profusely apologized, and yet still took forever to get something as simple as steak sauce. (i probably wouldn't have been as pissy if i wasn't hungry, and all the preceding hadn't happend, but whatever). they waitress apologizes once again so she comps us a brownie.

so while we are eating the brownie my friend's girlfriend starts to feel very very ill, and now we're in a rush to go so we ask the waitress for a check. it seriously took like 10 minutes for our waitress to give us our check AND we had already asked for a split one, and she gave us one receipt. WTF. so now we wait for that, and we finally left.

will i give it another shot? hell no."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate at this location last night,the food was good but the portion of it not so much for the prices!!My wife ordered the steak and lobster and it looks nothing as it does in the picture.The steak looks bigger in the picture than it does what they serve it's basically half a sirloin steak,service was good thou nice servers,but the food 2 stars I would mostly not come eat here again,pictures can be deceiving!!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday afternoon to party in there unless and was told that I would have to stick with why did I choose and that's the only time I can get if Farr can. I was okay with that with anyone else. Share with the people wasn't happy that I was told that it was coming from the manager that she did not share it doesn't stay in the fine print share."}
{"text":"Great food but, the service could be better.

This Friday's location has been recently remodeled and updated. There is a nice outside dining area great for the warmer months. The food is always good. They offer apps, sandwiches, salads, seafood, burgers, pasta, steaks and ribs. My only complaint is that the wait for your food is ssssssssssssssssssssssllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! You will need at least an hour if you come here during lunch time.

The last time we went the three of us shared the pick three appetizer. We choose  Buffalo Wings, Fried Mozzarella Sticks and Potato Skins. The trios was enough food so we took our sandwiches home for lunch the next day. The wife had the Triple Reuben and I had the Jack Daniels Burger. Our daughter had her usually burger. One thing I can truly say is that their fries are something special. They are extremely addictive!

Drinks consists of typical Coke products and they offer a full bar as well.

All in all a solid place for when you don't fill like cooking.

{"text":"I just had the worst service here.  Eric our waiter was non-existent and we had to seek him out just to get our check.  Food was overdone and nothing to talk about."}
{"text":"order:

crab cake appetizer
Jack Daniels Burger w/ onion rings
Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp w/ sweet potato fried

Crab Cake: was ok a bit bland the sauce helped alot but still couldve been better and was ok.

Jack Daniels Burger: was delish.  flavors went well everything was cooked as asked.

Sizzling Chicken & shrimp. ooooooooooook. we had a major problem here. 2 cheeses are suppose to be in there but it was just 1 american cheese. meh. i had ordered the sweet potato as a side but the waiter came back out saying he can switched my mash potato for the fries. so i agreed canceling the side. the shrimp was alright. nothing special. the chicken was oil under marinated. and just bland in general. the sweet potato fries.. was HORRIBLE. adding salt DOES NOT COMPLIMENT the fries AT ALL. if it was under salted it was fine. but i literally saw chunks on salt all over it... so that was left untouched...after a bite.

our waitor tried to charge us for the side of sweet when it was suppose to be switched out :( but he cancelled that for us.. which is great. over all the food wasnt that great here :("}
{"text":"Rude hostesses, hairy food and extremely undercooked steaks. My second bad experience at a TGI Fridays. I ordered the Flat Iron steak and I've had it before, and it was severely overcooked twice in my first visit. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back. BAD MISTAKE. 

First off, the last two times I have come, the hostesses have been extremely rude and/or have ignored my existence. Once I got to the table, there was a brown sticky substance that I had to clean up myself. 

I ordered my food and it came with two sides. Okay, I asked for seasoned fries and if I could substitute my second side for a side salad. Apparently they can't do that so I had to add a salad to my meal for an extra $4. When the salad came out there was, of course, a nice hair mixed in with my dressing. How wonderful. 

By the time our steaks came out, we could already tell they were undercooked. Our waiter agreed and took the steaks back. Once they came out again, ten minutes later, they were still extremely undercooked. 

The only think good about this place is their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. I won't be coming back. 

They did take off half of my bill, but still..."}
{"text":"Great burgers and strong cocktails. a pity we missed happy hour..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately due to the lack of options in Aliante I have eaten at this Fridays at least 10 times.  I am amazed at how bad the overpriced food is.  I only give it 2 stars because the service is good.  I actually feel bad for the server's, they know you are paying too much for crappy food but try very hard to serve it with a smile."}
{"text":"Worst ever. What my husband ordered was not right' the ribs were tough dry and hard to eat. When I drank my first glass of tea the glass was full of nasty yellow things stuck in it, no it was not lemon. My hamburger was tough. Will never go here again not worth 45 dollars for food that's not good. All manager did was take off our two  dollar drinks."}
{"text":"Food and service are good. Cleanliness is questionable. The Jack Daniels sauce is addicting and it keeps me coming back. I get the grilled chicken with sweet potato fries and extra sauce. The JD burger is also a good choice. Don't have baked potatoes which is a negative. The floor was sticky, and my drink tasted like soap during our last visit. It is cold in the summer, so a sweater is needed."}
{"text":"Walking in, you can get a sense that you're not welcomed by the facts that it takes minutes to get someone's attention to sit, as well as no one is even in the business at all!

Once we realized we were not allowed to share appetizers, the waitress assumed we would be a hassle and avoided our order, avoided bringing our food, and dropped off the check without any statement or compliment.

The manager is a car salesman who pushes overpriced shit that's about to go bad.

2 beers on tap, 1 appetizer, and '3 for $15' entrees; all horrible.  In taste, price, speed, and portion.  $45 later, we walked about disappointed in the fact we just paid steakhouse prices for Applebees food microwaved twice.

Don't do it, not worth it."}
{"text":"I had a great time last Saturday! We were greeted at the door and seated promptly. The waitress was great and very attentive. We ordered the pot sticklers for an appetizer which were AMAZING! I was a little skeptical at first to try them there but sooooo glad we did. I had the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp which also came with steamed seasoned veggies and loaded mashed potato's. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. Mashed potato's and shrimp were amazing! My only recommendation would be a little more seasoning on the veggies.

 After dinner I decided on  a Washington apple martini which was pretty good but definitely not the best I have had. I also joined the stripes club which is pretty cool. You earn 1 strip for every $1 spent on food and in turn earn free food etc. I am already up to a free appetizer or dessert so I look forward to some more pot sticklers! 

I would definitely recommend this for a night out with friends or the one you love the most but it's definitely not a romantic location.

Enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"Walked in and after waiting for a few minutes we had to seat ourselves. The server wasn't exactly the friendliest at first. No hello just asked if we wanted something to drink. I had to joke around with her to get a smile. I'm giving this location a 3 out of 5 stars based on the service and ambiance. The quality of the food was exactly what I expected and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank God It's........ Friday's? Service here wasn't that great. The food was decent though.

Waited a long while to get my steak but it didn't even seem to be busy. I'm not too sure if customer service is much of a priority at this location. Oh well"}
{"text":"The Jack Daniels grill is amazing.

Some of my favorite ribs of all time.  Do yourself a favor and order up the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips as an appetizer as well...you won't be sorry.

Delicious."}
{"text":"Had a quick bite here. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food. 
One of the best franchise restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"If they had hit the bell again, I was about to lose it. I think that was the only thing I had an issue with last night. The food was good, the atmosphere was great, and our server was decent. I think we caught a crowd of karaoke singers (maybe that's why the bartender was ringing the bell?) so it was pretty busy in there. All in all, I really want to give five stars but four will do."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to watch football and have some lunch. We placed a very simple order: Jack Daniels burger, no cheese, and a buffalo chicken sandwich.

The burger came out with cheese, so we sent it back. My sandwich came in two halves, one half of the bread was burnt, and the other half had a SLIVER of chicken on it.

I didn't complain about the underwhelming cut of chicken. But then I bit into it and nearly broke a tooth. It was hard as a rock, and beyond overcooked.

Then I sent it back.

It was crap. Whoever the monkey is in the kitchen, sucks. But the manager, host, and waiting staff were all very helpful and apologetic."}
{"text":"We've always liked Friday's dry rub ribs and decided to try the new rib menu.  Alas, no dry rub anymore but they do promise more ribs for the money and are running a $12.99 full rack special vs. normal $21.99 price.  Comes with two nominal sides--fries and slaw, neither of which have impressed us in the past so we asked for the upgrade sides, which a manager promised would be a dollar more each.   Got the Jack Daniels ribs with sauce on the side--ribs without the sauce were definitely sweeter than the rub but every bit as fall off the bone tender and they were meatier.  As sides, we ordered mac & cheese, spinach and sweet potato fries.  The \"new\" mac & cheese tastes totally like velveta, definitely a down grade from the previous white cheddar.  Spinach was the same but much saltier.  Ditto for the salty sweet fries.

Problem came when the check arrived.  We questioned the price adder for the side upgrades.  The bill didn't reflect the $1 adders and our server didn't really know what happened.  A manager stepped in and took care of the problem, attributing it to a programming error with the new menu.

So, new menu, new quirks.  If you are a regular at Friday's, don't hesitate to ask lots of questions about the menu items.  Newer isn't always better."}
{"text":"Sat down at bar was given a menu. Red head Russian looking bartender hardly introduced herself and took forever to even ask me what I would like. Looked at menu knew what I want but bartender never came back. Got tired of waiting so I decided not to eat there and left. I've been to Friday's before but this by far is my worst experience. Its not the food but that bartender was horrible. Paid more attention to the locals and talked with people she knew."}
{"text":"Good food terrible terrible service the woman at the bar did not even acknowledge I was there and clearly saw me plenty of times. She helped other people that sat down at the bar after me while I'm still waiting finally the man at the bar turned around and acknowledged me and took my order. like I always say service and food go hand in hand at least he made up for it with a smile and a welcoming vibe unlike the girl that was there. And after he brought my food she asked if I needed help get outta here!!!"}
{"text":"We were actually here two times in the past three weeks. Why? Laziness is the probable answer. But in reality, the steak I had was ok and the Mojito was better than I've had in other places. Best thing I can say is that it is better than Applebee's or Chili's."}
{"text":"I like tgif. The service sometimes slack and they skimp on the alcohol in the beverages but it's a cool place to chill if u want to eat and not get drunk."}
{"text":"So disappointed with Friday's last night. The service & the food was a big let down. I always go to this same location& I order the same thing each time jack Daniels ribs & shrimp which cost $21.75 plus I got side Caesar salad. First off I wanted 10 mins for the salad I had to ask the waiter about it. He apologize then it showed up 5 mins b4 the food came out.  I'm so mad I didn't think about taking a picture of this sorry ass small slab of rib it was half the size it usually is it was pathetic. Usually it's a full slab of rib that is almost the length of the plate but this shit was 2 times smaller.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this location. They are not kid friendly. I ask for a high chair I was told they could only provide a booster seat. I told the server that I was treating my Granddaughters out to dinner. She turned around and carded me. Wth!!! I'm a senior citizen and I have to go through foolery. I won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"American restaurant, bar, dim lighting, and don't forget a big screen TV at the bar area. Unfortunately it's not all around the restaurant. The service we had was okay, nothing spectacular stood out. 

I ordered the shrimp chicken pasta and it was served with a spoon.. They gave me a spoon so I had to wait about 5 minutes for the server to come by again to get a fork and the top layer was already cold. I would come here once in a while, not often though."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We ordered drinks and waited over 20 minutes for the bartender to come back. Just paid out and went to Hickory Taverns."}
{"text":"Ok, a friend and myself dined here this past Saturday.  We arrived at 10pm and upon our arrival there was NO one at the hostess station; however, a small group of waitstaff and the hostess were gathered at a table directly adjacent to the hostess station.  We stood there looking at them looking at us like \"why are yall here???\" I immediately thought to myself \"damn are they closing?\"  So I looked at the door to check the closing time, which was posted as 1AM!!! After saying Helllllo to them, a young lady then scurried over to seat us.  

Not a whole lot of people were there (weather was awful that day) and again the waitstaff were just sitting around. NOT good.  A young lady finally came over to take our order for drinks and kinda just hung around looking at us.  I thought this was soo friggin wierd! We then proceeded to order an appetizer of the spinich and artichoke dip, when it came, the chips were burnt and hard as a brick! I immediately sent that crap back! 

We get those back with fresh(er) chips but I still wasn't impressed by those.

Our entress came and were \"alright\".

My biggest complaint was about the waitstaff! (They were just sitting around looking at people like why are any of you here)! LOL  It's my assumption that the management had gone home for the day and they all just kicked back! This place had better get there service together and QUICK! This place is nothing like the old location, which was always a good experience.  But I'll be back, because I like Friday's food and I have some rewards that I need to spend.  LOL"}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place stays in business. We had a party of 6 coworkers tonight. Our waiter never smiled or even seemed interested in waiting on us. We all ordered drinks from the bar and waited 20 mins to receive the beers. I had ordered wine and another 10 minutes passed & I never received it. My husband walks into the bar to ask them since our waiter has told us twice it was coming. The bartender said they can't find the corkscrew!!! (Is this really a restaurant?) Finally they find a wine with a screw off top & serve it. I later get charged $13 for a single glass of wine...surprise! Our entrees came out sporadically with at least 10 minutes in between. From the first entree to the delivery of the last one was at least 30 minutes total. One of our guests had to send her's back because it was inedible. If the food was outstanding it might have made this evening easier to swallow but the food was terrible. The manager did give us 20% off our meal but I would rather have had good food & service. Will definitely NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Server was great! Had to send burger back to have it cooked the way I wanted. Skimpy on sweet potato fries portion for paying extra."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here given the string of horrible recent reviews. I gambled and came here for the endless appetizers special while waiting for my vehicle to be serviced down the road. I was seated right away and given a menu. The server Leisa brought me the endless apps menue and explained the process.

She was fantastic the entire meal. All of the appetizers were cooked well and were delicious. The portions were pretty good size so I could not try too many. This is my first time just eating appetizers for a meal. I normally get a big burger or their ribs. 

I would not hesitate coming back to the location. The seemed pretty good and attentive to all the guests. Lesia (server) was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I was there last night for dinner while on a trip. The fried green beans were as good as back home and my steak was cooked just as ordered for the sizzling steak and spinach. Bartender suggested a great local beer called spotted cow and gave me a few tips on spots to ck out. Great service!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid chains but sometimes I get a hankering for TGI Friday's Jack Daniel's sauce. Plus, there aren't many options in the South Hills Village Area as far as non-chain restaurants go. If you know of any good non-chain restaurants in that area, please help a sister out. 

The food here is consistent, as most chain restaurants are. But the prices just keep going up and up and up. Every time I come here, the prices are higher which is a shame because let's get real, it's kind of just a glorified Eat n Park. The prices are honestly what keep me away. 

Table service at this location is probably better than most other Friday's but I find that this location might over staff the hosts/hostesses. Each time I'm here, there's a group of four or five of them socializing at the front table which I find that they are very often distracted by each other to wait on customers. I also never get a \"thanks, have a good day\" or anything when we leave which you'd think at least one out of the five would be nice enough to do. This isn't a deal breaker but it's nice to be greeted and acknowledged. 

Every now and then, I need a Jack Daniel's sauce fix. That sauce will make anything taste amazing. Otherwise, I try to stay away. If I had to choose between all the TGI Fridays in Pittsburgh, the Bethel Park location would be my top pick."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I ordered potato skins and when they came out they were baked so hard that they dried out. I ordered a baked potato with my meal and it was undercooked and cold.  The salmon was OK but compared to the exact meal I've eaten at another TGI Fridays it was horrible. They will never see me in this establishment again."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with the fact that I LOVE the food and drinks here. It's probably the only reason I keep coming back. 

If you sit in the bar area, your service is generally really good. They cater to you and know how to get you taken care of and turn the table quickly. If you're seated in the rest of the restaurant, forget it. 

We waited for fifteen minutes to even get drinks on the table. I can understand if the bar is backed up, but at least get us waters. 

Servers just aren't as committed outside of the bar area."}
{"text":"I'd say this was a pretty solid visit to TGI Friday's.

My friend and I stopped in Saturday night, it was pretty late when we got there and the hostess asked if we would mind sitting at the bar. We said that was no problem at all! The waitress greeted us immediately and said any of the waiters we saw could help us! Sweet! 

We took a little bit of time to order, but ended up going with the wings with Caribbean Rum sauce and chose your own appetizer with crispy green beans, pot stickers and garlic Parmesan boneless wings. 

The food arrived pretty quickly, but the sauces on our wings were wrong, but the waitress apologized and put another order in right away. The crispy green beans and pot stickers were hot and delicious. Once our second order of wings arrived we were good to go! 

We both left full and happy. So I'd say again, overall a solid visit!"}
{"text":"Ok...Well, I was excited to grab a quick bite with my hubby at this location. Not too busy and we were seated right away. Then we waited,  and waited.  Apparently our section was being taken care of by a new server and she was not quite with the program as the waitress who ended up asking us if we had been waited on said. At any rate we ordered our food and were offered a free dessert per the manager who sent apologies with our waitress. I got the Jack Daniel's burger and it was really, really good. Cooked perfectly and served with pretty decent fries, I was a happy girl. My husband ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken with parmesan fries and broccoli and two huge chicken breasts (saved one for next day lunch). We did choose the brownie for dessert and it was good as well, and a nice offering to smooth over the rough start to service we had. It was a decent overall visit, but based on the experience as a whole, I think three stars is as high as I can go."}
{"text":"Came here after making a u-turn on Sahara & glympsed the TGIF sign.  We work a couple miles away, but overlook this location whenever we hunt for a lunch joint. Turned out to not be busy & the restaurant, hostess and server were very pleasant.  New menu, including the sizzling chicken & spinach, with mushrooms and mashed potatoes--my choice.  Thought I'd have leftovers, but it was hot, flavorful and before I knew it, the sizzling platter was empty! My friend ordered the Cal club with fries and enjoyed it, too, especially the roll.  Our server was friendly,  service was quick enough that we didn't overstay our lunch hour, and our quiet booth was conducive to conversation and catching up."}
{"text":"I was here on the 4th of July because it was the only place open I could find at 11pm. Everything started off great. the hostess was nice and friendly. She gave us our menus and told us our server would be with us shortly.  It took him 10 minutes to finally show up. It wasn't busy at all. Don't know why it took him that long. He too our order for drinks and came 
back 5 minutes later.  At this point, I'm starting to get annoyed.

  We finally ordered and he took our order and seemed confused. We had to tell him 3 times exactly what we wanted.  20 minutes later, our hostess was bringing our food, not the server. WTF? She apologized for the delay. I looked across the room and saw our server handing drinks to another table. Really? We were waiting a long time.  We were all pissed at this time and to make matters worse, he got one of the orders wrong. Nothing remotely to what we wanted. We didn't say anything because we wanted to eat and get the hell out.

  I finished my drink and waited for the server to come by and offer a refill. I waited and waited and waited. He walked by our table at least 4 x and not once, bothered to check on how we were.  After 15 minutes, I finally got up and spoke to the manager. I explained to him what was happening and he asked me to described the server. I gave a brief description  and he stopped me by saying \"Oh, that's Ryan\" with a bit of bite in his tone. I guess Ryan  has had complaints before. The hostess brought our drinks and apologized again.

  When it came time for the check, he actually brought it to our table, the nerve of that guy. He came back to pick up the check and to clear the table. The server dropped silverware on me as he was taking a plate off the table. Good thing I ate everything or else food would have landed on me. That was the last straw. 

  I signed the slip and where it says TIP, I wrote NONE. DOESNT DESERVE ONE. I have always left a tip behind and am always generous with 18-20%, but not this time. The food was good, but the service was horrible. Only good thing was the hostess. I should have tipped her since she was doing his job."}
{"text":"Ok this has to be the worst TGI's I have ever been too. The sliders were cold and flavorless. My daughters pizza looked like cold pizza hut pizza. My husband asked for his steak to be med rare it came well done.  When he mentioned it to the server he had them make another one. This time it seemed like the cook said you want it \"rare mutha f'r\" here you go. It was browned on both sides and blue and cold in the center. I believe that is rare not med rate. So the manager came agreed and took the steak off our bill. The server seemed to busy to even bring us refills. I asked for 3 waters to make sure that we has plenty to drink incase we ran out. All around horrible go to fudruckers if your gonna eat here at the Orleans."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to a lot of chains. Fed up with horrible customer service we usually never went back. We tryed this Fridays and they were great. The food was excellent, quick, and the drinks we fast and  good. The staff was extremely nice and refilled our drinks with out us having to stair them down and ask. The jack Daniels sampler is awesome, as well as the new pretzels they have. The manager is usually walking around asking how is everything. He doesn't seem out of touch with reality rather. We asked him for more sauce he promptly ran to the back and grabbed us some. Would definitely give it a shot if u have not been there"}
{"text":"The servers there were really nice but we waited for over an hour just to get an appetizer and when we asked for ranch, it took another 30 mins."}
{"text":"Came in for a few beers and some bar food. Service is rediculous. They are way overwhelmed and short staffed. They had a sold out hotel for an event months in advance and did not prepare properly.  That is poor management and inexcusable.  Next time we'll take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing that stood out, crowded and slow service, most likely wont be back, nothing to drive across town for!"}
{"text":"TGI Friday's is your normal run-of-the-mill National Food Chain. 

They have a gigantic menu to please groups of people, but everything is just ok. 

I got the French onion soup and the pretzels. The soup was very good. I did enjoy it, with all of it's cheesy goodness. The pretzels however were sub par. I mean who deep fries pretzels? The were greasy and the beer cheese that came with it was chunky. I would not recommend. 

If you come to the mall on a Sunday or before a race at the track, they have Sunday Funday. You can get a 32oz beer for $3. They are gigantic mugs with a ridiculous amount of beer inside. Provided laughs for our group."}
{"text":"I am somewhat of a Fridays regular.  Jodi at the bar is truly an expert mixologist.  She is friendly and attentive.  

Food is serviceable.  Chicken is pretty good, steaks are ok, sandwiches aren't bad either.  I wish there was a pasta dish available.

As I said Jodi is the best bartender around.  Her mixed drinks are to perfection and she is very attentive. Mi can't recommend enough.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a meal especially if you're staying at the Orleans. It's conveniently located on the casino floor. The service was VERY slow upon arrival, with our server bringing one glass of water at a time (seriously?). For the price, the food was fantastic. One of the dishes, sirloin and lobster, was ordered well done, but it arrived at the table rare/medium rare. My rib eye and lobster was cooked perfectly. Considering this is inside a casino, the prices are VERY reasonable. Price for a table of four with an alcoholic drink was $87 and some change. Improve the service here and you have a great place for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Good Fridays location! I had a great black bean burger here!"}
{"text":"Really upset with the service of this place. We didn't even get a chance to sit down or anything, but from the minute we walked into the restaurant, we had bad and slow slow slow service. The guy told us that we needed to wait in line just to put our names on the waiting list to wait for a table. But that doesn't make sense because we just wanted to know how long the wait was before decided whether or not we wanted to even eat here. That's not how restaurants are supposed to work. We should be able to get an estimated time for how long we would wait for a table and THEN decide whether or not we would eat there. So we were upset that they wouldn't help us unless we waited in this line that only had 3 people in front of us, but took FOREVER. After 10 min of waiting without even putting our name on the list, we left. They had soooooo many tables open but didn't have enough servers, so they failed to fulfill the customers. Almost the entire restaurant was empty! And it took 10-15 min JUST to put your name on a list to wait AGAIN another 20-30 min for a table. Unreal."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat and kick back at the bar. The bartenders, Liz, Ashley and Hillary are very polite and courteous. They always make sure my glass is full. The food and atmosphere is comfortable. Sometimes I watch my sports there. GREAT SERVICE!! Cheers to my bartender girls!!"}
{"text":"FIRST & LAST tIme I ever come here!! Never have I been disappointed going to eat at any restaurant in my life but this was my first.. took more than 30 minutes to receive some overcooked/dry/Stale chicken, no point of complaining If I'm going to wait another 30 minutes to receive the same nasty thing.....Such an awful experience, I would never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Had to leave early from Vegas on May 20th and this was
the only restaurant open at 6am.Never ate breakfast at Friday's but had no options.I was pleasantly surprised,our server was friendly and efficient. We received our beverages quickly ( I had a VERY strong vodka and tomato ). The breakfast menu was very limited. My friend ordered biscuits and gravy which he said was good. I ordered the\"Deuces Wild\" which had 2 bacons,2 (very spicy)sausage patties, 2 
eggs,and 2 pancakes.Food was tasty but LARGE portion and couldn't finish.Would eat breakfast there again."}
{"text":"Upon entering no hostess greeted us. Our waitress was attentive and very polite. My silverware was dirty with crusted food on the steak knife. My sliders was bland. The chicken  strawberry salad was way over dressed and the chicken was overcooked. The mixed drink Diddy on the Beach had no pineapple which was in the the posted advertisement ,when asked the waitress said they didn't have any. The parking lot had trash and a dirty diaper on it. Most of this is forgivable if it was very busy but at 12:30 on a Wednesday  afternoon it was not very busy at all."}
{"text":"I have a 2 hour flight delay so I decided to pass the time here. I am very impressed that the bartender is handling this entire area by himself. Shay is the man!!! He is doing an awesome job of ensuring great service in a timely manner. I had the strawberry fields salad which was delicious!!! I dug in before I got a picture unfortunately...."}
{"text":"I'm giving a low review because of the atmosphere.  We (grandparents & family of 4) to celebrate our 17 yr.olds  birthday.  It was  Friday eve.which is typically busy. The talking noise was loud then they started the band!!!! Oh my gosh. You couldn't even talk. You had to practically yell to people at your table. Wait staff struggled to hear. There were lots of families there. Most folks go to eat & visit. Impossible here. We couldn't get out fast enough.  It was like a bar atmpshere. We had no problem with the food. Salads, Jack Daniels entrees all were tasty. Just need to tone down the noise."}
{"text":"I usually stay at the Gold Coast quite often due to its price, quality and value.  A year or two ago they opened a TGI Friday's and I really fell in love with the restaurant.  The food reminds me much of Chili's as their menu is mostly American.  The grilled chicken tacos were tasty and accompanied with pinto beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  

However, on my most recent trip, I wasn't terribly hungry, so I only ordered a small appetizer.  I decided to go with their pot stickers as my friend ordered a large steak, lobster tail, and mashed potatoes.   The waiter was a little rude (or concerned?) when I asked for a Long Island with no sweet and sour.  He kept trying to dissuade me of such a strong drink, but he eventually caved in and brought me my drink.

The food came and my friends entree looked amazing.  The steak looked juicy, tender, and delicious.  He gave me a bite and the steak was amazingly tender and full of flavor with their Jack Daniel's steak sauce.  As for my appetizer, the pot stickers came on a rectangular dish and were nicely presented.  The appetizer included about six or seven pot stickers, which were nicely fried and full of vegetables.  The pot stickers were piping hot, crunchy and tasty.  Although, I was off put by the concerned waiter; I continue to love going to TGI Friday's on my Vegas vacations."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. The food was terrible and cold. The atmosphere was unwelcoming. The server was rude. I certainly paid too much for what I didn't get. Whatever happen to the old TGI Fridays? This place is awful!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop in for a drink and to take advantage of the 2 for $10 menu. And we did not have any complaints. The service was good and the food was hot. 

We asked what the drink specials were because we sat at the bar, and this night they were Long Island Ice Tea's....if you ask me there really is no other way to drink iced tea! But they were as expected, delicious!

For appetizers we got the pot stickers and the spicy queso beef dip and for our meals we both tried the Jack Daniels Chicken Duo- which has grilled chicken on a skewer over jasmine rice and then sesame style chicken with a side of Jack Daniels glaze. YUM!

The pot stickers were wonderful, I absolutely love the schezwan  dipping sauce! The spicy queso dip was good too...it's a little weird because it comes with topped with half a taco shell...but once you take that off it's full of yummy queso and jalapenos and spices for a nice kick! 

The Chicken duo was delicious! I loved the grilled chicken especially which over the rice with the glaze was a perfect pairing. 

Love that they have this deal, and hope it stays around longer!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Great clean atmosphere. It has a ton of seating areas! The waiter we had was great, nice, made sure we were taken care of. The food was good. I ordered steak and half rack of ribs. Steak was very good and the ribs were good. Overall I was pleased."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a date and had an amazing experience! The waiter was really nice and our food was out promptly! We even took long ordering and being a little nit picky to see how he handled it and he wasn't ever without manners! Even though the food tasted just like any other Friday's, I will come back just for the service! He was new too"}
{"text":"Server was a sweet heart but other than that, we would not go back.  One and done.  Kitchen was extremely slow for a week night,  (25 min to get our appetizer). Entrees were underwhelming."}
{"text":"First time to be at a tgif that served breakfast. When in Vegas there a lot of 24hr places with a selective menu. I just wanted to know how there breakfast tasted. They should stick to lunch, dinner and happy hour.

Food was average I had a country fried steak with eggs and hash brown. My mom got the bacon, over easy eggs and toast. 

Service was average. The waitress did check on us ask us if we wanted a refill on coffee. 

Nothing spectacular just diner breakfast food. I took a break from gambling. Lol."}
{"text":"stayed at a hotel near this place for one week and i came here twice first day wasnt anything special but second day was pretty kool. they had live dj and were auctioning 5-7 drinks specials starting at 20-40 buck which all money was going to a good cause for drunk drivers. It did cost 5 bucks to go in but that also went to the good cause but you had the option of not paying it. but they had beer speicals which were awesome."}
{"text":"Oh TGIF Friday's, how could you get some many things wrong with one simple order? My boyfriend and I placed an online order on a late Thursday night (it was around 10:15pm). He ordered the buffalo wingman's burger without the tomato and I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich -- No substitutions, except that he did not want tomatoes in his burger. Once we placed the order, we were instructed that it'd be ready for pickup in the next 20 minutes. When we arrived in approximately 20 minutes, we ended up waiting for an additional 15 minutes. Mind you, it was a Thursday night, so it wasn't that crowded. We left once we got our food and drove about 10 minutes home. We settled in and were about to enjoy our food, but then realized that his buffalo wingman's burger did not have buffalo wings....instead, his beef patty was topped with a chicken patty (Please refer to the pictures). Sorry, but how could you get a simple order so wrong??? So we ended up driving back to the restaurant. It took about 15 minutes for them to make a new burger and we left, again. When we got back to our place, he had a tomato in his burger, although he had asked for it to be left out. And I didn't get a chance to inspect my food closely the first time, but I realized too late that the Cajun onions in my chicken sandwich were nowhere to be found. (Remember, it's supposed to come with my sandwich - I made no substitutions.) My food was also cold at this point. We just don't understand how they could have screwed up a small and simple online order so badly. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Thursday night dinner, had a coupon for 20% off, yeah! Service was a bit slow, ony 2 waiters. Will was wonderful, excellent service, but seemed to be all over the place, due to lack of employees. Food was great, had the wedge salad and the NY Cheddar Bacon Burger. Not sure if I'll be back again, since this is Vegas, but nonetheless was very satisfied with my meal, the hostess was very apologetic due to the wait, which was about 10 minutes, in a near empty dining area."}
{"text":"Went with son. Here for soccer tournament. Food ok. Waitress did not turn in my loaded potato skin order. Made us sit without food for a half hour. As cook got my cobb salad with salmon wrong and waitress him change it before bringing it out. Seating was screwed. Not enough servers on hand. Three stars may be too generous."}
{"text":"Not even 1 star
Ate lunch today with 3 friends and a stink bug was found in the onion soup
We we're all to sickened to eat and asked for our lousy lunch to be comped
The manager would not accommodate and only comped one. It's bad enough to be unsanitary but not too have customer satisfaction to cover the table was unprofessional
Do not eat here"}
{"text":"I went Sat ordered sizzling chx an shrimp ... i sent back ... brought me a sizziling pan an cold chix .. this restraunt is semi clean .. Service was ok although she didnt offer me anything else while i sat an watched my friend eat ... Dont waste your time or $$$$"}
{"text":"Previous experiences with TGI Fridays were so blah that I have not come back in five years. My friends and I nicknamed TGIF as \"That Glop is Food?\". And then I remembered this place has karaoke.  I didn't want to hear some drunk dude screaming \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\".  Well, not when I didn't have an ear infection or wasn't drunk. But my nephew decided, \"TGI Fridays!\" as we pondered the restaurant choices at Aliante Casino. And no karaoke that night! 

We got seated right away. This new beautiful casino has several new restaurants. This TGIF is one of the best looking in their chain.  It's got some dark woods and bright colors inside. It was super clean with less than half the tables filled. The bar is a very classy looking place, and the bartenders were energetic as they heard tales from gamblers who just lost their shirts. We gave our drink orders and our waitress came back quickly with our drinks and took our food order.

I chose the Mac and Cheese with grilled chicken breast. My nephew had the full rack of ribs. My brother had the pork chop with mashed potatoes. Our food came out in about 20 minutes. My dish was excellent. Al dente pasta was tossed with light creamy white cheeses, and topped with grated cheese.  There was a smallish grilled chicken breast. It was a winner and a great deal for $6.00. It was easily the best value on the menu. The pork chop ($13) was nicely  grilled with a creamy side of mashed potatoes.  It was small portion-wise that I wished had two pork chops even at a slightly higher price. My nephew's full rack of ribs ($16) came with crispy fries, not  greasy at all.   The cole slaw taste-wise was flat as a a bad karaoke singer's pitch. But overall, each one of us gave this place a thumbs up.

Since we have a lively time whenever we're together, the waitress was around to check on us, but not intrusive. She was prompt with refills. clearing off plates, bringing the check and running it through the machine.  We had a very nice time.  This time I could honestly say \"TGIF -Thank God It was Fine\"."}
{"text":"So we went here late after shooting some pool with friends. We were hungry and it was on the way home. So why not? :)

I had seen the commercials for the all you can eat apps... And I wanted to try it out. 

We were greeted right away from the hostess and taken to a table.... Where we waited and waited and waited.... The server didn't come to the table until I stood up to go-to the bathroom... From the moment we sat down to the moment I stood up to go-to three bathroom was about around 8 minutes... Not that long... But not that short either. 

And when I told the lady that I wanted the endless apps for my meal she gave me attitude. If that's what I want that's what I want. Geez lady give it a rest. I love apps more then I like entrees... So why not just get apps for dinner? Lol I can't be the first one and I most likely will not be the last. 

I got the flat bread app and it was actually good... Just a little crunch around the edge... Chicken was tender and the BBQ sauce added a touch of sweetness that I liked alot. The fried pickles were delicious! I love fried pickles. The only weird thing was that it was like mini pickle spears instead of the food that I was expecting. Then the potstickers well... They were potstickers....Lol what can I say? It was decent nothing to write home about. :)

My bf got the grilled chicken entree and he inhaled it. The chicken was very tender and seasoned well. The sides were decent. But he was still hungry as it was only 1 chicken breast. He ended up getting the brownie a la mode which he liked as well. It was a little too sweet for me...

Overall the food was decent as I knew it would be. But nothing really stood out to me as something that I would be craving in the near future.

The service on the other hand was a total miss. Besides having to wait to place our order, towards the end of my meal, a large table came in... Pretty much after that I did not see the server at all. We had to flag her down to get our final bill and to pay. They had the little machines on the table and for once I wished that it was working instead of having to wait another 10 more minutes just to pay."}
{"text":"For where I was at and for the deal that TGIF usually has this place wasn't half bad.... I could have spent $50 a person and went to the Bellagio, but what would I do after I ate, gamble? Nay, here at the Orleans they have a 72 lane bowling alley. But that's for another review. 

The servers are nice, but they had a lot of tables that were full so they were spread pretty thin, so I'll grant them some leniency.

So TGIF has a special going on here where it's buy one of the Jack Daniels Specials get another one free. Now that saves at least $14 off the bill and with a group of 5 with an overall bill of $45 we thought was pretty decent (that includes the drinks) so I'd go back here for a quick bite. But remember you're not going to leave here thinking that this is the best of Las Vegas, but you'll leave content that you filled yourself without going over budget. 

I wonder if Rachel Ray's still doing her $40 a Day show....? Well Enjoy."}
{"text":"So I'm not sure what's happened with T.G.I Fridays over the past few years but the prices have increased A LOT and the food quality has gone downhill. 

My husband and I stopped here for dinner after a long day of running errands. It was about 9:30 on a week night so there were only about 2 or 3 people working. When we saw how much the prices had gone up on the menu we considered going somewhere else, but we were starving and figured the food would be really good so we stayed. 

I got a burger with sweet potato fries...that cost $13! And a margarita. The margarita was good. The burger was just okay. And there were only about 12 sweet potato fries on my plate. I think this cost an extra $1.50, so you think they could have give me a few more. The food wasn't bad, but when I'm paying that price I expect it to be awesome...which it wasn't.

The waitstaff at this location were all very friendly. It's just the combination of high prices and mediocre food that make me think my days of going to Friday's are over. There are so many better local restaurants you can get much better food at for a lower price."}
{"text":"Had to try there deal on steak and lobster steak took a while but it was cooked just right and the steam lobster tail with the butter was great 
All you have to do is buy a drink and you can get the deal everyday"}
{"text":"Ate there last week.  Big disappointment.  Prices are up, specials are basically gone.  Food was mediocre and overpriced.  They took a lot of items off their menu that I liked in the past.  This place has had a lot of ups and downs over the past 20 years.  We ate there a lot in the past 2 years and it was very good. But now they're definitely in a downward spiral.  We'll try again in a year or two."}
{"text":"My husband is pickiest eater in the world. He loves baby back ribs here. I usually order something new on the menu. Tonight it was bruschetta shrimp fettuccine dish. The tomatoes overpowered the dish but it was okay. I'd like to suggest at least a piece of bread to accompany their pasta dishes.  
The restaurant itself was well staffed for the dinner hour. Aesthetically I was not pleased with the floor in our area which was strewn in napkins and straw papers. Bright sunlight emphasized greasy finger and handprints on the windows. Makes me question cleanliness of areas NOT visible to diners. JC our server was courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"I haven't had Friday's in quite awhile. The last city I lived in didn't have one. The location in the previous city closed down.  The food was good. The service was good. I liked the service and food here better than the buffet in the same hotel.  My family used the hotel room coupon so we got a free dessert. You are able to pick any dessert from their menu.  Most places will limit a coupon item to only a select few."}
{"text":"Good food quick service If thats If on family side SERVER WAS GREAT BUT... waited 35-40 mins since bartender was busy too busy chit chatting with two other couple's there ,and for some reason my drinks were waterer down I asked for stronger. Even tried a different drink same thing but boyfriends. Was strong like supposed to be we ended up asking for to go"}
{"text":"Well kudos for them being one of the few spots open on Christmas day. It was pretty packed and we  had to wait 15/20 minutes, which was not too bad. We had the wings as appetizer and they taste just out their TGiFridays frozen food line. I remember the sizzling chicken and shrimp being tasty; however not this visit. I know it has been a few years, but I really do not recall that icky marinara on the shrimp. I am almost certain they use to be scampi*shrugs* Our server was just okay and seemed to be little scattered and not as sunny as a few others. We both felt bloated and nauseated later on and this pretty much hammers the nail in the coffin. Highly doubt we will ever return."}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour! We were going to see a movie and told the server was very good and helped us get out just on time for the movie! The service was great but the food could have been better the fries tasted fishy I'm assuming they use the same oil to
Fry them! But I'm willing to
Go back"}
{"text":"If only I give zero stars...
We went to this location about six months ago and it was okay. Not great, not horrible, just okay. 
We went again this evening and won't be back. 
We were seated by a grumpy hostess at a booth with a flickering fluorescent spotlight directly above it. It felt like we were under a strobe! About five minutes later, our server finally stopped by the table at which point we asked to move. He looked up at the light and said, \"What the hell is wrong with these lights? Yeah, sure fine, move here.\" 
Two things: While some don't consider h*ll a swear word (and it is mild), he decided it was appropriate to say while he was working to customers with their young children present. Then, he moved us one table over and they promptly sat a new group at the clubbin' booth.
The menus were sticky and my husband's had someone's leftover food squished between the pages. The children's menu did not include the chicken sandwich listed on the website--when I asked about it, I was told we were at a franchise location, so they don't do the kids' chicken sandwich. This sort of technicality shouldn't be my problem and the website didn't mention that it was advertising for only corporate stores.
Our drink glasses were dirty and we weren't given straws.
We told the server we were leaving and he said, \"Sounds great!\"
Huh.
We went and had a lovely, friendly dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Friday's was my go to spot for late night happy hour. This Friday's was ok. The food was good, prices still 1/2 appetizers, but their restrooms were filthy!!!!! 

You know that old, disgusting public restroom smell? Well... It derived and thrived from this place. Makes me wonder if the health grade was a C! Ew, if I would've went to the restroom before my meal... I would've walked out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Too slow.  Ridiculously slow.  Like it starts to become funny how consistently slow this place is."}
{"text":"Food was good but listen I drink Hennessy on the weekly basis 3 4 times a week I know my Hennessy and I know this shit Here is watered down ... be careful what u drink There Hennessy is watered down"}
{"text":"A simple family night turned into the worst experience ever.... Our server Dani was so slow and non-engaged with her customers it ruined the while evening. Not to mention, getting here at 7:30 and not receiving all of the food in a decent amount of time. At 9:00 we cancelled the remaining order that had not been received.  After asking for the check twice it was in correct with items we didn't even order. Never had a bad experience with Friday's chain in any state until we go Lt to Sam's Town...."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was for our recent dinner at this location. We were celebrating a relatives birthday with a large party of 14 and decided to dine at TGIF.  Both the service and the food exceeded all our expectations!   I had the bacon wrapped shrimp which was simply delicious and my boyfriend has the steak and lobster and was very pleased with the portion and taste. Everyone at our table was very pleased with their meal.  The young waitress who helped us was superior and undaunted with the large party size and special orders(I'm sorry I didn't get her name).  Very pleased with this location and will definitely be back next time we are in town, which is quite often."}
{"text":"It's been a really long time since I had Fridays because of a not so great experience. My family decided to give it a shot for a change in food and were pleasantly surprised. The food was fantastic, not a single complaint and our waiter was awesome. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I have had in a while. The service was absolutely terrible and I would recommend never going to this restaurant. I have never been this disappointed."}
{"text":"Jed is the best!! I come here just for him and Alyssa. Amazing bartenders! Definitely makes you feel welcomed and right at home. Absolutely love them! FOOD! Always amazing! Never a dull moment with them. I come here just for them. Jed makes the most amazing mango mai tai. Always keeps the bar alive."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 (4 adults one being pregnant, and 2 children) for dinner yesterday around 7pm. We ordered endless apps and one entree for the table. Only items everyone at the table consumed was the wings and the ranch. 

Within less than an hour multiple people in our party were suffering from GI issues from wanting to vomit to having horrible gas. Within hours of being home we were all sick. All 6 of us have been up all night intensely sick. This now cuts into our next day resulting in loss of time we needed for important appointments and an already paid for photo shoot for mom to be. We are also insanely worried about mother to be being so sick this close to her due date. 

We should not have had to spend so much just to end up being given some ugly intestinal sickness in return. We would like a response from management regarding this issue ASAP. If our medical issues continue through the day I will be filing a report with the county health department as well for further review. The location was very busy last night so I'm sure many customers were affected.

**update**

28 hours later after eating and we're still sick. I posted my comment on the locations Facebook 17 hours ago with no contact from a manager. Tomorrow I will be contacting corporate office as well as the health department to complain."}
{"text":"Don't waste your hard earned money and this dive. It's filthy, the service is horrible, the bartender can't make a proper drink.  There's no consistency with their food or drinks.  Will never go back. I wouldn't even give 1 star but had to in order to post s review. We sent the drink back and the bartender added so much liquor to it you couldn't drink it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. A new waitress on a busy Friday night. Never again. Horrible horrible horrible.
It took 40 minutes to get drinks! Not even a glass of water. Apologies were given, however my boyfriend's dinner came before we received our drinks! Not to mention that when we finally received our drinks he was done eating his meal and 2 minutes after that my plate came out! Horrible. I really think our waitress forgot to put our order in. She blamed everyone but herself."}
{"text":"I went to TGI Friday's on 08/23/15 at approximately 6:30 pm. I set at the bar, the service was okay, nothing particular. I have had better service. The staff at the bar didn't seem to be upbeat, and I the manager didn't check on the customers. That speaks volume when the manager walks around and checks on the customers. I had the classic burger and French fries. I had the same order in Alexandria, Va. The food taste better at the TGI Fridays on King Street and the wait staff appeared to be more upbeat. I had a coupon from when I ordered a burger in Va, the TGI Friday's near Concord Mills didn't honor the coupon, I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because of the food. Otherwise the experience was horrible. The server did not bring set ups with silverware or water and even when I asked she brought it after I had my food. She was very rude and did not even ask about how I wanted my buffalo wings- just gave me the spiciest."}
{"text":"I went to this TGIF yesterday, and i order the babyback ribs. I feel as though they have left it out for a while or it was overcook, and it was also really dry. and maybe they just put bbq sauce on the ribs, but i do enjoy their buffalo wings. it was spicy just the way i like it."}
{"text":"Met a high school friend here for beers and b.s. Staff was friendly and polite,  chatty and pleasant. Being that my friend is from out of town lots of people had Vegas \"must -do ' s \" for him and he loved it. Just a great evening,  he still mentions it."}
{"text":"Both appetizers are cold. You can blatantly tell that the potstickers were frozen beforehand. Since no mini plates given, my napkins aren't sufficing. Asked yet still no plates... Oh, I was waiting for my entree to come but I felt like leaving since they took forever. Didn't stop by for a status either. Do I have anything more to say? No..."}
{"text":"I stayed away from this chain for years, but after a business trip forced me into their doors multiple nights, I gave my home location another chance.

The food is predictable but getting more adventurous over the years, and the korean tacos are pretty exotic. I try not to eat here without looking at the nutritional information in advance; the one time I didn't, I ate half an appetizer (loaded baked potatoes) and a salad and found out that was 2100 calories. There were also pretty substantial delays in service. My other half dozen visits have had excellent service and well prepared food. Maybe the staff wasn't at its best because they were here on New Year's Eve?

Though I seldom use it, they have a very nice drink list, especially if you're a fan of tequila. It's also one of the few restaurants I know that offers reward points for eating there. All in all, I choose to go here for a standard night out with people who can't agree on what they want to eat."}
{"text":"The service was great until it was time for our food.  The New York strip steak I ordered was very rare especially when I ordered it medium. It was sent back twice and the only part put back on the grill was the part I cut off to examine how done it was. I got to eat the potatoes and jasmine rice but the steak and soggy shrimp did me in. I got compensated for the meal but that didn't  help the bad feelings I had afterwards."}
{"text":"I was here the other night with some friends. Not the Fridays I normally go too a little out of my way. Anyway, the service was great sat in the bar area the servers was friendly and the bartender kept us entertained as well. They have a new bacon Mac n cheese balls. Taste amazing. They have a new try 3 or try 4 appitazier for about 15 bucks deffently worth it. The the crispy sushi one was eh wouldn't get it again but the other 3 I had was good would go back for it again. If you go sit in the bar area you will enjoy the evening we did."}
{"text":"Had the full rack of ribs they are pushing on television for 12.99. They boasted on the television spots as meaty. Mine were very sparse and very dry and some pieces so dry they were almost inedible. Service was professional and kind. The food was not."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant in a local's casino on the bad side of town. It's sufficient and fairly consistent. Hit up this spot for an easy dinner before seeing a movie at the Century theater across the floor. Request indoor seating to avoid casino smoke (open \"patio\" gets the fumes). Service is attentive, with most servers training another employee.

Food on most recent visit was priced a bit higher than I expected but it's been ages since I've been to a TGI. They've added new menu items to try to stay trendy, and I really appreciate that they list their calorie count and nutrition info on the menu- went with a soup/salad combo instead of other dishes I was eyeing. Food was fresh, friend got a skillet meal that was sizzling and flavorful while mine was as expected. Drink refills were prompt, which is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Arriving at 6:20 pm on a Tuesday, we did not receive a greeting nor was the host to be found. Approx. 5min later host said there was a 25 min wait. We agreed to wait, a table for two.  As we came back host didn't recognize us nor had she wrote my name down. As we were seated the host had clearly just wiped down the table and seats with a wet towel not knowing we sat down and we're very uncomfortable due to the fact that our jeans are now wet from the wipe down. I will no longer come to eat here. Despise the fact that this was not my first time. I've been here 3 times and all 3 times have been a horrible experience. I will take my money else where."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the quality and service.  Was seated and had to wait about. 10 minutes for our drink order then another 5 for straws since they werent left with the drinks. Asked for a water a bit latwr and that too took 10 minutes.  When the food arrived it was barely lukewarm and the shrimp was incrediblely soggy.  As we were leaving server tried sitting a group at a table that hadn't been cleaned yet.  Bad place to go.  Way to expensive for the quality of food.  I recommend Chilis over this place."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Teusday, 7:30pm, hardly anyone there. Now I know why. Stood at front reception desk for almost 5 minutes before someone came and proceeded to tell me what a bad day she is having....I DON'T CARE! Then getting passed by several times with servers without asking if I cared to spend money on their overpriced drinks. To sum things up, great food + poor service= one less customer....me! What a shame in management."}
{"text":"Friday's has always been one of my favorite restaurants to go with family, but today I had one of the worst experiences ever. As a server I always try to give other servers second chances to correct mistakes they make while out eating. Our servers name was Holly not only did she take 20 minutes to bring us water and 2 beers which she messed up in the size, she was also very rude! When we asked her if she had put our order in for our beer she had the nerve to roll her eyes at us for her mistake! We went for happy hour and we were planning on ordering some more appetizers for our group but she was no where to be found, it's as if she hid for long periods of time waiting for happy hour to end. I try not to judge a server for being slow or even a little forgetful because we all make mistakes including my self, but being rude for your own mistakes is uncalled for. We do appreciate the manager who was working at the time, because he was understanding and he did try fixing the crappy experience she gave us. He was very professional and kind, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to fix the rude attitude she brought to our table. We won't ever be back to this location!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this Fridays location around five thirty on 12/30/2012. This was perhaps one of the single most wretched dining experiences I have ever had.  I had been initially impressed by the renovation of the building, it looked quite nice inside. However, it  soon became clear that the staff was very very poorly trained. The waitress, though terribly sweet seemed lost in the menu. It took ages for the first wave of food to arrive at the table, and the kitchen sent out one entree ten minutes before the rest. Forcing one friend to either eat cold food, or eat before the rest of us.

When the bulk of the food did finally arrive,  it turned out that the kitchen had forgotten to prepare two of the entrees. The traumatized seeming waitress apologized and scurried off to try and get the kitchen to prepare the rest of the food.  Flash forward twenty minutes later, and she brings *one* more entree to my friend and says \"OK! Have a nice meal\"  It was at this point that we all realized that she has no idea that I had also still not received my meal.  She acted surprised, and then tried to act as if I hadn't actually ordered anything. Then when she reviewed her ticket she came to the realization that she had simply forgotten mine altogether. At this point, everyone else was finished with their food, and I was starving and exceedingly cranky.  She went back to the kitchen (Which is exposed to the dining area so everything they are doing at the food window can be seen. Especially when they are dramatically talking about a table that they are unhappy with) and waved her arms about angrily to the female manager in the pink sweater. About ten minute later the waitress finally produced my tepid food, slapped hastily onto a plate. Starving, I didn't bother to point out that they had not included one of my sides, but did ask to speak to the manager. This manager was in no way shape or form prepared to handle an upset customer. She arrived at the table combative and rude. The way to handle a customer who is rightfully upset with their treatment is not to then embarrass them for complaining and still not comp their meal or even bother to offer any sort of *genuine* apology.  Pink sweater manager on duty. Please report to corporate for proper training on how to both run your restaurant, and deal with the unhappy patrons you have tortured.

I paid for my meal, and tipped the waitress twenty percent, as it was not her fault that the manager had not correctly trained her. However, I would suggest avoiding this location at all cost until it  receives further training intervention on the management level from corporate. Had the manager been polite, and handled the situation properly, this review would have been unnecessary."}
{"text":"Pretty poor and slow service. Took fooooorever for the drinks and food to come. Waiter was nice but whomever is managing this location needs to be replaced."}
{"text":"We had ribs & flat iron steak on one plate, ribs & lobster on the other. Everything was cooked to perfection. On top of that, our server (Chris) was super friendly and made entrée suggestions that we took advantage of. We weren't her only table, but she made sure that we were taken care of with refills, extra napkins etc. We will definitely be returning.....and asking for Chris!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at TGI Friday's isn't a normal experience for me but a nice option when on vacation.  Forgot what my friend ordered but I ordered the Portuguese sausage, scrambled eggs, hash brown with English muffin and a slice of orange.  It was good but wasn't enough so I also ordered a plate of fresh fruit which was way more than I expected and the fruit was ripe and juicy.

It was still pretty early in the morning so there were only about three other tables being served and the lone waitress was friendly and efficient, coming around to check regularly on our needs.  The interior is eclectic and lit up with highlights to show off items on the walls.  I liked the ceiling pendant lights that looked like Captain America's star, it helped to liven up the dining areas.  

My big negative is that they don't enclose the restaurant as it is a no-smoking zone and of course the casino gaming area is not and the smokey air easily drifts inside the open air dining areas.... cough cough ack!"}
{"text":"When walking in,  there was no wait.  The girl looks at my boyfriend and asks if we were the party of 5. I said no,  just 2. She continued to look over us and continued on with other business. We sat down  figuring we had to be next. 3 other groups  walked in and we're immediately  seated. I figured they had to be reservations. So I asked if they were aware we had been waiting. We received  minimal  apology then they seated us with someone's walker crammed  behind the table (in between  tables). The service was terrible and we will not be returning to this location ."}
{"text":"Up until about two months ago I was a big fan of Friday's, especially this location. I went there a couple of months ago and waited at the front. And waited. And waited. There were about ten people waiting to be seated, and we had stood there for nearly 15 minutes. One person wiping tables looked up and saw us all standing there, and went back to wiping tables. We left and went to the hotel buffet.

About a month later we went back. No problem getting seated this time. The problem was getting waited on. We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes and no one approached us. Finally, as we were about to walk out the door, the waitress came by and handed us menus. She said she would be \"right back\" with our drinks. Another 15 minutes passed (the place wasn't terribly busy). By this time I was fuming - and I'm usually pretty calm and tolerant about these things. Finally - 45 minutes after we were seated - we got to place our order. When the food arrived it was overcooked and dry.

Add bad service to the significant price increases throughout the Friday's chain ($16.95 for a dish with two pieces of chicken? Really?), and my love affair with Friday's is officially over. When I complained to the company they sent me two $8 dining certificates (which together wouldn't pay for a Jack Daniel's chicken platter). If anyone wants them..."}
{"text":"Gross food. Ordered the sriracha wings and they tasted old! The fries were even all wilted!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place, but my experience tonight was HORRIBLE! Hard, day old bread in my French onion soup, water tasted like; I can't even explain. I waited 15 mins for a sprite. My waiter was totally inattentive ... I'm so irritated with 2 giggly waitresses running around making noise was completely unprofessional... I
Will NEVER come back here!!! I believe Evans if that's your actual name needs a refresher course on taking care of the customer."}
{"text":"After having a terrible experience at a different restaurant and walking out I came here in hopes of getting a decent meal. And it was!! My server here was amazing. The manager was very attentive at the front of the restaurant and I made sure to tell him how great the service was today.

I was also delighted to see some old familiar items on the menu. I have not been in a Friday's in probably 4 years or more, but the sight of the sizzling chicken brought back memories of my favorite dish. It was prepared perfectly.

Also, they (like most casual dining restaurants) are on the pretzel and beer cheese kick, but the ones here were definitely better than some of the others I have tasted.

Overall, I was very impressed with this place... if I was a local, I would probably frequent this place!!"}
{"text":"I used to love TGI Fridays, and more than likely had I gone to the one up by my parents' house or the one up in State College this might have been a 4 STAR affair, however it is not and here's why:

Right off the bat, the greeter might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying \"I Hate My Job, Possibly My Life, Ergo I am a black-hole destroying all signs of positivism\".  I had to open my own door, which isn't a big deal except HE WAS HANGING AGAINST THE OTHER DOOR.  Duuuuude, get out of the way if you're not going to open the door.

The shame of it all is that I entered hungry the restaurant hungry.  So after the door debacle my spider senses are going haywire, further confirmed by being greeted with \"Is It Going To Be Just You Three?\"  What?!  Who talks like that?  With a slow gait of a walk and a disconnected facial expression were taken to our table ... oh and it wasn't cleared.  We got an exasperated (oh yay signs of life!) \"hold on just kidding let me clean this\" and after about 5 minutes of him running around looking for a \"rag\" as he asked the wait-staff, we sat in a lysol-like smelling table--heck! at least it was clean.

Now the purpose of this trip was simple.  Get an appetizer, eat only half, then indulge in one of their larger desserts.  Well at this point the whole just being seated experience had thrown me for such a loop that I wasn't hungry.  I got their potato wedges...usually a pretty safe bet...but WRONG.  Apparently loading them with cheese cuts too much into profit margins or something because it was potato plus a table spoon of cheese and a table spoon of bacon bits.  So a tad on the bland mostly potato side of things.

Our waiter/server/dude was more alive than the greeter, score!  But still the entire staff just didn't seem be all OK with being at work, which heck I get it, but in the service industry you suck it up and move on.

In the end I was so bummed that I skipped dessert and called it a night.  The whole thing was forgettable, so it might be a while before I return to Fridays."}
{"text":"Empty restaurant yet still slow service. I felt like i was a burden. Will never return. And no tip left they didnt earn it."}
{"text":"Loved my experience. The Bartender who was from Minnesota was extremely helpful and courteous, as well as beautiful. Would definitely come back time and time again! Much love from Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Slow, boring food. Two stars because the staff were nice and the good didn't look like it would make me sick.  There is no reason to come back."}
{"text":"The bar at Sam's Town is pretty good; the prices are what you would expect for mixed drinks. The drinks we tried were the strawberry hurricane and the Hawaiian volcano, which were both pretty good! The strawberry hurricanes were sweet and not too strong with alcohol and the Hawaiian volcanoes were stronger than the strawberry hurricane, but still tasted good. The bartender took a little while to acknowledge us, which shouldn't have happened since there were multiple bartenders present. I would definitely return again though, the service was good once we were acknowledged, and they were very friendly to us."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times.  I would say this is in line with every other Fridays I've been to.  Their happy hour specials are great.  The food tastes like you'd expect from an American chain restaurant.  The service is okay.  If you are at Aliante or in the area and looking for this type of food it will suffice."}
{"text":"TGIFriday's just always leaves me underwhelmed. We go there because their \"Stripes\" reward program does give us great discounts, but their menu selection is just too limited and the prices are high. I wanted just a salad with crispy chicken and they did not have one. The server told me they could make a salad with three chivken tenders on top, but no whole breasts. I don't like that pecan crusted chicken. Plus, all their signsture meals are made with alcohol based sauces. Jack Daniels sauce, apple cider sauce, beer cheese. How these chains stay in business, I don't understand."}
{"text":"Server was pleasant. The food is not good, no flavor served lukewarm.Staff doesn't really seem to care about where they work. The hostess sat us with menus that were ripped , had missing pages  and were completely filthy. Stains all over it,binders falling apart, very unpleasant. 
We tried this location because the location inside the Orleans was even worse. Needless to say this will be our last visit to this chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Before you ask what I was smoking when I gave this Friday's 4 Stars, hear me out.

I came in here for a late dinner during the week. Probably around 9PM.  It wasn't too crowded and we got to sit down right away.

The service was slow, I think they were probably spread thin. But our waiter was very friendly and other servers seem to help each other out.

The food was pretty tasty,(I may have been hungry), but never the less I thoroughly enjoyed my Jack Daniels Steak and Shrimp Dinner.

It did take a while for our food to come out which was surprising since there were not a lot of people in the restaurant, but I have no idea what the kitchen size/situation is for that place."}
{"text":"Two stars-- 
Jorge, our sever, was very attentive. 
Food was good and prompt.

There was a discrepancy about cost for my husband and I's Long Island Ice Tea.

I only wanted to come for happy hour. There were no booths on the happy hour side. So I was told I needed to go on the other side by the hostess.

We ordered our food which came out quick-- but delicious. 

Btw. We visited with our 3 children. One of which is 6-- we won't have dinner at bar seats if regular seats are available.

Anyway, we get the check. We were charged $9.25/each per drink instead of the $6 happy hour charge. 

The server, Jorge, offers to get the manager to fix the discrepancy. 

The manager, Paul, arrives and is very unprofessional. He originally has a oh well approach until we tell him we originally requested to sit in the bar area. He finally decides to charge us $6 each instead as a one time courtesy with an attitude. Bravo you honored the $6.50 difference. His demeanor was as if he donate a kidney. 

We will NEVER come back based on our sole interaction with Paul. 

Congrats. You've lost a customer and even though we don't come too often. I'll be sure to make it my life mission to deter people from coming to this location. 

You know they say word of mouth can be very impactful."}
{"text":"Well Fridays,  I think we are going to go our separate ways.   Your food was good,  the service used to be good and the beer was cold,  however,  the last 3 visits to different locations have proven that it's not just a location issue it's a company wide issue.  

We had horrible service today for a lunch and the fries were nasty.  It took the server over 10 minutes to even take a drink order.  I was seated without a kids menu and when I did get one,  no crayons.  That's not a deal breaker as I carry them with me.   Our food took an ok amount of time and was super hot.   We had the rib special and chicken fingers as well as kids mac n chs.  The fries that both my husband and I had were horrible.   Cold and mushy.  The manager was so busy running food we couldn't flag him down.   Our server never truly stopped at the table she only paused long enough for us to say any thing as she kept try to serve the other table more then us that was right behind us.  I honestly 
felt like the \"red-headed step-child\" and was a huge bother to her.  Even trying to pay she never truly stopped at the table just tried to grab and run off until my husband said there was a striped reward written on there    She tried to say she didn't need anything but the phone  number, but my husband was trying to tell her there was a reward to redeem number written too.  

I don't think they were under staffed as I saw many employees running around.  It seems as if a company wide training needs to happen since this seemed to be the same situation at all 3 locations."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch today with a friend. We shared the Spinach Queso Dip appetizer ($8.70), which contains spinach, white cheddar queso, Parmesan and bread crumbs, and served with tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole, was delicious and plentiful, along with a glass of Long Island iced tea ($4.00). The California Chicken Club sandwich ($10.20), however was not good, as the chicken tasted like it wasn't fully cooked, although the rest of the sandwich ingredients were fantastic...toasted baguette with hickory-smoked bacon, smoked Gouda cheese, chopped romaine, tomato, avocado and yogurt aioli...so that part is what I ate instead."}
{"text":"Giving this a five star because of the manager mary.
 I ordered a steak and lobster and did not realize how small a 6oz steak really is. It was very petite and I told her it was small and wasn't expecting that.
 She kindly apologized and informed me that they were 06 oz and on the smaller side. She then gave me a free steak as an apology for the size. Also the waiter was very timely with everything."}
{"text":"Our server Paige. Just wow. We have limited diets. Gluten Free needs. We aren't easy. Not only was Paige extremely friendly and accommodating, she didn't make us feel in any way bad. Some servers, well, you can just tell they aren't in the mood to take special food requests. Not Paige. She was super nice. Our needs were no biggie to her at all. And when the kitchen screwed up hubby's burger, she immediately made it right. It was a breath of fresh air!

Food was tasty. No complaints. Really yummy. But Paige, she's worth going for, especially if you have food sensitivities. She will be helpful and understanding. 

Thank you Paige D. :) It was great meeting you!"}
{"text":"This Friday's is the absolute worst, It was my birthday and they sat me my wife and my elderly mother at the bar, the bartender wanted nothing to do with us very unfriendly, my wife had to ask three times for plates and silverware and they still didn't bring a setting for me. I had to get the manager and leave it was so bad and I am very patient as I am a manager myself but the way they treated us was awful not a happy birthday at all."}
{"text":"Drinks way over priced!    BWW and Hooters captains are 3 dollars right now during the games, this place is $5.99.   No wonder there is nobody here watching the games and the other places are full. 
I know times are tough, but good god.   Do some market research and at least make an effort to compete."}
{"text":"Today's service was good. Food was excellent. We were immediately seated and the food came out really quickly. Which really helps with little ones. They can get impatient. The food was delicious and the restaurant staff was accommodating."}
{"text":"This TGI Friday's is one of the only sit-down options available to people flying through the Pittsburgh airport. I admittedly don't eat here too often since I prefer to grab a muffin to go during my mornings. But when I do eat here, I enjoy my meals well enough. 

Really, my biggest gripe is more with TGI Friday's in general as opposed to this location: their menu is EXTREMELY limited in the low calorie department. As in, you can count your healthier meal options on one hand with fingers to spare. That sort of thing doesn't do people like me any favors when I'm flying and sitting still in an airplane for hours at a time.

But, like I said, that's not something I can hold against this specific location. And for what it is, this TGI Friday's is ok enough. During my last visit I was mostly disappointed by my Long Island iced tea. I think he ice diluted my beverage a bit much for my taste, and I'll be keeping that in mind the next time I eat here if I'm thinking about ordering an alcoholic drink.

Fortunately, my meal at least made up for the \"meh\" Long Island. I ordered their healthy chicken platter meal, and was surprised to find that the chicken was exceptionally tender and the sides seasoned, fresh, and delicious. It was much better than what I'm used to eating at a TGI Friday's. (But I feel obligated to mention that my dining and travel buddy's steak was not nearly as tender.)

So, like I said, they're a-ok. They're a decent option if you need a sit down meal here. Still, I wouldn't cry if a new sit-down option opened in the airport (especially if they offered more healthy options!)."}
{"text":"Came here our first night in Ohio cause we were in a hurry and it was next to the hotel. This place was dead at 8:30 at night. All the servers were sitting in a booth hanging out.

Our waiter was over quickly. We ordered 2 salads and a bowl of soup. Should be quick right? Toss some lettuce around, pour some soup in a bowl. Plus, there were maybe 5 other people in the restaurant.

No, we waited 30 minutes for the food! When the waiter brought it, my dad told him we were in a hurry, so bring the check now. 

By the time we paid and left it was 9:30. The food was fine, it was soup and salad, can't really eff that up. But the service was ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and two errors in our orders - not really surprised but was hoping for better. Food was hot and the summer all day happy hour drink prices were good."}
{"text":"This Friday's location is average. I would actually probably say a little below-average, but I'm going to be nice. The service is actually really bad. I'm sorry, but it is. You are better off going to a mom-and-pop style local restaurant. This chain has lost touch with reality, probably due to a corporate mindset. The meals are undersized and overpriced! Pay $17.99 for a steak and you expect a decent sized meal at a restaurant of this caliber, but you get a very shriveled up piece of meat with very small portions for side dishes...  Corporate freaking welfare man!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch, party of 8 and everyone was pretty happy with it. The service was good, in fact our server never wrote anything down and we got all our orders correct except one person did get sauce on her sandwich instead of on the side. I had the California Club and it was excellent, so really no complaints here. Probably the only thing is that a few of us felt that the prices were just a bit high for what we got."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!

After having a bad experience at the Westlake location we decided to give this location a try after they sent us a gift certificate.  It was not any better,.  TGI Fridays does not train their staff.

First we where shown a table a the bar when the place was almost empty.  Are we being hidden away?  We were given a table only after asking.

The server came write over and took our drink order and told us to try an item but did not explain it.  Drinks arrived and orders taken.  

We opted for a small salad as a side dish.  It was a SMALL salad!  The main meal came and service when down hill after that.  The server or anyone else never picked up the salad dishes.  Those dishes sat on our table during the whole meal.  We never saw the server again until we asked for the bill.  We were never offered refills or asked if we needed anything else.

The salmon and lobster dish was very small and not wroth the price.  The sweet potato fries where also small and cold.

The other dish was a steak with what was supposed to be steak fries.  Instead they where jo-jos and they were cold.

The host keep walking up and down the aisle with a dirty rag and never noticed used dishes still on the table.  We also observed that other tables still had dishes on the tables after the guests have left..  The place was not busy at all.

When the server came over and we asked for the bill none of the dishes were removed.  Only after we paid did the server start to remove dishes.


Sent a comment to TGI Fridays and did not receive a response. They don't care about training their staff or the customers.  The food is so-so.  There are too many other great restaurants to choose from than to bother with TGI Friday's again.

{"text":"I've eaten at this location a few times now. Dining in isn't too bad, the food and service are both decent at best. 

We ordered take-out a few nights ago when we were bowling upstairs. It was absolutely terrible. We got the combo sampler platter thing with wings, potato skins and mozzarella sticks. Everything was cold and had clearly been sitting for awhile and there wasn't nearly enough food for $17. Asked for no bacon on the skins, they were all covered in bacon. It all tasted terrible. Just an overall bad experience and they weren't even friendly when we picked it up.  

Normally I wouldn't be so harsh but this is like the 3rd time i've gotten take out from this location and its genuinely awful each time. No more chances!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant chains.  Customer relations is a joke.  The food is just so-so and it seams that is owned by Jack Daniels since half the menu has it smothered with it.  Selection can be much better and same at all locations..  Very loud."}
{"text":"Got there when they opened for lunch, waited 40 minutes for a couple of cheeseburgers. They were cold when we finally got them.  Pretty sure the coleslaw was at least a day old. Service was slow, food was bad/cold. Won't be back.  Too many bad factors to assume I won't have to deal with at least one of them again."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. Couldn't even eat the food it was so burnt. Asked for bill and left. Don't waste your time or money here"}
{"text":"A T.G.I. Friday's is a T.G.I. Friday's. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).

Honestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.

Once we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.

This T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I'd consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn't be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here three times.  The food was consistently excellent, as was the coffee.  Having never eaten at this chain (I avoid chains) I was quite pleasantly surprised.  Go for the Hawaiian omelette.  The first time the service was very good, a gentleman serving.  The next time got served by a woman that, though friendly seemed flustered and forgot things.  The place wasn't very busy at the time.  My last time was on a Monday and a slender blonde waitress gave superb service.  If I owned a business I'd try to steal her away.  Just really top notch.  Kudos to her and the cooks."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night with a friend and had terrible service. It took 10minutes just for a glass of water and 20minutes for our beverages after we ordered them. Aus Jus on the French dip sandwhich was more like gravy and did not taste good at all. Took forever to get anything. Worst service I've ever had at a TGI Fridays"}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. It's TGI Friday's... What else is there to say. Not fantastic, not terrible. 

If you're looking for good food fairly quickly without emptying you wallet, head on over here."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the worst experience ever at this location. We came in and were seated right away which was a good sign. There were several large parties so we were patient. But it took almost 45 minutes just to get the appetizer. They advertised that the endless appetizer would be a good deal and yet they took that long to come out! What was the point?? But then it took an additional 45 minutes, a total of an hour and a half to get our entrees. The waitress had a good attitude and came back to apologize for the wait time but there was nothing she could do to salvage this experience. We told her we would just like our food to go and the check. And we ended up still getting served our food by someone in the kitchen who didn't get the memo so we had to box it up ourselves. And of course, it took an additional 20 minutes to get the check. So we left, still hungry and no manager or supervisor ever came by to check on our experience. They knew what was happening because we saw others speaking up, but they weren't going to acknowledge it unless we went to them first. It's sad to see a place with such good food be that terribly run. I won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"It was food.  That was about it. Service was good but food was not worth the price, we could have went somewhere much better for the same or less money.  

We wanted a place for a early dinner and decided on here because of the location and other plans. 

Kids both ordered wings and they where good. Wife and I both ordered sirloin and lobster tail. The tail was a joke, So very very small and no taste. The steak was good.

Well, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to TGIF forever and a day now. They have good average food! I usually come here when I'm craving a good burger or the Jack Daniel chicken strips. The chicken strips are no longer offered as a lunch or dinner item but you can order the app as your main meal with a side of fries. Gotta love TGIF and we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Steak overdone, rice dry and overdone, poor service.  Very disappointing birthday dinner for my son."}
{"text":"2 stars for the slow service. I understand when a server is really busy it can get hard; but at least check on your table after the food has arrived & not come back when everything is practically done. I only gave 2 stars, because the manager was super nice & comped our delayed appetizer."}
{"text":"Oh boy.... :( 


Came here last night with the Gf, and we had a pretty bad experience ... We came in expecting a pretty good happy hour, with some beers and good food, right ? WRONG


First off, we were originally seated in the ( non happy hour section) so our waiter took us over to the bar.. Cool right ? Nah, we were seated at a high table top and waited around 10 minutes to be greeted and asked if we would like a drink .. Tick tock tick tick ... Waitress finally came, placed our drink order.. Meanwhile the bar is adjacent to us, it took around 10 minutes just to get a drink... We put the food order in and the food came out faster than the waitress checking up on us, and the drinks . Confused ? I was. The only good thing that came from that night was the $3 beers and the $10.99 rib special that was falsely advertised ... 

My question was \" Where is the FOH manager ?\" I've worked in both FOH & BOH and everything from the appearance and hygiene of the staff was horrible, like disgustingly horrible ... Nasty body odors, dirty hands . 

Never again"}
{"text":"Not worth coming to. I had to wait literally 10 minutes for service when I came here with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago. When the waitress got to our table she didn't even apologize and there were ONLY 3 people sitting in our entire section. She didn't even ask if we wanted any appetizers or anything.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience at TGI Friday's in Mentor. I was drawn in by the 10 Endless Appetizers. I have to say I was beyond impressed with the speed, and friendliness of the staff. This is definitely someplace I plan on returning."}
{"text":"So after a few visits here I've decided I will most definitely never return. 

I had been here a number of times and always felt it was a decent enough TGI Fridays, nothing particularly spectacular for food or service, but a nice quick bite when my husband and I were craving some fried green beans. After my last two visits here however, I will never be returning.

The second to last time I was here, I had a chicken/veggie dish that was pleasant. I also had this vodka/blue lemonade drink that seemed pretty tasty. We almost always eat at the bar since the service tends to be faster there, and it was no different. We had a attentive bar tender and food was served quickly (as were our drinks). We pay and go home. Not two hours later I start to feel pretty crappy. I chalk it up to not drinking very often and call it a night and head to bed. Wake up and feel fine. 

My last visit here however I was not so lucky. Opted for the 'endless apps' for my husband and I so we could enjoy a few Blue Moons and watch TV while in the bar area and enjoy a variety of options. Everything seemed okay, we still had decent service, ate and went home. That night I ended up with some horrible food poisoning and considering it was pretty much all I had eaten that day I knew it had to be what I ate here. Needless to say that was my last visit to this location and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Usually I can always count on Fridays to fix me a good drink... Well not this one. The first  one I got was too sour and then I think the bartender was trying to say she was going to charge me anyway for it even through u sent it bk. (which she didn't) then the service I was not impressed. They tended to pay more attention to their regulars than the new people (btw I was setting at the bar)'"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way home. Not much say. The service was sub par. My family all ordered burgers and they got two of our orders wrong. Hubby doesn't eat onions I do kinda mess up. It's nothing to really say about this Friday's other then the food was good, service was ok, and the money you spend isn't bad either. We did get our food quickly."}
{"text":"I came here to eat dinner tonight with my boyfriend and some friends. Not only was our waiter not very good but a waitress spilled 4 glasses of ice tea she was carrying next to our table and my friend and I got soaked.  It got all over our pants, shoes and my purse and coat. The only person to apologize was the girl who spilled the drinks and she only apologized to my friend not me. The managers never came over and apologized or asked if we needed anything like napkins, which we had to ask for!!! Our waiter never even acknowledged the fact that it happened when everyone witnessed it. They never offered us a free drink, dessert or a discount on our bill. Which I thought was ridiculous because being a chain restaurant, you could spare a $6 dessert. My boyfriend said that when the girl spilled everything the managers just scattered. We were sitting right my the register where they put in the orders so we saw the mangers walking around multiple times and they said nothing after it happened!! I understand that things like this happen but the way the staff/managers handled the situation was horrible. I was very unhappy with the service we received and do not plan to go back!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed my family and I  went here tonight and we will  never go back. We paid 70$ and the food was horrible stake  and lobster, 2 burgers and 3 water and  1 tea. The tea and water were the only good parts about all of the meal. The stake  was tuff  and the lobster  was rubbery. We order potatoes skins for all four of us to split. You would think we could get 4 little plates to eat them. Nope all we got was napkins.  My husband could never get a second  glass water. WE WILL NEVER  GO BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the taste of the food.  We got our food almost an hour after we order. We had to get a takeout box, paid and left.  There was no apology for the long wait or for the inconvenience. It would be nice if the service was a good as the food."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good service. I went to the restaurant on Dec 22.Bartenders Abby, Beka, and Tish all deserves 5 stars for their service. Thanks"}
{"text":"Worst management ever!!!! Do not come to this location especially at night! We were brought food an waited 15 mins for silverware!!!! Management came to the table with no apologies for such horrible service I mean this was a mess if I have to say so myself! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends to have some drinks and appetizers before our Bingo session. Yes we are 80 years old and play bingo. If you sit in the bar area, you can take advantage of their happy hour, for appetizers and drinks. Appetizers are $6 each and certain draught beers are $3.  The appetizers we chose were:

potato skins
pretzels
bbq chicken flatbread

The food took a long time to come out, and when it did, many of the items were cold as if they had been sitting for a while. The potato skins for example, were super crunchy, but not in a good way. More like stale crunchy. The pretzel sticks were probably the best thing, they were like breadsticks that looked and tasted like a pretzel. They came out buttery and warm. The cheese sauce that came with it was not very tasty though. The flatbread was mediocre at best.
I ordered a wildberry lemonade to drink and that was the best thing I had there. The ice comes crushed which is my favorite. Service was slow, food was not good.I know this is a chain, but I can't understand why they are still in business."}
{"text":"Horrible over all experience. 15 min wait was promised for 1/2dozen ppl but we sat watching the hostesses chat while the bus boy was in his cellphone.
Then the bar waited on us which led to cold endless apps, zero attention after he dropped off our appetizers AND to top off this horrible dining experience, we FROZE because the air was on blast and it is chilly outside this evening.
Great sports bar NOT for for true dining customers. We saw 3 separate ppl leaving when we arrived who looked angry, one was fussing about something and another looked like they'd had a horrible date.....now we totally understand.
Bad business, where's the manager(s)?"}
{"text":"I know. You're wondering why the hell would anyone go to Fridays when there's so many amazing strip and off-strip options. I HATE chain restaurants and avoid them like the plague. 

This Friday's is definitely an exception. 

I'm not sure if it's the amazing late night happy hour, the endless apps that come and go, or the amazing bar staff that works here. 

I love the girls at the bar... Amanda, Amber and Selina are so sweet and really take care of you. They know their drinks and beers and always keep you hydrated ;) 

Bonus: they serve to-go drinks in styrofoam cups. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Food was cold when it came to our table. Not once did they offer a refill on our drinks. Took 15 minutes to get the check so we could get out of here. Ridiculous. Step your game up Friday's!"}
{"text":",..The best place to hang out delicious food ,..good wine and cool staff, very friendly place..."}
{"text":"I love their potato skins, but dislike the staff. I had an awful experience. The waitor bought me the wrong food, overcharged my bill, didnt refill my water, and didnt add my meal to my points. Then when asking to speak with a manager, the manager took 20 minutes to get there, and then asked me would i like an appitizer for my trouble, dude!!!! i had enough points for a whole  meal, why did you think that would solve my problem? Take money off the bill, thats how you keep me coming back, WILL NOT GO THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"I came in and counted about 12 open tables and there was still a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday night, but on a saving note our waiter Bob was quick to take our order brought us waters with our drinks. The appetizers were very timely and of good taste. The main course came out as we were finishing our appetizers for a perfect transition. The meal was delicious."}
{"text":"The place was half empty.  We couldn't get a table. I  went to the restroom.  Trash all over the floor.  Just nasty.  We walked out"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Was at this location on a Friday night (December 2,2016) with some friends. My group were the only people in there besides one couple on the opposite side. We were having a great time and yes probably being a little too loud. However, instead of being approached in a manner that was nice the assistant manager was extremely rude and even told part of our group that they were loud ( even though they were sitting at a completely different table just talking). The manager proceeded to argue with us and asked us to leave because we were too loud. In my opinion it's a bar ( and yes we could be too loud) but the approach to this conversation was totally uncalled for. Will NEVER go back here again!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I don't even write yelp reviews because I'm in the service industry, but because of this experience I will not be returning to a Friday's. I could babble but it's simple. Horrible service, drinks were short poured, food obviously sat in kitchen for over 15 minutes because it took 45 for a med rare burger and boneless wings to come out at 10:00 P.M on a Wednesday. No check back by bartenders. Such a horrible experience. I feel like my boyfriend and I paid to have cold left overs. 
We honestly were sad we did not go to steak and shake. We would chose any day of the week over Friday's."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch on a slow weekday with time to kill before my flight. The high point of my visit was the warm and sincere folks working here especially my server Stephanie. She quickly greeted me, took my drink order and was attentive but not bothersome throughout the meal. She's one of those people that calls everyone hon (or is it hun?) and seems to really enjoy working with people.

I did come by to satisfy my lunchtime hunger though. While I did achieve my mission, I felt I could have done so much better just about anywhere else in the terminal. I selected the \"fav\" French Dip with a side salad in lieu of fries. The salad turned out to be OK with fresh ingredients including a couple cherry tomatoes. I had the low fat balsamic vinaigrette dressing that was tasty for being low in calories. 

The sandwich though was a disappointment. It didn't even remotely look appetizing when delivered on the plate to me. The \"fresh\" baguette was super white and at first glance didn't even looked to be baked. I prefer my bread to have a brown hue to it after baking but maybe that's a Southern thing. My biggest complaint though was the sauce served with the sandwich aka \"the dip\". It was thick like gravy and actually tasted like that Heinz brown gravy you get from a jar. Then again maybe it was since I am in Heinz's backyard."}
{"text":"Stop. Turn around and walk out.  We got there early on a Monday, the hostess said we are short staffed and I will seat you in an area that someone will be clocking in soon.  Should have ran for the door. The hostess took our drink order which were 4 waters.  The waitress comes over and says I can't clock in , I'll get your drinks.  We told her that we had already ordered and needed a few minutes on deciding.  When she came back 10 minutes later we ordered and I ordered a Stella Artois on draft.  I was watching tHe waitresses they had complain about being short staffed, but they seemed to be staffed well with the amount of people.  Was the slowest people I have ever witnessed.  We had an appetizer and was told they would bring us plates once they got some clean ones(should have left).  I asked her to check on my beer and 5 minutes later she brought a warm  beer with 2 inches of foam.  I told my husband we should leave because I was not drinking that.  They brought our cheese fries with plates, I still debated. When our waitress came over I told her I was not drinking or paying for that beer, that it was warm, the glass was dirty and someone poured it incorrectly in the first place.  She said kind of nasty it was cold when I brought it.  I let it go, they brought the food and the food tasted good we needed a box but could not get a box because she was to busy flirting with a man at another table.  We got the box and check and overcharged.  She said she would fix it, I gave her a visa gift card that we verified had money.  What seemed like an eternity the manager came to our table I thought to apologize but only to say we didn't have enough on the card.  We knew we had and he tried to explain , my husband was adamant and was able to go online to verify that the entire amount had already been used and showed it to the manager, the manager was confused and did concur that they had already taken it out.  If we had not been persistent we would have paid twice.  This meal took an hour and 15 minutes total and it was not worth it.  In conclusion if you stop here after reading this then you are taking a gamble.  I will never visit another TGI Friday's again anywhere."}
{"text":"I only like this TGIFriday's.  Their service is very good.  I have never had to wait more then 10 minutes to get a table.  The food there is very good.  Always consistent.  I always usually order their House Sirloin-10oz.  It is always juicy and flavorful.  They always keep sodas and other drinks full and their manager always checks on you to make sure that your experience is a good one.  Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but the service was to be questioned!!  It took 20 minuets to get a draft beer only to find out that particular draft was out!  So I ordered another kind and that took 10 more minuets.  It wasn't busy so it should not have taken this long!!  Our food came (we ordered the $6 appetizers) and our server Audra asked if there was anything else she could get us....I said guacamole that isn't brown!! Our guac that came with the quesadilla was brown!!  Now because I myself am a server/manager for a Mexican restaurant I know quac isn't suppose to be brown. It sat under the heat lamp to long!   Her response to my request was \"it's probably all like that\".  She got us a new one and it was fine.  You can tell when a server is just there for the tip or if they genuinely care about giving good service!!   I don't think she really cares about giving good service!"}
{"text":"If I could half the stars, it would get 3.5 definitely. TGIF has a formula that works. The food is average. The atmosphere was warm. There were a ton of people there for a Tuesday night. The bartenders were good. One seemed to slave while the other took break after break. Although others complained about the service, I was happy. Drink specials were great. I have been to this location numerous times. I'll probably be back. 
*side note* There were regulars and they were super drunk, taking up most of the waist staffs attention."}
{"text":"Typical TGI Fridays inside the Orleans Casino. 

We visited Thanksgiving Week and came here because we were attending the Las Vegas Invitational at Orleans Arena, which is attached to the casino. We came in between games and sat in the bar.  None of us ordered any alcoholic drinks; a couple sodas, a water and a Shirley Temple.  Instead of just taking our orders, our waiter made a comment that we're in Vegas, at a casino, in the bar area and we're not ordering drinks.  He even joked about the Shirley Temple that we ordered a \"kid's\" drink.  I wasn't very happy with the fact that he mentioned this to us and thought it was quite rude of him to impose."}
{"text":"I had a chance to go to this particular Friday's after returning some Christmas gifts at Northlake Mall recently.  If you've every been to a Friday's, you know what your getting and I can skip the customary descriptions of the interior and the menu - its a Friday's with everything you would expect a Friday's to be and have.  

I know most people don't usually think of Friday's as a place where you can get a good steak, but I do.  In fact I usually order some sort of steak entree when I go to Fridays, and this time was no different.  I ordered the flat iron steak with the veggie medley and the parmesan and garlic potato wedges as my two sides.  My steak was cooked to my specifications. I ordered it medium-rare and it arrived to my liking - juicy, tender and NOT over-cooked (see pics).  The veggies were just so-so, and in hindsight, I wish I would've ordered a different side item.  The potato wedges were great and I recommend them over the standard french-fries you might normally order.  

My gf ordered the endless soup and salad (found only on the lunch menu I believe) and was more than satisfied with her decision.  The Caesar Salad was, well, a Cesar Salad, with the standard tomatoes and parmesan cheese (see pics).  The chicken tortilla soup she ordered was very tasty, as I sampled some of it myself.  I was pleasantly surprised with the cheese that added a nice texture that you don't normally find with most standard soups.  

I've been here at least three-four times and have found this particular Friday's to offer a clean and friendly environment.  There is also plenty of parking which can't be said for the rest of Northlake Mall.  The only drawback, is that it can be difficult to get out of the parking lot and back onto Harris Blvd., but that is due to the poor design of the mall itself.  If you find yourself tired or hungry after a day of shopping and fighting crowds at Northlake Mall, this particular Friday's is definitely a quality, fair-priced option."}
{"text":"Toughest steak ever and waitress said have to serve salads with the meal, and not before?

She relented and brought salad early.

Lobster was good although cold."}
{"text":"Went to dinner.  The hostess stated our waitress just came on and would be with us soon. Ten minutes before she asked what we wanted to drink.   We ordered.  Ten minutes more before we even got our drinks.  They we not right. Coke and raspberry ice tea.  She did correct it quickly.  The steak was not cooked correctly and the baked potato was barely warm. The chicken was ok. But they put the onion rings($3.00 extra) in the sauce. No longer crunchy but a least they had flavor after sitting in the sauce.  The coleslaw tasted off.  The waitress even mixed up our bill with the credit card in the folder with another guest.  Worst dinner and experience I've had in a while. Will not be back"}
{"text":"The beer in this place is very cold...and the bartenders are very cute and sweet!  This place is my fix after a long day at work.  If you want really good service just sit at the bar...they are very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Was there today and never disappointed service is always high above average! You get waited on fast and was not disappointed with the waiters or waitresses. They leave you alone while you eat and just come by and grab your drink and refill it,"}
{"text":"Arrived there at 10pm and was starving. Waited 5min for someone to show up and asked the hostess if I could order to go. She said \" Yes sure, just order at the bar \". I then sat at the bar and waited 20min. There was only one bartender for 13 people and he never came to see me. I then left and told the hostess who didn't give a s... the worst TGIF I've ever seen in my life, I hope this location goes out of business, they don't deserve to get customers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time with a large group and though I had no issue others did. I met with an out of town guest and we ate lunch no complaints. Though I work nearby, I prefer the other location."}
{"text":"We came during a late afternoon on a Sunday.  My sizzling plate was no longer sizzling and chicken and shrimp were well over cooked.  Service was slow and there were very few people in the restaurant.  The cost of the sub par food was much too expensive for the quality of food we received.  This will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Never again! Walked out after still no food after waiting 45 minutes.... Not even my side salad. Asked for the manager but she was too busy cooking. There was maybe 10 tables in the whole place. Terrible terrible service and management skills! NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp. My meal was really good. We had a party of 10 and our server was friendly and efficient. Everything was correct and really good. The restaurant was really clean too! Our reservation could have been ready faster than it was but with a large party you can't expect miracles.  Overall I would recommend this establishment to others."}
{"text":"The wait was usual. Its Friday night.
The guy at the checkin podium couldn't figure out who was who, calling names of people who had been sat, left, or calling wrong names.
 As soon as we sat down we could hear other patrons around us complaining, watched a manager making the rounds. 
    The table across from us, whom were seated almost 10 minutes after us, were served basically their entire items before i received a water. 
  We ordered an Angry Orchard cider, an appetizer and two entrees. 
 Over the course of the next 15 minutes we had completely plain wings brought to us, (which gross btw) not once, but twice, and the waiter insisted it was ours. Finally a table two down yelled, \"those are ours.\" No apology for essentially accusing us of ordering some garbage.
   Then the bartender walked up with a long island. Again we remarked, its not ours. Bartender sighed. The waitess came over, \"its for this table but they dont want it anymore, they waited to long\" 45 minutes in fact.....
    So having still not received silverware, the cider, or childrens chocolate milk in almost 20 mins we decided to walk out. The waitress and manager basically watched us go, didn't even try to approach us.
   The experiences here historically have been lackluster, and coupled with the hike in prices, (20 bucks for jack daniels chicken? Really?) I'm pretty sure we're just gonna skip this chain from now on."}
{"text":"How do you mess up French Onion soup? Well they did, the bread in the soup was stale. Also the waitress didn't bring silverware until after the food was served. They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Man. This place is way off base.  Management here has to get their act together.
Was promptly seated by cheerful hostess.
Waitress/server approached promptly. Took drink order. Brought promptly.  Took dinner order.  No appetizers.  FROM THERE FELL OFF THE RAILS.
One order ribeye/shrimp w/ broccoli n cheeze.  Salad.
Other order full slab of ribs w/ spinach.  Salad.
One drink raspberry iced tea.
Did not bring salads for over 20 minutes.  Then dinner right behind it. Brought 2 orders of broccoli n cheese.  NO shrimp.  That took another 20 minutes.
.
Refill of raspberry iced tea was not drinkable. Was like had spoiled milk in it.
Only response, kitchen really super busy....
Hope gets better."}
{"text":"Love this location! My partner and I live/work very close and the staff is superb! Good food, good service thanks."}
{"text":"Restaurant was just renovated and looks great. Was there on business and everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  I had the jack Daniels chicken sandwich and a colleague had the chicken with sautéed spinach. Good service too."}
{"text":"Went to (try) and have lunch here today around 2pm. Place wasn't packed at all, yet two employees handed menus off to eachother twice before one finally took us to a booth. Overly loud R&B music playing.. okay, I can deal with it for good food. The girl who sat us down asked what we wanted to drink, I said tea. We waited for about 10 minutes (and still no tea) before someone came to the table and asked what we wanted to drink. I again asked for tea and my fiancé asked for a mixed drink. Yet another 10 minutes before my tea arrived, and his drink was sitting on the bar that was clearly visible to see from where we sat. Took our order finally.. then another 5 or so minutes passed and she walked by and said, \"your drink should be there soon I guess,\" not paying attention to the fact that it was sitting there getting watered down. Another 15 minutes of waiting for his drink and food was enough; we left. We will NEVER be back to this location, and highly suggest nobody else goes to this one if they're not a \"fan of R&B and rap music\", if I make my point obvious. I treat everyone equally, something the servers here obviously don't practice."}
{"text":"Sadly the service is terrible every time we go. Took over 20 minutes to get our drinks from the bar, and what is really bad is we were sitting in a booth next to the bar. Server didn't seem too happy about working there. Endless appetizers are cool to get. I had the Cajun shrimp & chicken pasta. It was good."}
{"text":"This place has gone really downhill from years ago. If you sit at the bar that place is very unsanitary. No one cares to sanitize the bar tops!
If you come in for the endless apps there are certain stipulations when you get there when you can have those apps. The bar is only for drinks I would not recommend getting food there and also please bring  sanitizer!!!!
 I can compare this to a New York city subway because this place is dirty and needs re-organized with their management !!!! We have been to Fridays in the past and it's pathetic that Monroeville's Fridays has gone really downhill!!"}
{"text":"Great and IMMEDIATE service starting at the door. That's what we like; lots! 

Ice tea was real good. You may think that doesn't matter but for this home boy it can make or break my culinary experience. I want an adventure, not a death-trap.

Ordered lobster with one steamed and one grilled. Wife-partner ordered Jack Daniel Seseme Chicken. Our plan was to be happy and satisfied.

Jessica took care of us. She offered some suggestions and we were grateful. The food was good. I learned I like steamed lobster if kept attached to the shell, and if removed prior to final grilling then the grilled. Great portion of veggies. Nice salad as a side.

All-in-all, Jessica and TGIFridays exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"The waiter was rude and had bad customer. Kept telling me my food was coming and it never came. Then the manager came out she was also rude and did not demonstrate leadership qualities. You can tell the employees at this location do what they want. Also so witnessed sever being mean to other guest also seen people get up and walk out they didn't wanna deal with the waiter.  They also limited the number of appetizers to 3 only. The menu says endless apps. Do not got to this Friday's"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was pretty dead inside but still had to wait a little for a table. Me and the three guys I was with got seated and looked over the menu for 15-20 minutes before anyone came to wait on us. They apologized and said that they were \"very busy\" although there were maybe a total of 15 customers in the section we sat at. Most of which had already had their food. We put in for our drinks and food including one appetizer. the drinks came promptly but it took another 15-20 minutes to just get the appetizer. After this we decided to get our food to go because it was taking too long and we were on our lunch break. The waiter apologized again for them being \"very busy\" and when called out on it, because they were not busy at all, we in turn received attitude. When we got to work and started eating our food (which was cold by the time) we noticed that the very few fries that we each got were cold and stale. We will no longer be taking our business to this establishment. Especially after the horrific service that we had received."}
{"text":"Absolute worse experience ever!  We had to leave because our server was too busy talking to people to even come and take our order!  We tried to flag him down and he ignored us.  Only when we were leaving did he say anything to us.  Do not go here !"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and the place was pretty empty. I believe perhaps they were just opening. I ordered a BFM (Best Friday's Margarita) and the bartender made it with some love. I appreciated that. :-) For lunch I ordered the California Club with sweet potato fries. The food was very fresh. I assumed it was a hot sandwich but instead its a cold one. Not a deal breaker though. I really enjoyed it. It was cool too see the CIAA additions to the restaurant as I am solely in town for this event. Overall, the service was good and the food was good too.."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have this curse, we always seem to get the worst service. Not today! We were warmly greeted, quickly sat and our server Heather was almost too good! Our 52 dollar check was happily rounded up to 75 after the best experience at a chain we have ever had the pleasure of enjoying."}
{"text":"If only I had gone here BEFORE I chose this restaurant to celebrate my and my husband's birthdays. Seems this location has a bad reputation! We don't go out often but went here today after putting off both our birthdays til payday to splurge. What a disappointment! The prices are not worth the meal! At 67.00 for two people you expect to get a decent meal! The ribs were over cooked the fries were under cooked and the slaw was nasty. Had to send the fries back because they were cold and the next batch presented was undercooked and not edible! You all should be ashamed charging these exorbitant prices for lousy food! Never again!"}
{"text":"No, just no. There were maybe 5-6 other tables of 2-4 people and 5 of us. Ordered 3 bar drinks and waited over 30 min for them to come out. One of us ran out of water about 5 min in and it took 45 min to refill it. Waited another 15 or so min for our food; 2 of the meals were soggy from sitting, and we were missing a few sides we ordered. We had to flag down someone to even get napkins and silverware to eat; the random other waitress we had to ask rolled her eyes like it was the worst thing we could have asked. Our waitress intentionally ignored us the rest of our visit, making the bus girl serve us our check and one round of refills. We were in disbelief on how awful this experience was, that we wanted to tell the manager (which we've never, ever done). We went up to the host stand to find 2 other tables complaining about the exact same thing! I'm not even joking. The manager gave a quick apology like it happens all the time, and knocked 20% off our checks. The same waitress still never acknowledged us and quickly dropped the check at our table before disappearing. TGI has recently not been the best place to dine, but this was almost weird with how bad it was. Negative stars if I could!"}
{"text":"This place sucks I waited about 10 minutes till the bar tender finally came to take my order which was a to go order back upstairs to my room the steak and lobster  it was supposed to come with two sides macaroni and cheese in a baked potato with all of the fixins is what I ordered I should have checked before I went upstairs to my room upon arrival the baked potato with simple by itself no condiments at all they forgot my macaroni and cheese and no buttuh for the lobster tail.... after a night of drinking I didn't feel like going back down very disappointed yes I should have checked before I went back up to my room but is that really my job isn't that the job of the person packing the order wasn't even a busy night... very disappointed"}
{"text":"3 words DON'T EAT HERE. Worst food I ever had in Las Vegas, tasted like it was 2 weeks old. tossed it in the garbage, service was bad"}
{"text":"i really despise chain restaurants.
and this is why...

this was, by far, one of the worst dining experiences ever.
i ordered the Jack Daniel's® Salmon & Grilled Shrimp Scampi.
the description reads, \"Norwegian salmon fillet fire-grilled to order and glazed with Jack Daniel's® sauce, then paired with jumbo butterflied shrimp, charbroiled shell-on with a garlic-tomato scampi sauce. Served with jalapeño cornbread and your choice of two sides.\"

the shrimp was so overcooked that the meat was completed glued to the shell and inedible.
come to think of it, every piece of food was overcooked, including the mushy vegetables.
i was looking forward to a garlicky scampi sauce but there was no flavor here...just salt.

i may have been able to overlook the horrific food if the service was amazing but, no, it was just mediocre.
i felt as if someone should have been paying me to eat here.

never again.
never!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself at this place..two things have happened...one...you have given up looking for a good place to eat...and two..you have chosen to not care how you spend you money. This place would be the place you break up with people..it's just horrible. I ordered boneless wings..which took way too long and arrived cold. A sloppy sauce was added to remind me that I had ordered flavored bread. SRLSY, if this place was not at the ballpark it would have long been closed down. 

I would like to add that a table next to me also complained of the food being cold. 

There is no reason to go here on a non-baseball game day...unless you need to tell that special someone you want them out of your life."}
{"text":"We went there for my friends 21 bday, we ordered drinks and some shots while we decided what to eat. The manager told us to finish are drinks first and then he would go ahead and bring the shots, 25 minutes later and still waiting for drinks and food. Stay away from this place stuff and management are the worst."}
{"text":"I want to give the restaurant 4.5 stars but since it's not an option, I'll surely give 5. I was visiting this restaurant for my birthday tonight and was happy having hot and fresh, fall off the bone, perfectly cooked jack daniels ribs and fries. They were delicious. My waitress was so nice that I had to send TGI Fridays a compliment that I hope they share with her and commend her on the great customer service. My message was as follows:

Ingrid was great today. I had a party of 10 at the restaurant for my birthday tonight. We were seated around 7:03pm. It took a while for someone to come over but she came over around 7:20 and took drink orders and food orders. It took a very long time to receive drinks (we got them around 7:50) and our food came within the next 15mins. However, even though those took a while Ingrid remained cheerful, friendly and positive with our table. I'm big on good customer service and many people don't know how to provide patrons/guests with that type of service even if they happen to be complaining or questioning something. Ingrid was the sweetest and one of the most friendliest waitresses I have ever encountered. I'm not sure why things took so long to get to the table, but she was so polite and friendly about it and everything else. I made sure to tell her how much I appreciated how nice and friendly she was. So did the members of my party. I hope this message is able to be shared with her to again, re-iterate what an excellent job she did tonight. I really appreciate your exemplary customer service, cheerful attitude and politeness. It is MORE than appreciated and I'll be sure to ask for her if I ever return to this establishment!

--
If you're ever visiting this restaurant, ask for Ingrid! Thank you for being so nice!"}
{"text":"Two things bothered me here. First, to get half priced appetizers you have to sit in the smoke filled bar area. Really Fridays?? Smoking allowed still?? Second, our server was a moron. I asked her if the chicken salad sandwich was good. Her answer was 'I've never had it'. Ok, no problem with that answer but here's where it goes bad. As she brings my sandwich she says...and I wish I was joking....\"I just remembered! Most people can't stand this sandwich.\" And then walks away. The sandwich wasn't good but was somewhat edible so I ate half as left. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food, 5 stars, service, 5 stars, atmosphere 4 stars. I had the Jack Daniels steak, great flavor. The vegetables were fresh and tasty. They sat me in the bar section, which was basicly undecorated. When I go back, I will ask to sit somewhere else, which is nicely decorated.
P. S. The food must be good, as I witnessed tons of, to go orders."}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero if Yelp would let me. Our waitress was sweet but the general manager was a serious Bitch. I brought food due to a severe food allergy but was with people ordering food and we were all getting drinks and I was told I couldn't eat my food here."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!

I came to this restaurant after nagging my bf that I wanted pasta. We checked every other restaurants before landing in this awesome place (Others were closed because it was almost mid night). 

For starts the ambiance was dark but pretty cool, it reminded me of Applebee's but slightly bigger or not idk I just wanted pasta that night. Anyway, for starters we ordered Tuscan spinach dip... it was amazing. Absolutely delicious I must say. I totally loved it! The combination of spinach, artichoke hearts, sautéed onions and bell peppers blended with parmigiano and Romano cheese was divine. Adding with the crispy tostada chips was better. 

The main dish for me was a Cajun shrimp & chicken pasta and my bf was a Sizzling chicken & shrimp( Garlic marinated chicken). Both dishes were divine and tasty. I love the flavour of the pasta ( I'm a pasta freak!). The shrimps were juicy and the garlic sauce mixed so well with the shrimp. (I've fallen in love with garlic sauce mixed with melted butter).

This place is a good place for a mid night dinner. I would recommended you to try it."}
{"text":"A late afternoon, or early evening on a weeknight turned out to be very relaxing. Good draft beer, and yummy food, that came out quickly and hot. Friendly staff made the afternoon very relaxing."}
{"text":"It's an OK TGI Friday's experience.  Service was quite friendly.  Food seemed a bit slow to arrive, and the sides were very, very small.  Friend got the combo fries (half potato, half sweet potato) and the sweet potato fries were odd - not crispy, bland, just... weird.  

Overall, it's still a Friday's - so if you like that kinda thing, this is a decent representation of it. ;)"}
{"text":"First time ever to this Fridays. It was a grand experiance! 
Came here with the extended family for a First Communion Day dinner.Our Server was a great guy. Seth,was attentive and fast, and really made the day great!
 Our food was delish, all of it!
 They even gave the Boy a free dessert of his choice. The resturant is very clean and so are the restrooms. Music is not too loud, and everything about it was great.
 Yes, i will come back here any time. We really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Food was so good I felt I wanted to lick the plate. Jack Daniels burger with sweet potato fries, extra jack sauce. Unbelievably delicious"}
{"text":"Great food and fast friendly service. They have drastically changed the image of the concept and food is completely different from before.  Great change. Well selection of drink specials and variety."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I have made our rounds to quite a few T.G.I. Fridays. The TGIF at the Orleans Hotel and Casino on Tropicana Avenue is our favorite. We usually sit at the bar for happy hour -- the food and drinks are inexpensive and the bartenders are quite conversational and very friendly. 

TGIF is generally a relaxed, fun atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and tidy, the service is great... We always have a good time! If you are in the mood to kick back with a few friends and grab some delicious snacks, then I would recommend the TGIF at the Orleans."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Got seated, the server didn't even acknowledge we were at the table for about 10 minutes, she finally came over so we ordered our food with our drinks. The food was almost cold, yuck. The food was disgusting and had no flavor as well. Our server was horrible, and barely spoke any words to us. All I can say is I'd definitely NEVER tell anyone to eat here. Sorry restaurant in all if you ask me."}
{"text":"I like fridays but I hate this location. Me and my girlfriend ordered food. Mine came out in about 30 min. Hers came out 22 minutes after mine! I asked my server who was also the bartender why her food hasn't come out. He was annoyed and said it wasn't his fault! I explained that I didn't really care who's fault it is I just would like our food to come out together. It finally came out 22 minutes after mine! Also,I hate how this location will not serve alcohol to anyone with a vertical ID. My ID doesn't expire until 2020. What kind of rule is that? Never had that happen anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place can be summarized in 4 words:

Great Service, HORRIBLE food.

First off, service: The staff was great and helpful! We were seated, and got our drinks quick. During the entire course of the meal, we were checked upon and had our waters refilled. No complaints about the staff, keep up the good work!

Now, the food:  I went during happy hour, so most appetizers were all $6... My party ordered 4 appetizers and 1 dessert. First off, the Tuscan Spinach Dip: There was spinach, artichoke, cheese, tomatoes, and chips... There was nothing too special about this dish. The taste was just mediocre and bland. I think we were only able to finish half of the dip and chip... Loaded potato skins: about half of the potato skins had a good amount of cheese and bacon, the other half, only one or two pieces of bacon were to be found. In the sour cream and green onion dip, let's just say I could count how many pieces of green onions in that dip with the amount of fingers on one hand. Then we had the jack daniels chicken strips: The strips were small and overcooked, and it just didn't taste right. On the contrary, the dipping sauce was excellent. Finally, we had the Sirloin hibachi skewers. The beef was overcooked, but the sauce and pita bread combo was excellent. We ended up finishing this dish first since it was the best of all the appetizers.  For dessert we had a slice of red velvet cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The color of the red velvet cake indicated that the cake has been sitting there for hours, if not days. It was a dull red, and the taste matched the color. The vanilla ice cream looked 'smooth' and had chunks of ice in it, which was a clear indication of it being completely melted, and refrozen.

I don't think I'll ever be back at this place again. Yes, the wait staff was kind and courteous, but that is not enough to keep me going back to a place with horrible tasting food."}
{"text":"What I read in the reviews is very much true. I'm somewhat disappointed but not at my server(s). I got here at about 2:45, there was no hostess present so I rang the bell. (there's an older couple who just walked in and asked if they're to seat themselves). To no avail, we sat ourselves. I went on to locate a high chair for our 10mo old and was fortunate enough to bump into a hostess. She switched our table and got us a high chair and I began to read reviews. My wife, who suggested we come here so she could have a drink due to her disheartening day asked our waitress about happy hour and was told it's only available if you're seated in the bar. I would have better understood if we weren't with our child. We requested a manager to determine our eligibility for the special, which shouldn't have been necessary but was honored nonetheless. We ordered two electric blue lemonades and continued to entertain our child. After a while, after reflecting on the reviews... I determined I would get our drinks faster if I walked into the bar area and ordered them myself. True enough, I returned to our table with our drinks, and the waitress was empty handed. Nacho's (toppings) weren't hot, sliders weren't hot, and I didn't even want to try the wings. This location is too valuable to have such lackluster product."}
{"text":"Showed up. No host in the front for 10 minutes the dining area had all of 10 people in it so it was pretty dead. All of the employees were in the bar area having social hour amungst themselves. 10 minutes later. A host comes. We get seated in the bar area , we figured that we'd actually better service if we sat where all the employees were. Faster service once we were seated. Food was eh. My husband asked for the buffalo burger and to have bleu cheese swaped for ranch and was told no. My burger was good. I asked for well done and got medium well. Eh. Our server Yurnell wasn't really the greatest. Didn't seem interested in serving us. We were nice and constantly saying thanks she ignored us. I ordered water and didn't recieve a refill. I've had better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, I ordered a cheeseburger to go and when they bring it to me the fries were ice cold and the burger looks like it was just thrown in the box all messy. Manager had an attitude when I complained & said I'll make you another but you can keep this burger too. I said I don't want this burger , if it was good there wouldn't be a problem. I said I have many friends who own restaurants, when food is wrong, you remake it then give them a refund. He's clearly an idiot."}
{"text":"We ordered online for pickup. Young lady who got our food was very nice, we even tipped her. It seemed she was a student, so we felt she deserved it. That's where the niceness ends. We ordered cheeseburger and fries and sizzling chicken and shrimp with loaded mashed
potatoes. I'm glad we got mashed potatoes , they stuck to our fingers really well! We had no utensils and condiments. My fries were cold and bland and there was no salt or pepper. 

I should have yelped this particular location but didn't because we've eaten at Friday's before and the food was good. My boyfriend's burger was overlooked . Overall, a real disappointment for $30 worth of food. We will complain to management."}
{"text":"The worst service ever , Joshua not only was not attentive.  He lacked the basic cuatomer service skills , that are standard . (Would you like refills,  hows the food etc) The manaher on duty also lacked empathy , when food was not up to standard . Then had the audacity to say that we dont typically comp a meal (when we are at fault) then suddenly changed his statement when asked for the General Managers name . Needless to say that , we'll never return to patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Very good service. Vivian got us the table we wanted. She was AWESOME."}
{"text":"Very basic food....and not a lot of it.... not many people there either... on the other hand driving by Olive Garden... the parking lot was packed ! Should of ate there!!! And waiter in bar was clearly not the best......"}
{"text":"Now I remember why I never come to this location when I go to TGI Fridays...service is terrible! When we arrived we were told it was going to be a 30 min wait. Since it was Friday night, we figured that made sense and we sat around waiting for our table. About 20 min later we were told that our table was ready and followed the hostess into the restaurant where we were led to the far back left corner, passing through a half empty restaurant! If there were dozens of tables empty, why did we have to wait and more importantly, why were we lied to about a 30 min wait when they could've pieced together 2 tables to fit our party of 5 easily! 

When it came time to order our drinks and appetizers, I inquired about happy hour and was told it was only at the bar. Since my friend had his nephew with him we couldn't move to the bar, oh well. We placed our drink and food orders, with Rachel and I going with the $10 unlimited appetizers - mozzerella sticks and boneless wings. The mozz sticks and wings were decent since those are pretty difficult to screw up. My 2nd order of mozz sticks were not as good and the cheese wasn't as melted which is how I like it. Our 2nd order of wings had the garlic parmesean sauce on it, which tasted kind of funky. Rachel couldn't eat it because it looked like snot to her lol.

When it came time to pay, we split the check between 2 cards and when the waitress saw this she asked for our IDs. Hold up, hold my phone. Since when do restaurants check for IDs when paying for a meal?! At first I refused to show my ID on the principle that no merchant is supposed to ask for ID anyways when paying with a card (Visa and MasterCard both prohibit this), much less a restaurant. However, it didn't seem like she was going to let me use my card if I didn't show her my ID. A little argument ensued where I informed the waitress that by doing so her business is in violation of their contracts/agreements with MasterCard and that I would report them for such a violation if she continued to ask for my ID. In the end, I decided to just comply by tossing my ID at her rather than just walking out and not paying. I figured I'd contact MasterCard and their corporate customer service to voice my complaints, because an hourly paid waitress is too dumb to understand anything related to business or contracts anyways. All she kept saying was that she could send her manager over as if that was going to solve anything. She said it was store policy so I'm pretty sure her manager was the one that taught her this. Idiots."}
{"text":"We always sit at the bar. Larisa is a GREAT bartender and the food is ALWAYS amazing. Literally. No idea where bad reviews come from here. But we've never had a bad experience. The Parmesan crusted chicken is delicious and the spinach and queso dip is always bomb. Love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Great food great vibes and AMAZING customer service thank you for lunch  i had the half ribs Mac and cheese with bacon wrapped shrimp and spinach artichoke dip my son had the pizza off the kids menu and it was a nice size and not anything small. My food was delicious !!"}
{"text":"We went to Fridays on Friday.  Yea!!! We frequent this restaurant but tonight they were not on point. The waitress was messing up big time. The only good thing was the wait time on this go round. We were in quickly!!"}
{"text":"Horrible ribs, horrible service, I will never come back here again. I am speaking this as a person who used to work as a waiter back in my college days. At first, we ordered bbq baby back ribs and food was overcooked and dry. Waiter's name was Dean and he was clumsy, nearly dropped the food at my friend. Well, s*** happens. I used to be a waiter for a sushi restaurant and I've had my bad days. So we were compensated by getting different entree. By the time we got our food, we lost our appetite but still finished the shrimp pasta. We asked for our check to pay the bill. It took him 20 minutes to close our tab because he couldn't get his priorities straight. I recall having bad, clumsy days, such as putting entrees one over the other and end up squashing the bottom entree, spilling drinks, but I've never kept my patrons waiting. I would close out the tabs and let the patrons go so that new customers can come and take the seats. I would never come here again. Rather go to oyster bar next door or drive outside since there are so many restaurants. I've had enough patience and tolerance with this place since I used to be a waiter myself."}
{"text":"From ca I have to say this was the best TGIF I have found...delicious down to the dessert.  Five stars for food so people know but be warned...service sucks.  Our server mocked us....??  But food...yummy!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday night, a few minutes before 9pm, and the place was fairly empty. But, we had to wait a few minutes for the hostess to come back from wherever she was to seat us. 

We asked for a booth, she looked around and she said she had to clean one off. Although other booths were available, maybe the sections were closed due to staffing. Anyway, it was the very first booth- I thought she left to get cleaning supplies, but she went to have a conversation, came back to the table to wipe it down, left again to finish her conversation, then finally came back to seat us.

After several minutes of waiting, our waiter came over and gave us menus. Our waiter had a hard time remembering things- like, bringing our food to our table. We ordered endless apps, for the three people in our party. 19 minutes later he brings the apps to the table behind us. I heard one of the ladies ask her friends if someone ordered it. I waved to her and asked was that our order of apps and she replied that it must've been. Meanwhile, they told the server and he walked away. I could also hear from that other table that he was messing up their order as well because they ordered meals and not apps. 

Three minutes later the server comes back out with more apps that he again, put on the other table. At this point, were were just waiting for him to acknowledge our table. Again, I can hear the women say that it was not their food. The server disappears again. 

He comes back out and asked us, did we order endless apps- imagine the looks on our faces. We said yes, and he said that he would be right back (so we have now been waiting approximately 25 minutes for our food). We ended up walking right out. It made no sense to speak to management- for what? To wait another 25 minutes and possibly get a free water!!!

Stay away...far, far, away from this location.
I gave one star because I had to. They didn't even earn a star."}
{"text":"Obviously the staff has been changed and it's not for the best my boyfriend has lived in this area forever so I am a regular we sat at the bar for 20 mins before being asked if we need help ahhh duh we are here of course the water had stuff floating in it from glasses being dirty and the soda we ordered after that was flat soup was cold wings were salty steak was over cooked and service was horrible let's rewind go back and attempt to regain old staff the flow was better energy was better I'm never going back"}
{"text":"I have visited Fridays numerous times over the past couple years.  I have dined both for lunch and dinner times.  The service has always been good, the food has always been good.  No problems with the promptness of service or politeness of the waiter/waitresses. My last visit I had the Hibachi Chicken Skewers. Now its one of my favorite dishes at Fridays. My favorite reason for visiting Fridays is the quality drinks that are available. Its always a treat to try a new alcoholic beverage.  Great margaritas, very good double berry majito shakers.  Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I love the food at TGIF but that being said the service from the host and hostess to the server down to the management was a complete failure worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant environment the first couple visits weren't bad but weren't great either my last visit they told us we had to wait 30 minutes for table in the restaurant was empty the excuse the host had was there was only two servers and they couldn't keep up with the three tables they have so after speaking with management I was told and I quote yo I can't slam my servers end quote so at that point my family and I decided to leave how can you trust an establishment to prepare your food if they are treating you in such and unprofessional manner I would like to let the fellow Yelpers should beware of this place I'm giving them one star because they earned it"}
{"text":"Our waitress was excellent! We had a great time!
We came here for the endless appetizer and she took the time and explained to us how it works. 
Basically it's $10 per person and you choose one appetizer and stick with it. 
We chose mozzarella sticks,boneless chicken and potstickers. 
We were so full and could barely finish our second round. 
Our waitress was so nice and really attentive! ( I wish I'd remember her name :/ )"}
{"text":"First we waited 20 minutes to get our order taken and then another 20 minutes to get appetizers. Trying to order out next round or get the sour cream my potato skins were missing is impossible. Let's not even mention a drink refill. Omg worst experience ever. Think it's back to not going to a Friday's again."}
{"text":"I've never seen such shitty service. This place is literally the worst place to dine in on a Friday night. No tip for you. I've never been seated to wait 20 minutes for water. Then this lazy cunt of a waitress couldn't even bother walking around the table to hand the drink to my friend. She slid it across the table like fucking \"Cocktail.\" There are many more reasons why this place is shit...But I digress. Fuck this place...fuck them up there stupid asses."}
{"text":"My friend invited me here yesterday / I didn't want to go here since the bad experience last time. Well 1st thing I ordered a Ginger Ale they brought me a sugar free Im allergic to sugar free and never asking for sugar free. I asked for Club soda and got it. I never ate here and saw menu the prices so high for lunch! I had a soft pretzel w beer cheese dip . Oh please cup was big as dixie cup loaded w green onions! And had small boneless wings w Sirracha Buffalo sauce tell me Where is the heat? I guess they didn't shake bottle cause it was0 in taste. Bet ghost sauce was same.? My friend had a Chicken salad sandwich loaded with strong onions that she said overwhelmed it! And this is her favorite place? I left there Hungry and never again even if invited! There were hardly ten people there more workers then customers too."}
{"text":"This one star is solely becuase of the bad service I've now received twice. The first experience was New Years Day. Our server was fine, it was the kitchen and bar that was a mess. It was a party of 5, we all ordered drinks from the bar. It took forever to get our drinks. We also each ordered an entree. It took forever for us to get our food. The table behind us had a party of 4. They were seated about 45 mins before our party and their server hadn't even been by to get their food order. One of my friend's entree was given to the wrong table. My other friend's kale and Romain chicken salad didn't have any kale in it. When the manager came to explain, he didn't have the greatest customer sevice. He was making a bunch of excuses and not really trying to make it right. 
The second experience was last night. It was a party of 5 of us. Our server was fine, once agaqin, it was the kitchen. 3 of our party ordered apps, one of my friends ordered dessert and I was the only one who had an entree. I ordered the dragon chicken, which is pretty good. My friend who ordered dessert, her dessert came put first. Followed by my friends' apps. 30 mins later my entree came out. By that time my other 4 friends had finished their food and our server was bringing the checks. I asked for the manager. Same manager as before with lackluster customer service. I told him that I took so long for my entree to come out and all my friends finished before I even received my entree. Once again, he was giving the excuses. He said that they were apps and came out first, well then what about the dessert, why did that come out before everyone else's food, desserts are usually last. We also explained to him that it still shouldn't have taken 30 mins for me to get my entree after the apps were out. And the restaurant was not crowded. It was almost empty. He was making so many excuses and wasn't trying to make it right. I've had enough with this location, this kitchen crew and this manager. I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"We purchased 4 burgers to go here. We told the guy taking our order to make the burgers medium rare. We come home to pitch black burnt hard hockey pucks. We called to tell them and Jason said well we don't make our burgers medium rare. Isn't that something to tell someone while they are taking the order? The manager got on the phone and she was even more rude than Jason her name is Minera or something like that. What nasty people with poor customer service skills. Never again will I go here the burgers suck and the people do too."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in about a year but stopped in the other night to watch some college basketball at the bar. It was 5:30 pm, which means it was happy hour which got me $4 drafts (any) and $6 appetizers. The bartenders were friendly and continued to check on me and other guests constantly to make sure we were good on food and drink. They also try to learn everyone's name and make conversation with them. When 6 pm rolled around they changed channels for me no problem and I was able to watch my Big Ten games. The bar area got crowded by 6 or 7 pm but food and beer continued to flow uninterrupted. Will have to visit this location more often this year. Didn't remember TGIF being so popular or efficient"}
{"text":"Our server was very inattentive. I had to ask for a side of lemons three times before he brought them out. He also brought out the appetizers after the entree itself. The food is good. But I would advise going to another Friday's."}
{"text":"Not much stood out, but I have no complaints. A group of fussy/ special dietary needs people caused a lot of extra trips to the kitchen for the waitress, but she made no mistakes. I was so full from the lunch buffet (and the 17 prior huge meals), that I just sampled everyone else's dishes. The Jack Daniels meals were good. The sides were standard. They gave us coupons for free desserts, and the brownie sundae wasn't bad. 

We were a bit disappointed that happy hour was available only in the bar most of the time."}
{"text":"Always a good Bloody Mary pre flight.
Food is your typical Friday's.
Always stop before my flights out."}
{"text":"The same Ole Fridays but at the airport. The menu isn't as extensive as the other restaurants but big enough to give options and to full your stomach before a flight. I usually grab an appetizer (spinach flatbread) and a couple beers before flying out. The have drafts and micros on tap. (Blue moon)is my favorite. Sit down, enjoy and have a safe flight."}
{"text":"I feel their menu and food has been much better. Even though I don't care for corporate places much I've been impressed. The reward program is a nice benefit also. 
The steak & ribs are usually our go to meal. The chicken on flavored board is good with a mac&cheese side and tomato salad. Yum"}
{"text":"Want to know why your dining room is empty at lunch time?  It's because your food isn't any good!  French fries should be served hot so should soup.  

The server was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had... I sit here with a bill in front of me and the dickhead bartender hasn't even cleared my plate ... I have had two glasses of water. Simply because my ice melted into water, walked in to the bar, was ignored for 10 minutes, bartender talked to me twice in 40 minutes, and threw the bill in front of me... Fries cold and delivered by a waitress, was treated to witnessing a meltdown when the bartender ran out of glasses and was not checked on from the minute I got my food to the moment I type this ... This is the only time I've been tempted to walk out ... Simply because the bartender deserves nothing and he probably wouldn't even know for a. Hour ... Idiot central"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for about an hour. Bartender refused to service me for some reason, most likely cause I asked about dietary information on some of the food. I dont like chain places and was there with a friend who had no issues being served.

The GM did reach out, but all he did was \"apologize\" and could really care less."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location.  We came to celebrate a birthday.  The bartender Jeremy was very amicable.  Jeremy made excellent drinks and had a great sense of humor. We got a booth once the rest of the party arrived.  Our waitress was Jackie and she was patient with the requests from some of the group members. I always order the bruschetta chicken pasta and it was delicious.  I would recommend coming here and if you go to the bar hopefully Jeremy is working and if you get a table hopefully you get Jackie."}
{"text":"I keep giving Friday's more chances in hopes that they will restore my faith in them, but I think I'm good. Tried one of their black angus burgers and it was very dry even after ordering it medium. The bun was juicier than the patty since it was covered in grease. The blue cheese was lacking. Fry portion is now smaller, everything we needed (i.e., napkins, mustard, water) we had to ask for. I could've and should've done better at home and saved myself $40. Sorry Friday's, I must bid you adieux....."}
{"text":"Only because I got a $10 comp is why I ate here, I soon learned that it wasn't worth it even if it was for free. The food is disgusting and it doesn't look anything like pictured on the menu. 

What you order may not be what you get. As an example, I ordered a Cesar Salad and it was served with wilted lettuce, some balsamic/oil dressing, no croutons, no parmesan cheese. I asked if this was the Cesar Salad and they said it was \"their version\" of the salad. 

My goodness, don't advertise something then change it up and call it \"your version\". Are they going to serve a sandwich, call it a hamburger, then call it \"there version\" when you question them about it? 

The food was under cooked, and somewhat cold. I asked if we could just cancel the order, but they said they couldn't and we should have ordered something \"better\" or \"read the menu\". I was upset, but instead of making a scene, I just left.

Not coming here again and I would suggest you to be cautious with what you order if you do come here."}
{"text":"Drink at the bar during Happy Hour for great value and early diners grab the days special or go for steak and lobster tails.Real bargain."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because the service is terrible. We were going to sit at the bar and we looked in and all the tables werent clean. So we decided to have the hostess seat us. So the area the hostess wanted to seat us was only big enough for 2 people when one of our friends might show up we decided to check out the bar again. It took them 35 mins to bring our appetizer out then another 20 for our food. We were on a tight schedule since our movie would start soon. There was just no sense of urgency with these people. The food is good just like every other tgif. I gave it 2 stars because of the happy hour special. Cheap food and drinks."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar area where we thought it was happy hour. They changed it so we had to wait 20 minutes so we could get the specials. Our server was not very friendly from the beginning and took a long time to come check on us. We ordered a couple of drinks finally, when happy hour started and it took 30 minutes to get our drinks. We got our food and  almost finished eating before our drinks came out. The customer service was not good. Not sure if the restaurant side is any better, but I wouldn't waste my time going to that location again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times had not so great service and the food was mediocre.

First time, i told him that i was allergic to tomatoes and to not put them atop my creamed spiniach.. and what do you know.. 10 minutes later it came out with tomatoes. Thats a FAIL in its self. 

The second time I went my friends hamburger was missing the top bun. Um, how do you forget to put a top bun on a burger. Thats what makes a burger look like a burger! Just plain crazy I tell you. Then I order a salad and he forgets my ranch. There were only two tables so his lack of remembering cannot be cause he was busy.

Just was disappointed in food quality, serve and overall appeal.

I'd rather go to mickey dees next time.."}
{"text":"This place really isn't any different than any other TGIF.  The \"experience\" started with the greeting (or non-greeting) by the teenage valley girl hostess and her friend.  We got seated and our server acted like he could care less that we were there.  The food was mediocre at best but that was probably my fault; I ordered a steak and, while it was cooked to the correct temperature, it was a less than desirable cut of meat.  I wasn't expecting steak house quality but I expected a strip steak with a little better quality than whatever this was.  My wife had chicken; at least they didn't screw that up."}
{"text":"Zero stars for me. They literally messed up on every single person at the tables order. Not to mention the food they brought out looked absolutely sloppy and disgusting. Waitress was nice through it all and understood but we ended up leaving."}
{"text":"My server was horrible...... the server was inattentive and slow. I will not be coming back. A hair in my ribs"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for a late lunch with a friend. The place was pretty dead and we were seated right away. Took 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then. Took another 30 minutes to just get our drinks (2 beers on draft) and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us. Finally our food came (soup, salad, boneless wings, and fries). A different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. After being given our food we were completely ignored, along with others in our section. Us and two other tables waited over 45 minutes just to try and ask for our check (one table just got up and left!) 

Being a server myself, I try to be very understanding to the wait staff. But this was ridiculous, the restaurant was not even close to busy and my section of about 5-6 tables was ignored."}
{"text":"The TGIF app sampler and weekday drink specials are where it's at. Good enough for 2.

Unlimited is too much food for 1 person and too restrictive. With unlimited calculated tip % on the receipt was off."}
{"text":"They're back.  So good to see TGI Friday's back in Champaign.  The food is excellent especially the Jack Daniel's menu items.  With the Ribs being the best.  You have just got to try them once.  The wait staff was hit and miss at first but after some training they're getting better as well.  Excellent atmosphere and good food, can't beat it."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Maxine the server and David the manager took care of my family like it was theirs.   Thank you so much for a great experience. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, restaurant was kind of messy. The ribs were overcooked and burnt.  There was an on duty police officer in the lobby area. I wasn't sure if I should of felt safe or worried"}
{"text":"Just okay. I went in for the unlimited appetizers promotion that I swore I heard being advertised days ago, but of course it was over. 

Like with all chains, you kind of know what to expect. On the particular stop, I ordered the parmesan chicken dish. It came with mac and cheese and a caprese salad, and it was only 900 calories. It was decent. I'd get it again. 

The service is so so. There is almost always a wait, which I don't understand. They have plenty of empty tables. 

If you're in Aliante Casino, it's an option though there are cheaper options in the food court."}
{"text":"This is the third time recently we went to the Fridays in Henderson.  Never again. We left without ordering which is something I never have done. The waiter was so very very RUDE that we left. We asked for a new server and talked to a manager but decided to leave. Why give them our money.  He should apply for a job a DICKS. To think when Friday first came to town in the 80's I used to stand in line just to get in."}
{"text":"Always come here service is great ,food is always good they are constantly changing the menu with new items ordered the Spicey shrimp and chicken  it was really good vivian is awesome"}
{"text":"I came to this particular TGIF with 2 of my coworkers for lunch to take advantage of the $12.99 ribs special that we saw on TV.

FOOD:  4/5.  We all had ribs with fries and coleslaw.  And at $12.99, it's tough to beat.  The only problem I had with the meal was the coleslaw.  I'm not sure if it was parsley or what, but it tasted weird.

SERVICE:  5/5.  Today (5/4/18), service was really fast.  Unfortunately, it's not always like that...they must've had \"hot n ready\" ribs.  I've been to TGIF several times before and they usually will take 20 min or so to serve your food.

AMBIENCE:  3/5.  It's inside the Orleans Casino and it's nothing special.  But, at least it was clean.


As long as they have $12.99 ribs, I'll be coming back.  Once that special is gone, ribs at Ellis Island, GVR's Grand Café, or Lucille's is a better choice."}
{"text":"Open late, cool decor, playing good hip music and yummy food! (the cheese sticks are to die for!) our server was Jordan, he was great! I'll be stopping in again :)"}
{"text":"TJI Friday's has fast, friendly service. 
Food came quick and fresh to the table, very friendly staff and the food was great! Im Definitely returning and i would highly recommend this place. Great place for lunch or dinner I really love the salads,ribs,chicken and appetizers also the drinks . Never had bad service I will be back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the pretzel appetizer but the rest was great food, had a nice waitress, I'll be sure to come back"}
{"text":"I cant tell you how awesome everything at this tgi fridays. 

Service. Lemitrius..i hope i spelled it right is my fav waitress. When i go in, i go straight to her section. Before she even makes contact with me. She already has my drink order in. We talk a little about our lives and always hugs me when i leave. She is the reason why im multiple visits a week.

And now im familiar with other staff members. I forget their names. Short white gal and a tall gentlemen with corn rolls.

The food is delicious. When i had a rare issue. They jumped to fix it"}
{"text":"Came in last night and the service was horrible. Although the food was delicious and they apologized and gave us free dessert. It wasn't a complete disaster."}
{"text":"I came here to have a drink and watch the kids playing in the stadium. The views are really cool and it was my first time at TGIF in quite some time. I had the cotton candy/ pink punk martini and it was really good... Sweet.. but good. Service was also enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not great. My waitress warmed up and was fun and friendly,  However the manager was rude and condescending. I'll take my money elswhere."}
{"text":"We have been here with groups of 10-15 for lunch multiple times. They are always able to get our food out in about an hour. The manager has checked on our table every time we've been here.  Servers are friendly for the most part. Unfortunately the food at all TGI Friday's is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waiter was a total b word. They are slower then ever. Need more cooks obviously."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. And it's pretty consistent at this location. I like the large booth set ups in the bar area. 
I think it's strange that they charge $1.00 for the Jack Daniel sauce but if you order something with the sauce you get extra automatically. (I love the JD sauce btw)
Today we ordered the steak & lobster $13.99 special. For the restaurant -- not bad. I like the other meals better those guys - the Maui Maui on the wooden serving board or the dragon fire salmon and I normally don't like cooked salmon. 
Happy hour starts after 3pm so don't get there too early ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, Bacon cheeseburger was delicious! A little slow on service, but only because there were huge parties eating. Great customer service and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars 
I check in often at this location and I've taken pictures here many times. But upon my last visit I was given a coke and I drank the entire coke. Then lord and behold their it was inside my coke... paper stuck to the inside of my glass. I don't even wish to explain the trip my mind took me on ...ewww ...I think I may have drank dirty dish water.  I felt like Alice In Wonderland I was almost ready to puke and hoping I didn't shrink down to a tiny size or get super huge.
However the management was standoffish and gave me free ice creme. The food over all was very good I took it home in boxes and ate it a day later. I love this location I love the service I get. But this time in was nothing to brag about. I will say this managers are trained to deal with good service. Id like to meet one who can do something other than look at me if something should go bad. I'm a very down to earth person had the manager just said I'm so sorry how can I fix this I would have felt better."}
{"text":"Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalapeño slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them."}
{"text":"So came here for the endless apps and Guess what they are out of the boneless wings and when the manager came over he was less then helpful or apologetic I would think being a manager you would know inventory control and have people reviews I know chains like this does not care about what one customer has to say but I just want to let you know if you come here expecting to get one thing they might be out of it"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I came here with low expectations, but we had a pleasant dinner at TGI Friday's with our children on their patio. It was a beautiful late summer day and we had to dine outside. We came here for a relaxing patio atmosphere and that's what we got. I had the Ultimate Mai Tai drink special which was tasty and cool - perfect for the day. I ordered the predictably good wings and my favorite Crispy Green Bean Fries. The fries were awesome! They come with a slightly tangy, possibly from horseradish, dipping sauce. I made the mistake of trying to add a slightly healthy item with a side Caesar salad, which I definitely do not recommend here. It was the worst Caesar salad ever. My husband ordered the Dragonfire Chicken, which he said was surprisingly good. I recommend coming here for the patio, appetizers, and sticking to the drink specials."}
{"text":"I don't think the host/hostess know how to tell time.  A 15 min wait is going on 25.  When we checked, they had our name crossed off but never called us."}
{"text":"They need organization at the front.  It's first come, first serve, but people are walking everywhere.  The girls seemed unfazed about the commotion.  The ambience is typical of a TGIF.  No thrills, no frills.  Food always taste the same.  Same music.  This location is within the Orleans where I was staying.  Great option.  The hotel give u a bogo when checking in.  Saves u some doe.  Server was good; bubbly."}
{"text":"I've been to this Friday's a few times, both for work and dinner, and have had great experiences. 

However, this latest trip was horrible. Granted, calling it a trip would be an exaggeration, as I walked out after 20 minutes. Nobody acknowledged our party of two was at the table, nobody offered water, took a drink order, nothing. Hell, we weren't even spoken to after we sat. 

I even made contact with the man I assumed was our waiter, and he just continued to walk on by like nothing happened. 

Service has always been good for the lunch crowd, but I doubt I'll be back for dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"This location is not good. We waited to long to be seated.  Once we were seated it was over 30 minutes before our order was taken.  We got almost no chips with our artichoke dp and what we did get were mostly small and broken parts.  The \"chicken\" was a joke, texture was like it was microwaved.  My boyfriend's plate was a small piece of chicken on a piece of wood and a couple pieces of broccoli for $16. Our server was very polite but overall for the $70 we spent on 2 drinks, 2 entrées, an appetizer, and tip was NOT worth it.  We could have gone to another of the restaurants in the Aliante and had a much better meal for less. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So, I don't eat out a lot, but wanted a good steak, and get boneless chicken wings for my picky 15 year old and decided to get it at TGIF.  Well, we went here for Mother's Day..big mistake.  We ordered ribeye/ribs combo, baked potato and salad.  My waiter was good and patient, bless his heart!  Our food came out, my steak was suppose to be medium well.  It was so tough and over cooked, I will say the ribs were really good, and the baked potato was so over cooked, the skin was dark brown and not edible! I love to eat my skin on my potato..not today! Received another steak, with another baked potato, the steak was a little better, and the potato once again was the same as the one before!  They gave me yet another potato, and it was a little better, but it was barely hot.  I just gave up!  My son's wings were dry, and he did not want anymore than what was on his plate.  I called the manager and she took off 1/2 the bill, but my gripe was that the manager knew that the waiter was taking back my order, why didn't he come to the table and apologize, and take off more if the bill.  My bill was $57.51.  Sara the manager took off half.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations for chain restaurants. This experience was no different. High marks because our server was very friendly and helpful. Points because we got a free entree side we had our movie tickets to the galaxy theater next door. 
We got an appetizer which was the pretzels and cheese. These are actually very good. Maybe a bit salty, but the sauce was a tad different and was tasty. My drink was not awesome. It was a mojito, which just was not refreshing as out should be. Oh well. And food was ok. . Typical chain mediocrity. 

I would come here again if I was being a quick meal before or after a movie side it's right there and with the ticket promo that works nicely. But if they didn't have the promo I would skip out and Jay easy snacks from trader Joe's across the street."}
{"text":"Most amazing staff bj the best waiter ever and brian is an fantastic bartender!!! Food always great if not they make it right.
Will come back for more. Bar area 1/2 price  appetizer is beat deal in town."}
{"text":"What great service! Our server was fantastic, drinks where all ways filled and food came out fast. Very pleased with my experience!"}
{"text":"Thank you for such a nice lunch. Food was quick and delicious. Our server was amazing. Gave us information on deals, how to get free appetizer through their reward program. Our drinks were always filled, my margarita was perfect, we were constantly checked up on and the manager was also amazing. I heard him say \"we can make that happen\" anything any of his guest wanted he accommodated them including myself when I ordered a specific item with my meal. Awesome crew and service Friday's!! Thank you."}
{"text":"Def a fun place to eat overlooking chase field.  Had the all you can eat appies for $10 and came out way too full."}
{"text":"I've been to many Friday's in many different cities.  When it comes to this one I have one main question: Where is the menu?  It's only like 2-3 pages.  I'm used to Friday's menus going on and on like 6 or 7 pages with many choices to choose from.  I ended up getting the Jack Daniel's steak since the menu was so limited and it was half way decent, the vibe was not there like a normal Friday's, and with the limited menu I'll never bother with another one in this area."}
{"text":"If I could I would rate a zero. I asked for gluten-free nondairy, I received my steak with some yellow stuff on it. I asked the lady who brought out my food what the sauce was on my steak. She said garlic butter and started to walk away. I had to almost yell \"excuse me\" to get her to stop walking. She stopped, turned around and threw on a fake smile.  I sent it back, I'm paleo. Hence the reason I asked for dairy free. When I sent the food back, I had a new plate within three minutes with no butter. You cannot cooked a steak \"well\" in 3 minutes. they never offered me a steak sauce for my steak.  Our table didn't have ANY silverware on it. Our ketchup bottle was empty. I went over to another table to get silverware and ketchup. I went to ask for the manager, the manager came to the table I asked for A1 steak sauce. I cut just the tip of the steak, I tried to chew it and could not. I tried to cut another piece and could not cut the steak. It was so tough. I took the steak back to the manager he said he would get me a new my plate since my fries were already cold and so was my broccoli. The third plate was edible enough to pay for. They brought out the bill which for me was comp'd. This will be my last time visiting this location. I should've read the reviews for this location, I would've seen it only had a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at this place before and my girlfriend and I were hungry so I thought we would take a chance here. There was no one in sight to seat us first of all, so we wandered inside looking at their decorated walls. After awhile someone approached us and had us sit at a booth. When it was time to order, all I wanted was this spicy shrimp pasta. When it came, it didn't come with a piece of bread or a cracker or anything else. I was a little disappointed because I love eating bread with my pasta. I asked our server if bread came with it as soon as he delivered it and he said \"no it doesn't but you can buy some.\" I said no it was okay and then he proceeded to the couple on the booth behind us. I could clearly hear his conversation with the couple as he approached them and said, \"hey guys, chef put the wrong meat on the grill so you guys are going to be getting an even bigger steak\" and I could hear how excited they were. Just hearing that right after I had my bread request dismissed really set me off internally. I understand that bread may not be free at this place or may not be given with pasta dishes but to hear someone get an even bigger piece of meat while I couldn't get a piece of bread just doesn't make sense to me. To add to this issue, service was really really slow. I don't see myself ever going to another TGI Fridays again."}
{"text":"I went there with two friends on Saturday the 15th and the service was horrible. No one came by to serves us or acknowledged us being there and we were waiting for ten minutes and we just walked out. Will not come back again to this TGI Fridays"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and it was just alright. The waiter was nice but kinda slacked on the service."}
{"text":"80th Birthday, 9 people, EXCELLENT service from Bridgette , decent price. Great overall experience"}
{"text":"Not too much to expect here but I will say for as long as I've been eating TGI Friday's this one is the best location. My family and I came to celebrate my brothers birthday and everything was great. The food took a little long to get to the table but it did look like our server Larry got double sat a few times. He kept his cool through it all and gave us nothing but the best customer service and even threw in some complimentary chips and salsa when it was clear we were getting hungry lol. Overall, I was satisfied and glad we were able to sit enjoy each other's company and eat some good food. I had the dragon glaze salmon."}
{"text":"I think this place isn't given enough respect. Staff is great and food is what you'd expect. Atmosphere is great and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I were traveling across country. We are not big fans of chain restaurants but, this place was near our hotel and it was late so we tried it. Our waitress Malibu was fantastic, she explained the menu perfectly and gave her thoughts on what we liked. We ordered the special meal and a drink for  $12. each. We both ordered the grilled mahi mahi served on a plank. Excellent meal for the price with wine...How can you lose ?"}
{"text":"This is the worst rib-eye steak i ever ate!  It is really tough abd chewy for my medium cooked steak.   Not satisfied at all.   But the customer service is good."}
{"text":"It really depends on the day and which teenage cooker they have in the back.  Standard industrial chain fare with some attempts at a broad spectrum menu.  Definitely something for everyone - the menu is extensive.  The restaurant is clean.  When prepared to corporate specifications, the food is really very tasty.  Steaks are thin, so don't even bother ordering a temperature other than well done.  Again, it really depends on the staff they have on hand.  Disputes over the quality/proper temp whatever of your food are handled in the appropriate corporate manner with a bit of tired sarcasm born from repetition.... Basically, you can go in here and get a satisfying meal or you can go in here and get a crappy factory meal.  Again, it really depends on the daily staff.  As you know, TGI Fridays is not a \"destination\" restaurant.  It's the place you go when you want a quick tasty meal when you are shopping or don't want to cook or don't want to spend your entire paycheck.  It is what it is.  This specific branch however is not consistent in quality."}
{"text":"Should have Yelped this place first. It lived up to its other poor reviews. Slow service, but friendly. The food was average. The chicken and shrimp came on a sizzling platter with burnt cheese spattering grease on my t-shirt. The chicken was overcooked but edible. When you're on-the-road traveling your food options are often chancy. I've learned my lesson to Yelp first."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the chicken skewers. Really good  spicy but not too. Partner had shrimp  very good he said and he's a complainer!  Server pleasant and efficient. No complaints"}
{"text":"Good service, great food, and fantastic Detroit Lions bar for Sunday/Monday football."}
{"text":"This is the worst..took over a hour for our food..Would not discount us for the slownest..Manager act like a little kid.."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've ever been to. I actually walked out upset.

We were seated immediately so the only good thing about this trip was there was no wait time, but FYI - Happy Hour only applies if you're sitting in the bar area.

It took 15 minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order, and another 10 for anything to arrive. A different waitress brought our drinks out and when we told her which one of us ordered what drink, she still gave us the wrong ones. Truly, I think maybe she was high. Meanwhile there are nothing but drunk people surrounding us, yelling obscenities and being inappropriate, and I'm sorry but one of the waiters smelled SO bad that it was hard not to cringe every time he came around. 

The original waitress never came by and we didn't see her anymore for a while. It took us 15 minutes to get ANYONE'S attention and request the check, then another 10 for my card to be charged and brought back out to me. Easily the worst TGI Friday's I've ever been to and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I had one of the best servers ever. Russ, he took great care of me and my family. The food was great as well. I will definitely be back for more. Jay"}
{"text":"Where do i even start?! Ordered the steak and salmon dinner and received the dragon salmon....a completely different entree. Was brought out a new salmon that was raw on the inside smh! Spoke to TWO different managers for ONE meal! NEVER again will i be coming to this location."}
{"text":"It's Friday, I had high hopes for this Friday. I loved it back in Hawaii but here Sam's town was the worse my server name was Jordan. I asked for lemon wedges 
For my water. He came back with a coffee cup with 
Lemons in it. But with a big coffee ring around it.
It was very nasty.  So I didn't drink the water after that.
I ordered chicken wings and fries. Not one drum one
Drum stick. When I told Jordan about it.  
His response was, I just put in the order. Never will
I ever eaten the again. Bad service, bad food.
Look around you when you are there."}
{"text":"Once again I stopped going to the other location on W Sahara because twice the baby back ribs were dry and hardly any meat. This was just so so and not much better then the one on Sahara. I used to order the Ribs a lot at the Sahara location and it used to be good, they must be buying real cheap and not meaty ribs. Done with them."}
{"text":"1.) if you are going to offer a cocktail on the menu and you do not have the house liquor you should substitute the price for that liquor. Offered only grey goose for another option? 
2.) waiter did not ask about appetizers, shitty attitude. 
3.) food was below average, chicken was burnt noodles where undercooked. And for the prize I could of got a filet minion at steak house other than this.
4.) If you are going to have staff make sure they present themselves in a professional manner not have their pants sagging and have their ass hanging out."}
{"text":"Lame! There's a nationally-advertised rib campaign going on, and there's no ability to order online at this store (a requirement of the deal) using the website OR the mobile app. Then, when I call in, the people at the store won't give me the deal, or even REFERENCE the deal, even though I saw four commercials just today!

Nice going!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy this location. While not necessary chain fans, this Friday's has done a consistent job - great appetizers and dinners, the atmosphere is fantastic (always loud and hopping if you like that sort of thing) and service has been on the mark. Always get an amaretto sour, and hard to pass on their potato skins."}
{"text":"They need to hire host that know what's going on. Thar worst TGI I ever visited I will never recommend  this TGI ever nor will I ever come back
 I have informed  my employees  never to come here as well and explained my experience.  They said they would pass it on"}
{"text":"I've never reviewed a flat out franchise before, but I feel compelled to because I've never been to a TGI Friday's before and, more importantly, I have too much time on my hands.

No, I didn't go to Vegas to eat at TGI Friday's. We really weren't feeling that long buffet line though. We were seated quickly and a server came out of nowhere and yelled \"Hey HEY hey.\" Scared the hell out of me. I look at the menu and, unsurprisingly, most of that shit has meat in it. Even the salad! They chop up chicken and bacon in that shit. Mannn. I end up ordering this big ass potato with sauteed veggies in it. The heaviest vegetarian meal I've ever eaten. Pretty salty and really oily. Not really a complain, just something I noticed. 

Server was fine, food was adequate, I guess. I'll probably never come back. There's gotta be better restaurants in Las Vegas that aren't in smoke-filled casinos."}
{"text":"Friday's type food. Fast friendly service! Always a good meal and a good time at Friday's."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been coming here for 7 yrs. My server Clarissa is always on point, and Erika the bartender always keeps my beer ice cold and full. I always get the shrimp cocktail it's so good, and it's really fresh. My daughter had the wings. They were nice and crispy, and the sauce was so good. I give it 4 stars only because I've been coming here for ever and I've never met the manager. Not that they need one."}
{"text":"They don't let you order take out after 12 am !! They ask that you come in and order, wait for food, then if you want you can take it in to go boxes. Ridiculous because this restaurant is 24 hours. We called the New Orleans TGI Friday's and they were happy and able to take our order after 12 am."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had to take one star out. My last experience here was horrible. I ordered steak and ribs with a side of broccoli. My broccoli came with a paper label and my ribs were the worst ribs I ever had. Nothing compared to the one I had previously. Our waiter was really nice and helpful, he explained the paper in my broccoli was from the bag the broccolis came in and apologize a thousand times. The manager also explained the situation and my meal was on the House. The ribs were so hard that I've had bricks tender than that. Seriously! The waiter asked me if I wanted another rack of ribs but at the point I was totally disgusted and with no desire for ribs. I really wished I had a great meal as the other time I went there. This is one of my husband's favorites restaurants but after what happened I am not sure if I am willing to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place can never seem to get anything right. This is the second time I have been here this month and they have been below par. Service sucks. They are slow and non responsive. The endless apps is such a joke and they are slow with them. If you can't keep up then don't offer. They tried to seat 7 people in a booth meant for 5-6 people and then walk away. Drinks took forever to come out and everyone had such a lack luster attitude here. They need to shake things up around here and get in real people who want to be here. You have to ask everyone to repeat everything 2 and 3 times because they are mumbling. There is forever a 30+ minute wait here even when I can see empty tables because they aren't seating in the back. Management needs to take note."}
{"text":"Worst Fish and Chips I've ever had. Breading was wet around the fish. I couldn't tell the difference between the breading and the fish. To top it all off there was a guy next to me at the bar that was vaping so hard and blowing it all across the bar. It's hard to eat fish when all you smell is strawberries. I thought vaping was considered smoking and not allowed in restaurants. The management needs to be more present in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had the steak it wasn't what I was expecting. First off it tasted like the grill it's self it was too Chard in some places an it was over cooked. I had the sweet fries they we're under cooked. The only thing I had that was actually satisfying was the salmon an the hot tea. Besides that the service was excellent thanks to Tyler."}
{"text":"There was a few problems in the begging but the manager is the best I swear she took care of us very nice and very friendly staff food was very good  
Woulda gave it 5 stars but there was a hair in my food I'm a chef so I know how it is it happens manager made it right so I'll definitely be back she was awesome love this place I'll be back just to see the manager she's awesome I say make her gm"}
{"text":"Okay so I picked up a friend from the airport and we were all hungry. I had those 'Friday' commercials going through my head that with the unlimited appetizers. So we decided to go here. Now I want to say that while the server was a little slow (we think she was new) she was very friendly and this review is NOT against her. This is against the food. We got the appetizers and when we got back to the hotel...well all of us had stomach issues. All 3 of us. So no I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Las Vegas for Viva Las Vegas show and we were staying in the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. TGI Fridays it RIGHT next to the elevator that goes up to the rooms so it's really convenient (that's part of why they got two stars instead of one). I ordered the salmon and my b/f ordered the steak and shrimp off of the featured Jack Daniels menu. Here is a quick run through on what was unsatisfactory about the meal itself:
1.) steak was dry and chewy
2.) shrimp were much smaller serving than represented in menu picture
3.) baked potato didn't come w usual toppings, i.e. NO BUTTER
4.) salmon was tough on the bottom side/ overcooked and dry
5.) veggies that came w salmon were soggy and overcooked
My boyfriend was pretty annoyed by the steak being so disappointing, and we weren't expecting much this being a corporate food chain and all. We don't usually go to these places anymore for this very reason. 
So, bottom line is this. If your feeling lazy and are ok with food being \"passable\" then this is the place for you! But you've been warned. 
***Sidetone: Our waiter was Michael and even though he was really busy he was still very respectable and polite... I appreciated that."}
{"text":"We came at 3 in the morning because the other restaurants were closed. There service was decent. The waiter wasn't around to much but the food came out in a timely manner.  The drinks took a while to be filled up. The spanich artichoke dip was warm andMy sister and I split a burger and it was nice of them to cut the burger in half and split the fries. The burger was super greasy. All of our other food came out nice and hot. The waiter was funny and nice. Over all a decent place to eat at 3 in the morning."}
{"text":"Great service and frosted mugs. I Bailey say down at the bar before I was being waited on. Excellent place and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing stood out as particularly great. Service was slow and waitress was not very attentive to drink refills or anything really."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. 

TGI Friday's is TGI Friday's. You shouldn't come here expecting great service or great food. 

It's a place you dive into when you're hungry and wanting to sit somewhere. It might also be after a long night of flying back from Aruba. 

It was next to our hotel & it was late. The food wasn't horrible but nothing to write home about. Don't come if you're going to complain you weren't served great food. They never claim to be a gourmet restaurant."}
{"text":"This place seems to where we always end up when we can't decide what to eat. It's close to our church so coming here on our way home is convenient. 

Service has always been good, I've never had any issues. From their hostesses to all the servers we've had in the past, customer service have been consistent. 

Food is satisfying but they really need to change up the menu. I've passed coming here lately due to having tried almost everything on the menu. I'm not much for desserts. 

*Potato skins are a must obviously, it's always included with our order. 
*The boys always seem to go for the burgers 
*I always end up ordering pasta most of the time
*Mixed drinks here are strong ;-)."}
{"text":"Do not come to this location! We ordered 4 drinks and it took them 20 minutes to come out with them and take our order for food. Once we ordered that and another round of drinks, which took an addition 20 minutes we decieded to pay. We got charges the food that never came. The place was hardly busy (we saw like 4-5 other tables and at least 5 employees). We only saw the waitress 3 times. The whole ordeal took us over 2 hours for just a couple of drinks, waiting on food that never showed up and more waiting for our check. Just don't come to this location."}
{"text":"disappointing. very slow lackluster service. ribs dry , little meat and I paid for the good Jack Daniels ones. have had the same slow waitress twice in a row . ugh. tons of screaming kids. now 
on my must avoid list."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for during all you can eat appetizers but the service sucks. Spilled my martini without apologizing or cleaning it from my area, the drinks were not great nor tasted like the usual. Bartender D just needs more training!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi. Requested for spicy & blackened just like it was shown in the picture in menu. But got it as if it was just boiled not well done. Asked the server to take it back & blacken it but he said it was all they could, and just added some seasoning to it. The beer however was nice & flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I guess it's convenient for us. The service is always so so slow. We'd like to think that maybe TGIF's would make some changes after reading all the comments but wishful thinking. For two Sunday's now we've been here for happy hour appetizers but it's taking at least 20mins. for an appetizer. Really?!?!? 20 mins."}
{"text":"We basically sat down and got a server with crazy hair. His name was Odie. He gave us our food super fast, he cracked jokes and was honestly one of the friendliest servers I've ever had, plus he made our experience this visit pretty much amazing. I've been to TGI Fridays but never this location and it was worth it. He also joked around a little and knew our astrological signs and what our personalities were according to the signs and we laughed cause he hit the nail on the head when it comes to a server who's amazing. I recommend Odie to friendly people who have a sense of humor and who actually want to have a good time while enjoying a great meal served deliciously and fast."}
{"text":"The lunch menu was very good, very well priced, and the waitress was kind (Rachael ).  However, she was the slowest in history of human kind. We actually had to go find her to get our bill. Mind you , the restaurant was nearly empty, so she couldn't have been busy. After we gave her our card, it took nearly 15 minutes just for her to come back with the receipt. Like I said , she was very nice, but this has to be worked on"}
{"text":"Awful service...............inconsiderate. Sharpen up on training skills please
-signed a seasoned customer service professional
By the way the one star was given on the strength of the happening atomshphere!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was from Detroit and way cool dude. Bottomless boneless wings were very good and able to take a bunch home. The bar area was loud and didn't like that."}
{"text":"If you like to pay $8 for a glass of ice, this place is for you! We did happy hour and the cocktail that my husband had was a glass beyond full of ice...I didn't think to take a photo, but I should have.

My happy hour wine was fine.

The appetizers we had were: 

Shrimp cocktail--still frozen shrimp
Spicy chicken--I like spicy, but I could not taste anything else!
Sirrachi shrimp--bland and the avocado was all brown...gross!

Service was mediocre. The server ignored my husband when he showed her his empty $8 cocktail that had ice filling the entire thing!

We were so unhappy with the whole experience!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice. We enjoyed the food immensely. I've had the Jack Daniels burger and the Really Good Cheeseburger. Both  were hot, juicy, thick and very flavorful. They were messy, which to me is a sign of a good burger. My husband really enjoyed his Bacon Burger and fries. The onion rings were very crispy and tasty. Service was outstanding. The manager took time to visit each table. A very nice touch.
I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Friday's is usually our fall back when we don't know what to eat, the jack Daniels ribs are always good and we love the Mac and cheese, but the service is so inconsistent! We have had great service from billy (Bobby?) and completely ignored by the bartenders. Last night we went in for dinner, there were three workers standing there just staring at us.. I had to announce that we would like a table for two.. the hostess yelled for the girl to \"wipe it down\" before seating us.. we were told it would be  a 15 min wait for a booth or a table even though there were several tables and booths open and no one waiting. We were given the option of a high top ( which I hate! I feel like I'm on display)  but we took it.. as we walked to the table I noticed a booth open so I politely asked if we could sit there the girl responded \"we just seated someone there\" but I could see no one at the table and no menus down. I let it go( maybe they went to the bathroom) and took the table, once the waitress came and we ordered drinks, the booth was still empty! No one was sitting there. I told the waitress we were leaving because of the situation and instead of trying to fix it she removed our drinks and walked away! Get it together fridays! I love the food but hate the service!"}
{"text":"I was wondering why this Fridays only received 3 stars on average from yelp  reviewers. Now I see why and completely understand. This Fridays capitalizes on the fact that it is inside the gold coast. Don't think your going to see and get what you typically get from a city Fridays. Add at least $5 to $10 more on the meals and you get less food. 

Secondly, you better hope you get a good waiter/waitress. The last visit I had the waitress seemed nice enough at first, but as soon as I asked for more cheese for my salad and asked if it came with a slice of bread or crackers.? She said for a $1 I can get you a bread stick. I asked her to confirm that my $15 salad didn't come with ANY bread? Oh why did I ask that, she looked at me and said \"do you want the bread sticks or not!\" ..I just declined and ate my salad in silence. Her tip was a note that said \"its not always what you say, it's how you say it! And Of course I left a .25 cent tip to further express my satisfaction with my dining experience. A tip is not Mandatory and automatic people. Not with me. I'm paying for the food full price, the tip you earn! E A R N! I'm sure nothing will change at this location because it's the only 24 hour dinning restaurant on the property. The only reason I'm not putting that waitress on blast, is Because I forgot her name. She's lucky!...this time...."}
{"text":"The appetizers were the only redeemable part of our meal. After that, it went downhill. I ordered a chicken caesar salad....it arrived and the chicken was pink and it looked undercooked. When I asked our waiter if he could take it back and have it cooked more, he called over another employee (looked like he could have been a manager) who told me it looked fine to him. I asked if he thought it was cooked enough to eat, he huffed and repeated that it was fine but if I really wanted to, he'd take it back. I just ended up taking the chicken out of the salad and eating it plain. Not impressed with the food or their customer service,  we won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I  went to TGIF the Sahara and Decatur location on 3/11/17 a little after 1 a.m. I ordered the garlic parmesan chicken...they were fried extremely hard which made them dry. But me being me didn't complain because I don't like sending food back...so I continued to eat...and what did I find a long blonde piece of hair in my food drenched in the garlic sauce...I showed the bartender...she apologized and did offer me a fresh batch..but I declined...the order was removed from the bill."}
{"text":"The service is excellent!  They are vary friendly and cater to all your needs. I should of took a picture of my salad because the presentation was spot on."}
{"text":"Saturday night not too busy. Ordered steak mid-rare with langostino sauce topping. Cooked to temp. Good sides. Wife had grilled chicken Cobb salad. She said too much blue cheese & sauce on chicken was funky. Kid had grilled cheese.
Drink specials..... they are never in-stock of advertised mason jars. Weak alcohol. Service was mediocre.
Bourbon cake dessert. Outstanding"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review as many times as I've been here. A few years ago when I first moved to the area, while the service was good, the food was not prepared vey well. The last two times I've been in recently I can tell things have changed. I've sat at the bar both times and the bartenders are friendly. Both times I ordered the Cajun pasta without shrimp and it's so yummy, I came back within a week probably and had it twice because it was so yummy I had to get it again lol. The Barbados rum punch, while obviously not how they make it in Jamaica is very good. It's not very strong, nice and fruity which is how I like it. I'm glad the my sister pulled me in here one late nigh, because I had sworn off returning. My only complaint is that it's always freezing in there and for that I wish they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Good...! i  was surprise the way they take care of you do you feel comfortable to be over there take it of you the right... there be so great guy to access to the customer"}
{"text":"For chain restaurant like TGI Firidays I set the bar very very low, that way I never leave disappointed.
Service was very slow even though there were tons of waiters standing around and running back and forth.  The silver ware was spotty and could certainly use a better rinse before going into the dish washer.  When my ten year old little brother has a problem with the cleanliness of his fork you know it must be bad.  The tomatoes served in the wedge salad were rotten.  My plate had a barbeque sauce finger print on it that was not wiped off before serving. 
It took over 15 minutes for us to put our drink order in.  The restaurant had a damp dirty mop water smell. 
For my little brother and I to eat lunch and for me to have two sangria the total cost plus tip was $75.00 and I get to bring my little sister back next month for her birthday!!! 
 This Friday's isn't even trying to be good and way should they? They have little to no competition because they are adjacent right to the Consol and I am sure they just rake in the dough on game nights. 
The ribs were pretty tasty, but my fries were over salted so much so that I couldn't even eat more than two of them.  It took forever and a day for me to get my second drink.  
I got exactly what I expected, junk food with an absurdly high price tag served to me very very slowly. 
I will say that the hostess was very sweet.  I do wonder though how many residents of the Hill District or actually filling positions at this restaurant. There is ongoing controversy as to whether out not these cooperate chains are employing Blacks from the neighborhood....from what I saw they aren't.  I would love to see some more inclusion in this Fridays...but I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was awful. The cheese sticks were ice cold and the burger wasn't cooked the way we ordered it, but even worse there was a chemical taste to the burger. I don't know why I keep going back to this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in to have a couple beers and some bar bites. It was a Sunday night and very slow in the business. I sat at the bar and there were two bartenders who did a very good job. Fairly attentive. I ordered a couple of apps on the happy hour pricing. The boneless chicken tenders were cold but I was happy so ate them. Felt most likely that they were sitting and then sauced once I ordered them. The biggest issue was the other staff. They were standing around and talking about their sports bet and how much they won? I mean they were loud. Then they were loud enough to talk explicit along with cursing. For me I do not personally care, but this is not a hard core bar, I thought that this was a family restaurant? There was a manager on duty as well. She just seemed uninterested in what was going on."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to TGI Fridays at this location. Kinda surprised it wasn't added to yelp.com. So I did.

Evidently it has been here operating for a couple weeks. Kinda surprised that they didn't have NTN Buzztime trivia to enjoy. Friendly staff as always. 

Food was good. My steak was ordered MEDIUM. It arrived WELL-DONE. So it went back and was cooked properly the second try. The other the meals and appetizer was prepared properly and was highly enjoyable.  The server initially had a hard time keeping my coca cola full.  Had not my steak went back, they would have received 4 stars. Because service was just OK...just an average rating they receive."}
{"text":"I swear the service here is as slow as molasses. My goodness! Our last and probably final time was a few weeks ago after my daughter's promotion we were there for over an hour before we received our food. The place wasn't even busy. Honestly our last few trips before this were pretty close to this. It's extremely frustrating. Food is good, just don't go if you are starving."}
{"text":"It's TGIF...what do you expect. Food is ok and service is average. Nothing to write home to mama about. I like going here because it's close to home and the pricing is good especially during happy hour.  One thing I like about it is that there is never a wait when I come....I think once I had to wait maybe 5 or 10 minutes. Other than that hey are pretty quick with seating you."}
{"text":"Terrible, slow service in a nearly empty restaurant-nonevent night. I cannot imagine how they handle any kind of crowd here. 

Servers lack all attention to detail, and seem to have the attitude of \"why get it right the first or second time when you can apologize after you screw up?\" Manager apologized, too but still charged me full price."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated quickly.  We ordered mozzarella cheese sticks for our appetizer and a couple of drinks.  The martinis were on special that day so I had an appletini and it was really good.  I ordered a salad and my husband had the JD chicken.  Everything tasted great.  No complaints from us and we'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, the service here really is as bad as everyone says.  The employees are pretty nice overall but no one is in a hurry to do anything for you.  Three hostesses but 2 waitresses?  No bus boy?  Couldn't get refills till we were sucking on the leftover ice cubes.  Couldn't get water either.

I don't blame the employees but I certainly blame the management.  If there was a manager on duty we never saw him.  

It wasn't terrible but they won't survive if the service continues to be this bad."}
{"text":"Signed up for the rewards program for a free appetizer. Got the jack Daniels chicken strips, can't go wrong, right? WRONG. They were either burned or fried in old oil. I had ordered onion rings. Right before I got the chicken strips so I didn't know they tasted terrible... they were just as bad. The menu states that the onion rings are $5. I was charged $8. I asked the server. He said I order the appetizer and didn't add them to a meal so they were $8. My boyfriend ordered a meal, he could have added them to that meal, or explained that there was a price difference when I pointed to the $5 ones on the menu. Three dollars is no big deal, it's the principle of the matter. The menu does not state that there's a discount for adding to meal... Not to mention we kept flagging down a waitress that had a table nearby to help us get our check. I probably won't ever be back to that location."}
{"text":"I was working graveyard when I ordered for carryout to this place. The bar tender handles everything at this point and was so nice and friendly. She talked to me over the phi phone like we'd been friends forever and when I got there to pick up my food same thing. The food came out hot and fresh and she loaded me down with sauces which is something I always hole for. My jack Daniels burger was so bomb. That's what I usually get and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible service the food was served cold it took forever to get the food out and we were not informed they were out of one of the items we ordered till the food was delivered."}
{"text":"So we get the advertisement about the $10 (per person) endless appetizers. I'll call to ask what age they actually charge & she wouldn't give me a number, just said ALL people, doesn't matter if it's kids or adults would get charged... my daughter just turned 2... I asked so if she ate a little of it we would be charged an extra $10, she said yes... umm, my daughter is 2, she wouldn't even be able to eat a 'whole' plate of an appetizer... they should make an age rule on this \"deal\"... if she was one & ate off my plate, we would be charged too?"}
{"text":"I don't get how they only have 2 and a half stars!! It took a couple minutes for us to get seated but you need to understand stuff like that went there's only a server for the bar and one for the dining area. Not a problem to us. We get seated and within a few minutes our wonderful server got us our drinks. We ordered the nacho grande for an appetizer. It was so good! I loved every bit of it. The pico was so fresh and amazing! I got the jack ribs and shrimp and my boyfriend got Cajun shrimp and pasta. The ribs fell off the bones, so tender and amazing. The jack sauce was to die for, the shrimp was so crispy and good I cried a bit. His pasta was spicy but so good. I really loved it. Perfect amount of sauce and just everything. Andrea, our server, was consistent when it came to refills and such. She did really well! Next time I go back, I'm asking for her! I'm happy that the first time my boyfriend tried it, he loved it! Will be back. (:"}
{"text":"My sister and I came for dinner. We ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp which was delicious.  Our server was Chris. He was the BEST!  He was very helpful with the menu and the service was great. He was also very friendly and had a warm personality.  All in all it was a great experience!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often but my husband and I were in the area. 

They had great food and good happy hour prices.

The service was excellent and the bar tender had a very contagious laugh!"}
{"text":"Well me and my husband went here for lunch.  The food and service was terrible.  It wasn't crowed and we waited 40 mins for our food to come out.  When the food did come out it looked gross.  We both ordered a burger and fries.  The burger was nothing but grease.  This place is to expensive for the type of food they serve.  We will never go back.  The burger was $12 bucks it was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Service at this location is almost non existent.  Hostess practically threw the kids menu at us. Been here more than 10 minutes without even seeing a waitress or being asked if we want something to drink. Waiting on manager now. Not too many people here so I can't understand the long wait.  I live right around the corner from this location and will definitely never come back. Absolutely crazy"}
{"text":"Went in after church service (on Easter) and got seated pretty quickly! Not only that but the waitress was very helpful in sharing some of her favorite dishes (i like doing this to see how much they know about the food they serve!). I got the 8oz stake which I wanted MORE of (it was soooo good) with a side of Stake Fries. The wife loved her shrimp & ribs combo plate (which I of course \"tasted\" as well) and it was very good. The shrimp had a tasteful seasoning to it that when they breaded it, it stayed juicy... The baby raved about the mash potatoes... She said it was \"hmmoowerasommmmm....\" lol. Oh and before I forget, their Jack Daniel sauce was interesting and would go back to get more... Thanks for looking!"}
{"text":"There is one good thing about Friday's: the Jack Daniels sauce, everything else is disappointing.

The outside of the building is nice, but the inside is dim and has the cluttered, nostalgic look that only works at Cracker Barrel.

The potato skins that used to be epic are tiny, overcooked crisps with a nickel-size dab of \"cheese\". The wings are tasty, but so tiny you begin to worry that you were served the sickliest of chickens or the wings of a smaller fowl. The potstickers were the most disappointing appetizer: hard skin and salty, gummy, grey filling. The meats are average burgers and ribs), but it's the sauce that makes them yummy. 

The service is basic, but there are a few friendly bartenders. 

I won't be visiting Friday's again for a while, not until I forget or forgive my lukewarm experiences here and give them another chance to underwhelm me."}
{"text":"Hello yelpers!!!!! A hidden gem awaits you inside Sam's town. Initially we went in for the big rib sale special that tgif's was running on Tv and we got more than we could have bargained for. Our waiter named Matt was great and provided excellent service. We ordered the ribs and steak and lobster. The food was tasty and filling. We were so impressed we signed up for the tgif's rewards app. We went back the following week and were treated like Vip's. Matt was excellent again and the manager Janet really did a great job with an irate low class customer who was next to us and was clearly out of line wanting to blame anyone and everyone except her ghetto self for of all things a lost phone charger. Any who, do yourself a favor and visit this location. They are open late and run a great steak and lobster special after 10 at night.  And then you can check out the mystic falls show after that or just enjoy a little Vegas roll of the dice!! And remember, the random element of chance always favors the prepared mind!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here for an early lunch before our movie at the Galaxy Theatre on Saturday 9/3/16. I follow a strict Pescetarian diet (I only eat vegetables and seafood). I ordered the pretzels off the appetizer menu, and asked our server if she could make sure there was no bacon in the cheese dip that comes with It. Her response? \"There is no way to take the bacon out of the cheese dip, the cooks have already premixed it for the day.\"  I find it very hard to believe that they couldn't heat some plain cheese up, and just not add any bacon to it for me. On top of that, this server was very short with us, and looked very annoyed to be working there. Also, the clam chowder my grandma ordered was way under seasoned, and came out messy with drips down the sides. My fiance's Jack Daniel's burger came out well done, when he specifically ordered it medium rare, and they did not bring the usual side of Jack Daniel's sauce. Will never come back."}
{"text":"So yesterday my boyfriend and I came to eat around 6:40pm. We first aren't greeted when walking in. Waiting about 3 mins to get seated. That was fine until we waiting for about 10 mins till meeting with our server and our server was really short with us didn't really ask if we were ready to place our order , which we were ready to, just asked for our drinks and left. Time passes by and a total of 20 mins pass by till we get our drinks and they're given to us by the host not the server. So by this time my boyfriend and I thought we'd go to the bar and get better service. We were wrong because we got just as bad service there as well. Our server there came and started talking to us about 5 mins and literally left in the middle of us talking twice , it was so rude. It took my boyfriend to raise his hand and stop the server to get our order in and that point we gave the server our whole order so we didn't have to stop him anymore. Terrible ass service."}
{"text":"Just terrible. Sat down and didn't see a server for 10 minutes. Took our orders and had to track her down afterwards. 
The salad was HORRIBLE and was so limp, i couldn't pierce it with my fork. 
After asking and being informed that they had one large hopper of lettuce, she even asked if i wanted another salad. HELLO!!!!! It's the same lettuce!!!!!! Just bad bad bad all around."}
{"text":"So I cam for lunch and I have to say the service is terrible and slow. There are employees standing around talking and I had to wait to be seated even though the place is empty."}
{"text":"Best Friday's ever. Food and Service exceptional for a national concept. Amazing outdoor patio with privacy. Able parking. Fast Kitchen."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waiter took five minutes to come to the table then five minutes for soft drinks on a Wednesday I got.  Got up and left talked to the manager and offered to give us appetizer cards for next.  Not happening not going to be a next time."}
{"text":"So so SO BAD. 

SYSCO slop poured out of plastic bags, slid under heat lamps, then brought to you by scowling, apathetic servers. Everything - from the floors to the bathrooms to the servers themselves - was unclean. Nothing less appetizing than watching servers wipe their faces with their hands, check their phones, etc, then stick their fingers in the basket of food that's been under a heat lamp for 27 minutes. 

Salad was brown. 
Kids' desserts were sad. 
Whole place was SAD."}
{"text":"Ate here this evening with my fiancé, we arrived at about 430, sat in the bar area at one of the high top tables. Great atmosphere, and yummy food! We ordered a salmon and sirloin combo with the choice of two sides and the sirloin and chicken combo (not on the menu but they made it happen), and the spinach dip appetizer. The steaks were cooked perfectly and very well seasoned and we loved our spinach dip. Our servers name was Scott and he was the cherry on top of the cake! Wonderful service, we will definitely be back to see him! Thanks Scott!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, drinks were good. Waitstaff were unfair. We sat down well before the end of happy hour and ordered full price drinks, at the end of our meal I wanted to order a beer, they had what I like on tap and a good price for happy hour, but happy hour has just ended. He told me he couldn't give me the happy hour price even though I had already bought full price drinks and had been there before happy hour ended. The table next to me got there right when we were about to leave and asked if they could have happy hour drinks, and because they knew someone who used to work there they got the happy hour price even though they didn't show up until it was over."}
{"text":"Service was very slow from the beginning.. It took a while for us to get our water. I ordered a blue raspberry slushie which also took awhile to be served. It tasted okay.. But the mango peach slushie was way better! You can change flavours! 

We got the all you can eat appetizers for $10 but now you can only get refills on the same appetizer you ordered. Whereas in the past, you could change the appetizers you ordered.

So we got loaded potato skins which was delicious. The skin was crispy and the potato was soft and the cheese was so good! The bacon bits were crispy! 

We trie jack Daniels and barbecue boneless wings. The jack Daniels were my favourite. They were sweet and crispy! 

The potstickers were very hot when they were first served and after awhile, the skin of the potsticker was just really floury and chewy."}
{"text":"Well, I went specifically to try their black bean burger and sweet potato fries. My to-go order came fast, though my sever was kind of rude and I stood there right beside her with my receipt and money while she did everything but acknowledge me. I almost walked out until one of these people made eye contact and let me pay. I must say the burger was great. The fries were kind of soggy and also, maybe I'm a pig but for a $15 meal, the size of my fry order is kind of ridiculous....I almost took it back but I didn't feel like being ignored again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE?? 

I went after I went to a movie I was starving I ordered a steak with a side salad ...... It was about 1am or so when I left I went home took a shower went to sleep

When I woke up I felt like DEATH! I woke up drenched in sweat had to run straight to the bathroom.... I had such bad pains in my stomach u had never felt them before in my life

I went to the doctor and lord and behold FOOD POISONING..... 

I will never return I've never had food poison before and I want to never get it again EVER it's horrible unless u enjoy bonding with the toilet"}
{"text":"I've been to tgif before, but in this one, there are friendly staff members,  and the waiter named David was particularly nice to us out of towners. We had questions about local spots and he was very helpful. He even suggested a special that my husband really enjoyed and I had my salad and side dish.  Thank you for your service and demeanor David!"}
{"text":"Got turned away at 10:52pm for food. The kitchen closes at 11pm and the bar is open till 12am."}
{"text":"From 4/4/15
We stopped into this TGIF's for some food before hitting the bars later that night. The place was packed, which is to be expected on a Saturday night. We were seated at a table that had a TV hung above the center of it. It was pretty awkward because we could not divert our eyes away from it since it was above the center of our table. Also, There seemed to be a lot of birthday celebrations going on, so we had to endure that awful, terrible franchise version of happy birthday like five times- gah!! 

Anyway, we had a nice server, who got out food out to use in a timely manner. I got the Jack Daniels burger, it was cooked nicely, and flavorful. Next time we come in I'm asking to be seated at a booth to avoid having a TV above my head."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this Fridays turned out to be one of my better dining experiences.  Service was outstanding and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This place sucks so hard. Haven't seen this much worse service in an american restaurant."}
{"text":"Not amazing, not terrible. The green bean fries are pretty good but the rest of the menu is blah."}
{"text":"Spent the last 5 days coming to the bar for dinner. Kacy is among the best bartenders I have had the pleasure of dealing with. Blake as well as Katie did wonderful jobs as well. However dealing with Kacy the majority of my time there, she deserves the recognition for her outstanding performance for both a bartender as a server. 10/10 on her part. I will for sure come back just as I have in the past to be apart of this atmosphere.

{"text":"I was there with a group of 3 [total 4] old co-workers for lunch. It's a chain so we will cut to the chase

Pros: The waitress was superb. The service was prompt and the food was served quickly and efficiently. Despite me forgetting her name she has been one of the more tenured servers.

Cons: Nothing more than the fact that it's a chain so mediocre food."}
{"text":"Took 4 kids to dinner here. Endless apps were awesome and cooked fast and delicious. Plenty gluten free options. Breanna was a fantastic waitress!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service I ever came across. There was no hostess at the front desk and had to wait for 15 minutes for no reason even though the place wasn't busy. Even after being seated nobody showed up at the table so had to leave for another food joint."}
{"text":"Gotta say I am surprised at all the recent bad reviews. This is our go to place after the movies (usually mid-afternoon) and perhaps that is the difference as perhaps the servers/chefs/mgrs. change before evening when most of the unhappy customers seem to have come in. Never have we had anything but great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!"}
{"text":"Happy hour ALL day Sunday and free appetizer if you sign up for their deals on tgifriday.com. That is an awesome deal! All four of the members in my group signed up and we all shared our appetizers . $2 beers oh yea! Our bartender was awesome and friendly. The service was great. There were tons of tvs with the games on in the bar area. This TGI Friday's is open 24 hour and serves breakfast. You can also get food delivered to your room. 
Some reviews mention that it is located off the strip in the rundown depressing Gold Coast. Yes this Hotel/restaurant is older and not as \"cool\" as the new places but you can't beat the friendly service and deals. My boyfriend and I each got one drink at a bar at the MGM and it was $38. At TGI Friday's a group of 4 ate and drank heavily for under $30! We had just as much fun or more at the Gold Coast."}
{"text":"I ordered steak fajitas, my second time at this location.  it was excellent!

The steak had a good flavor and was very tender. It came with cilantro rice and black beans both were very good.

My only complaint would be it took some time for our order to be taken.  The waitress was very nice but clearly overwhelmed.

I would go there again."}
{"text":"If you want mediocre food, service and overall experience then come here. Otherwise, don't bother. I have been here twice- once last year and most recently for a luncheon after a funeral service. Last year, I had no issue. I ordered a typical lunch with a half sandwich and salad and it was pretty good. I sat at the bar so service was quick and it was an overall pleasant experience. However, my most recent visit was not so great. We were visiting for a luncheon after a funeral service, there was around 12 people in our party. Everyone was ordering individually off of the menu, we opted out of getting a buffet. The manager greeted us right away, which was great, however he was absent for the rest of our time there. We had three servers for our party- which should have been plenty. However, the service here was downright embarrassing. As a former server, I am pretty forgiving. However, when it is noon on a Saturday and it's dead in the restaurant and our servers are no where to be found, there is no excuse for that. Our food was quick to come out, which was great, but no one really came by to check on how our meals were until we were all done eating. My boyfriend and I ran out of water multiple times, and there was no one around to refill them. I ordered french onion soup and a house salad and immediately after being served I noticed that the garlic stick did not come out with my salad. I asked one of the servers for it and 20 minutes later, it still did not arrive. I had to ask another server for  it, after I had already finished my salad and soup. The food itself was below average. The $5 salad was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes with a few cucumbers. The french onion soup was just awful- barely any cheese and very few onions. Overall, I was really disappointed in this experience and will not bother returning."}
{"text":"Came here after watching a movie with the wifey and friends. Since it was almost 1 am and these guys close at 2, we figured sharing an appetizer and an entrée would hit the spot before going home. 

We had a choice of either sitting at the bar or inside the main restaurant. To me it looked like nobody was in the main so a booth at the bar was gonna have to do. At the time it was 5 dollars for some of their appetizers because it was happy hour. I was more interested in their 2 for 10 promo that was happening at that time. You get your choice of appetizer and entrée for 10 bucks. The only kicker is that your choices are limited. I wasn't picky so I went with the Pan Seared Pot Stickers and the Jack Daniels Burger. I had water for my drink. (btw, their water is straight tap so its not filtered)

We got our food after about 10 minutes and I gotta say, they make the pics in the menu look so good but when you get it, it looks nothing like it. I have had their Jack Daniels Burger before and I remember it being quite tasty. I always order it medium so that its still juicy. This one seemed like it had no flavor. I literally had to douse it with the Jack Daniels sauce just so I can get any kind of flavor. As for the potstickers, bland and almost unedible. 

I don't know if it was because it was almost closing time but it seemed like the ambiance was \"we are closing soon so you get what you pay for\" feeling was in the air. Service was weird because you have a main server and several different servers that bring out your food and drinks so if you had any questions or want to order more stuff, I didn't know who to bring it up to.

In the end, when we got our check, I noticed we were charged regular price instead of the 10 and some change. I pointed it out to our server and her excuse was that someone else rung it up and not her. So instead of apologizing and taking care of it, she blamed someone else for the mistake. 

So needless to say, our overall experience was not very pleasant at all. Memo to corporate: I know a major chain is hard to keep your eye on since you guys are everywhere, but something has to be done in regards to service and quality of food. It has gone down big time. It will be a long time before I eat at any TGIF and that is being generous."}
{"text":"Again our server Jay was awesome he made sure our food was correct out of the kitchen and it was piping hot. If you come to this locale please ask for this server he's great and his service is on par."}
{"text":"We have to pleasure of being served by a pair of sisters. One is in training but their service is excellent. Food came out hot and our steak was wrong and they made it right quickly. Great service"}
{"text":"Less than one star.   Takes forever to be seated.  Server comes to me and asks what I want? In a harsh demanding way.  Left took forever to get a water and didn't give me a menu.   Don't go here !   And they don't offer the promotions as other tgi Fridays.   Awful experience...."}
{"text":"Literally this TGIF's has the WORST service I have ever had in my life. Maggy is my waitress and she is absolutely horrible. Her attitude is disgusting along with her service. Attitude the whole time. Shaking her hair and head. Walking away while asking to order. She NEVER came out with my drink. I had to ask ANOTHER waiter for my orange juice. Unbelievable. I sat for 10 minutes with no drink not even a water. I watched two other tables be served before me when they arrived after me. I will never return here. And I suggest you do not eat here. Even if you love tgif like me, drive to another location don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went with our two kids to Fridays tonight 5/24/2017 for dinner. We had seen the commercials about Endless appetizers. We first arrived and were told there was a 5-10 minute wait but yet there were a ton of tables open and could have been used. Right off the bat we felt the restaurant did not staff enough wait staff. After about ten minutes we were seated in a table section that was loaded with a big party and several smaller tables. We sat at our table for a good ten minutes before our waitress even came over to ask us for our drinks. My wife got a coke my son got a chocolate  milk and I got a $3 bud light draft. It took my wife's drink literally about 8 minutes and my beer and my sons milk came after we already got and finished out first round of appetizers. The list of what apps you can choose from is rather big so no complaint there. We got Potato skins mozz sticks a lot of boneless wings pot stickers. It's decent bar food. The signature jack Daniel's sauced wings were horrible to the point we had to waste that order as it did not taste good. the pot stickers were nothing special either. Our waitress NEVER came back to ask my wife if she wanted a refill I walked up to the bar TWO times myself to ask for a refill. The bartender was very very nice and got us our refills and said sorry a few times for our waitress not doing her job. Now to be fair I won't blame our waitress for everything as there were only two girls for a big amount of people I blame management. I spent $33 and change before my $5 tip. I will try the Mentor location next time. I work in the area so we wanted to stop in the Mayfield hts location since we were right by it. My wife and I also felt another table got more attention when it came to getting re orders put in. I tried to put a few orders in at a time but that kind of back fired as they were not put in correctly so we would get all of one persons order and the other people would not have what they wanted in front of them to eat. We don't eat at Fridays been to this brand only a few times several years ago. Do your self a favor skip the all you can eat option and get your self some good draft beer and bar food else where. Two bucks next store would of been better. We just wanted to eat at a place we normally don't as we are tired of the same carry out options. We won't return to this location.(No photos of the food my son had my phone watching youtube)"}
{"text":"Here for a college reunion.  Not bad for a late night dinner at a bar.  After flying in from LA and dealing with traffic, I didn't want any more stress for the day...I've reached my limit.  Very convenient considering it's open 24hrs.  Right next to hotel elevators and casino.  Great place to just chill out and people watch.  Food was good.  I had the bourbon barrel mahihi with fresh tomato mozzarella salad and broccoli and it was delicious!  It helps too that I was served by a cute bartender."}
{"text":"TGI Friday's is not a place you go expecting gourmet food. However, I was pleasantly surprised by my lunch the other day. I tried the 2 for $12. It came with a FULL appetizer and entree. Wow. I think, hmmm, how can they make money off of this.

Nevertheless, it is comfortable and a great place to grab an easy meal with a friend. I had the mozzarella sticks and the chicken with angel hair pasta. The sauce was balsamic based with fresh chopped herbs and tomatoes. The food was filling and a great comfort meal. 

I had one of their specialty iced teas and was not overly impressed by it. I do like their drink specials and they have something different to take advantage of each day.

Overall, for a chain place, this place is pretty decent."}
{"text":"We eat at Fridays because of the rewards.  It's not the first place I think of going but if I have a buy one get one free dinner I'll go.  The past few visits the food has just been ok.  Our last visit my husband ordered french onion soup.  It never came so he asked twice about it.  Finally, after he finished his entire meal, it showed up.  He had a bowl of broth with two bread slices and very little cheese.  Not the oozing over the bowl cheese...just small amount on the bread.  NO ONIONS!  We had a free dinner because of our rewards and a free birthday dessert so I couldn't complain.  If we were paying full price for this meal I would have been super unhappy.  Don't bring us in on coupons then serve us a crappy dinner!"}
{"text":"Sarah.Sarah.Sarah... Only great things to say about her, if anyone wants to understand the true meaning of customer service come and ask for her. She will treat you like royalty and promises only the best of opinions from the menu and guarantees it will only satisfy your taste buds. 

FIRE!!! Is the definition of the jack Daniel burger. It was so vivid in taste, so juicy and tender, so satisfying in every way possible. It had the most accurate amount of TLC you can put into food. 

To make a long story short the atmosphere is good, food is great, and service from SARAH is fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The food is always perfectly cooked, the service is awesome and I love the fact that the Manger of this Friday's is rolling up her sleeves and helping out her staff and making sure everyone is well taken care of.  They are all so friendly and are constantly asking if you need anything. I prefer coming here over the other locations in the Vegas/Henderson area. Teresa you are extra awesome!"}
{"text":"Where else can u get 6$ cocktails (call I.e. patron & kettle one etc.) As well as steak and lobster for 13$. 

Amber provides amazing service during the day and the graveyard staff is also on point 34/7. The JD ribs and wings r Fuego. The mashed potatoes r also solid and the pricing even when happy hour isn't in effect is very reasonable for 24 hr service. 


I come here often if your a local I recommend you do the same word to the wise the word of mouth promotion if you have a EE industry id is an additional 30% off boomshackalka."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY ZERO STARS. Came in, was asked if we preferred a table or a booth (my husband and I were accompanied by our two children so a booth is always easier). Hostess came back and stated there would be a 10-15 minute wait for a booth- not a problem since we were requesting something out of rotation. Wait 15 minutes- hostess comes back and says she can only sit us at a table. Ok. Get sat at table and proceed to sit there collecting dust for 15-20 minutes waiting on server. She finally shows up. Electric blue eye liner. Took our order so finally we were hoping things might look up from this point. WE WERE WRONG. SO. SO. WRONG.

I ordered a side of fries for my 3 year old to eat- never came out. Food comes out ungodly late, of course waitress that is somehow employed never comes over to bother to check to see if we need anything or if anything is ok. Instead the whole group of them stand behind the bussing station complaining about their jobs and that they should've been off work long ago (in earshot of our table). The best part of the meal was sitting for 20 minutes after my meal came out with no waitress in sight to provide utensils to ACTUALLY EAT WITH. So my food became completely cold. Everyone else at the table had no napkins (at all to the point I had to pull out tissues from my purse to wipe our hands with). At that point we asked for the fries we were being charged for on the kiosk along with boxes for all the food we couldn't eat due to zero cutlery. All waitress could say was- sorry. *eyeroll* 

Just absolutely horrible. The correct way to fix the disaster of a situation would've been to go to the manager as an employee and notify that the guests were extremely unhappy and if they could mediate the situation. Of course that didn't happen. We were there so long for absolutely no reason we will be calling in to discuss this issue because waiting there for a manager when the service was that horrid would've just added to the nightmare."}
{"text":"The worst fucking service ever canned fruit when I asked for fresh the margarita was sickening the waitress is beyond rude and ghetto NOT PAYING FOR THIS SHIT"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Labor Day not busy.We ordered potato skins an appetizer they came out warm not hot, but tasted like ( when did was the last time you replaced the oil). Then received our entrees the french dips bun was hard as a rock. I told the waitress about both items she said she will let the manager know. I paid my bill and no manager ever came out to discuss the issues apparently TGI F management team is to over worked to address quality of the product they sell. From this experience it makes me realize profit before customer service, so this will be my last experience with this company until they get their priorities straight."}
{"text":"If I could give this Friday's, I would give it a 0. The service was so-so at best. It took 40 minutes to get seated, then the kitchen got backed up so that was we had to wait about an hour to get our food. When we got out food it was messed up. My food was burnt, my dad and uncles food wasn't right, my moms food was gross AND SHE GOT A SALAD! The manager came over and apologized, even took 50% off the bill.
Considering that I'm from out of town the likely hood of me coming back to this Friday's is low, but after this horrible Friday's experience I am NEVER coming back to this Friday's! Even if the food was totally free."}
{"text":"This was only a late dinner stop due to other places being closed. TGIF. Should be fairly consistent, because they prefab the seasonings and sauces. But somehow it's a gamble ordering. I have never liked strongsville location and don't have good recommendations. 

I always get Cajun shrimp and pasta. Pretty idiot proof dish. The sauce is prefab and pasta, well how tough is boiling water and waiting 8-10 minutes. Their pick two ($15.99) deal want much of deal. The spinach dip was almost lacking any trace of cream. If you order salmon that isn't glazed you are making a big mistake here. Unless you lack tastebuds, there is little, to no flavor here. The portions were small. The parmesan steak fries were lacking real cheeses or again flavor. 

The server was actually very friendly and manager did stop by to ask about food. She was concerned about ok and decent describing the meals. Not enough to Off set food. The food rates a 1 1/2 star but service have a little better rating.   There are better choices in strongsville."}
{"text":"My family had a great experience here. Our aunt and uncle were in from out of town and were leaving in the morning. We decided to grab dinner at a new fancy burger joint however said joint, even after a reservation, told us  when we got there that for 9 people it would still be another hour wait.. In panic mode we called Friday's they told us they could accommodate us no problem, we went there the staff was terrific and the food was terrific! 4 of us got the bourbon chicken, it was delicious! Our waitress was awesome! Thanks for a great night you guys made it special...."}
{"text":"Jack Daniels burger and fries... extra JD glaze?  My mouth is watering!

The staff is amazingand eclectic. .. and always friendlier than just about anywhere else in town. 

The constant happy birthday singing annoys me every time, and would usually lose a star,  but the fact they have a big chief illiniwek mural on their wall saves that 5th star for me."}
{"text":"We desided to eat after walking the convention all day we wanted to eat something other then Buffett . I have never ate here and man it was really good .  The atmosphere was good the service was awesome"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost."}
{"text":"Dined: 4 / 1 / 2011 @ 10:33 pm

Ordered:
 Long Island Ice Tea
 Mango Mai Tai
 Nachos
 

  This T.G.I.Friday's is located inside the Orleans.  I came with my girlfriend and her brother.  Upon arrival there was no one in line.  I approached the hostess and she told me there would be a 10 minute wait if we wanted to have happy hour at the bar.  I gave her a confused looked as I glanced over to my right and saw 3 tabletops in the bar that were empty and prepped for the next guest.  I told her okay and sat on the 1 bench that they had for those who were waiting to be seated.  While waiting a couple came and was sat immediately in the regular dining area.  5 minutes after the couple's arrival, another group of 4 was sat immediately.  At this point, I was getting a little frustrated and just kept staring at the Hostess.  She stood there with two other hostess just talking amongst themselves.  She finally decided to seat us after  nearly useless minutes of wasting.  Within those 10 minutes, not one person left or entered the bar; so I have no clue what the wait was all about.  

  We mainly came here for a late night snack and enjoy some happy hour drinks.  Luckily our waitress was really nice and serviced us immediately.  She was very bubbly and had lots of energy.  If it wasn't for her, I would have definitely rated this place a 2 star.  The food was good and the happy hour prices were phenomenal.  

Pros:
* conveniently located inside Orleans (movies, bowling, dining, food under one roof)
* Open late and TVs throughout the bar 
* Quick service (at the bar)

Cons:
* Horrible service at the hostess stand 
* Unprofessional demeanor at the hostess stand.
* Difficult parking

Tips:  
* Ask to just sit at the Bar itself (not a table in the bar area) for faster      seating.
* Sign up for their email list to receive points for future discounts and also receive a free appetizer via email confirmation message.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but since the location is pretty convenient; I'll be fair and recommend this place to those who are not in favor or driving around kill the night.  This is a one stop shop and has numerous entertaining amenities to keep you busy and complete the night with cheap drinks/ cheap eats."}
{"text":"8/6/2011

Okay so it wasn't like I planned to go to this TGI Friday's.  We actually went to Gold Coast to enjoy some frugal eats (Steak and Eggs @ the cafe).  It shows how long its been since I've ventured the Gold Coast.  That cafe is long gone and has been replaced by an all too familiar chain.  

Pros:
  Open Late
  Happy hour until 4 am... SCORE !
  Friendly staff (especially the bartender...we sat at the bar)
  You can still enjoy steak and eggs!

Cons:
  You must sit at the bar for the happy hour.  (this is not really a con for me, but it could be for others so i figured I'd mention it).
  Irish Car Bombs are nearly $9.00 a pop!  
  Steak and Eggs for $2.99?  Dream on... more like $13.99!  Funk that!

Verdict:
  Overall, I'd recommend this place.  You really can't go wrong with TGIFridays.  They have a good happy hour (though the old happy hour at TGIFridays was way more bomb!) with cheap drinks and appetizers for $6.
The only thing that could really mess this up is bad service.  I didn't get any of that here.  The bartender actually comped my friend's appetizer since it was his birthday.  That's pretty awesome if you ask me!  That definitely beats having a group of servers gathering to sing you an unsynchronized version of the happy birthday song.  I'd give this location a 5 stars if they offered a steak and egg special for $2.99.  Aside from that though, I'm a fan.  Late night (or early morning..whichever) eats for cheap while intoxicated... I'm easy to please.  If you are anything like me, you won't be disappointed.

Tips:
  Stay away from the drinks not on the happy hour, they'll cost your more than your wings.

  Speaking of wings, try the traditional Jack Daniels BBQ wings.  YUM!

  Sit at the  bar and avoid the line if any.  Plus you get happy hour prices!

  Stay away from their Port Sausage.. doesn't taste good at all.  If you want some Port Sausage, go to a local island joint =)"}
{"text":"I love TGI Friday's, but haven't been in awhile.  I was shocked to learn that they  changed their Happy Hour menu up a bit.  It seems like the drinks got a little expensive too...nonetheless they had a pretty good selection of beers on tap (I had the Pyramid) and some awesome prices on the food they do have on the Happy Hour Menu. 
Ordered:
  Pyramid- Ice Cold
  Sliders - was good, but needed a little something.  I ate it w/ ranch!
  Wings - you can order different sauces.  I opted for the Jack Daniel's sauce.  Its a tad sweet, but was very flavorful. (came with carrots and celery)
  
I went with my sister around 5pm.  It was steady-paced, but not overwhelmingly busy. My sister scored a free Margarita.  I don't know what it was, but it was bright blue and was super yummy!!  Pretty strong too!

The highlight of TGI Friday's was walking out to my car to find that I parked in front of a Soccer Mom's van with a license plate that read:  

  IAMPOOH

I sh*t  you not (no pun intended haha)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here often when we lived closer to Aliante, but since our new house, we've only been here a few times but the food is still great! Never fails me. I love their chicken. I've tried the lobster... it wasnt that great, so I'll stick with chicken! :)"}
{"text":"Started off with a 15 minute wait even though it didn't appear to be very busy. It took a decent amount of time for me to get my drink ordered, which by the time that happened I was also ready to order my food. The menu I was given was falling apart and had food stuck on some of the pages. The food itself was below average. I ordered a mushroom burger and the bun was cold. I asked for a new bun and the top of that one was somewhat hard. The burger was cooked well and the waitress was attentive on refills. I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Like other locations, good food + good server. pork ribs + potato skin = my favorite foods in Friday's. Their long Island Iced tea and desserts are too sweet for me though."}
{"text":"Not very good service. Tried to flag down the waiter for 20 minutes for lemon for my water. Finally when he brought the food I could get it. Now currently spending another 20 minutes trying to flag him down again for Tabasco sauce. 

Foods good. Service sucks."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight. The restaurant is very nice and clean. The hostess was very nice and we were seated right away. Our server was also very nice and very attentive. The food was outstanding, everyone we came in contact with was pleasant. The only complaint was that it was very cold. The restaurant does not control the temperature, the Energy Console building does. Just bring a sweatshirt! We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Let's s be real, we all know what we are getting ourselves into when going to a TGI Friday's. It's either to get a little toasty or to experience their ridiculous appetizer menu. If you are coming here for a fancy dinner or to celebrate a birthday (other than your 21st), you are in the wrong place.  

The reason for the 4 stars, is simply about the experience my wife and I have had on every occasion that we've been to this Friday's. 

-is the service 100%? No! 

-will you ever see Elvis stop by? (Probably, it's Vegas) 

-will they ever become a Michelin Star rated restaurant? Not in a million years!

-do my wife and I have a grand time every visit and leave TGI with a huge smile and a little more buzzed than when we walked in? Absolutely! And that's the point. 

You see TGI Friday's is meant to be a fun atmosphere restaurant where you can grab a drink and food with friends and have a good time. 

This TGI Friday's has been the place where our trip begins and where we get our Vegas trip started off right. 
It's a place where you can get affordable drinks, delicious appetizers and it's open 24 hours. 

It's conveniently located inside the Gold Coast Casino where gambling is extremely affordable and where your money will go a long way compared to those big time casinos on the strip. 

If you find yourself in Sin City and are craving some Jack Daniels flavored dishes, this is your restaurant destination."}
{"text":"While I understand it is Valentine's Day, nothing excuses the Friday's franchise of such poor service and declined food portions and quality.  I had dinner with my hubby and 4-year old and the host who sat us seemed annoyed when he asked if a table was ok, and I asked for the booth across which still had the tip on it (otherwise cleaned off).  No one was communicating who's tip it was, so he cleared it off and slapped 3 regular menus on the table, no silverware.   While our server was expedient in taking our order for drinks and food, he was apparently waiting on too many tables with very poor support staff.  I ordered the triple appetizer platter and one waitress brought out a mozzarella platter, to which our server had to take back once a different waitress brought out the right appetizer platter.  While my plate was finger foods, my husband had to find someone to get silverware from to eat his pats with.  My husband's bruschetta pasta was half the size of what Friday's portions were so known for, that $15 for angel hair with marinara sauce and seared chicken strips could have been made at home for 1/2 the cost.  While my 4-year old stuffed himself with 2 mozzarella sticks and I got my fill of buffalo wings and the other 2 mozzarella sticks, the potato skins could have been replaced with French fries for better value.  The Tennessee whiskey brownie dessert with ice cream was scrumptious, HOWEVER the host who sat us and brought it out to us asked \"Do you need spoons for this?\" Confused, I looked down at my silverware thinking if I could manage eating ice cream with a fork.  My husband took lead and said said \"yes, we definitely need spoons\" to which the host looked annoyed again, but returned and placed a soup spoon for me in the desert (nicest gesture from him the whole night, but he gave my hubby a teaspoon... Lol.

Ultimately, I won't return to this location even though we live just down the street.  Such a poor representation of the Friday's I knew, loved, and frequented when I was younger.  Such a shame"}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING!  THe food was less then average. Only came here because we got a gift card, thought maybe it had improved. 
Nope. Won't be back. Too many better options nearby."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of the big chains but we had a Giftcard. Fridays is Fridays, nothing fancy but I guess good when there are no other options, or I you have a Giftcard. I give my visit 5 stars for one reason. My 1 year old son decided to vomit all over the place about 5 minutes after being seated. Three people on the staff there came over offering to clean it up. I couldn't make someone else clean up that crime scene but I was shocked they offered. Other then that it was Fridays."}
{"text":"Went here today for quick lunch with my mom today and have been to many Fridays before but figured I would still write a review. The bruschetta pasta was amazing and can't beat the price at $5.99 for lunch. Staff was very friendly and this location is pretty large and open."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, it took our server 30 minutes to bring four drink two waters & two pops. She finally came back after the bus boy asked did anyone come take our order . We was asking her questions about the menu & she couldn't give me a good answer why I couldn't substitute one thing out for another one , we asked her two times can she go ask an manager if it was ok , she still stood at the table looking at us . So we said give me a minute to took at the menu again it took her another 30 minuets to come back to our table . So finally we was ready to order . And of course it took even longer to get our food. The cook brung out our food my wings looked like they was sitting in the back all day they was cold & another meal was mozzarella sticks was cold like they wasn't cooked all the way thru . So I asked for the manager once again & some random like walked to the table without even telling us her name. So we finally realized it was the manager & I explained the problem she explained why the food took so long because they was serving a table of 20 people. She said she will handle the problem & bring us fresh food so we waited 15-20 minuets . She brung me the boneless wings that was once COLD AGAIN , & never brought the fresh Mozzarella sticks to us. So we got up and left. The places doesn't deserve any star will never go back again & will not recommend nobody to go here."}
{"text":"Came here on Memorial Day for my sisters birthday. I don't remember our server but she was really nice and very helpful with all my questions. I ordered one of their juices which was delicious. It had a lot of ice though so maybe next time I'll ask for light ice.

We had mozzarella sticks which were very good. I also ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp that came with their jasmine rice pilaf and mixed vegetables. The bacon wrapped shrimp was very good. It was salty but I enjoyed it but if you don't like salt it might not be right for you. I definitely enjoyed my dish. However it took a very long one for our food to come out and idk why. It wasn't that busy in there but maybe they were short staffed.

I also ordered the red velvet cake to go. It was sub bar at best lol. The cake was ok and the icing was alright they added these popping candies that made it taste weird, like it was a strawberry cake idk I didn't like it and it wasn't what I expected for a red velvet cake. 

Overall it was a good experience. The bathroom though was drenched in water by the sink. Water was everywhere. Idk if a kid did that but i has to tread lightly just to wash my hands lol"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Friday's. This was my second and last time at this location. The soup was Luke warm. The chips on the salad were stale and the chicken was dry. The service manage to be worse than the food"}
{"text":"Our server was very sweet.  We went for the $10 endless apps and when I didn't like how one of them was made, they fixed it immediately and without fuss. 

Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the Jack Daniels ribs.
That being said, I must be getting too elderly to cope with noise and crowded seating."}
{"text":"The food was good the service was fine the price was right. No complaints. I ordered the Black Bean Burger with fries and my partner ordered a salad with salmon. For an appetizer we ordered the Spinach and Queso dip. The avocado side was my favorite part."}
{"text":"We went there on sunday, and ordered food with the kids. We had such a great experience. My youngest wanted mac n cheese, Kraft style. when it came out it wasnt what he expected, so he didnt eat it. But they came through with more fries and fruit. I was really impressed. We love this place. Its gotten a little expensive, but the food and service are top notch. I love the burgers there."}
{"text":"It's a TGIF, so you'd think that it would keep up with standards.  The service was nice, but on a Wednesday night (and it was actually fairly busy at the bar), you would have thought that they'd be a little more attentive. 

Those on the other side of the bar that the bartender had their backs to were serviced less unless you happened to be friends with the bartenders.   At least so it seemed.  Didn't bother me as much since I was just having dinner and as long as my Coke was refilled, I was good.

I had a Jack Daniels Flatiron steak (medium rare).   They might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak.   When you cut into it, there were two different \"red colors\" which basically means that the darker red is \"raw\" while the other red was \"cooked\".   Not a good sign if you can't cook steaks at the right temperature.   And with meat, it's always better to be more conservative with the timing.

Everything else was fine, but being that it's a chain, I expected at least average ratings which the food part didn't induce."}
{"text":"Sorry but this was our second visit and again disappointed with it.

The first visit was just after valentines day, so when we started ordering off the menu everything was unavailable, we literally had to ask them what they did have.

This time food was available but service took some time, the greeter could not decide what server was coming to our table, we had to go find him when we sat for some time and never saw him.

We ordered, my wifes steak was meant to be medium with pink, well it was well done and she had to work on it to cut it, it was getting late and we were hungry. I had ribbed and well okay but nothing to make me go wow.

And when you get the bill and its over a hundred bucks for a few drinks (yes a few), an appetizer and two entrees you think what the hell.

Nope not going there a third time to eat.

The bar is nice and serves blue moon but the restaurant sucks."}
{"text":"NOT A FAN OF COMMERCIAL Food. 

I came here for their 2 for $20 deal where you get 2 main entrees and an appetizer.. 
The service was slow and it wasn't like the joint was crazy packed. Came here for lunch at around 1pm.. and no one was there.. we didn't get refilled on our drinks until we were about done eating.. mind you, we were the ONLY one there it seemed like.. I had the skillet chicken entree with lots of cheese.. it was good, but because the service was terrible I had to give 2 stars!!"}
{"text":"A group of our friends stopped by Thursday  around 11pm-11:30pm after Chris Tomlin's concert. They refused to serve us because we had a group of 12 people and due to it's almost time to be closed (2am). Never experienced anything like this before. What kind of customer service is this? Is this how they make business? Regardless, defiantly will not recommend this place. Not sure who was the manger on duty and their host or server that spoke with our friend at the mean time, but it's ridiculous and so unprofessional! I ranked them one star just so I can continue with the review post, but I wouldn't rank any stars at all."}
{"text":"located in the Orleans..usually one of our favorite spots,but for some reason this one wasnt exactly what we're used too..took a bit to get our waters and our order in..we sat at the bar and there is supposed to be some kind of discount..wasnt really sure if we got it or not..food was average not bad..I guess its good if your in the casino and want something thats not fast food.:-/"}
{"text":"Wow I am so shocked. We have been in the bar area for 40 minutes waiting for our food. I expressed my concern to our waiter. They offered us sliders for free. This is just terrible. I am so hungry. And the manager and waiter are very nice. But I have to be at work and I have been here a hour so now I can't enjoy the food I really wanted. The waiters apologized. But he said he forgot to put in our order. I'm so disappointed. I won't be coming back to this place ever.  Geez and I am still here waiting. Wow. What is happening to customer service?"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and this will be the last time. Both times they didnt get my order correct. I didnt realize it the first time but I has orderes steak and got chicken and a side I never asked for and didnt even know they had. This time I went with 4 other people and they got mine and 3 others wrong. The waiter had to ask my dad 3 times bone in or out and then it still didnt come out correct.  He was friendly but messed up our order and bills so much he mostly apologized throughout serving us. And as much as they fucked up none of us fot anything off our bills. I recommend to never come to this one."}
{"text":"Nice remodel from the \"old\" Friday's.  Parking lot is very dim lot at night, kind of sketchy feeling. Big parking lot though.  Staff has a lot to be desired, I feel if you sit in the bar area, the bartenders take much better care of you. They have good deals for lunch and dinner, not to badly priced. Typical Friday's, nothing special."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because it was close to my hotel, and not on the strip. I ordered a burger with fries and a Sam Oktoberfest. Beer was good. Burger came out smelling strangely like rubber. I tried to ignore it thinking I might be crazy, but every bite brought back the smell. I was really hungry and ate the flavorless, rubber smelling burger anyway.

I was sick all night, couldn't hardly get off the toilet. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day.. we had a party of 10.. first the service was very poor.. our drinks were not filled I asked for a lemonade 3 times before I finally got it (at the end of my meal).. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with creamy mashed potatoes and it says it comes with a tomato n mozzarella salad... the server gave me a house salad and charged me for it.. the portions were ridiculously small especially for the price we paid per plate (over $15) we ordered a pina colada from the bar that was soo sweet it made it impossible to drink.. the steak that was ordered at the table was damn near the size of a chicken nugget.. again it was over priced and poor quality.. we tipped the server $40 because again it was a party of 10.. but the tip was most definitely not earned.. we most definitely will never be back again"}
{"text":"I am hoping to update this review sometime soon. I walked I today and sat at the bar hoping to get some happy hour drinks and food before 7pm. In the 21 minutes I sat there I had 1 interaction with the bartender where I ordered a margarita and the sliders. She carded me which was nice. She made my drink and dropped it off. Keep in mind it took 10 minutes for her to come by and attend to me. Also, there were 4 guest at the bar including myself. Once I got to the 18 minute mark I asked the server to grab a manager. The manager did the same thing I do with my staff and called the bartender over to the service well and asked her why I asked for a manager. As a manager you want to get as much info about the situation as possible. Again. That's how dead it was that I could hear them from my seat. Manager came over and I explained to her what happened. She apologized and offered to take care of my app but I asked her to cancel. She took care of my one margarita and I was on my way. If they were busy I would understand. I will go back sooner than later but who knows when. I was here two Thursday's ago and the bartender that was there was super awesome and cool!! Hopefully she will be there when I get back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late dinner since we were too lazy to eat outside of the casino. Shared the lobster and ribs, which was decent. The server was nice enough to trade my dad's steak for another when his steak came in medium instead of medium rare. My water was only refilled when we finally got to ask around dessert time. But overall the waiter was nice and the food was a decent three star meal"}
{"text":"I've often wondered whether or not it's worth it reviewing chain restaurants.  You pretty much know what to expect when you walk into one.  That's not necessarily a bad thing--most of 'em have decent food and the service is usually pretty reliable.  I've rarely had a bad experience at any of these places.  

Usually places like these have good lunch deals too.  TGI Friday's has a $6.99 Endless Lunch menu.  Being that I was working off-site today, a few my co-workers and I headed up here for an early lunch.  I opted for the soup and half-a-California Club sandwich.  Typical chain restaurant fare."}
{"text":"Stay Away! We went on a Sunday afternoon during a steelers game and it was not busy at all. We should have taken the hint and left. As soon as we walked in we noticed that the tile floors were very greasy and not cleaned properly. It was like a skating rink and I almost fell especially with the very odd ramps up and down between rooms. Our table had hair on the edge caught in something sticky, one of the cups we were given was dirty, our app was not very hot. I ordered the Jack Daniel's flank steak as I have done dozens of times and it was terrible. The shape of the steak was oddly rectangular as if it was a preformed patty remade with meat glue (look it up if you don't know) It tasted so peculiar I can't even describe it but it was bad. The meat had to be spoiled etc. The rice was sticky and tasted like it was a week old. The whole meal wasn't very hot as if they made it and let it sit under the heat lamp for 20 min before giving it to me. The manager was awkward as if he never had a complaint before but he did take the meal I didn't eat off our tab but no other discount. Also we sat inside near the outside patio and the glass door leading outside was so dirty with greasy hand prints it didn't look like it had been cleaned in months. We were right beside the drink station and that was super dirty and disgusting as well. We found it very odd that it was so close to our table. We could have reached over without getting up and got our own refills lol. How is this place still open? They have got to be bleeding money. Hopefully someone will buy it, tear it down and put something better in its place"}
{"text":"Yuck. Food was over cooked, service slow..avoid this location!!!
Asked for rare steak, was like a hockey puck. Shell still on the skewered shrimp."}
{"text":"Been here several times, I figure I should finally leave a review. I obviously like it bcuz I've been back several times. Can't really say what my fav entree is, I've had Jack Daniels burgers, flatbread, Cajun shrimp & chicken pasta (without shrimp, HIGHLY allergic)  ribs, appetizers upon appetizers, a couple salads. Anyway, I haven't had anything I didn't like & we usually try to partake in specials, 2 for 1, happy hour, 2 for $20 etc. the service is always consistent & pretty quick! We've never had a wait more than 5 min to be seated."}
{"text":"When we walked in the door we were greeted very nicely and taken promptly to a table. We were sat in the bar area. Let me just start by saying the service was well below TGIF standards. We have ate here on mulitple occassions and have been satisifed but this time we were not. First of all, our salads came out and they were bland with hardly any toppings. My steak came out hard and tuff that you could barely cut it. I was missing my mashed potates and partner was missing his mac n cheese. We only got 1 refill while we were here. Meanwhile the bartenders children and baby mama walk up to the bar and the bartender completely stops what hes doing and starts playing with his children. The child maybe age 4 goes behind the bar and the management seemee not to care.  Then he even walks outside with his children. The bartender wasn't focused at all on his job. He was very rude and no smile what so ever. Didnt even introduce himself. Never asked if he could help us with anything, never asked if we were ok nor never came to check on us."}
{"text":"Erica and Larissa were frickin amazing. Started out with Erica who took our order and brought our food in a timely manner. She made sure to check on us to make sure we were good. She made wonderful conversation throughout our dinner. Larissa was super great she made us laugh. Thank you TGIF's for all your awesome vibes"}
{"text":"Meh...typical Americana food and atmosphere.  5 different menus slapped in front of me makes my brain hurt.  Stop trying to appeal to EVERYONE and focus on your core clientele.  Going into places like this is really difficult for me because they have something for \"everyone\" but nothing is really that good.  Thanks for the 2 dollars off on my appetizer due to happy hour though."}
{"text":"Meh.  Chain.  Went to the bar for a beer with my buddy at 430 on a Friday.  Like pulling teeth to get the bartender to leave his other 2 customers to get us a beer.

Once we pried him loose he was knowledgeable about the beers on tap but was obviously very busy prepping for the night ahead.

Had potstickers.  Meh.  Meh. They did the job ok.  But I won't be driving around looking for a Friday's anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular TGIF a few times. It is a great place to hit up before going upstairs for a movie...(p.s that theater is $5 on tuesday for all movies! Including new releases) 

The service every time has been awesome! Friendly, fast, and frequently fun. Seriously the service A+

So why a 3 star rating you ask?? Good question, to be honest the food is rock solid mediocre. Not bad, not great but always right in the middle. And it is not a bargain. 

Today for lunch I had a $12. Caesar Salad that was fine. In the past I have had BBQ, pastas. All about the same. Right smack dab in \"Meh\"- The stand outs for me have been the burgers. They are always good. Cooked well, tasty, with a small side of fries. I suspect that is the answer, stick to the burgers.

Why go back is your next question, I don't have a good answer for that.
Probably because it is easy, convenient, and sometimes \"fine\" is exactly what you want before a bargain movie."}
{"text":"I try not to frequent chain restaurants so to support small town businesses, but Fridays is one of my favorite restaurants! Service is always satisfactory and occasional servers who go above and beyond, such as our waiter tonight, Sarah. 

I feel that the food is better on weekdays rather than on weekend because they aren't rushed and the food doesn't sit under the warmers waiting to be taken to tables. 

The sesame jack chicken strips and pot stickers are what keep us coming back!

There are TVs at the bar so it's a great place to watch any game with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I know what to expect coming in to a place like this, food wise, but I wasn't prepared for how filthy it was.  The booth we sat in, right in front by the hostess stand, was just caked with crud on the walls.  Just sitting there made me feel dirty...but we were hungry, it was late, so we stayed.  The service was absolutely the WORST I have ever experienced.  Anywhere.  Our (frumpy) waitress never refilled our drinks, I had to chase down the hostess to get another round.  We waited about 50 minutes for our food to come out, and it was typical Friday's salty nosh.  The chicken with cheese was ok, although my ankles were swollen in the morning (as usual when I eat at Friday's the night before) due to the saltiness of their food.  
After having to watch the degenerate gamblers and obnoxious loud fat people stroll in and out of there all night, we wanted to leave.  The waitress gave us our bill then disappeared.  I tried to flag her down, but we waited at least 15 more minutes.  We got fed up, counted out enough money to leave for the bill, and were even generous enough to leave her a $.17 cent tip.  I normally leave at least a 20% tip, even for crappy service, but crappy sevice is better than NO service.  This place needs better management..."}
{"text":"I have never been to a place that made me throw up before I could even finish eating. The one star is because the water was great. All of us were sick to our stomachs. Who messes up boneless wings and potato skins (which had chunks of unmelted processed cheese), let alone the mozzarella sticks were pretty, but tasted like feet. I literally called anther restaurant to get take out while I was sitting there. Totally disgusted..."}
{"text":"Added a star for decent service. Here for breakfast. Eggs were not prepared correctly and bacon was thinner than paper....not coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"WEIRD!!! Why is the 2 for $10 menu top secret when its advertised on TV..  kind of shady you think; no menu just a small paper that is read to you by the waiter."}
{"text":"Definitely a great TGI Friday's to go to for tourists or locals alike.  Being slightly off strip, it's nice to not have the Las Vegas Blvd rush.  But don't be fooled, this location can get very very busy during peak times as well (aka any of the happy hours as well as during dinner time especially on Fridays and Saturdays).  The staff is unusually friendly for a TGI Friday's, but that's what you can expect in Las Vegas; a different approach to customer service.  From the time I walked in to order, to receiving food on a non-busy day, it only took a total of about 25 minutes.  I made the mistake of coming on a busy day to experience it, and had to wait in a line to check in, then another wait to get seated.  Every booth and table was filled, and that experience took almost 2 hours to get food.  Located in the heart of the Orleans Casino, this establishment is particularly loud so if you are looking for a quiet place to dine, this may not be for you.

Food is better than most locations as well and always served very hot.  Other locations I have had the unfortunate experience of asking to take food back due to being prepared wrong or too cold. No have never had a concern about this location.

Because it is part of a casino, it is loud, difficult to find if coming from the main doors and not parking garage, and you get an unpleasant scent mix of smoke, perfume, and food.  Doesn't affect the taste, just the smell.  The location is also fairly small so tables do feel cramped.  A few times I have been bumped into by those walking and sometimes by people pushing out chairs and under estimating the distance.  Bar area serves what you would expect, but for whatever reason it does seem to have slower food service than the standard sit down area."}
{"text":"My experience at TGI Friday's was not the greatest tonight. I was super hungry it wasn't that busy at all take five minutes to sit me down and another and another 15 minutes me  sitting there waiting for them to ask me what I wanted to drink and they didn't so I left. Was the worst experience ever"}
{"text":"The service was okay. My fiance ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and was very disapointed. It tasted and smelled like fish. It looked like it was under cooked. I ordered the chicken sandwich which tasted much better. The bun came out soggy and the sandwich did not hold very well together. This place is way over priced and we will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I get annoyed with negative complaints.  my wife and I go out a lot and we write reviews.  Most places are good, some very good and some above excellence!!  This experience was above excellence!!!   We walked in around 3:30, it was hot outside and our server, who was above attentive [Teresa], provided such a beautiful and awesome experience.  Her suggestions were spot on, her attitude was amazing and professional, with some being relaxed and fun.  during this visit, WE NEVER HAD TO ASK FOR ANYTHING!!!  Teresa made sure she came to our table to make sure our food was to our liking and we always had refills...  The one thing that impressed us was after taking our order, Teresa wrote her name on a napkin, so we knew who was our server!!  Very Awesome!!  BTW, the food was excellent at this location and we were extremely happy.  Thank you Teresa for an awesome experience.  You made our stay well worth it and when we are back in Vegas, we will make sure to stop by and ask for you personally!!!  Again, THANK YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, the server very good, Au jus barely warm though with hardly any meat on one side of the French dip and got my one drink wrong. Told them and they came back and insisted it was right lol like I haven't had the same drink at the many other tgifs ive been too...second time there and went back cause thought maybe the first time was a bad night for the place but nope. Other places way better for just a few bucks more..."}
{"text":"Preface this by saying I haven't been here in quite a few years. We didn't make a reservation on our Friday night but we all (4) didn't mind the wait. They said it would be about 20 minutes. So many people were waiting we decided to wait outside, literally right outside the door. Fifteen minutes later we all walk in because it is getting warm and multiple people have come outside waiting to be called. 

Surprise, they apparently had already called our name. Did they whisper? There are four of us right outside the door. They couldn't walk outside? They told us that since we we're already called we would have to wait over 20 minutes because now more people were in front of us. 

I know this is a rant but seriously? Any type of consideration or professionalism would have been nice."}
{"text":"We actually stopped here on the way home to eat somewhere else! We love Willy and Jose's! But they only open for dinner!!

So we ate here instead, servers are very friendly. But there weren't to many of them here! So the service was little slow. But she tried hard! Can not complain to much about her.

I had their pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw, it was a very good sandwich. i didn't over do it! No Fries!!! Just the sandwich, made me feel better! Wife had a half a club sandwich, and salad. And enjoyed it very much! TGIF like most other chains, foods ok, service ok."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I LOVE TGI Fridays, and I'm sad that I have to even leave this review. 

I come to this location often because it's less than 4 miles from my house. The last three times I've been here have been awful.

The waiters are usually ok, nice the first time they come to your table. 

Then they never really check on you again.

Two visits ago, we asked for a menu for the \"endless apps\" which was $10 at the time. Someone I was with had just been there about a week prior and knew they had the menu. The waitress said something like \"I don't we have a menu for that, I guess I can check though.\" and came back about 20 minutes later with the menu.

All the waiters know how slow the kitchen is, when we ordered endless apps the waitress literally told us she would put in 2 appetizers at a time for each of us so we didn't have to wait so long, which we still did.

Getting a drink refill is like pulling teeth, which is annoying considering how much drinks cost.

The prices recently went up for practically everything on the menu, and considering that this location can't even guarantee you fast service or warm food, I'm not sure it's worth it anymore.

Other things to note:
-The layout is awful. Just terrible. Some of the tables are at a weird angle where you feel like you should just stand up the whole time so you're less uncomfortable.
-They have \"free wifi\" which has literally not worked in 3 years. I get that you don't need to be on your phone during dinner, but there's no cell service since this area of Sam's is basically cement. I like showing my parents things from Instagram or Twitter sometimes when we're talking, and the wifi never works.
-The nearest bathroom requires you to walk outside the restaurant and into the casino. Not a deal breaker, but pretty annoying.
-It is so loud!!!! You can't hear ANYTHING someone with you is saying, even from right across the table."}
{"text":"My family and I came to TGI Friday's after going to the movies. We got there at 1:35, and it wasn't that busy and there were plenty of open tables, and yet we waited 10-15 minutes for a table. 

Of everything that was ordered, the Friday's sauce still came on the one burger when one of my party said she didn't want it. She asked for a new top bun and had to wait way too long for that. The server didn't apologize for the mistake either. She acted like we didn't ask for the sauce to be omitted. Another one in my party didn't get another side of sour cream either for her quesadilla because our server was not coming to our table very often. 

I had the black bean and avocado burger, and it was good. The avocado was fresh and the seasoning was well balanced. My personal experience is what made me give this review 3 stars. If my food hadn't been so good, it would be a 2 star. I sat too long without a refill on my water, and when our server brought refills on cokes for 2 of my party members, she didn't feel the need to look at the table or ask if we needed anything else, so I had to hurry up and get her before she ran off to wherever she stayed hidden and ask her for more water. She was nice and pleasant, but considering how it wasn't packed, I have a hard time believing that she was swamped and that is why she came to our table maybe 3 times start to finish. 

I won't be going back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was beyond terrible, let me start off by saying the waitress was super nice, the cooks probably shouldnt even call themselves that i went on fathers day i could assume they would be busy but i waited upwards of an hour to get cold food when it got to the table the appetizers where the only good part of this meal my work boot was probably more tender than the steak i recieved my lobster it was shriveled up it looked like a jumbo shrimp, i dont know if its cause it was a busy day but the place looked pretty dead, so i dont see why you would take upwards of an hour to get my food to the table, bottom line i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy"}
{"text":"Broccoli and cheese soup is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to SALTY :( pretty dissapointed because that's my favorite soup since it's winter time, I've tried it in many Fridays that I've lost count and all of them taste to salty"}
{"text":"My family recently went to TGI Friday's for dinner.  We all had the appetizers that everyone can share.  Our waitress was Cassie.  Every thing was wonderful.  Food was fresh and refills were delivered immediately.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Just bring a jacket - it always COLD.  We talked to the Manager to let her know the wonderful service we received from Cassie and how delicious the food was."}
{"text":"I will NEVER dine in this restaurant again.  We waited ONE HOUR to get our food and there were only 4 couples in the restaurant.  According to the ads on the TV the unlimited appetizers for a certain cost was suppose to be on forever, well not at this restaurant.  They make up there own rules. The ladies room was a mess but they did clean it after we told them.  It's tough when there aren't any paper towels to dry your hands.  We ordered Nachos and the chips were stale. We ordered chicken nuggets for the children and they were OVER cooked and you couldn't chew them.  I guess if we needed a hammer to hammer in a nail they would have been perfect.  All our meals were overcooked.
We did ask to talk to the manager about our complaints and I guess we were lucky he finally came to the table.  He sort of stayed by the door that goes into the bar and we had to insist for him to come closer, it was hard to talk to him while he was about 20 feet away.
As I said we will NEVER eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The whole visit was bad.  Started with the host staff.  Walked in and they were fooling around, punching each other and being really loud.  Didn't greet us til we got right in front of us.  Walking to the table a server walked right into me and I'm handicapped.  

Our waitress was slow.  I ordered lemon with my beverage and had to ask 3 times to get it. Husband had to ask repeatedly for Splenda for his tea. 

I get that this is a theme type restaurant but the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk.   

The food was ok but our experience was so negative that I will never be back again."}
{"text":"We had 5 people in our group and there were 4 tops available.  They said they don't push tables together and told us at 9:30pm we'd have to wait 20 minutes.  We ended up in a corner booth in the bar.

When we ordered my husband said not to put any green onions on his food because he is allergic.  His food came out with green onions.  Really? You can't get something that simple right?

I'm so done with TGIFridays.  Bad service with mediocre food."}
{"text":"I had a good time at TGI Friday's for lunch. The food was hot and was served on time the lady was really nice and she got our drinks quickly you can use discount points and also buy discount appetizers it's a great place to go say"}
{"text":"Don't know why people hate this place, it's not in the best location cause it's in Gold Coast but hey, the food is great and the service is awesome! You can't complain much and if you want more service than that, I suggest that you should go to the strip and pay 10 times more to get the same food/drinks"}
{"text":"Food was ok, waitress was rude. What else can I say, took my sister and niece there for lunch, they had a special  $10.00 ,eat all appetizers  you can,  so we order and my niece had a second one, but the waitress never came back to ask me and my sister what we want or if we need another one and she bought the check, we will never go back there ."}
{"text":"Good bites along with a convivial atmosphere makes this a destination to meet friends and family.

 The appetizers came out hot and savory. The boneless wings and pretzels with beer cheese are a must. The super staff conjured up our meals quickly after we orderred. I enjoyed a crisp harvest apple chicken salad with a touch of house dressing."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with the service I received tonight.  It was my husband's birthday and I figured we could just go somewhere and grab a bite.  He worked all day and then went straight to the baseball field where he coaches my son's baseball team.  It was late.  We met up at the restaurant after 9 pm.  His practice was over at 8 pm, but he has to gather the equipment and then leave.  He and my son got to the restaurant before my daughter and I made it.  It took a while before we were able to place our order because our server didn't stop by our table for a while.  I didn't think much of it.  After about 30 minutes, she finally took our order.  That should have been our cue to leave.  We didn't.  We waited.  We waited for almost an hour before our food came out!  In fact, we didn't say anything until the manager stopped by our table and asked if we were alright.  I told her no.  I told her that we were waiting for a long time for our food.  At this point, we were more sleepy than hungry!  She apologized for the delay and explained that one of the cooks didn't come in and that one of the dishwashers was helping with the food.  That information didn't make me feel any better!  She went to the back and came out with two plates, mine and my daughter's food.  She told us that my husband and son's food was on its way.  I excused myself from the table to go wash my hands and to get someone's attention.  I was hoping the night could be saved with a little birthday song for my husband and a little birthday dessert.  I happened to see my server in the bar area.  I got her attention.  She came right over.  I told her that today, was my husband's actual birthday.  She said she could bring something out to him once we finished our meals.  I said ok.  I went back to the table to eat.  Once our meals were finished, she came to our table and picked our plates up.  She said that she would be back with the birthday treat!  I couldn't believe it!  I was hoping that I could at least surprise my husband with the little treat!  Nope!  She not only said it once, she mentioned it twice!!!  At that point I was done!!!  When she brought the sundae out, she just unceremoniously sat it in front of my husband!!! No birthday song!  No extra spoons for me and my children!  Ok!  Before my husband finished his sundae, the manager came back to our table.  She apologized again and then starting telling us about bad service she got when she went to some restaurant!  That didn't help the situation at all!!!  The problem in this whole situation is that our server had plenty of opportunities to make a bad situation, not so bad.  First, she could have checked on us more.  She checked  on us once during that extremely long wait for our food.  Honestly, I think she really only noticed us because we were sitting in the booth right in front of the entrance to the kitchen!  Second, she could have told us that they were missing a cook.  The manager told us that, after we waited close to an hour for our food!  Third, she could have saved the night by presenting my husband's birthday treat in a better way.  I was expecting one candle and a song.  In fact, not only did she ruin the surprise, but the manager verified that it was his birthday!!!  Wow!  Really?!  Horrible!  They don't have to worry about me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here on 3 occasions . 1 time dine in. 2 times take out. All 3 times Trash. Go to Applebee's"}
{"text":"Yet again chain restaurant don't care about food quality. Ordered their new stack burger with sausage. The amount of sausage I got was a half of a coin. I should have gotten at least three to four coins worth. Wife ordered steak medium and got well done."}
{"text":"My mom & dad wanted a quick meal & Noodle Exchange had a 1 hr wait.  Now I remember why I go to one of these once every 10 years or less \"by force\".  The servers don't seem to care & took more than a 1/2 hour to bring any drink refill despite noticing empty glasses every time they passed by the table.  It's not crowded either.    We had the ribs & shrimp, ribs, Mediterranean salad, & surf/turf.  The food is ok but I wouldn't go back by my choice."}
{"text":"I told the manager on one occasion that I would be ashamed if this came out of my kitchen. They obviously don't care"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area, testing the restaurant waters. The good news - the food is good - fairly expensive but, good. The bad news - the staff (that night anyway) was super unfriendly. I placed a pick-up order. Went in to get it - they directed me to the bar - a football game was playing (12-17-17). The bar tender acted like I ruined her night by coming in to get my order. She had to stop watching the game for 2 minutes! She looked at me with obvious negativity. Then handed off my food without speaking or looking at me. Wow... horrible experience. BTW - It wasn't even a Panthers game - I should deduct another star for that!"}
{"text":"You can't beat $4.99 breakfast deals and $13.99 steak and lobster daily from 3-6pm. Who would have thought that TGIF would serve such deals in Vegas? This TGIF is located inside the casino and parking is free. There's also a a happy hour and the place isn't too packed because the secret isn't out yet."}
{"text":"Our experience here was terrible. The wait was ridiculous. We stood and waited for 50 minutes next to an open table that they ended up seating us at anyways. The service was poor and extremely slow. And lastly, the food was bad. We went here hoping for a relatively quick meal and ended up here for about 2 hours. Other Friday's locations have been good, but this one- avoid!"}
{"text":"The steak and lobster special was good. Even though the portions were small, the price was small, the taste was very good. Sides were perfect and cooked well. No cold or hard vegetables. After having the buffet last night at the Aliante, this dinner helped redeem the hotel regarding food."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite TGI Friday's in Las Vegas. Come to think of it, probably the only one I ever been too in Vegas. 

A good time to go to TGI Friday's, is probably after busy hours, in between 1pm - 3pm. That's when its probably quiet, and that you have the waiter's full attention. I think, this is the time, where they show their best qualities at TGI Friday's. Coming during the usual busy hours, of course you won't have their full attention, and you'll have cooks speeding up food orders. If your food is undercooked or not to your liking, then your struggling to wave down the waiter, who's probably running around, like a chicken with his head cut off. But when you go there during the not so busy hours, I find that TGI Friday's tend to be more pleasing. 

We went there around 1:30pm, and right away, we were greeted and sat in the bar area. Just a few seconds later, we was greeted again, to take our drink order. Of course it being slow hour, the one who greeted us when we came in, was also our waiter, so that's why it didn't really take long to wait for a waiter. I was really impress with the politeness and quickness of the waiter, bringing our drinks and entertaining us. 

After a good amount of time to look through the menu. We started off with our usual Nachos, which were really good, and I ate most of it. The wife ordered her Sirloin and I had my New York steak and Shrimp. I also had an Ultimate Mudslide, which is better then Applebees, where you can't really taste the alcohol at Applebees, but you can at TGI Friday's. We got our order and, I really like the way they did the meat, and my sides. It was cooked to perfection. My wife's Sirloin, was undercooked. But with the immediate response from the waiter. She was able to explain her situation and the waiter was polite to return her Sirloin to the kitchen. Just a matter of minutes, that the waiter returned with a better cooked Sirloin. 

Everything to me, taste great, that I ate everything on my plate. Unfortunately I was to full for dessert, but my wife loved the cheesecake I had last time, so she ordered one for herself. Sure enough, she liked it and the presentation of the dessert was really nice. 

I was really satisfied with the place, with the staff and the food. I would really recommend this place, during the slow hours (Usually after lunch time, and before dinner time). Its where you get better quality service from the staff and the cooks."}
{"text":"Happy hour makes this a good find.  They have a big margarita for six bucks.  Not bad.  Good flavor definitely not watered down.

I gravitate towards the Jack Daniels menu items.  The ribs are 4 out 5 stars and they salads are definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"Just don't do it. Staff is rude, manager is worse. 

The had a special on ribs once a week. Twice I got my meal and discount, but 3rd time going to get the meal I was told no discount after I are, I was told it's available only some hours of the day. Nowhere does it say that, or simply said half of this day, not certain hours. 

The assistant manager was so rude handling it that I laughed and said no way you are the manager, get me the real manager. So he did and she was sweet but it was too late. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Things were ok when my family and I walked in and sat down. Then we realized there was a special on Lobster. The waitress was really slow so if she was about 10 minutes faster we would have gotten the special. We didn't complain a bit. Then after someone threw up next to our table as we were just getting our food, things were getting worse. Instead of getting a mop and soap and water they start sprinkling this oatmeal looking substance to absorb everything. Then they got paper towels out to clean that up. After they did that, they were spraying this lysol cleaner on the floor \"all while\" we are trying to eat. Our appetite was ruined. I am giving them 2 stars because the manager was nice enough and took 50% out bill."}
{"text":"We always stay at Sam's Town when we visit Vegas, and so we usually start out our day by eating at TGI Friday's.  We have been going to the hotel for years, and remember when the space used to be the Harvest House, which was an old school coffee shop kind of 24 hour restaurant.  

So, we like to have breakfast but they don't have a lot of omelette selections, not very creative that is.  They have a special priced lunch menu, so one day this last trip I tried the special $5.99 cobb salad.  First of all, we waited over 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered it, and when my salad came, it was a very small piece of chicken, a half of a hard boiled egg, and like a cherry tomato sliced in half.  My husband had ordered breakfast.  How long does it take to make breakfast?  

I said something to the hostess and she offered to give us a dessert for free, but all of their desserts look big and my husband is a diabetic and I'm on a diet (did you see the salad??) so I said \"No thanks.\"  

We've been there other times when you basically have to get up and walk over to get your bill, get your bill paid, or get a drink refill.  The service is slow, but it never seems overly crowded in there.  Now on two occasions this trip, there was a large party in the other room...and everyone was working on them.  

Also, I guess is the case with the chain's restaurants, the booths and the seats are not super comfy.  The turkey burger on the special lunch is pretty good, and it comes with homemade potato chips, which are good, if not fattening.  Most of the tables don't feel too crammed up against other tables and the restaurant opens up into the casino, which is fun if you are there to gamble.  You can see the action while you eat."}
{"text":"We went to this location on a Saturday around 3:30pm. We were seated, and did not get seen again until we went back up to find someone 20 mins later. They completely forgot we were there. 
The food was also awful, there was actually a black hair in my burger so I couldn't eat it. At this point it wasn't even worth complaining because we just wanted to get out of there because we had been there an hour and a half. 
We will not be visiting here again."}
{"text":"We had a big party of around 20 to 25 people our waitress was amazing she was very patient she was funny and when there were issue she accommodated them quickly we even had other waiters coming over to our table just to see what the noise and everything was about they were very patient and the food was amazing the drink that you see in my picture is a blue MF ER and it was so delicious I recommend that if you do get that or drink more of those make sure you have a designated driver because those are definitely alcoholic beverages as well LOL. They have this special going on where you get two types of meat in a side for $14.99 I had the salmon and the chicken the mango salsa that I had on my salmon was really good and the parmesan chicken was amazing I do recommend anybody who is on the budget to definitely look into that because it was a great price for great food and great service."}
{"text":"The hostess was polite but the fact that they're in such close proximity of an arena should make her more aware that people may want to sit near a tv when sporting events are on. While we were there 3 people asked to sit hear a tv in a fairly empty restaurant. The place was clean and the service was great we got our drinks and food in a timely manner. The steak had gristle but I happen to like a little bit of it on my steak. I had the Jack Daniel ribeye and shrimp with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They had $4 Long Island Iced Tea which was impressive for a Saturday evening. Cool atmosphere for any day when there's no sporting event at PPG Paints Arena."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by after a movie at AMC for a bite to eat. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress. We ordered 2 Red Oak beers that came out luke warm, two southern fried chicken sandwiches with fries that were also luke warm:(. My kids had requested Red Robin earlier, I wish I would have listened to them. One of my kids ordered the kids sliders and they didn't even melt the cheese. Honestly, I could have had a better dinner at Chick-fil-a. Fool me once, shame on me! You will not fool me twice!!"}

I just called spoke to Stephanie she told me since it's in a casino they need to be w an adult it's a law .. can someone show me that law ??? As their eating in the cafe right now ?? I mean  seriously? They never had a problem with it before ??? i want answers"}
{"text":"Ordered Togo picked up at the bar , the food was behind the bar ( I didn't know it was mine ) the bartender kept walking by me she had three others at the bar .. Only to attend to the waitress at the end I waited15 min for the food that was already ready , and they never even gave me buffalo sauce .i got home I was pissed .. I gave her a tip too .. ( karma ) everytime I dined in never had a problem the bar is terrible service !!! Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"I went here in May 29, 2014.

The food here was pretty good, but a little over priced, especially overpriced were the potstickers. The waiter barely acknowledged us and we felt ripped off for the service that we received. The portions served were ok for the price we paid. Not worth a visit unless you want horrible service and ok to good food."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of meat and even less frequently do I eat hamburgers, but I was in the mood for one today and sought out what I thought would be a good place for a great burger. Unfortunately, that was not my experience here. Through no fault of the server who was excellent, the burger almost moo-ed when brought out to me. I order it cooked medium, but it was closer to rare meat that had been thrown on the grill for a minute to get the char marks. It could have been because of the thickness,  but someone didn't know their classifications for cooking meat. It will be a while before I'm back, and it won't be for a burger."}
{"text":"I came here today with 18 other people today after my little sister's graduation from Duquesne.  Noah was my server and she was one of the most talented and kind servers I've ever had.  She knew every single person's order and kept track of each check!  Not a single one of us had an issue with our food and she kept up with refills, timing of the food, and any other special requests.  Nobody had to remind her of a drink or food - she knew everything.  If I lived in the area, I'd come back to have Noah as my server every time.

Also, my mother is very allergic to seafood, so the manager came out to assure her that the food was not going to be contaminated and she could eat it!

FANTASTIC SERVICE!"}
{"text":"We came in for an early valentines date, before the 105.7 old school love affair concert. Upon walking in we noticed the place was packed on the dinning side so when we asked for a booth they suggested the bar area also mentioning that it was happy hour. We thought it might be a great idea considering we were so close to the Orleans Arena  we can order a few drink before the concert. In the bar area it's self seating, which is great for us cause we wanted a booth. Almost right away we were greeted with our server Rebecca, very nice girl but not so great with taking orders down. We started with the drinks we both ordered Coors light and two waters with lemon. I remembered that water taste a little off last time so I asked for a bottle of water instead with the ice and lemon. She must not have heard or listen because when our drinks came back two beers and one glass of water with ice and lemon and a bottle of water came back. She had other drinks on her tray and left before I could ask for the ice and lemon. I had to wait five or six minutes to grab her attention. Mind you this place was picking up but not quit busy yet. When she brought the ice cup and lemon we asked her about the special we saw on the commercial for two meats and two sides. Rebecca said the special just started a few days ago and hasn't heard the details about it, she needed to ask her manager about it and it was so new T.G.I. Friday's didn't have the menus yet. 
She gave us more time to look at the menu, not really saying if we could order that. So we went on line and looked up the details and read them. We originally wanted to order steak and salmon loaded mash potatoes with broccoli for me and steak and ribs with a baked potato and broccoli for my wife.
When she came back she asked what we wanted, we mentioned we wanted to two meats and two sides deal again and proceeded to tell what my wife's order was ribs and steak she cut us off and said I don't know if we could do that since I am just hearing about this deal and haven't yet spoken to my manager about details . I was about to show her and get the advertisement on the T.G.I Friday website but my wife cut me off ( second time someone cut me off in a row) and said that's fine. She will take two steaks  a bake potato and broccoli. Irritated already I ordered a steak and salmon loaded mash and broccoli I was trying to tell her I wanted the salmon plain but she cut me off twice to ask how I wanted my steak answering medium she left with my mouth still open. I hoped she heard the plain salmon part but had a feeling she didn't. Twenty minutes later my wife and I received our meals hers completely correct except for the ribs not being an option when it clearly was an option on the website and my plate all wrong salmon had the Bourbon sauce. I immediately tell her it's wrong she says that's ok walks off grabs a plate and asked me to put the salmon on it I tell her about the sauce being on the broccoli if she could replace that too? She says oh ok and takes the whole plate. While waiting the manager comes out ask if everything was ok? I go on to tell her what the problem was and she too cuts me off and says oh yes the cooks are taking care of it, at the same time my plate shows up everything looks ok ! But when I go to eat the broccoli IT HAD THE BOURBON SAUCE ON IT THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A FRESH ORDER OF IT  LIKE I ASKED !!!! And my steak is well done not medium.  I'm already highly irritated when Rebecca shows up to check on us we were already almost done BUT I still tell her about the broccoli and she tells me I told them to change the plate and give you fresh but they didn't listen. 
I know how that could be since I have worked in the food industry  and I agree sometimes that could be an issue but in my opinion if the server gave two extra seconds to listen to an order and take it down correctly or have a keen eye to detail this wouldn't happen in the first place. And I love the fact that the manager comes to your table to check if Everything was ok but how about coming around after we received the new plate or around the time we get the check . The manager would of been able to asses the situation. Also I find it odd that a promotion was already going on and no one knew about it ?!? How could this happen ?!? I know that if you haven't received signage or menus yet, it still wouldn't be an excuse why the server wouldn't know about the special. In short we never got a second beer because we never asked which we would have ordered another round and my meal was a complete disaster my wife finished her meal before me and just sat there and waited for me to finish. Good thing this wasn't our actual valentines dinner celebration, This was our second visit to this restaurant and our last ! Can't believe I paid full price and tipped for this horrible service."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten in a Fridays in years, so we thought we have a nice dinner with the kids this past Saturday. My husband signed up for their app while we waited to be served. To spare you the graphic details, let's just say he's been in the bathroom ever since, and today is Tuesday! He's used their \"feedback\" feature no less than a half dozen times in the last three days, and I can only assume that there is no one checking it. We had minor issues with service and the time it took to get our food, but these seem less important now.

It simply is not the place it once was."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here late last night, and the whole casino was surprisingly busy for a Thursday night. There was live music next door which you could hear from inside of the restaurant which was cool. It took a while for a host to show up, and  and when he did he seemed miserable and he made the interaction really awkward. He sat us at this half booth/half table that definitely wasn't made for a couple to sit at. The waitress showed up seemingly annoyed and she didn't smile once. I ordered the black bean burger, it was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich and he enjoyed it. Only giving three stars for the food and the music next door, the service was horrible. Definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. I've gone when the food is amazing and plentiful, and I've gone when the food is inedible and almost non-existent. Their sizzling chicken dish is usually fairly consistent and good. The service is usually decent. Overall, I'd give it a mediocre rating of \"meh\" here."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. If your visiting for a day and want an aswome place to eat. You have a view of chase staduim. Now my 3 stars was because my service was really slow. They are very polite but very slow. Food is about the same as all other TGI's not to bad for the price."}
{"text":"WTF IS THIS PLACE....we went to 2 different fridays and decided to sit at this one why who knows we were hungry.... I am positive we will never return and it sucks because the waiter was pretty cool...the food was poorly made terrible..."}
{"text":"Ordered Cajun chicken and shrimp took 20 min came cold ate anyways afraid of spit will not be back very slow service waiter had a full beard really."}
{"text":"Its bad when this was the best food I had all weekend.

TGI Fridays saved me. 

No stomach flu caused by the food. Check.
Decent prices for the food served. Check.
Quick and friendly service. Check.

TGI delivered great service for both of our meals there. I personally liked their dinner menu a bit more (had the fajitas), but both were head and stars above the sickness inducing buffet offered at Ports O Call.

If we come here next year, you can bet every meal will be on Friday!"}
{"text":"It's a hit and miss with the service here but for a 24 hour place in the Gold Coast.. Can't really complain. Usually the staff are overworked so a little patience is probably appreciated by them. I've eaten here more than I'd like to admit the past 3 weeks but at 3am there aren't many other options.

Trying to be healthy I've had the portion right steak and vege which was decent 6.5/10. Buffalo wings hot 7/10 although it's pretty tough to get bad wings. The 3 sampler with fried cheese, wings and potato skins is so bad for you you can taste it.. Proceed with caution lol... Felt terrible the next day but if it's deep fried goodness you're after get this. 

My partner had the nachos which was massive but they're stingy with the guacamole. 

But hands down my fave thing there is the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. I normally don't eat wheat and have a slight allergy to shrimp but for this I make an exception. I've had it 3 times now and it's been good everytime. I've just ordered it again to have now!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Friday's I've been to lol. Definitely go ANYWHERE else. I'd go to Applebee's before I came here again. Can't cook a steak or a burger to save their lives. If you order a medium rare steak, you'll receive it medium well. Your burger tastes like lump of charcoal, and they tell you it's \"meant to taste that way\"... Gtfo lol."}
{"text":"Nothing great here. Mediocrity would best describe the food and service. THE LOCATION IS GREAT BUT THERE are many other places in this area that have better food and service. TgIFridays was great in the 80's. Sad to see what it has become. Not even the same anymore."}
{"text":"Food arrived ice cold. Waiter Alberto asked me if I wanted another steak & lobster. No I just want to watch my Fiancé eat his dinner. So now I'm waiting for my dinner while my other half is eating his dinner without me. SUCKS BIG TIME. Not Happy at all. They must have cooked my food first which was rare & his steak was med well. DUMB. We were here 20 days ago & had great meals. Not today. Thanks for ruining MY date night. We usually eat here when we watch a movie. NO MORE

My new steak & lobster arrived. The steak was medium & the lobster was so tough it wasn't edible. My 1st steak was rare. The manager came over, she did not apologize. I do not recommend this location. They can't cook food to a customers request."}
{"text":"The only other location I've been to is in the Orleans which is Horrible. The manager there was rude & we left without me having dinner because they couldn't make my steak correctly & the 1st round was ice cold. 
We tried this location for dinner. They have a new menu & I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp which was excellent. My Fiancé enjoyed his dinner too. Now we're waiting for our cheesecake. Two different Managers came to our table to ask us if everything was ok. WoW this never happened at the Orleans. Truly a great staff at this location. Will be here again for sure"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after shopping. I will never ever go to another T.G.I.Fridays. My server Marissa or Miranda would not serve me. The host Trent from the front that seated me had to serve me. I'm  sure this had to do with the color of my skin. To my put one star cause I needed it for this review. I guess I have to find another favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We waited an hour to be seated. The excuse was we needed a highchair. Tow families needing a high chair came in after us and were seated instantly. I received attitude when asking about the reason my family was stilling waiting. I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered in their happy hours.. Had a chocolate Oreo dessert which was simply amazing.. Chicken wings, soft pretzel and pasta in entree were decent too.. Their happy hour pricing is worth it"}
{"text":"Well I came in for a quick bite, ordered an ice tea and French onion soup out the gate. Let's just say, their French Onion soup. Needs onions.  The sliver or 2 of onion, does not a French onion soup make.  I also ordered the new Philly burger with a salad.  I finished my soup and here's .My SALAD and Philly burger.  The Philly part is COLD. Doesn't look appetizing at all. Salad is typical . Bartender Hayleigh was nice and sweet.  No manager in sight.. Typical of restaurants I have been in, the after lunch time 1p to 4p. The ball gets dropped. The Philly part is not on the burger.  There is a Strong pepper cheese taste overpowering. I would definitely NOT recommend this item..  sloppy presentation. And certainly not a Philly taste."}
{"text":"We like coming here for one reason excellent service.  We are regulars at this place and we really appreciate the customer service from all the managers.  In the past they have helped us so many times.

Kristen was our waitress today, she's nice.   She knows what we drink by heart and will always take care of us.  She really knows the meaning of customer satification.

While we were here watching the NFL Jets vs. Pats game.  A tall bartender that saw a customer left his suitcase and he tried to get it back to him.  How nice was that?  Hopefully that man remembered where he left it..

I'm sure we'll be back for more half priced apps, I even signed up for a stripes card.  In the bar area Mon-Sat from 5 PM - 7 PM & 9 PM - 2 AM is half priced apps. On Sunday are half priced apps ALL DAY.

Sign up for their Give Me More Stripes account, opt for the emails & text messages if you can.  I get amazing email offers every so often. I also fill out the surveys on the receipt for an $8 app."}
{"text":"Vegas on budget? $6 appetizers (excludes seafood & platters), $5 Sangrias, $4 20 oz. Glass Draught beers well drinks & 6 oz. Wine by the glass. Finally $3 14 oz. Glass Draught beers & bottled beers.



I love the multiple Gluten, corn, soy, sesame free options here.  Dragon  fire Chicken Kung Poa sauce on the side $11.



Our waitress is the coolest.  I can't tell you we must have her to ourselves."}
{"text":"After Nascar Qualifying we really wanted to check out Aliante since it's 25 minutes away from the speedway.

It started out seemingly slow. We were told by the hostess it would be a 45 minute wait. Okay, so we waited and we heard all these parties being called. Nobody really showed up except for us. It wasn't a bad wait time, luckily it was maybe 15 minutes tops. We were seated quickly and it was nice to see this location went all the way to the back like a real TGIF. 


Debbie was our server she greeted us with a smile and asked how everyone was doing.  We ordered our beverages and decided to use my free chicken entree. I grabbed the Sizzlin' Chicken & shrimp, my boyfriend had a Classic Cheeseburger and his mom ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger no bun & without the Balsamic. When everything came out it seemed overdone. My chicken was burned on both sides, her burger was a hockey puck and my bf's burger was cold to the touch.   We were really shocked they scored a 0 on the food quality but 10 on the service. We asked for the manager and Debbie came right over and we asked her to send it all back.

We spoke with the manager (wish I caught his name). He apologized and told us we would make sure the kitchen fixed it. He mentioned he had been on our side of town working at the TGIF in The Orleans and it clicked in my head. We've already met him once before, he checked on us last week! ha ha ha ha.

All in all the food came back out, it was hot and it was excellent. They made it right by us and I'm thankful for that. Truly I am, I've had manager's take offense to us sending food back and we've been treated poorly in the past at other restaurants. We'll be back in the near future, maybe even this Sunday after the race!

I was thoroughly pleased to know the staff here was super NICE!  The reviews I read about here made me cringe.  I would love to be seated with Debbie again. She was super attentive! We left her a nice tip for the amazing Service.

  Service: 10/10   Food:     10/10     I took pictures of before and after.. The second time around is the charm and I'm okay with that.  They fixed everything and couldn't of asked for a better treatment. Very thankful for the understanding staff."}
{"text":"This has been my first trip in about a year due to this location not being too close, It was in my eyes superior to Applebee's and others similar to it,  but always loved it even in the one in Sandusky. But I think he recently years there's been increasing price and lacking service(from hosts to your server to the hands preparing the food. This franchise was a favorite now, is sub par and will not be returning on my on will. Especially for an occasion like today."}
{"text":"Ok so I was very skeptical about eating here as the reviews seem to convey that your experience here will either be a hit or miss. I have to say that our experience here was not without incident (one female server wore waaaay too much perfume that aggrevated my sinuses and I had to switch seats just to keep a distance from her), but after we were established it only got better! So yes the wait staff did take a while to get to us, HOWEVER, the server did acknowledge us in the beginning and said he was going to be awhile and would be with us a soon as he could, which he did :) I was impressed and surprised at how fast our food came given the amount of people that were there. Then came the drinks - my brother ordered a beer but unfortunately, they only carry it in limited supply. SO our bartender personally went out of his way to run and dig through the supply in the back until he successfully came back with a six pack of the beer my brother ordered (Score!). Then came our drinks, which we had ordered basic margaritas, unfortunately, he got it in his head to make a fancy margarita, which he put a lot of effort into making as we were watching him. We didnt have the heart to turn it away so we graciously accepted it without complaint. Later when it came time to pay, while the bartender was finalizing our bill, he realized his mistake on the drink (without us having to say anything) and comped us the drink since it was his mistake! I was wow'd at this point. I was not expecting this level of service here based on other reviews. Due to this experience I felt the need to leave a review of our time with Shea. So lesson learned? Park it at the bar on the days Shea is there and you will be in good hands!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We sat at the bar and waited a half hour for salads before our entree. Then when asked where our salads were, the bartender responded that he almost forgot that we ordered food. They weren't even that busy. We put our food order in at 8:15 and it wasn't even prime dinner time or a full bar. No excuse. After we got our dinner, neither bartender checked back to See if we needed anything. I needed a refill and my boyfriend needed ketchup. We never got it. After we finished, we had to ask for our check just to get out of there. Our enjoyable was terrible answer should have stayed at Longhorn and waited in line. Never going back."}
{"text":"Good at 4:15 p.m. the place was empty and we were told it be a 15 minute wait. That should have been a clue to leave at that point. However a manager came and told them that they should see people. Service was absolutely horrible slow inadequate useless. When we finally got our food 20 minutes later it also was horrible. Service deteriorated as they went on. Not sure if we will attempt another TGI Fridays or just totally write it off our places to eat."}
{"text":"I dined here on Monday 04/29. I ordered the Korean steak tacos, they were ok but nothing special. The vanilla bean cheesecake however was good. The waitress young lady long blond hair, was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was ok. It didn't leave me wanting more, but it wasn't bad enough not to eat. The restaurant is clean, the wait staff is nice. What more can I say? It was the only non-fast-food-place open in the casino before 4pm."}
{"text":"Visit on 7-2-17. One thing I love about TGIFs in Vegas is it's a cheap place for eats and drinks. It was Sunday, Happy Hour, and across from our hotel so we walked despite the 115 degree weather. We were seated immediately. The was no long wait here seven though it was a holiday weekend. I'm not sure if it was good timing or what because the one at the Orleans almost always has a wait.

Our server was friendly and quick. We received waters right away and pondered the menu. We settled on shrimp cocktail and nachos. After finishing we were still hungry so we got the BBQ chicken flat bread.

The cocktail was served with lemon and lime. I haven't had shrimp cocktail since I was a child and it was so good I'll def order it more.

The nachos were good. The white sauce on it was yummy, wish it had more. Had a good amount of chicken. 

The flat bread, who can trust thin, crispy bread topped with BBQ.

The food was fulfilling without being stuffed. I will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I guess coming in at 6pm on a Saturday and seeing it completely dead should be a sign. For starters, the food and drink prices seem ridiculously high from what I remember. The staff is alright, our waiter was pretty friendly this time around but with as slow as it was, it took way too long for our food to come out.

I went with a new item they had on the menu...Korean Steak Tacos. For $10, I expected a lot more. The tacos were small and had barely any meat on them, the tortillas were stale and I'm pretty sure the greens topping them were expired. My wife had the wedge salad and boneless wings which were both okay. They drench the wings in sauce so they are super soggy when they come out. About the only thing we liked were the pretzel sticks which I'm guessing are a frozen thing so not too hard to get right anyway.

The food and service might deserve 2-3 stars but the restaurant doesn't for letting a particular \"balloon man\" wander around. I posted a picture of the guy so if you see him, make sure to say no thanks on the balloon animals. I don't get mad easily and joke around quite a bit, but this dude was a complete d-bag. He was making inappropriate jokes, being rude and just acting like a complete jackass in front of my family, including my 4 year old who he was making the balloon for. Had I not been with family, there would have been a problem with the way this guy was acting. I won't be coming back to this particular TGI Friday's anytime soon, if ever, just because of him."}
{"text":"35 minutes for two appetizers and an order of shrimp pasta and they couldn't even get the pasta right.   Our server was nice enough about the wait but nothing she could do.  By time my sons pasta came (corrected) we were ready to leave.   Now I know why this location jade a low rating and why I try to avoid chain restaurants.

Just as I was about to leave a one-star rating they came back and comped the appetizers and sent us home with a free dessert.  Way to own up TGI Fridays!"}
{"text":"Worst TGI Fridays experience ever.  They weren't busy but the time to get our food was about 30 minutes.   My burger was so over cooked I could have played hockey with it.  No point in waiting another 30 minutes for replacement.  And of course the fries were stale from sitting under the heat lamp.   They replace those but without apologies.   

I won't be back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!The sad things about this location is there a franchise and they could care less about helping the customer. The host sat us at a table for 4ppl when we had a party of 6. The waiter came over we started to order our drinks. I saw they had a strawberry black tea in the fine print it said free refills. I double check with the waiter..he said no and was arguing with me...I asked for the manager she came over and agrued with me as well. I said dont bother...This location doesnt know how to treat customer...we will never return here again."}
{"text":"I went to TGI Fridays on 16 Jan 15, my friend called ahead to make reservations and was told they don't \"do those\". So we all show up, a party of 6, and are told it will be a 1.5 hour wait, at 8pm on a friday. We agree to wait and 50 minutes go by and we are let into the place, and the dining area was empty, minus a couple tables...so they must have been understaffed right? No, there were employees everywhere.

The waiter takes his time coming to our table, 10 minutes until we meet him, Eric was his name. He takes our drink orders, everyone gets an alcoholic beverage. 15 minutes goes by again, we are all ready to order, still no drinks, still no waters, menus down on the table, I'm starting to get impatient. I flag Eric down, he comes and takes our orders, and I don't know what his deal was, he had to ask for clarification on every little thing, we had to repeat ourselves several times. 

10 more minutes, still no beverages, no waters. Menus left on the table. Finally the drinks come and they were all filled up 70% of the way, we all noticed and joked about it, but seriously why were they like that? The speciality drinks my girl and I ordered tasted of absolutely no alcohol and tasted a lot like crystal light. They were not good. I asked for waters when these drinks were brought to us and he came back with some and some appetizers. The microwaved appetizers. I know its only TGIF's but come on, unevenly microwaved food has to embarrass someone that works there. 

28 minutes later our meals arrive, everything looks good on my plate, Jack Daniels Combo of ribs and flat iron steak, except my steak is missing something....its warm pink center, my cut was brown throughout and dry and I ordered it medium. I tell Eric and he says he will take care of it. Also someone helping Eric deliver the food spilled water all over the table and then set the food down on another table and went to get rags to clean it up, they take 3-4 minutes to do so, while our food is sitting on this other table cooling off, so I stand up and serve my friends. Finally they come back and clean up and Eric has a little plate to take my steak away, and then goes up to his manager to tell him whats up, then something weird happens, within earshot of our table, I hear Eric and the manager debating about whether or not my steak was medium or not. I can hear them and I feel uncomfortable both for myself and for Eric. 

Another 30 minutes goes by, we are all about done eating, itching to get the checks and leave, since this has already been a drawn out experience, yet I haven't received my replacement steak yet, and Eric has asked me twice if it has come out. Then the manager brings it over and asks me to cut into it, I do and am satisfied, more like I just want to leave by now, so I eat it. Then the checks come, and what do I see on my ticket? I was charged for an extra steak, just another delay and annoying thing to keep me sitting in this dump of a restaurant. I tell Eric and he says he will take care of it. Then we pay and start to leave, I left $11 for Eric, some of my fellow diners weren't that nice, but I really feel like management of this place is why our experience sucked so bad. 

Also, this restaurant was dirty, the floors were gross and under all the tables were disgusting. My friends martini glass had other human lip stains on it....and the list goes on of negative aspects of this establishment. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"I used to like TGI Friday's better when they had their version of Beef Stroganoff. Now I go for their appetizers. So, since they were offering all-you-can-eat appetizers for $10 each, husband and I decided to each order one appetizer and share. We ordered the Tuscan Spinach Dip and the Potstickers. The Dip was cheesy and tasty, but I found the chips a bit tough (at least they didn't break apart when dipping). The Potstickers were typical, but I had no complaints. As for the service, it was somewhat slow and our waiter was not as attentive as we would have liked, so next time, we may try a different location."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes to sit, waited 25 minutes to eat and paid 20.00 for the smallest salmon in the sea!!! Just okay!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant several times. I typically get the barbecued ribs which are absolutely excellent. And there are enough ribs for me to take home and have dinner the next day. The cool thing about this restaurant is that it's located in Sam's town and if you see a movie there you can use your ticket stub to get a buy one get one free meal at TGI Fridays. You cannot beat this offer."}
{"text":"Kind of slow service at the bar on a slow night, but endless appetizers and 3$ Newcastle makes it ok."}
{"text":"No I no why all the Fridays have shut down..Walked in at 930 pm an the kitchen was closed also was there twice in the last year, food was terrible, didn't pay and walked out..WTF.  maybe take some pointers from Applebee's on food quality an service. Will never ever go there again..Shut it down"}
{"text":"En línea con lo que se espera de la franquicia. Las hamburguesas son poderosas, pero esperaba más para un local de la franquicia en su país de origen. Hubo un poco de revuelo porque eramos un grupo grande y no tenian mesas para ubicarnos (hay mucha atención en dejar espacios de circulación libres como corresponde a las normativas), pero eventualmente nos sentamos y la atención fue muy rápida. Quizás demasiada, es uno de esos lugares donde algunos mozos pierden rápido la paciencia ante extranjeros. De todas formas cumple, y en cuanto a comida no hay nada que reprochar."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars as a cumulative rating after seeing their low rating.  I have always been happy with the food and service at the Steele Creek location. Then again, I tip at least 25%. That is a good thing to remember the next time you get poor service on your second visit to a restaurant!  Very friendly staff and consistently well prepared food.  Not normally a fan of chains, but do enjoy their food. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant several times.  The service and food is comparable to other TGIF locations, and we use the coupon we get in the Entertainment Book for additional discounts.  Also, sign up for the Stripes Club.

Restaurant is large but usually not full, even during busy times.  Good place to eat prior to going to the movies or a show in the lounge."}
{"text":"We like it here. We've had really good service the last half dozen or so times we've been. Come to think of it, I don't think we've ever had bad service, and that includes the time they sat a party of 35, yes, 35, right after us. They actually asked us if we wanted to move because that party was close to us. That was a nice touch. Our favorite is Ashley, she's awesome. We had Joey tonight and he was great. I had the Dragonfire Chicken. I recommend. Just enough zip but not too hot."}
{"text":"My review is for the $10 all you can eat apps.  Terrible and nasty.  Over cooked and served cold.  Nasty.  I will not go back for that \"special\".  The TV commercial makes it look so wonderful.  

It is too bad that I cannot rate our server, she was a 5++++.  Can't blame her for crappy food though."}
{"text":"If I'm being honest this location is pretty terrible. The atmosphere just seemed a little uncomfortable almost awkward. Everyone that I encountered as far as employees go and management seem to be new to the point of never have worked in a restaurant before. But it's a chain so I guess who cares. The only reason I was there was to try the Beyond Burger which I had never had before. And to be honest it was pretty good. It definitely has the meaty chewy texture that a beef burger would have but you don't get the upset stomach and all those good things that come with eating meat. If I'm comparing it to the impossible Burger though it is a lot heavier like you feel definitely fuller after eating it. All in all I give the atmosphere and the restaurant like one or two stars but the burger is worth the visit so I can give the burger like four stars"}
{"text":"Ordered steak and lobster it was the worst ever!  Rib-eye steak tough and lobster tail tasted like stuffed-something and not like lobster:( 

However, manager, Liz and our waitress, Ashley were very professional and friendly, great customer service! Took care of me, I walked away satisfied. 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"We waited on this bubblehead hostess to seat us after half an hour. As a look around the restaurant they were a good 8-10 empty tables sitting there. Now when I asked why we couldn't sit down she looked at me with the bad attitude and told me she's doing her best, clearly she was overwhelmed. We had to wait a half an hour just to sit down with a bunch of empty tables. As for the services it was fine and the food was good. The last this that gave this TGI Friday location a two star was how dirty this place was. If anyone had ever been to a Waffle House, it was just like that (eating food in a gas station bathroom)."}
{"text":"Children are allowed at the bar while the adults drink.  Supervisor approves and says her son does the same and she does not see any issue."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, dessert was good, nothing to complain but it takes a little more than this for a 5 Star but it gets a solid 4."}
{"text":"Horrible, service,      although nice lady did admit she was training a new waitress,  food blah, burger fell apart like a sloppy joe, fish was to die,  for ,  don't order the fries.  -Cold garbage, cokes watered down no fizz....very forgetful service,    Lots of very loud  riff-raff.... Bad shady neighborhood,   Down & outers begging outside in the parking lot,.   no diversity ...all African American restaurant except for a couple Mexican waiters."}
{"text":"all cold luke-warm food, poor, non-existent service.."}
{"text":"Terrible. Prior to tonight, I've ordered carryout online after work about every other week.  Tonight, I came to pick up my order and waited at the Curbside Pickup parking spot (like I always have--the 30something times I've done it.)  After about 15 minutes, I finally pulled my car around and went in to get my food.  I was directed to the bar, where there were no employees the first few minutes I was waiting.  Finally, someone came up and provided me my food. When I explained that I had been waiting outside, she informed me that they \"don't do curbside on online orders.\"  Hmm.. well they certainly have every other 30 something times I've ordered this way.  When I explained that, she changed her story and told me they \"only do curbside late at night.\"  Again... I've always ordered right at 5pm when I get off work and they've always brought it out.  Not that I mind going in... but if that's the process, that should always be the process. There's no option to choose curbside vs. inside, etc. when you order online. (BTW.. I also already tipped on my order, assuming it would be delivered curbside.)  

When I finally got my food, I left.  Once outside, I realized I wasn't given my coke and returned to get it and had to wait again.  Once I got home, I realized every part of my order was wrong.  I had ordered a burger with a side of french fries.  Then as an additional side, I ordered mashed potatoes for an extra fee.  Didn't get the french fries that came with my meal.  I ordered cheesecake with no strawberries and only chocolate syrup.  What did I get?  You betcha... cheesecake with strawberries and NO chocolate syrup.

Absolutely ridiculous.  This was 5pm on a Monday and they were not even remotely busy.  No excuse."}
{"text":"It was lunchtime so we ordered from the lunch menu about $10 each for two of us. When the bill came it was $40 and when we asked about it. Our waiter said he put the order in from the dinner menu and he was sorry but we had to pay $40. His mistake and we had to pay for it. Very poor business practice in my opinion."}
{"text":"This review is more about my bartender Daniel than it is my food. I have never been to a place where the bartender was able to turn a 1 star review into a 5 star review. I travel for business and have been staying in Sam's Town for 4 nights out of 10 at the time of this review. I came in on my first night because cheap drinks and cheap apps. I was greeted at the bar top by Daniel he walked me through the happy hour and had my drink back to me before I could even send off an email. My BBQ Chicken flatbread was floppy and warm at best 2nd night I had the driest sliders ever 3rd night was soggy nachos. Yet here I am night 4 I'm here for 1 reason Daniel the Bartender. We have had great conversation and I have had the best customer service I've ever experienced. If you come in eat before but come have all your drinks from my dude Daniel."}
{"text":"I don't know what us up with this place because they used to be really good. Wifey and i would get take out about once every month or two  since I like the Jack Daniels burger and wife likes the Jack Daniels chicken nuggets.  This is literally the third time this has happened. I ordered my usual burger with EXTRA JD on the side. This came as a regular cheeseburger with jack cheese no JD sauce on burger or on side and no bacon. Wife got her usual JD chicken nuggets which is usually a pretty good portion talking maybe 15 nuggets which is reasonable since they cost $11 dollars. However this time 8 lierally 8 for $11. What a deal right? Anyways they also seem to always forget the kids meal. Then when you ask them for it they get an attitude. Like i said we eat there once every month or two so for us tipping $6 on a $40 take out order that we enjoy is no big deal. I really wish i had asked for the tip back as the bar tender couldnt be bothered and i had to ask a server for help or at least give the tip to the waiter. So in summary if you eat here eat in and do not get take out. If you must get take out CHECK and double check the order before you leave. Also the manager in his green pastel shirt was 0 help and just ignored me when i tried to get his attention. I wish i were a secret shopper"}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  Sad thing is i love TGI Fridays, but this location inside the Orleans hotel and casino is not good. I'm guessing they are not staffed well enough to keep up with the amount of people that want to eat there.  Service was at best ok.  My sons sliders were dry and cold.  My wife's chicken bruschetta pasta was cold and bland. I could've had a much better meal somewhere else for $115!!  Shame on them. This is Vegas.  For the amount of money you leave behind in this town you shouldn't have a bad meal anywhere."}
{"text":"I was on 5/12/18 and ordered 2 big slab ribs to go.... Wow they were small and all dried up ..like jerky on a bone and they only gave a scoop of coleslaw and a handful of fries. I called to complain and the girl told me there is nothing she can do and thats the way they are... I will never be going there again. The meals were thrown out....."}
{"text":"After being served what tasted like tap water. We ordered a sprite. The resturant was not that busy. It took over 15 minutes to get said sprite. When the waiter was asked again he said one moment. ( he forgot ). The 2 female waitresses were more concerned with flirting with a single male patron then their actual job. What a waste of time. The menu's and empty played were never removed from out table. Sorry TGIF I won't be back. Evan you failed at providing a great experience."}
{"text":"Uh, wow... some of the worst slop on a plate ever served.  Our chicken quesadilla appetizer was all of 4 pieces and mostly tortilla than chicken with old-tasting salsa om the side.  Her French onion soup was reminiscent of packet soup smothered in some sort of overcooked, rubbery cheese (no, not Guyere).  And my pecan chicken salad was a disgusting cess pool of wilted, completely dressing-drenched lettuce leaves and other things begging for the mercy of a trash can.  Even our server came off as robotic and disgruntled as our food was.

I've been to other TGI Fridays around the country but this one takes the cake for the standard airport restaurant \"who cares what you think, you're leaving soon\" fare.  I'd go out of my way to avoid eating here again, hence the 1 star."}
{"text":"This TGI Fridays is near our house and we visit every month or so.  Food is always good and the drinks are also great.  Their service, unfortunately, seems to be hit or miss.  One time we might get a friendly, dynamic server and the next time get someone that takes over 30 minutes to take your drink/food order.  Too bad."}
{"text":"The service here is just sad. The set up they had for us was horrible. We couldn't fit all us comfortably so we asked to have another table added which was so easy for them to figure out for the amount of people we had. They had a couple of the chairs set up so close to the wall we moved the tables out on our own.. The chairs at our table were so wobbly, I couldn't take it, I switched it out myself. 
One of us had to wait another 5 minutes for their food after everyone got theirs..because another server took it to another table. Our waiter said it would be a few minutes but it was much longer than that before she got her food..refills on drinks even water took quite a while! I mean we didn't see our server very often in this little restaurant. Our appetizer dip was not served with utensils I guess they wanted us to dip our chips in it and pass it around. I would've appreciated a little compensation for the late food. Or the fact that she asked our waiter if she could at least get a dip while she waits and watches everyone else eat. But he said No. Thank you so much for crappy service!"}
{"text":"Gees lots of bad reviews here but we had a pretty good experience eating here during a Sunday evening over the busy Memorial Day weekend. We had appetizers; BBQ chicken flatbread which was excellent. We shared potstickers which were okay but a tad dry probably because they were under the heat lamp but still good  My entree was Sizzling Chicken and Cheese and it was excellent; a mix of  cheeses with peppers and onions under boneless chicken breast accompanied by their delicious mashed potatoes. Really really good. My husband had steak and lobster and said it was \"okay\" (I think there are certain items you just shouldn't order at chain restaurants). I did have their \"Cadillac Margarita\" which was not memorable. Even though the restaurant was very busy our server David was very pleasant and efficient. But the girl working the hostess desk was a witch. She wanted to seat us in the bar area at a high top table and I asked not to be seated there due to how uncomfortable it is and she got annoyed and to 'punish' me said it would be another 15-20 minute wait. However another girl immediately sat us in a booth. These are the people that hurt businesses but she didn't ruin our dinner."}
{"text":"This TGI Friday's is located in Sams Town Hotel and Casino. We stopped in around midnight and thought it was going to be a disaster because it was late and there was no one in the restaurant (plus other  nightmare experiences from other locations).  I had the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese and it was delicious and piping hot! The chicken was very tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were excellent.  I had a Bloody Mary which was okay (good but not great). I would definitely come back to explore the menu some more."}
{"text":"My favorite entree when I visit any TGI Fridays is the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese (chicken breasts on top of peppers, onions and 2 cheeses with a side of mashed potatoes served on a sizzling skillet YUM!). It was good at this location but missing some of its usual flavor. I had a Moscow Mule cocktail and it was excellent, served in a chilled copper mug. This drink was so refreshing and stayed ice cold! My husband had the salmon (with rice and broccoli )he said it was good. He also had a Blue Moon tap beer. We shared a BBQ flatbread appetizer and it was okay but it was lukewarm at best. Our server BJ was EXCELLENT, super nice and efficient....you couldn't ask for a better server! TGI Friday's is not a cheap place to eat anymore. Our bill for lunch was approximately  $67.00!"}
{"text":"***Too Expensive For Quality Of Food/Drink/  
        Slowwww Service***
I do like Fridays but this is the worst TGI Fridays I've ever been to. Stopped in for lunch, I ordered a berry limeade cocktail that was so watered down it angered me ($12.50!!). The 2 appetizers we had were potstickers and bbq chicken flatbread pizza ($11.50 each LOL!!) both overcooked which obviously made them dried out. I ordered the crusted parmesan cheese chicken ($14.25) and this too was overcooked. Food splatter all over the wall in our booth. Though our waitress was nice and the place was almost empty the service was  slowwwww, I mean one of the worst service I've ever had. For lunch we were in there for 2 hours.  I don't know but I think the kitchen is to blame and obviously management but then again when I paid the waitress I had to wait well over 10 minutes to get my change.  How does this place survive. SKIP THIS FRIDAYS!!"}
{"text":"I never had french onion soup served borderline cold before. It is always the opposite; so hot you have to wait to eat it but this is how it was served here and LOADED with parsley. My entree was also overdone with parsley. I agree with the other Yelpers that  the service is very slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"Short and simple...don't waste your time! It's sooo many restaurants in the area, so don't settle for this one. Miscommunication, lack of communication, negligence, no sense of urgency, unprofessional, smelly...I could go on for days!"}
{"text":"service was good, food was what I would expect from TGI Fridays"}
{"text":"Okay, summer is here and I'm fat. So a salad was on the menu.  The Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad was delicious and filling.  The Chipotle crema drizzled around the salad is thick and yummy, not spicy at all. Hubby got the Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad that he loves.  Our server was great.  A good visit overall."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat there, waited 40 minutes for chicken nachos,  to go . Got my check 20 minutes before I got my food. Refill never came .. sad really .. when the place was dead; 4 or 5 front of house members going around . 5/6 booths isn't busy!
Finally got my nachos... Hardely any cheese and fyi I'm not picky... This was dry. 
I gave the check and nachos right back to the waiter.. and three bucks for the  Pepsi I drank.  Thank you for the smile but work on your kitchen staff and waiters so that they may explain delays. 
Manager FAIL. Sad sad management."}
{"text":"This gem is tucked away in a corner at Gold Coast and is worth searching for. After a slight snafu with a coupon that I had (was told by hostess that I could use it but management said no) we got seated and our waiter came over and took our drink orders. He was friendly and polite (cute also) . We ordered our food and were really happy with the prices and quality. 
I had the warm pretzels with dipping sauce and chicken fingers with fries. The pretzels are awesome and the sauce really good. Adding jalapeño to the pretzels would make them amazing.
My mom had a burger and fries that were perfectly cooked. 
As we ordered off the lunch specials in the back of the menu, the prices were lower (only available until 3 pm) .
Please note that they do not have a restroom inside the joint. You must walk a bit to the casino restroom . 
All in all we were happy and would certainly come back when at gold coast."}
{"text":"We were sat quickly but then there was a slight delay in our waitress coming for our drink orders but I won't complain about that since my wife had to use the restroom anyway. The service overall was good, tho a little slow on bringing the food out. Which very likely could be the kitchens fault. The main issue with this place was the food. My sons burger was cooked well past well done and he wouldn't eat it. An 8 year old that usually eats well took about three bites and said he couldn't eat it. My wife ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was cooked nicely but it was pretty bland. I've had this dish at TGI Fridays before and this was subpar for them. I ordered the French Dip with no onions. Of course it came out with onions but no horseradish sauce. I'm not one to send it back (Ive seen the movie Waiting lol) so I picked off the onion and went on. The kicker was my Au Jus cup was cemented to the plate. I picked up the entire plate, food and all by lifting just the cup. How does this happen you ask? Well it was glued down with the cheese that should have been on my sandwich, unless that was cheese from the last patron lol. I probably shouldn't laugh at that.
The only bright spot was our server. She was a little slow in things that came from the kitchen and seemed spread out across the restaurant. But she kept the smile and was very friendly. 
They're so many other great food choices in that area that there is absolutely no reason not to avoid this place and go somewhere with more passion for the food coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've never eaten a a TGIFridays before so when we got a two for one coupon in the mail I decided to give the place a try. I ordered the Stacked Blue Cheese Burger and what a mistake that was. The burger was so salty it was almost uneatable. I made through about half of it before giving up. If I do eat there ever again I plan to eat only salad because now I don't trust the meat seasoning. Worse experience ever with a restaurant meal."}
{"text":"Take out jack Daniels chicken...no jack Daniels sauce.
Get it together TGIF.
No excuse to miss one of the main ingredients.
Can't fix it was ordered for take out."}
{"text":"Just the other day, my fiancé and I were out and about, when decided that we should stop and get a bite to eat. Upon agreeing to eat at TGI Fridays, we pulled into this TGI Fridays location. Long story short, our meals and appetizers where great! But the waitress we had by the name of Alex (a female) was horrible..So bad to the point that we had to get the manager just to get our glasses of water refilled. 
     I am and always have been a fan of TGI Fridays, I love their food, and even more so their cocktail drinks. Just about every other time I've gone there, their service is spot on. But I don't know what the deal was with this woman Alex not wanting to do her job. Needless to say,me and my wife to be left a tip of $0.00. 
    If you go to this location, and your waitress has a badge that says \"Alex\", either go sit at the bar, or ask for another server (if she still works there). 
    Just a (somewhat) quick heads up ;-)"}
{"text":"Hostess screwed up in the beginning and got everyone's order in line mixed up.  Then she thought we were a party of 2, not 3. Sat and waited for the server to finally come and ask if we wanted drinks."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day, unfortunately! Worse food & service I have had in a long time.
Server took 3 attempts to bring a round of waters and a tea for 7 people. There were only 3 other occupied tables during lunch. First sign this was going to go south..quickly. Finally placed our order, a girl in the group placed a to-go order. Her to-go order came out after 2 girls received their salads after 20 minutes and still no appetizer. When the fool finally came out after 45 minutes half of the orders were cold and the other half were burned. 
Manager attempted to make our experience right by taking 20% off, this didn't make up 2 of the girls not eating any of their food.  
Don't waste your time? Better luck at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Just went have  after about 4 min hostess got me a drink. 15 minutes later no \"sorry, what can I get you\", no be right with you. So I got up and walked out, I would have stayed if there had at least been some kind of acknowledgment. Don't go to this location unless you have time to waste!"}
{"text":"Was a loyal fan of Fridays until a recent encounter.  Went on Wed $3 martini night, asked server if it was indeed $3 for a martini and she responded by asking what kind we wanted.  Took the order and all was well until the check came.  Martinis went up to $6.  When quizzed, she said that she told us the \"deal\" was only available at the bar, but she didn't tell us and when told she hadn't mentioned the bar only deal, she got very firm and said she did.  Well, two of us know what she said.  So we didn't ask for a manager because it was busy and thought we would handle this little snafu by going to the web site.  filled out the requisite form, got a response that the GM would contact me and after two weeks, I'm still waiting.  Blowing off a good customer isn't the way to do business!   It isn't about the money; it's about the lying!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday.  We are somewhat regulars,  so we were surprised to see a new face.  We placed out order for an appetizer,  which took longer than usual.  When my order came out I noticed that I was missing a part of my order. With the lack of table touches by the server it did take a while for me to notify him that I was missing part of my order. He apologized and said he would go put it in right away. During that time we had finished most of our meal received our check and then the server comes back and says that you put it in but somebody else took it, didn't offer to replace it or any other service recovery. Also did not take down my rewards number so I can receive my rewards points for the money I was spending there. It was clear that he was a new server and may possibly be in need of some retraining and customer focus because this was probably in a long time the most memorable experience of bad service at we have had coming there regularly. Also, just a suggestion, may want to advise servers on their vernacular with patrons based on their ethnicity because everybody deserves professional communication and service."}
{"text":"I like TGI Fridays the atmosphere is fun to have good entrees. I mainly went there for the $9.99 all you can eat apps now they're 14 bucks so I won't be going back soon"}
{"text":"Place needs a sprucing up. Scratched up paint and dingy floor.
Heavy scent of air freshner, covering up what exactly?
Itsy bitsy lunch menu,. Expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Conveniently located inside of the Orleans, this TGI Friday's location is a great place to go eat before or after bowling, the movies, or just a nice place to go eat food at. The prices are comparable to TGI Friday's outside of casinos and have the safe offerings as other TGI Friday's. During my last visit, our server was really nice and informative. The food was up to par. My friends ordered their wings and I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. I absolutely love the Jack Daniel's sauce and the reason I get Jack Daniel entrees. The sandwich was delicious, but it was missing the fried onion strings. Their sweet potato fries were top notch in my opinion and made the meal that much more enjoyable. Overall, a good place to eat if you like the uniqueness TGI Friday's has to offer, but nothing stands out to me that puts TGI Friday's above the rest."}
{"text":"The rain drops didn't stop us from going to one of our favorite places !   We tried their bucket of bones ... which was BBQ Ribs , garlic Parmesan wings and fries...very tasty!  Our waitress was Abby ... so sweet and friendly ... their new fry cook did a excellent job on our order !  Give him a \"pat\" on the back ... our favorite is The grill \"master\" Michael but he didn't start until later ... so until next time ... thanks for a great Lunch"}
{"text":"I am writing this sitting in my booth where I have been for the last hour and 40 minutes here on st Patrick's day. It took 15 minutes for the host to get the waitresses attention. When I asked for a refill on my drink it did not come until after my meal was complete. Another 25 minutes to get anyone's attention to bring the check and here we are 20 more minutes later and no one has taken my check. The worst experience I  have ever had in any dining establishment. Will never come back."}
{"text":"I did a to-go order. They forgot the salad dressing and the burger was way under cooked so I couldn't eat it. The host did refund me for the burger but waiting 25min for an under cooked burger after midnight is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I'd give zero stars if I could. Won't be back. Dirty. Cold food. Endless apps not worth the wait. I could go on, but won't waste my time. Don't waste yours either."}
{"text":"decent food. yes, a chain restaurant and the same items you'd get elsewhere - a bit better than your average fast food place. portions are nicely sized, they have added a bunch of new stuff to the menu, and the service was friendly enough."}
{"text":"We have never had even a decent experience at this location - in fact, the trip back to this particular store was the first in about 5 years.... Now we remember why....
My boyfriend and I met another couple there and they were seated and waiting when we got there - service should have been established by this time.. But NOOO.
It look about 20 minutes to get our drinks, the water that we ordered at the same time as our cocktails never came.
The waiter did not get one single food order correct at the table and seemed upset when our friends requested the rest of their order. The food was average at best and the service was horrible for the restaurant not being very busy.
The manager/supervisor was busy flirting with the female wait staff by the bar while other tables waited for drink refills and to order.
Horrible experience -we will not go back to that location and think if it IS a franchise, the parent corp should come in and bring them up to quality standards."}
{"text":"Love the happy hr prices, ordered the onion rings, wings, potstickers and our fav was the green bean fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I are there for lunch yesterday and had great service! The food was excellent. We had the jack daniels burger and the pulled pork sandwich. They were amazing! Can not complain about a thing! I have eaten here before and things are definitely changing for the good, must have new management. 
Good job tgi fridays"}
{"text":"Arrived to no line - host sat us right away.
To a dirty table with food crumbs and debris.So when the waitress arrived it was pretty apparent that I annoyed her when I asked for it to be re-cleaned after the \"wait help\" or someone attempted to wipe it down - wipes the table then seat then table then other seat. Now WHY would anyone wipe a chair - seat then wipe the table you eat off of ?
She had to redo it and didn't seem to appreciate that extra work.
So we order a couple of things while we waited for the rest of our party. To my surprise when I ordered the VERY small BUCKET of bones AND wings -- I was corrected by our waitress that NO I DID NOT order the wings. I ONLY ordered the bucket with the ribs/wings. Well - with FOUR people there is NO way you can feed them with such a small portion of food with their serving size of the bucket of bones (more like soup bowl).
Then we are contemplating whether we would order dessert or not -- to our surprise this too was an irritant to our server Kirsten.
So we decided not to and just pay our bill. Well damn if i had a comp to ruin her day even more ?!? Excuse me for being a frequent club member at the Gold Coast.

Or was it because we were Asian and she wanted to serve anyone else but us ?!?

Kinda of felt that way if you ask me --
Check your video Ms manager of TGIF.

Too bad I couldn't record our conversation.

That's ok -- I have a lot of yelp and TripAdvisor followers.

Here is a place YOU don't want to spend your money on - even when you can't get any value on a comp!  Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always get the pecan chicken salad but won't anymore.  They changed it for the worse no longer has cranberries or pecan pieces.  They also changed the Mandarin oranges to fresh orange segments Yuk.  Will not be going here again!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten t TGIFriday's many times but the One on Sahara   4570 West Sahara Las Vegas Nv. number 1852 has a lot to be desired.  First we came in about 4:30pm no one to seat us I guess shift change but this not my problem.  Finally a waitress came up and i will try and find someone to eat you  That should have been my first clue.  So were were seated and finally our waiter came over and ask us what we wanted to drink water and a beer, after a short time the beer was delivered.  I ordered the Pecan and chicken salad my husband ordered the fish and chips and I had the soup.  Now my soup came no bread and one package of crackers.  I asked if I could have some bread extra charge,  okay more crackers.  His Fish and Chips came first not very good looking  and Fish looked like the grease was old, not a very good presentation of the dish.  Next the salad chicken put on top and everything else on the bottom , I had to try and find the nuts pecans and cranberries plus the cheese.  Needed our check and yes I had to ask another waiter for the bill.  Finally our waiter came back and didn't know how the pay at our table worked,  The bill came to 51.00 and some change I tipped  him $8.00 he would have gotten more.  This cooperation needs to get it together .  Lets hope they read their reviews and get a good chief or cook.  Did I complain No but they should know better.   I can see why they are closing their restaurants they can't get it together,  Asian salad was great gone from the menu ,"}
{"text":"Two of us sitting outside and it is very pleasant. The weather today is great!  We got the three appetizer special including boneless wings, mozzarella sticks, and pot stickers.  They were great and if we stopped there this review would be 4 stars. If we didn't have the appetizers, there would be just 2 stars.  For dinner, I got the Chipotle Yucatan salad and it was barely ok.  I've had it before at another Fridays where it was great so I know it has potential.  The chicken was dry and stringy and everything else was drowning in the dressing. The other meal was the NY Cheddar Bacon burger and it was only ok as well. The bottom bun fell apart, and the burger itself was difficult to bite into. The waiter was great, though, and if I could give a half star I would push it up to 3.5 stars based on his service."}
{"text":"We went out for a girls night out. We sat there for about 10 plus minutes before our server came to get our drink order. We did the endless appetizers first we had fried pickles and pot stickers. The fried pickles were bitter and not very tasty the potstickers were the best of the evening. We had a medical emergency and I asked them to call 911 the manager told me no they will ask me questions you call them. During this they bring our second serving of loaded potato skins and garlic Parmesan wings. The wings were not very tasty they tasted like strong garlic and rubbery. The potato skins tasted burnt. Slow service and not that good tasty food."}
{"text":"Our experience was horrible. The floor was so dirty and tables along with menus were sticky. I got the ribs and shrimp with fries.  The fries tasted like freezer burn and the shrimp tasted old and fishy. They went down hill. Our waitress looked like she was from the hood and would beat you up if you looked at her wrong. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"So, we were here on a trip from San Diego, we usually stop by or stay at The Orleans and we always stop in at Friday's for a bite to eat.  Either a meal or just snacks.  We have always liked this spot.  Very convenient and friendly.  However there certainly seems to be a change, and it's not for the better!  We were in a bit of a hurry, there was a little bit of a line to be seated in the dinning room, so we chose to sit in the bar.  All we wanted was skins, a cocktail and an ice tea.  So we sat at a bar table, and nobody paid any attention to us.  So I got up and walked over to a lady behind the bar and patiently waited for her to take a quick break from chatting with an obvious regular customer.  She never acknowledged me, Laura went to another bartender and asked for someone to take our order.  She was rudely told that we waited because we sat ourselves in the bar.  The lady said she would send someone over, but sure made it seem like we were putting her out.  Laura mentioned her treatment to the manager, who spoke with the bartender (before we got our drinks... EEK)!  Sure seemed like the waitress thought we complained about her, because she  barely said a word to us for the first time or two she stopped by, but then warmed up and was OK.  So we asked to speak with the manager again, about the whole situation.  She apologized and made excuses.  I explained that we have been coming here for 5 or so years, and have always been treated well, but this time was certainly different.  I asked her if she ever looks at the Yelp reviews for her store, she said no.  They have their own review system and don't care about Yelp.  I told her she really should.  I explained that Yelp is HUGE now, and she could learn a LOT about her store.  Well the skins did arrive and they were OK, nothing to make us go out of our way for again.  Certainly unless Yelpers start giving this place a better rating we won't go out of our way to eat here again.   The manager did comp the cocktail, but we were running well behind our expected time, but it worked out."}

Brussels sprout appetizer was horrendous, super long stems and very el dented and Luke warm. The usually delicious loaded potatoes hardly had any bacon or sour cream to go with them. And they were luke warm....service is pretty bad tonight and it's not even 6PM"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service!!! Food ok, princess seen to be a little high 2 dishes and 2 iced teas, check $45 bucks!! Portions are very tiny, ambient little loud and many seniors around, but i will comeback just for a happy hour ."}
{"text":"I am only giving this review one star because their food was actually really good. All except the steak my fiancé ordered was over done but still ok. 
My biggest issue was with the service we received from Staci. Now for the record I was a server/bartender and manager of a restaurant for over 4 years. There was now greeting at all. Like hi my name is Staci what can I get you to drink. Instead we got a what do you want to drink. I had the endless appetizer and my fiancé had the flat iron steak. The appetizers for one took forever to come out of the kitchen and this did not seem to be tho kitchens fault as the food was warm at this point and that's due to it sitting in a window for longer than it should (again I would know managed a restaurant for 4+ years). Every time she would ask what I would like next for my endless appetizer it came out as follows \"what do you want next\". She never once asked us how the meal tasted or checked in with us. The only time our server ever stopped at the table was to drop something we asked for off or when we ordered, no other times. The other issues is neither her nor any other server, bus boy, manager no one else asked if everything was ok either. One of my biggest issues was no one taking the plates we were done with out of our way. I had 3 app plates and my fiancé plate were all sitting on our table even when we left. My fiancé had finished his meal about 15-20 mins before my final appetizer came out and still no one too the plate even though we put the napkins and everything overtop of the plate. Every server should know the proper steps to serving especially in a decent restaurant. 
All in all not sure if we will be back to this location and if we do probably will just do Togo because again the food was just fine."}
{"text":"Staying at the Gold Coast for a conference this weekend. Went downstairs for a late night munchie. Shelby was speaking to a couple on the short side of the bar so I stood on that side to order figuring she'd obviously welcome me when she was done. I looked over at her a few times so she'd know I was waiting, she never even looked at me though I know she had to at least see me out of her periphery. When she was done chatting she walked away down the long right side of the bar, never even came over to me. 3 gentlemen sat down at the long left side, she walked right up to them all smiles and started helping them. I sat there and stared at her, we can all feel when we're being stared at and we look. Nope not her. Finally another bartender who was going into a cooler looked at me, smiled and asked if I was being helped. Thank you Ashley!!!!! The whole time I was standing there, Shelby never once made eye contact or anything. There were a couple male bartenders who came in after I'd gotten help, they even made the polite eye contact and smiled in acknowledgement of my presence. After I got my item I asked Ashley for the other tenders name and told her what happened. If you look gay (I'm a butch dyke) and you come to this Friday's don't plan on even being acknowledged if Shelby is working, she OBVIOUSLY has serious gay issues. I'll be taking the rest of my dining off site this weekend. The Gold Coast lost it all because of this bartender. A fair number of the people that are with this conference are LGBTQ."}
{"text":"Whenever i crave for steak and lobster this is the place to be! The wait wasn't that bad when we went there for st patrick's day. Server was nice! I so love their mozzarella sticks and the marinara sauce. Tenders were good too not too hard on the breading. It was a great experience as always!"}
{"text":"Waiting for service. Very poor. If. you are in a rush don't come here. Haven't even received water. Another gentleman has been waiting over 10 min to pay his bill! Don't know if it's because we are African American or not, but we have watched 2 tables get served their food after we had ordered ours. The server we finally flagged down got our drink orders but we are watching people around us eat and we still haven't received our food!  Horrendous service!!!  Because we haven't been served we are leaving. I guess they wanted to give us a hint. Well, we're taking it and our business elsewhere. Oh did I mentioned we're at this place because I booked a party of over 50 people for a small wedding reception?  The Orleans hotel is great for their staff and service, but THIS restaurant is horrendous!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Friday's several times before I mean if you've been to a Friday's Applebee's or Chili's then you've been to them all they have pretty good drinks they have good appetizers and there's usually something you can find on the menu so there's really not too much to review unless you've been hiding under a rock all your life"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of restaurants. By no means did I walk into a TGI Fridays with high expectations but somehow, they disappointed even my lowered point of view. 

We sent the potato skins back. They were mushy. No green onions. Just a fried piece of potato with cheese and bacon. Absolutely nothing to make them stand out or even compete with the most basic of potato skins. And they claim they invented these? 

You can tell that nothing is fresh. The ranch is bland. Everything tasted manufactured. 

Not once was my dad ever offered another beverage. And it was a Mai tai. That's such an easy way to get a bill up higher and no one even thought to ask. 

The hostess? Non existent. And when she did make her round to us, there was zero personality or positivity. 

We ordered a couple burgers...fresh baked buns? Maybe one of them because the bun was actually brown in color. The other, was white. 

To top it all off, right as I was about to rate this place 2 stars, the random bad attitude hostess comes to the table and auctions off a ribeye steak. I told her we were finished with our meal and she stood there, blankly for a moment, just to respond with, \"Oh.\""}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! Let's start a Go Fund Me to help them pay there NV Energy Bill and turn on the heater. Next, our server Heather was out of this world. Like literally, I think she's an alien! Totally awkward and would always interrupt our conversations. And don't get me started on the feedback or non-feedback we received on questions we had about the drinks or food. And while we are on the food, we should've ate at Wendy's, because then at least we would've had something edible. This place sucks! Save yourself the trouble, if not ask for Heather, she's GREAT!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Our waiter, Grayson, visted our table twice in the 50 minutes that we waited for food without receiving anything. We ordered appetizers and sat waiting for 50 minutes! Our waiter came by, said \"still waiting\" as he saw our glasses empty and ignored us and walked by. Only when we flagged him down a second time did he get our drink order, and then sent another server to do it. We saw one waiter visit each of his tables numerous times before ours came by to check on us once. We eventually spoke with that waiter, David, and he apologized several times before we left. He was the only good thing about this Friday's."}
{"text":"Although I am not a big fan of chain restaurants when there are so many other options, I have to say that I will make this location of TGI Friday's an exception.  I have been in there a few times (once when there was a Pens game on TV, another just to dine quickly on a Friday after work) and I cannot complain about either experience.  We did want to go last night before the Pens game but they were indeed super busy and it would have been impossible to get a table. 

The service is good, the staff is friendly, and on the first occasion we were there they were closing, but the Pens game had gone into a shootout, and they did not shoo us out.  That was such a good move as now it has left a very positive impression on me and it will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I love Friday's sesame jack chicken strips but I loved NOTHING about my day at this location of TGI Friday's!

One Sunday before going to see a movie, my friend and I decided we were going to grab a bite and chose Friday's as we both had said \"decent food, quick, and we have not been there in awhile.\"  What a mistake!  Unlike most of my other experiences at a Friday's (which was pleasant), this one was NOT that way.   

AWFUL service, awful food, and awful environment... we joked that we felt like we were being served lunch in a women's prison.  Terrible!  The area they sat us in was filthy and loud and they had just opened and they were not busy.  My friend's order was completely wrong and they comped her an iced tea (what kind of a manager does that?).  

Needless to say, after this experience, I will not be back to this location, but I will definitely explore the others in the area."}
{"text":"Here at 11:30pm the food was horrible. We got burnt pretzel sticks, hard overcooked boneless wings, potato skins over cooked, and cheese stick that were ok. Service was not good and both the bartenders had bad attitudes.  I got an apple martini and it did not taste like apple at all. I will not be back EVER!"}
{"text":"So I feel bad for all the people coming in at 7:20, when the food runner said they close in 40 minutes and there are no clean tables - yet there are three full tables and tables with literally a coffee cup on it. Our server was the only thing positive..... must be hard to find good help and management - the lady with the crazy eyebrows - she has sent away no less then 15 people."}
{"text":"I live north of butler and drive here monthly. I like the food but today the service was horrible. As you can see from the pictures we waited 30 minutes for our appetizer that of course came after our food- sat there with empty drinks and dirty plates. I would hope that it was just an off night but it was a waste. Sad state - avoid this one until they turn it back around ."}
{"text":"Something has seriously happened to the quality of food. My blue cheese stacker had floppy greasy patties the quality of McDonalds. My son's chicken fingers breading was thin and tasted really off. Almost like plastic. For a family of 4 this wasn't close to worthy of a $50 bill. Only plus was we had a fantastic server."}
{"text":"Food was ok, we got a to go box after we just got the food and the bill was showed at the same time. I though it is a dine in restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good came out nice and fast.  Me and my wife got long island ice teas only difference is my drink had gray goose and cost 3 dollars more. When they got there the waitress put them down. And you can see the difference between them. They should be identical and my drink was extremely water down with sprite by the taste. And my wife said it was really weak compared to hers. So food good drinks suck"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. Our waitress took our drink order, and after we said we needed more time to look at the menu, she disappeared for about 15 minutes before she came back, took our order, and brought my water. She still had not brought the other 4 drinks and claimed that she was waiting on the bartender. Another few minutes went by and she finally brought the rest of the drinks. That was the last we saw of her.
When our food was finally brought out by two other waitresses about 20 minutes later, my water glass had been empty for awhile so I asked for a refill. Nothing. In addition to that, our order of fish n chips was chewy and a burger was soggy from sitting out so long. One of the waitresses rolled her eyes at us when we asked for napkins and utensils so we could, you know, eat our food?
Meanwhile, our assigned waitress had been very attentive to the other tables she was waiting on, and purposely ignored us every time she walked by. We finally had enough and went to the host stand to find a manager to complain to and there was another woman up there to complain about the same waitress. The manager was very apologetic but as soon as he FINALLY brought my water that at this point I had asked 3 times and waited half an hour for, he disappeared like our waitress had. And still no one checked up on us for the remainder of our meal. When we finally got our check, we saw that we only received a 20% discount, which was much less than we had expected. The bus girl helped us more than anyone else did. It was like pulling teeth trying to get simple things like refills and utensils. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Kevin won us over. He is the reason why my husband and I love coming to this TGI Fridays. We came here with friends one night and Kevin introduced us to the endless apps for $10. Even though the endless apps deal is awesome, we would have probably forgotten about it and went back to our usual place. But, because Kevin was our server we came back and can't wait to come back again. He is THE best server I've ever had in the history of all restaurants. He's funny, helpful, and just the nicest guy. 

Also, get the Jack Daniels Wings. They're awesome!"}
{"text":"Terrible, unfriendly service.  Very dead atmosphere.  They clearly don't care about the food.  We live 5 minutes from here and will NEVER go back.  Save your money!"}
{"text":"I visited TGI Friday's inside of Sams Town Casino last weekend and here's my review.  I had the Jack Daniels Burger and it was just okay this time.  Usually it's pretty good but, what made my experience great there was my waiter Brandon.  He was one of the nicest waiters I've ever met.  He was totally professional and kind.  He should be working at a 4 or 5 star restaurant.  He's that good so when you stop by...ask for Brandon's section."}
{"text":"Service slow. Food, not great. 
But what did I expect, it's TGIF. 

All you can eat apps is the worst idea ever, btw."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating at TGIF's last Friday with some friends. Unfortunately, I found the dining experience to be unacceptable and I wish to share the details with you. We arrived at the restaurant at 7:15pm. We had a group of 4 in our party. The hostess informed us that the wait would be about 25 minutes. Thirty minutes later, I went to the hostess stand to check on the status and I was now told that the wait would be a bit longer. We were finally seated at 7:50.  Sabrina our sever approached our table and apologized for the wait and said that she is dealing with a group of 7 and that she will return as fast as she can.  Eventually she came back and took our drink and food orders. I had specific requests for my food preparation and asked her to reiterate it to the kitchen staff. She told me that she cannot do that and simply puts the order into the computer. I found this to be rude. It's the servers responsibility to make sure that the order is correct before delivering it to the table. Shortly thereafter, I noticed that we didn't have any silverware. I asked the server were our silverware is and she informed us that the entire restaurant doesn't have any more silverware! She said that the silverware will be delivered before our food. This wasn't the case, the food came out which was not hot by the way before the silverware. I picked up my baked potato and was eating it with my hands. Since it wasn't hot, I didn't get burnt.  The server checked back with us from time to time but always blamed someone else for the delays. She said that they were short a server and only one person was washing dishes.  Even the manager came by at one point and didn't really apologize for the troubles.  How can we eat our meal without silverware!? Finally some silverware was delivered to our table but not after we complained literally 5 times about it. Please contact me for more information about my experience.  We finally left the restaurant at 9:10pm."}
{"text":"Got here lil before 3pm and there were only 3 tables. Slow day. When my bf got his beer there was a BUG in it. Disgusting!! When we told the server if she can change it she said yes. We didn't even get an apology. Food was OK. Service wasn't bad just doesn't seem like customers are their priority. They charged us for both beers but then stated they took one beer off. Like if they were doing us a favor. In all my years in food and beverage industry that is unacceptable. You need to acknowledge the guest apologize and I would of taken the beer off from the bill. Definitely not coming back to TGIF at gold coast. Don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"The star is for the location and server. The food was absolutely a disgrace. The salmon was dry, over cooked and a very sad portion size. The fried shrimp was so oily I couldn't eat it. The fries were old and dry the only thing good per my mother was the coleslaw. Oh and the happy hour margarita was pretty good. Too many places to eat at in Vegas for them to be selling food this bad."}
{"text":"Pretzel sticks and sesame chicken apps are awesome! 

Love the all American burger.

I do not recommend  pasta dishes at Friday's. 

Service is always efficient."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite. The friendly staff is amazing and the food was so good.  The unlimited apps are a must.  Try it all."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of TGI Friday's, until last night. Service was mediocre at best, took them 15 mins to get my son a chocolate milk after my husband and I received our drinks. Restaurant is very dirty! Seems like when they wipe down their tables they just wipe it all on the floor and don't clean it up. From last time I visited prices have gone up tremendously! Reason for 2 stars is at least the food was good. Probably won't be back here again..."}
{"text":"Very good food!  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of their policies on certain items!    If you offer free chips as a reward member then why is it put on the bill in the first place?  Secondly only the manager can remove it from the bill? Then why are both managers in a meeting and I either have to pay for the chips or wait until their meeting is over??  Something wrong with this !!! And then the waiter doesn't understand why I woutbe slightly upset!!!  Of course after eating and waiting for my bill, why should I mind having to wait on manager availability before I can leave???"}
{"text":"I had a super lackluster experience with my family here in March 2016 but since this is my nearest Friday's, I relented and decided to give the place another try before heading to the movies at the Orleans. Bad idea : the same female bartender with red hair was there with her strange, rude attitude. 

Despite seeing her, I and my boyfriend sit at the bar and chat while waiting for the bartender to stop staring at her cellphone. Then she proceeded to polish things behind the bar despite our attempts to get her attention. 15 minutes later she walks over to us after I finally get her to look up and asks for my ID immediately before greeting us or introducing us. 

As someone who has worked in restaurants in NYC since the age of 16, I was stunned. I gave her my ID, then my order, which she makes a face at for some weird reason. She then took my boyfriend's order. We get our drinks placed in front of us and she walks away with an attitude. I guess she was taking her hate for her job on us? Not sure but it was weird.

She comes back out of nowhere and asks my boyfriend if he's from Chile and he says yes. Then she smiles at him coyly and gives me a dirty look - not sure why. So now she's rude & weird to boot- bless her heart. I can only imagine what her problem was but she was nasty for the rest of the night, especially after my man got weirded out by her flirting with him. 

Service was angry and slow, to say the least. Do yourself a favor and order from the restaurant if not another location altogether."}
{"text":"We did not eat here. We called ahead for seating for a group of nine. We were told there was no wait and they could not take our name because there was no wait. We walked in five minutes later and were told there was a 20 minute wait. Five minutes later we were told there was a mistake and the wait would be 45 minutes. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  When we protested we were told there was nothing that could be done because other people came in before we arrived."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? 
Let's start off with the dirty table, the menus were sticky and the table hadn't been wiped down before we were seated. 
This place was empty, how was there 0 time to clean? 
Next, my beer glass was DIRTY, and it tasted flat. I paid $6 for it and didn't even drink it. 
The only thing that was good was the queso dip, should have just ordered that and left. 
I know TGI Fridays isn't a high class joint but I expect it to at least be clean! 
I also expect service where I'm not ignored! 
Hire new staff that cleans and takes care of their customers.

Don't ever go here, ever. 
McDonald's would be better than this."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night for my birthday ! The staff was excellent the food and service was great!!! My server Lee went above and beyond to make sure I had a happy birthday!! Great dinner experience"}
{"text":"We went to TGIFriday and ordered the Ribeye and Shrimp with Broccoli.  The steak was medium rare as ordered and tough as leather unfortunately.  The shrimp tasted like it was fried in ancient grease.  The broccoli was oily and bland.  Ketchup did not help anything and even the salt was bad.  The food left a terrible and lingering taste that required a stop at a Smith's grocery store for gum.

My rating is zero stars but Yelp requires at least one star, which sucks. 

#NeverAgain"}
{"text":"What a run down hole....Sat at the bar which was disgusting btw..smelled like damp bar rag all around.  I swear, I think every glass and dish I ordered was dirty....and lets not get started on the scene at this place...Yea...better pack your bulletproof vest next time.  I thought I was going to get shot at one point.....At least the service at the bar was decent...thats about it."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I used to wait tables when I was younger and I know that things get busy but the restaurant was not busy and our waitress moved at a snails pace. It took her forever to greet us and forever to pay the bill. I will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"Erica the bartender is outstanding.... Otherwise I would not have given ANY stars at all.  The potato skins were pathetic.   I posted a picture of them on FB too bad the picture is on the Sarah FB page because Sunset doesn't have one.  Makes me wonder why they don't.  I also posted a pic of the Fridays Frozen Potato skins which LOOKED ahellofalot more appetizing than the ones we were served.  We also ordered the Triple Stack Ruben without caramelized onions (which just don't belong on a Ruben).  I opened the sandwich that had all of a total of 4 small specs of sauerkraut.  I immediately asked for a side of sauerkraut and the side came COLD as ice.  The corned beef was like lunch-meat and with 3 pieces of bread, there was only one slice of Swiss cheese.  Completely disappointing."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly. Our go to spot if we can't decide on dinner in the area. Have been here multiple times for happy hour, endless apps and many other promos and got our orders in a reasonable amount of time. 
Not sure what everyone is complaining about with wait times, terrible good or rude servers. 
We've come with just two of us to at least 5 and seemed to be no difference in quality of anything."}
{"text":"Our family went to this TGI Friday's to celebrate my wife's birthday and we will never go back. The service was slow, inattentive and incompetent. Drink orders took forever, and no plates were brought with a shared app (which is not endless because seconds were never offered like the menu indicated). The worst part was that my wife's entree arrived cold...and was not prepared properly on the second attempt. They only offered her a free sundae to make up for it, but they had already offered her a sundae for her birthday before dinner! There are many great choices in the immediate area. This restaurant is a huge disappointment.  Nothing like the ads!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure,but I'm pretty sure this is an alternative lifestyle Fridays. Last time I was in this establishment there was a 50 something transsexual  sitting next to me, and this time I've got a dude with make up on my right and a flamboyant homosexual couple to my left. I thought I was coming for half price appetizers,  but it looks like there is something else going on here."}
{"text":"Love the server she was excellent. The place was expensive for what you get in comparison to other places and the meals themselves came out average."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Took 20 mins for someone to even great us, and it wasn't even our 'server'. Manager came over and apologized, yet never offered anything for the delay, no appetizer, nothing. Took another 10 mins to get drinks. Asked for side of lemons with waters, server forgot. Took another 10 mins to bring those over. Now been waiting for our food for another 30+ mins for burgers.  This place is pretty terrible...and that's coming from a me, a server for many years. Not exceptable."}
{"text":"Good food and great service on a super busy night. Salmon was amazingly moist and flavorful. Endless appetizers were all good."}
{"text":"Went to dinner took server 12mins just to greet our table. I had to ask what drinks were good at bar. Order our food. Asked for jack Daniel flat iron steak and was brought a different steak which I order med well.server (GONZOLO) took steak back and brought it bak in least then 2 minutes.I specifically asked if it was same steak.which it was! Just took off garlic butter and they added jack daniel sauce,Vegetables were rock hard and didn't taste washed.We also Ordered other entrees. Which were horrible as well! Server never check back on us.I had to ask a host to speak 2 manager.manager (Nora) came right over. she try to accommodate us but by this point ..not worth even explaining. We paided for drinks and left!"}
{"text":"My family and I had been seated and we waited for 15 minutes for someone to take our orders. No one even offered us a drink. My dad had called for someone to take our order but none of the servers gave us any recognition. We then walked out and no one even noticed. They obviously do not no how to serve their customers."}
{"text":"Came to this location to grab a bite to eat with family before the Lady GAGA concert at the Paint Can. Table had visible drink ring stains. Had to tell the waitress no less the 3 times to bring my Dad a class of ice for his Labatt Blue 20oz Can. Also we were overcharged for a substitute side item, were told it it would be a $1.50 up-charge, instead we got French fries AND the side we had substituted them for and was charged the full price for the substituted item, and we did not get the special sauce at all not on the side. First time at this location and probably won't return if ever in town again."}
{"text":"The service and food was good. The menu items and taste of food were consistent with other TGIF."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised to see that this location didn't have a good rating. After looking at some reviews, I realized most were older (only 1 being in 2013)

We didn't have a bad experience at this TGI Fridays. We were greeted promptly by the host as well as the manager. The manager seated us. Bobby ended up knowing the host and stayed back and chatted with him for a second. 

Our server was Dominic (although for some reason Daniel is also sticking in my head. I was recovering from a cold & filled with medicine so I can't remember) We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer. It was tasty. The chips had a refreshing lime taste to them.

Each day of the week, TGI's has specials. On Thursday, it happened to be \"$3 Thursday\". Select margaritas (regular, strawberry or \"skinny blackberry\") as well as select appetizers were $3. Their daily deals seemed great. I also noticed entrees for around $10 on a certain day.. although I can pinpoint which day, sorry! Bobby ordered the regular margarita on the rocks and I ordered the strawberry. Our server mentioned mine came frozen, but he would gladly put the order in as on the rocks and actually recommended it that way. They were tasty!! 

I ordered the sizzling chicken & shrimp entree. The chicken was tasty & laid in onions, red peppers & possibly a cheese sauce(not sure?) and the shrimp had a nice, little spice to them (to my taste buds, but i'm a weakling) It came with mashed potatoes which were extremely creamy & seasoned well. You can't always find tasty mashed potatoes!

We left satisfied, except for the fact that we are making a daily habit of eating out- lol but that's our own problem, not TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"I've went once but never went back. Nothing really stuck out to me and the portions didn't fill me up. I'm a pretty small girl & was super hungry that night. I had to order a $6 brownie sundae (to share with my date) after to fill myself up -.-"}
{"text":"Service was great on a Saturday afternoon with three adults and eleven  high school students.   They quickly arranged tables to seat us together,  gave us two servers, and accurately fulfilled our orders. The food was \"TGI Fridays quality,\" which is fine, but it certainly is not 5 star quality.  There is nothing to really add about the food.   But,  what stands out to me was the restaurant's ability to provide the appropriate seating, staffing, and handle our orders.   4 Stars for the great service!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place sucks. Don't get me wrong TGIFs is amazing. But this one omg i waited so long for my order second my fries tasted like they sat all day. I asked for fresh ones and got the same batch back . I ordered first and my whole party got there food before me. Waiting and waiting my food finally got here and shit was all wrong  NEVER AGAIN HERE"}
{"text":"Nearly empty but slow service cold food.  Had to beg for ice tea or soda refills. Bad value for the money.  Will NOT be back"}
{"text":"After 2-3 chances, this restaurant has earned its one star. I think this has got to have one of the slowest service I've ever encountered! Forgetting little requests, not one refill, taking forever for the bill & just plain checking up on the table. Do they have staff meetings while they're open? In addition, the food is not fresh tasting or appealing. Their spinach artichoke dip frozen dinner from Smith's is better. Makes me wonder how they keep their location in the Orleans?"}
{"text":"I had a rough week at work and all I wanted was a steak. I remember having a great steak here before so naturally I went back. Never again! It took 10 minutes for water. When it came we were ready to order. 30 minutes later the medium steak I ordered was well done. Asked to take it back for a pink medium steak and I ate my 2 sides.  15 minutes later I cut into a steak that was so red and bleeding all over my plate. Gross! Didn't eat any steak and asked to have them take it off my bill. Over an hour for food that I didn't even get to eat. What happened to this place?"}
{"text":"Service was surprisingly average at best, which was a shock since it was a Sunday mid afternoon. Food is average chain restaurant....nothing great and yet nothing below average."}
{"text":"$12 for an appetizer is understandable, although still high for a chain store. This is the Jack Daniels chicken Sesame Jack Chicken Strips. $12 for this measly portion is truly outrageous. 
The food was good but not that good."}
{"text":"I love it. Food was good people was nice. Everything was  Awesome thank you tgi ot was a good family dinner"}
{"text":"We needed a power breakfast before we went on a zombie hunt at Adventure Combat Ops around the corner.

I have eaten at plenty of TGIFs in my day but this one is just off a bit. While the food was decent, it just reeks of \"Vegas Cheese\" factor. Eating while listening to the sound of people donating money to their casino is just unsettling. I usually like the food at TGIF but this particular location tastes more like Denny's food. The bathroom was not in the restaurant. NO - they want you to walk through the casino in order to go to the bathroom - in the off chance they might lure you into gambling, err donating money to their casino. LAME."}
{"text":"I ordered BBQ ribs. They were not as tender as I would have preferred, but the sauce tasted OK. The house salad and the side of mashed potatoes tasted good. The waitress was attentive and polite and brought us drink refills."}
{"text":"Tonight I made a reservation for two through OpenTable for 7:15 PM. We showed up, I mentioned that I had a reservation, and we were seated at a table. No one ever came by to take our order, although several employees walked past our table several times. At 7:35 PM, an employee walked up to us and asked if we ordered quesadillas. We still had our menus on the table and had not yet ordered! We told her, and she walked away without a care. At 7:45 PM--after a half-hour wait--we walked to the exit. Two employees were standing at the hostess booth and started to say goodnight. We told them that no one ever took our order! We will never go to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Food is good, and the happy hour appetizers are unbeatable at $6 each! Our server was super nice and food was fast. Only negative is the parking...have to park inside Sam's Town casino parking in order to get to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! First drink was too strong second one had no liquor in it. Never brought our appetizer out."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. Been there three times and twice haven't gotten a server after sitting for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Haven't been to TGIFridays for years and was never really a huge fan. I get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Let me just cut to the chase. TGI Fridays in The Orleans hotel needs a restaurant rescue. My wife's steak and lobster were served cold. Mine was lukewarm.she ordered her steak rare but since the food was cold, she sent it back for reheat. Well now the steak was medium and we asked to speak to a manager. She came to our table after 15 min. My wife explained the situation and before she could finish, the manager took her plate and as she was walking away, says \" I'll take it off the bill\". She never offered to replace it or ask my wife if she wanted something else. Needless to say, my wife didn't eat. To make matters worse, the manager never communicated to our waiter the result of her actions so we sat there for 15min waiting for a check, a resolution or anything. He finally came over and asked if the manager had talked to us yet. Really? Wow. No communication amongst the staff. Stay away."}
{"text":"This location was top notch with service and food. I came here after having a bad experience at another location and it was like night and day. I will definitely come back to this location for great food and service."}
{"text":"In hopes that TGI's would bring a little more to the table then what Sam's Town puts out...wishful thinking. I would much rather head out to the food-court, order a Big Mac and watch that howling wolf, then to spend $30 at this place again. 

I have generously given them an extra star due to the \"major crisis\" our server claimed they were experiencing during our visit. Needless to say, it took a good while to get menus, and twice as long to get drink orders in. 

We ordered Buffalo Wings from their Happy Hour. Wings were cold and had an odd flavor. The fries came later when we were almost finished eating our Wings. They were SO salty, we ended leaving the entire basket. Our Mozzarella sticks were delicious, and earned a whole whoopin star for great taste and freshness!! Cheese was fresh and stringy, just like a cheese stick should look. 

Other than our cheese sticks, everything about this location was below average."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple locations in the Las Vegas area and this location didn't seem as busy as others. Bar was pretty empty for a Friday night. We were a party of 20-waitress had a hard time keeping up with checking to make sure we didn't need anything, nonetheless, waitress was very polite. 

Food was ok. Nothing to brag about. I had the Chicken Cajun Pasta and it was a bit too spicy for my liking. Place is alright. Just TGI."}
{"text":"I won't return. The place was out of control. Not a sign of management. The waitress was cool (Tanea). She was available and attentive. This place needs a severe cleaning job from top to bottom. I refused to finish my water in fear of having to use the bathroom; of course assuming the bathroom would be in worse condition than the dining area. Dust everywhere. Tables weren't clean. The gentlemen at the front in the host position were terribly unprofessional. I'm glad everyone is able to do positive things and maintain a position of employment. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone visiting this establishment if they care about the environment they choose to have their meals."}
{"text":"Decided to come for lunch with my mom, sister, and a friend because we heard about the 10$ endless appetizers. We didn't see anything about the endless appetizers on the menu so we asked the waiter about them only to find out we couldn't share the appetizers. You can only get one appetizer too. So that was pretty upsetting, we ordered strawberry lemonades and the entire cup was ice so we finished the lemonade in maybe 2 sips (yes, sips!) so when we went to ask for a refill we were beyond shocked when the waiter informed us that it would cost 50 cents per refill. As if the experience couldn't get any worse we were looking around at props and the were beyond filthy; looks like the place hadn't been dusted in ages. A 60$ check is what we paid for poor service and horrible lunch to say the least. It made me question why these restaurants were still around. I will stick to Chilis (they rarely disappoint). And honestly I would go to Applebee's over TGI; and that says a lot being I don't like Applebee's much."}
{"text":"This place sucked ...hands down - service was sub par - I was with a group of about 8 and were were the only ones in there - took forever to get seating, forever to get a drink order then actually receive the correct drinks (ice tea shouldn't be that hard to figure out) 

Food arrived cold - I mean really, we are the only group in here on a Friday night - its dead...and the mashed potatoes came out cold - better turn on the heating lamp a little higher that is over that giant 50 gallon pot these probably came out of... 

Overall very disappointed for this TGIF"}
{"text":"Its a great Fridays fast service Cassidy was awesome ! Enjoyed our meal . being a rewards member helps . Will be coming back !"}
{"text":"I had the best customer service of my life with Cynthia! Not only did she handle our party of 7, but she serviced other tables as well without missing a beat. She made the birthday girl feel amazing, she got us appetizers for joining the club, she brought out our food with sauce samples, and she made sure we always had drinks ...even offered me a cup to go. Love that!!!!  I wish more people went above and beyond like Cynthia does. She made my day!"}
{"text":"wow... that was nasty. I had a charter of a bunch of prom kids that wanted to go there. so i was thanking that I would just grab some dinner why I was there. Lets just say I should have stayed in the limo. the food really SUCKSSSS. the ice tea had some thing floating in it. Nasty Nasty.."}
{"text":"Went to TGIFridays inside the Gold Coast.  Our server Chris was awesome! Very friendly and made good recommendations.  I ordered a Blue Moon, which they have on draft!  We ordered the potato skins for an appetizer, came out quickly and they were good.  I ordered the spicy beer cheese burger and the hubby ordered the nacho burger.  My burger had fresh jalapenos, fried jalapenos, beer cheese sauce, guacamole and lettuce and tomato....OMG delicious,  juicy, messy, and yes SPICY.  It was OH SO GOOD!  My hubby liked his burger almost as much as I was gushing about mine.  No complaints here!  Great service, yummy food and drink!"}
{"text":"We showed up for lunch on a Saturday. We knew something was going on when the hostess was not only seating people but also cleaning tables. Service was poor; we had to ask for condiments a few times before they were brought to the table. The food was mediocre. We're not sure if this is how this particular establishment operates normally, but most likely, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I decided to check out TGI Friday's since I have not been there in years... Went to the one on Sahara with a friend of mine and it was one of the most interesting experiences... The waitress Teresa was excellent... But it took long for your food to come to your table... By the time your food gets to the table you would have lost a couple years of your life and you'll be afraid to ask for dessert because it might take a millennium. If you have a few years to waste come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was longest time i ever waited  to eat! A hour n half!! n its after hours. Its barely people  inside  the restaurant... plus i lost half of my guest  thoughout the wait. And to top it off this is is my first  time eating  here....  im so sad about it ...first meal of my vaccination... never again..."}
{"text":"We have been staying at the Gold Coast Hotel/Casino a lot over the last few years and you can't miss the TGI Fridays on the way to the elevators. 

A couple of years ago, the service was not that good and I stayed away for a while. But, over the last few visits, I have come back to test the waters and it seems to have improved. I think the underlying problem is an inability to have enough people working at this location. I can't imagine the logistics behind running a chain restaurant in a Vegas hotel, but there never seems to be enough people working here at one time. We have gone in for a drink and a snack when there weren't many people in the place, and then crowds of people from the hotel would come in and the staff had a hard time keeping up. 

We had great bartenders this last time and the food we had was pretty good. They pour a good drink here (not a shock for a bar in Vegas), and we were pretty happy with the food. Like I said, I think more wait staff is the key. 

It's open 24/7, so that is VERY convenient when you are staying here."}
{"text":"After going here a little over a week ago with family to blow off a gift card we had, I can satisfactorily say that it was better than the very low bar I had set for it.  The service was great and on top of all of our needs - always very pleasant despite the fact that the entire front of house seemed like it was staffed by teenagers at the local high school.

The food was to be expected - microwaved and heavily sauced - exactly as I had expected out of a chain.  I'm also surprised that the Jack Daniels specialties are still continuing.  Hasn't this promotion been in place for 20+ years now?

I will stop by again if I am in the area to see a movie and if I have a gift card or coupon needs to be used up, but for no other reason.  Crocker Park has far better choices available for either sit-down or fast casual options.  When the next round of construction completes, I wouldn't be surprised if this part of Crocker Park complex is looked at for a demolishing/rebuild.  When that happens, I look forward to saying goodbye to Friday."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service was good.  It wasn't great, but it was good.  Staff here is very pleasant and polite.  They don't know their product 100% though.  As I asked what was in the rice pilaf, and was told, \"I don't know.  I think it has vegetables, maybe.\"  There was no offer to go and check and I didn't want to make a fuss over it, but some people have food allergies so it might be good to know what's in the food you are serving.  My husband and I came here because I was in the mood for something Jack Daniels, otherwise we normally avoid Fridays, and I will tell you why.

1.  The menu.  It has changed over the years.  Some items are updated and some are classics.  But somethings need to be added, like a few more chicken options that aren't paired off with pasta or chicken fingers.  Also I would have loved to have Jack Daniels chicken if I didn't know it would have been just a small piece of chicken.

2.  The food.  It wasn't that good.  It was ok at best.  I ordered a steak medium well.  This means slight pink in the center at the majority of restaurants you go to.  Here it means your middle is red.  One end is completely over cooked while the other is slight pink.  I was really confused how this happened.  But it was red dead center, over done on one end and pink on the other.  I really didn't feel like complaining but I think they should know how to cook food evenly.  They also had a tomato and mozzarella salad.  It was horrible.  I thought this would be a light side.  It was heavy and the tomatoes were sitting in some liquid made of juice from the tomatoes and run off from the cheese and oil.  It made it slimy but thick.  

Will I come back?  Not willingly."}
{"text":"Started coming here regularly do to the fact that it's open late. Not bad food and great bartender. Manager is the problem of this place. I have worked in the service industry for years, and I have never encounter someone as disrespectful as him. I have even gone to this place twice daily. You would think he would want to keep loyal customers coming, but I guess it shouldn't be a surprise why this place has such low rating."}
{"text":"By *any* means, \"country gravy\" implies sausage in the gravy. Otherwise, it's just \"gravy\". Recognize, tgi. However, the late night barfolk are ****AWESOME!***"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been to Fridays and it will be a while till I come back. The menu sounds better than it is. Everything seems way over seasoned. Maybe it's to encourage drink orders. Look at their website. Most entrees contain more than the daily recommendation for Sodium content, sometimes nearly twice. Not healthy. At this location the food seemed anything but fresh. Food came out slow, but our server was attentive. Portion size was small for the price.   Selection of beer was no better than my local grocery store.  This chain tries to look like a neighborhood bar and grill. I guess I am lucky to live by neighborhood establishments that do a far better job."}
{"text":"This place is trash. Got endless apps and most of my cheese sticks had no cheese and a bunch of my wings had no bbq sauce on it. Plus this waitress bitch with braces wouldn't quit spitting everytime she talked. Very bad service as well. Would not recommend at all to come to this t.g.i.f."}
{"text":"The mudslide was pretty descent, however; everything else was SO dry and disappointing I was bummed I chose this location and food chain for a farewell fatty meal."}
{"text":"Took steak back 3 times and still claim this is medium.  Terrible management and horrific service.. just awful!"}
{"text":"My boys are home from college so my family decided to go to TGIF on May 19 2017. As soon as we walked in and told the girl at the front party of 7, she gave me this look like are you serious right now? She continued to stare at me in what seems like she was wanting us to turn around and leave. She never said we will call you as soon as we have something available or anything of that sort. She continued to express to me how they don't have any tables open right now and they won't have anything any time soon. The other girl working the front with her realized how bad this co worker of hers was and tried everything she could to get us seated asap. When we finally got seated we could hear from the dinning area the employees arguing in the back of the podium where they input customer orders. They were cussing like no one was in the restaurant and arguing with the supervisor on duty. This cussing and yelling went on throughout our whole time there, even heard it from those in the kitchen. I heard the supervisor telling the waitress he couldn't fire her but he could suspend her but that wasn't enough to make it stop. This place is definitely not what it used to be. The staff there seemed to forget what customer service is all about. The way they argued and cussed and the way we were greeted when we walked in we're all very unacceptable. This was about 9-9:30pm 5/19/17"}
{"text":"Was in last Sunday and unfortunately, we were not impressed.  Sat in the bar area during Happy Hour and it was dead.  Not too happy.

Service - Server took our order and it took 10 minutes to get our drinks. I could have stepped up to the bar and gotten it faster. Then my wife asked for lemons and she walked by our table at least 5 times before she remembered to get them.

Food - Had a burger and a steak.  Not hard stuff, but the steak was generic and the burger was ok.

Restaurant - Its a chain restaurant, but it seems to be in need of a deep cleaning. Tables and seats felt like they were cleaned with a dirty sticky rag.

Overall, it will be quite a while before we head back to TGI Fridays. Too many other good places in Vegas better worth our dollar."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with two of my best buds. We walked in at 7:00 p.m. and we were seated by 7:15, not bad considering the place was an absolute zoo and there were eight tables ahead of us.

All three of us had the $12 unlimited appetizers, which we all thought was a pretty good deal. Joselynn was our waitress, and considering how busy the place was, she did all right. She was definitely slow taking our dirty plates away and refilling our drinks, but I can't fault her tonight. Literally, every seat in the restaurant was full.

I had three appetizers. First, I ordered the potato skins. They were bad. They were burnt, cold, tasteless, way too greasy, and colorless. The serving size was good, however. I think there were eight skins. Next, I had mozzarella sticks. Again, they were greasy, but they were massive and tasteful, and they came with a parsley and shredded cheese garnish. The third appetizer I had was the PB&J chicken wings, which were absolutely awful. I had one bite, tasted dirt and spice, and let the rest of the plate sit.

Between the three of us at the table, we had every appetizer as part of the unlimited $12 deal, except for the spinach dip. Friend number one had the green bean fries, the BBQ chicken flatbread, and BBQ wings. Friend number two had the sriracha beef, mozzarella sticks, BBQ wings, and chicken flatbread. 

On the whole, the food served wasn't hot; it ranged between cold and lukewarm. Partway during our stay, the kitchen ran out of cups so we sat for about 30 minutes without drinks. Also, they don't have raspberry or sweet tea. Overall, service was good for how busy it was at 7:00 on a Friday night (we all tipped 22%+). The food was ok (I assume it would be better if the restaurant was less busy). There needs to be music in the background; all we could hear was just stagnant noise. The bathrooms were also disgusting.

We will likely return to Friday's; we all got $12 worth, but we'll avoid going out on a Friday. If I had spent $20 for tonight, I would've only awarded two stars."}
{"text":"Man I love Friday's so this one hurts. Ate here three times during the week. Trip 1: everything was fine until a large party came in. Our server was overwhelmed by trying to hold down all the tables. I blame it on under staffing. Trip 2: happy hour on Weds evening. The server only had 2 tables but struggled to keep up with drinks and getting things out in a timely manner. The restaurant was not busy so I'm not sure what was up. Then a group of locals showed up and we got even less attention. Trip 3: Thanksgiving Day 11 am. Not busy at all but it was a disaster. Forgot our appetizer even though he had us sign up for it. Forgot the soup we ordered. Offered us an order of chips and salsa after the table next to us turned it down. This waiter was completely out of it. Told us he had talked about all his mistakes and that we would receive a discount. Our discount? He took the $2 soup off the bill. Thanks guy! At that point I was done. I can see why this chain is suffering. All the locations in San Diego are almost gone...Vegas is probably next. It's too bad. I really love the food. I wish a manager would contact me and convince me to be the loyal customer I've been for over 25 years."}
{"text":"Today, my family and I had breakfast at TGI Fridays. Our server was friendly, although forgetful at times. For drinks, our party ordered an Orange Juice, Grapefruit Juice, Coffee, and Hot Tea. For breakfast entrees, I'd recommend the Traditional Omelette (with cheddar cheese and mushroom), Two Large Grade AA Eggs, and Western Omelette (with spinach, mushroom, and cheddar cheese). Each of these entrees, came with hash brown, toast, and jelly. I don't recommend the giant ham steak as it was dry / overcooked and had the texture of cardboard. I'd also recommend the Oatmeal (with Strawberry and a little milk) and Fruit Bowl (which consisted of fresh honeydew, cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple, red grapes, and strawberries)!"}
{"text":"Our server was obviously not in the mindframe to be working in a service capacity, the food was awkward and had an odd taste to it, along with being overpriced. I understand it is a university area, so expectations are to be a bit lower, but we will be finding another place to eat."}
{"text":"Had lunch and later dinner drinks here, lunch was pretty disappointing it was a chicken ceased salad the chicken was dry and over all just decent food. Drinks at happy hour was decent price but service was horrible they where very understaffed and made them quite short and in attentive. Dinner was fine everyones food arrived quickly, I had black bean burger. As far as veggie patties go it was good the burger was supposed to be chipotle and something but was also dry and over all just 'ok'. We where a large party so the waiters weren't particularly friendly but it was fine, I guess on large parties I've come to expect subpar service."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting such a great experience, the duo behind the bar made it so! Ate at the bar though we don't drink alcohol and found that the staff was soooo much happier there than in the rest of the restaurant. They were very attentive and continuously smiling. We will go back just to be waited on by them!"}
{"text":"I was here about two weeks ago, but forgot to write a review. Food was good, loved the peach sangria, but our server was horrible. My friend left our table to go to the bathroom. She passed by our server who was talking sh*t about us to  the other servers. Rude! Never coming back! We still tipped her 20% since we all work in the restaurant industry. I regret doing that, what were we thinking!?"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my room to be ready and noticed Happy Hour was just starting.  Haven't been in a TGI's in about 15 years.  Plenty of seating at the bar that early and I ordered a Bass and the potato skins app.  The potato skins would have been enough for 3-4 people and I pushed down all but one.  They were OK and an excellent value at $6.  Service was all right."}
{"text":"Briana is the best waitress in the literal world!  She needs a raise for putting up with all these drunk people after the badger game.  She was fast and helpful and super nice!!!!"}
{"text":"I am sure you run these promotions (Buy one entrée get one free ) to get people to come to your restaurant....and it worked,  my friend and I went for lunch today.  We were going to order the pick two lunch but our server said coupon not good for that, so we both ordered a larger more expensive lunch with drinks. Lunch was very good that was not the issue and the server was very nice.

Went to pay for our lunch with one my $10 rewards gift cards for buying $100 worth of gift cards before Christmas. Server said you can't use a $10 gift card to pay for your lunch and a coupon. I'm sorry I thought gift cards could be used as cash obviously I will NOT be purchasing any more gift cards from you.

It is really sad because you send coupons all the time and we go out to lunch everyday.  The waitress did not even ask for my rewards number to credit today's lunch.

Not a happy customer!!!!"}
{"text":"If you have anything good to say about this place, your yelp privileges should be revoked on count of Zero taste nor understanding of service. Circumstance and location brought me here tonight, common sense had me leave. Waiting on a bartender's attention on a dead night is a mockery. I'm not high maintenance in the least, simply a fellow with standards, which can serve a good time if i need to and have. These entitled fuckers have no clue nor care. It's Wednesday April 30th 2014 at 12 am. Look at your schedule and show these punks the door TGIF. No Stars! I think I'm getting the hang of this."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Gold Coast for the week, and inside they have TGI Friday, it's not my normal fav place to go, but this one was opened 24/7 and happy hour was frm 4pm to 3am!!!  

I ordered a Cherry Martini, and man that drink was sweet & yummy! And it was a pretty pink with chocolate swirls all around. Shared drinks with frriends, and mingled. If you sit at the opened bar tables by the casino floor, its easy to people watch and that's what we were doing at 3 in the morning, 

Gotta love Vegas, 3 or 4 in the morning seems like normal awake times, going to bed at 7am seems to be perfect bed time, I love the night life!  And TGI Fridays helps you watch it and keeps it alive!"}
{"text":"Very good upscale pub. Fun place also...I've always had good food and service here."}
{"text":"TGI always good menu! The service was good and they have buckets of beer 5 for $10 and $5 margaritas. That is an awesome deal for any casino!!!"}
{"text":"They could def make the bloody Mary's look a little more appealing! I had the breakfast tater skins and they were good. Service in AM was one person but she did a fairly decent job taking care of everyone"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get spinach dip. Great food but a little pricey for some items. The server we had was really nice and on top of his game with refilling our waters and everything."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for dinner with my family. Very bad service by our waiter. He forgot our waters, even after reminding him. He dropped my kid's burger on the floor. He gave us fries instead of loaded baked potato. I'd only give it 1 star, but we got seated promptly & the food was eatible."}
{"text":"This is the least favorite restaurant I've been to in awhile, the food  was cold and not cooked correctly. Also this place is way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you get. 
Would have preferred to have went to the Texas roadhouse next-door, but they close to early. So we resorted to come here, big mistake of the night.  
TGIF is nothing special and way over priced!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience here.  Came here with a work group and the wait from order to delivery of our meals was easily over an hour.  One of our meals had a date dot which shows the freshness of the vegetables that was about the size of a price tag in in it (photo attached). My meal tasted a little like soap and we got a cup which had dishwasher grime that we scrapped off with our fingernail from the inside.  Our waitress was nice and attentive up until our order was in....but it just didn't make u for everything else."}
{"text":"I usually eat at the Fridays on Sahara but tried this one out last night because I was seeing a movie at the Orleans.

I have been here before and usually have a bad experience but this time was different I actually had a good time.

We were sat immediately which is rare on a Saturday night at dinner time. Our server immediately greeted us and brought our drinks out right away. We ordered the Fried Green beans which came out hella fast and were delicious as always. 

I ordered the Jack Daniels Pulled Pork Sandwich which was tasty as always and my son had the kids pizza with fries and he scarfed that down.

Overall this time I had a great experience service was good and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and has only gotten better!!! 

I love this place its awesome!!! 

Ok so when i go here i always always always order there Green Bean Fries there baterd and fried and come with a creamy cucumber wasabi ranch dip there soooooooo delicious i could just go here for this but that's not the only delicious thing there is... after i mmm ooo and awww over my green beans i order there Jack Daniels Chicken OMG this is orgasmic sooo sooo delicious the chicken is tender and the sauce is what makes the dish mmmm had to order xtra sauce bc its so good and it comes with 2 sides i had the baked beans and loaded mashed potatoes. 

This is a place i will always return to Ive never had any complaints food is great and awesome service @ this one on Sahara."}
{"text":"Not bad for a spot I can just cruise in and get a beer at.  Only on one occasion have I not sat on the bar side and it was just like sitting at any other restaurant.  There is a good selection of appetizers in the $6 and cans of PBR for $2 at my disposal.  Plus, they are nice enough to accommodate a large group in the bar... and by large, I'm talking about 25+ people!  Was a little worried about bringing in a group that big but they were nice enough to pull some tables together, sit us in the bar, and serve us in a timely fashion.  Will be back soon.. perhaps on the next Friday?  We shall see haha"}
{"text":"Horrible and slow service... Few food options...Waiters told us we could not make minor modifications to salads... Not going back"}
{"text":"The food was great! Super fast service too! Our waiter, Donne, was a fantastic waiter! He got our food fast, was very kind, and most of all just a very nice man. My little brother basically needed to go to the restroom, keep in mind he is 10 years old, Donne  had offered to leave and take him all the way to the bathroom and back for us. Donne is the definition of a perfect waiter! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The place itself is very nice and clean but the service is so terrible. When we walked in there was no host we waited to be seated and it was not busy at all only about 3 other tables occupied. When we were seated we waited for the waitress for about 10-15 minutes we ordered drinks and that took about another 10-15mins. Once we were ready to order the waitress disappeared to the kitchen it feels as if they don't like to help. They act like if it's an inconvenience to help customers. When we finally ordered our food it was delicious no complaints there. It's my second time at this location and both times the service was bad. Their servers have attitude and they just give you that vibe like they hate their job. Next time I will just order to go."}
{"text":"The manager Chaz, is the worst manager under the sun. He is disrespectful, adds extra to customer's bill, without telling, and then sends the sweetest waitress out to \"inform\" us of random adds. The only reason this gets a star is because of the waitress. Unfortunately we won't be back here. Ps, make sure you ask about any \"hidden\" charges that Chaz may add. ;-) thank you, Gerri for being the best waitress you could be."}
{"text":"This shit hole ... I thought this was going to be quick and delicious since I walked in and it wasn't busy, but boy was I wrong. 

I sat down with my group and after waiting about 10-15 minutes for water we got to place food orders. I had to ask for additional lemon for the table - I'm not sure why they insist on bringing one slice at a time. This was a recurring problem all evening but not the highlight of my night ..

My friend ordered the endless apps and her plates were almost flying out of the kitchen! I was less fortunate having ordered a healthier option, Sizzlin Steak and Spinach, and had to wait pretty long. I ordered my steak medium well and they brought it out very well done so I sent it back. My friend was given 5 plates before they got my order completed in front of me. I finally got my tiny steak on a large plate  once the rest of my party finished eating. 

Another person in my party was very clear with the waitress about not having cheese on her salad. Somehow, the table behind us that sat down about 20 minutes after us got their salads before she got hers. Apparently they had to \"remake the salad.\" I don't get it. It was a side salad, which is probably less than half of the portion they normally bring - it was quite sad. They finally brought it out to her AFTER her entrée arrived - but the waitress failed to mention there was cheese in the mashed potatoes she ordered. I don't understand why she wouldn't inform her of that after she clearly expressed her disdain for cheese. 

We requested to speak with the managers and the worker explained he couldn't find him. He described him to me and told me what he had on and asked me to find him myself, like a game of where's Waldo. 

Lastly, when he finally arrived, the manager actually argued with me over my order. The meal I ordered should have come with mushrooms and onions - which there were none. He told me he checks the orders himself and they were there. BULLSHIT. I asked him how the mushrooms were prepared - sliced or diced - and he said sliced. It's pretty hard to miss slices of mushroom on a plate. I cook and eat food all the time - I know what mushrooms and onions look and taste like. They were not on my plate. 

I will not be coming back here .. EVER. Not even on a Friday."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Friday's in a long time -Came in for a quick Dinner after golf and sat at the Bar....

The Bar was so sticky and flies were flying around all the drinks and around the bar. Bartender was un-attentive and didn't seem to know what was going on. We debated about leaving but thought we'd give it a try since we were just ordering soup, Cesar salad, and the soft pretzel with cheese appetizer.

The soft pretzels with cheese was the best thing we had and was surprising good, The French onion soup was so salty you could barley sip it and the cheese on top was barley melted, The Cesar Salad was very fishy, there about 9 pieces of lettuce, and no bread stick that was listed on the menu...what a bummer! 

Definitely a disappointment and wouldn't recommend eating here- Save your money!"}
{"text":"I have come to this location quite a few times because it is close to my home. We usually have decent service but tonight was absolutely horrible!  8:00 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was not terribly busy. We were seated right away and then we waited...and waited...and nd waited. Finally,  our server \"Sonia\" showed up to take our drink order... 3 strawberry lemonades... for which we were charged $3.49 , $0.49, $3.49 and $0.99. (The kids strawberry lemonade is considered a slushy and is an additional charge which was not stated on the menu nor did our waitress inform us.) We ordered a burger, a pizza kid's meal and an appetizer.  Nearly 30 minutes later our food was served cold! Sonia disappeared for a while after that. We didn't see much of her after that. We asked for the check and she set it on the table and walked away. I let her know we were ready but she continued to walk away, even after she watched me put the money in the folder. There we sat....waiting. .. I finally got up and went to the hostess stand to pay because it was now 9:45 and I had to be somewhere in 15 minutes.  Sonia was nowhere to be found. The two Hostesses went looking for her to close out my check. There we stood waiting...and waiting... I mentioned to the Hostesses about the horrible service and the fact that Sonia kept disappearing. They said, \"Ya, we hear that a lot.\" Really? Then why is she still working there? Then the two Hostesses bad -mouthed each other while I stood there waiting for my change! 
HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! $9 spent on strawberry lemonade that was not even made with actual strawberries,  but a syrup! And the food was cold! 
Never again! They really need to train their staff!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. It will be a long time before I set foot in a Friday's again. Server was simply lousy. With all the other poor reviews why has this place not improved?"}
{"text":"Fist off the service fucking sucks we got seated and waited 20+ minutes  for them to ask us what we want to drink they gave us no napkins and the food took ages I was sitting here so long that when I got up there was spider webs on me what the fuck is this trash I mean the food was good but service horrible never returning again byeeeeereeeeeeeeeeeeee xoxo"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant often because my family could always count on good food and great service. What has happened to this place?? I went in there for dinner and it took over 20 minutes for a simple appetizer, the place was not very clean, and finally after waiting over 45 minutes on 2 salads, I asked for my check and left. There was no real compensation offered by Management for the disappointment and inconvenience. And the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. They weren't even that busy. After reading several other reviews, it appears there are many unhappy customers who will not be returning. I sincerely hope this place can turn it around with being in such a prime location to do great business. Good luck!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come often usually for a late dinner after I get off of work.

We have had quite a few different servers and all gave great customer service.
Busy or Slow, the staff here including the host/hostess are very friendly!

I only had one bad experience with the friendliness of one of the staff members, but it was so minute I cant even remember what she looked like.

we will definately continue being customers!"}
{"text":"Worked in the food industry for 6 years and never told someone to wait 25 to 30 minutes when there are available tables maybe the wait staff or kitchen staff on a Friday night need to be rethought and planned accordingly slow service on a busy Friday is to be expected but being told to wait 30 minutes when there are Open tables is unacceptable"}
{"text":"10 STARS to our server CEAUX. Without his GREAT GREAT service I don't think our experience here would have been better!! I really want to acknowledge this young man because I seen him work so hard on Memorial night. And despite the crazy rush he still kept it together and really gave the best experience to us and I noticed to his other tables as well. He has a great attitude and shook mine and husbands hand! His service was way above the top!!! THANK YOU CEAUX 

So as far as food wise: delicious steak and salmon I had for the first time, I always get sizzling chicken and shrimp which is my favorite but needed to try something new."}
{"text":"I hadn't be to a TGIFridays in ages. The services was fine for a Wednesday night but the food was meh.  I remember it being better. With so many choices down my the mall there are better places to spend your money"}
{"text":"Endless appetizers (boneless chicken n
Spinach artichoke) was the worst !!!!
Chicken taste and look like microwave food and also cold,  spinach artichoke was over cooked. Didn't taste right. Worst appetizers i ever tasted !!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta with no shrimp and additional chicken. To my surprise there were very few pieces of unseasoned chicken that looked liked it was boiled. The Cajun sauce was watered down with no additional seasoning. I'm not sure if this is what's going on at other TGIF's but I refuse to get this again. This was pathetic."}
{"text":"Not the best but it's not bad . Service is a little rough, we ordered the salads and it taste pretty good . Clean venue, and make sure you ask for specials ."}
{"text":"We visited this location for lunch. Entering the location it is very dark. Our service was good but I was not super excited with the food. I ordered the Caesar salad with was fair. Then I had the lunch ship and fries. The portions were kind of small so I left still hungry. They place was a little pricey as well."}
{"text":"Tgi Friday's to me has good, not exactly great food. 

The hostess that took my table's drink order was short & rude. She was so awkward when she came up to my table telling us our server was busy & she'd be taking our drink orders. That was so weird especially since our server came 2 mins after the hostess took our drink orders. Anyway....our server was really nice & very attentive. 

I ordered the Jack Daniel's Mixed Grill with the grilled chicken & half a rack of ribs. I also got a side of the parmesan steak fries & the mac & cheese. I could have on passed both of the sides especially, the mac & cheese. The chicken & ribs were good because of the jack daniel's sauce that I love! 

For dessert, my table got the whiskey cake...oh my goodness, it was good! It's a toffee cake with pecans & it also came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

Overall, I like Tgi Friday's for the Jack Daniel's dishes to me, is their signature for this chain. Tgi Friday's isn't the greatest but, it's good for nights when you just don't know where to eat out at. Better than Applebee's in my book but, that's just me."}
{"text":"After not eating at Fridays for year's we gave it a whirl tonight (Monday night). Entering on a time crunch I said great not alot of folks here. We sat down first at at a dirty table and we ask to move. Next we sat down for at least 5 min with no one ever coming to take our drink orders. All wait staff and hostesses  (if you call these folks that) just standing in groups conversating. I used to love Fridays and talked my wife into going for my birthday dinner. This place is an absolute joke especially with a $12 salad on the menu.... will never go back. Jersey Mikes here we come......."}
{"text":"Took the kids and husband for lunch, dining room was almost empty my husband asked for water for all of us, she brought everyone but me one.  Then took drunk orders but ignored me, I had to ask when she brought everyone else's to get my drink.  All around the service was pretty terrible we agreed the worst we've had probably ever and we do eat out quite frequently, highly doubt we will return to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered to go. I ordered the brand new dish citrus chicken with veggies. I recieved half an order of chicken. The picture says it all"}
{"text":"Super qualité prix pour manger une viande ou un dessert de folie le brownie obsession... Je pourrais y manger tous les jours. L emplacement est sympa quand on a des enfants car à l etage de l hotel il y a des salles de jeux, la carte adulte ou enfant est variée chacun trouvera son compte au TGI"}
{"text":"We dined in at TGIFridays last night with family and I must say , our experience was wonderful from beginning to end . Our server Logan is pretty much a part of the family now ! He welcomed us , gave us his honest opinion on the menu based on our interests and he was on point the entire night . This was our first visit to this particular location but it will not be our last ! I cannot stress enough how awesome Logan was . He went above and beyond to ensure that our experience at the restaurant was like no other . Our food was awesome , we received everything quickly , as ordered and he made sure everyone was satisfied with their food . We will absolutely be sure to have Logan as our server each visit , he's the best ."}
{"text":"Had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at TGI Fridays on Harris Blvd. Bottom line- the manager would not remove a charge from our bill for food they told us was at a discount AND wouldn't remove a charge for food we did NOT get. He also told me that customers were liars and he wouldn't believe that one of his employees would tell us something wrong. So just FYI - if u are a customer here u might want to rethink as you are a liar! Please share so others liars are in the know. 
Now mind you- this manager treated me this way all over $6.00."}
{"text":"We as in my husband and I and two of our teenage kids decided to try the $10 endless appetizers here last night.  Huge mistake!!  We arrived probably by 6pm and sat down in the bar area.  Not to crowded and no wait yet.  Our waitress greeted us and told us about drink specials and my husband and I got a Long Island Iced Tea on special for $4 bucks.  It looked nice but tasted like mixer only.........no alcohol in either.  Waitress took both and returned with new drinks and they were better but still not close to tasting like a traditional LIIT.
  So we settled on ordering the endless apps and ordered the boneless chicken wings, spinach dip with chips and the Spicy Siracha potato skins.  The spinach dip was hot and delish but the chips that came with it were hard like they were stale.  We ordered the hot, bbq and Jack Daniels flavored wings.  The bbq ones were terribly overcooked and hard.  Flavor was good but you may break a tooth!  Jack Daniels ones were better but still not fantastic.  Im assuming the hot ones were good............I didn't try those but our 14 yr old son inhaled them pretty quickly.  The spicy chicken Siracha potato skins were ok but not a lot of flavor.  I was expecting a spicy flavorful bite and they just tasted kind of bland.  They looked good as in presentation but were just ok.
  I gave this place 2 stars mainly because our waitress was nice and knowledgeable about the food/drinks and the spinach dip was warm and good.  If you feel like dropping 50+ dollars on apps and 2 crappy drinks then this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't eat at the big chain food places as in the past they typically have been mediocre at best.  So the reason for the review...TGI-Fridays in the Gold Coast casino was pretty darn good.  The spinach flatbread was pretty tasty, my salad was fresh, the nachos not too shabby and my girlfriend said her chicken was tangy and just the right spiciness.  The service however was great.  I believe her name was Jenn.  Never had an empty water glass or pint of beer.  It was happy hour and the prices we great.  $3.50 20oz beers and $6 appetizers.  Like I said I wouldn't normally hit this place up, but if I am back at the Gold Coast I likely will."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible!!!! Complained twice and the manager never came over. Got pot stickers and they were freezer burned and the wings were hard as a rock. Service was average at best."}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy evening and was asked how many....Told the hostess that we were sitting at the bar for the \"Buy 1 Get 1\" special we had received an Email on. She said to us \"Ohhhhh we don't do that....we're a franchise restaurant and do not partake in those specials\" we turned around and left and have not been back since."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.

Friday's is like the \"fine dining chain\" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...

1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.
2.  I ordered one of their \"skinny margaritas\", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.
3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!
4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.
5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.
6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  

Never again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise..."}
{"text":"Two words: Jack Daniels!!! (Sauce that is!)This is what keeps me coming back , I use it on almost everything.  The menu has been tweaked, and the flavor of the burgers has improved. I like the location, the drinks, and the service. \"Mars\" must be your server!!"}
{"text":"We were supremely disappointed with our experience.  The first thing we noticed upon entering was the smell.  It smelled like someone doused the bar in disinfectant.  Next the menus were torn, dirty, and there were hairs inside.

Unfortunately, we ordered drinks.  They were served promptly.  The beer tasted funny, and as I sat it down, I noticed an insect land on my cocktail napkin.  I was startled and began scanning behind the bar for bugs in bottles.  Here's the really startling part.  A woman with a smartphone walked in and started taking photographs.  I thought that was odd and odder still was when she took out a flashlight and went behind the bar.  She started inspecting each liquor bottle by shining a light up through them, looking for bugs.  ICK!!!!

More unfortunately, we had ordered food.  We ate quickly and left.  The food was uninspired, not well prepared, and appeared to be reheated somehow and rubbery.

We'll NEVER go back!  OH, just so you know, this establishment is in the Alliante Casino, but not a PART of the Alliante Organization."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for our drinks, which where messed up twice. Food wasn't great at all, will not go to this location ever again"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed.  We had just arrived into town, got checked in and wanted to eat and relax.  Everything was dry, over cooked and dried out.  It was not good.  Service was ok, but the food was flavorless and dry.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The Jack Daniel burger was excellent and so was the appetizer. The service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"The Jack Daniels sampler was pretty good.  Had the classic cheese burger----nice and juicy. Service was good.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Not only did it take 2 hours to receive our food from grub hub when we were quoted for 1 hour, but over half of our order was missing. The food that did arrive is not even room temperature, but cold as I'm sure it's been sitting out for much time. When attempting to reach the restaurant, I was placed on hold for 9 minutes then disconnected. I called back and after another 4 minute hold, a rude woman got on the phone stating the driver didn't pick up the entire order. I asked her how old the food was because it was ordered at 6:45pm and it was now 8:45 pm. She said they would not do anything to make it right such as give a refund, remake the food, etc because \"I needed to take it up with grub hub.\" I told her they were just as responsible for not giving the driver ALL of the food. She said her other manager would also tell me they are not responsible. After paying $74 for food and tipping the driver, my two kids are sitting here at 9pm on a school night without dinner as my husband drives 15 minutes one way to go get the remaining food. Mistakes happen, but the attitude and lack of customer service was pretty disgusting. The only helpful, polite person in the situation was the grub hub representative that answered the phone. She deserves 5 stars. She attempted to call the restaurant twice with no success in reaching them. I told her I waited a total of 13 minutes in two different calls just to receive zero help. We will see how old the remaining food is when we receive it. So disappointed. We've never had any issues with this location or a Friday's in general until tonight. I only ever leave good reviews for businesses but considering I gave them an opportunity to fix it and they didn't even attempt to, the most I can do is leave a well deserved 1 star review."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed this time. I ordered for curbside pickup, and it was like pulling teeth to just get someone to take my order as the phone kept ringing and then I had to be transferred. I then arrived a few minutes early and had to sit outside for over 15 minutes before I decided to just get out of my car and go in. There were absolutely no employees watching to see if anyone was waiting. When I went inside, I found my meal had been sitting on the bar for who knows how long. It had to have been awhile because my food was only lukewarm. The onions and peppers on my sizzling chicken seemed old also, and smelled overly strong. Employee who gave me my food seemed bothered by my presence. Overall not a good experience. The last few times I've ordered from here, the food was excellent and the employees were very nice, so I'm not sure what happened."}
{"text":"I just came to eat dinner with my friend. I ordered cherry limeade, chicken and shrimp pasta. Those foods very yummy and good services. The waiter Britt is friendly and she can understand us. My friend he is a deaf and write it down to her. I usually came to restaurant that I was from Everett, WA. WA state doesn't have T.G.I. Friday's anymore. I gave the restaurant a big thumb up. :)"}
{"text":"Great service by Max! You can't beat the steak and lobster deal on Tuesday! I've been to TGIF many times and have never been asked to be a rewards member until this visit. Free chips and salsa as a rewards member!"}
{"text":"I've been to this TGI Friday's a few times but no more.  Our waiter Jon was clearly not trained.  We ordered drinks that never came because he said they were very busy, even though the place was'nt half full.  When he finally brought our wine it was warm.  I had the Jack Daniels salmon and woke up the next morning with food poisoning.  Thanks TGIF"}
{"text":"Last time I ate at a TGI Fridays the food was typical chain mediocre. For some odd reason the breakfast in the airport TGIFs seem to be way better than any other food you can get here at lunch or dinner. 

I had an egg white omelet and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Way better breakfast than I could have gotten at the McD's across the way and at $7.99 with toast and a piece of fruit it's actually a good deal. Surprising for an airport."}
{"text":"This location SUX!!!

Came here for lunch and had just a terrible experience. I asked about the 2 for $10 deal they had been advertising during the summer, and no one knew anything about it. what? Then someone finally found a crumbled piece of paper with that special menu on it that I could barely read. 
I sat at the bar and the bartender had facial seizure and didn't know how to smile at all. He was unfriendly, unattentive, had no idea on any questions I asked about any of the menu items, and never once checked on me or refilled my drink. 

The food was mediocre and bathrooms were not very clean."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I enter and the hostess takes us to a table because there are no booths but it was too cold for me and my bf so she said where ever we would like I sat by the sun for warmth but then I saw a booth became open we moved. In the bathroom its very nice it was messy and very cold also the mechanism sensor of the water flow didn't work very well and the machine where you have to manually take the napkins out. Didn't work so I came out asking for napkins of course they were very apologetic we sat at a booth with Tammie when she came over there were no menus nor was the table clean because we have moved but they quickly set it up . Tammie was amazing had a great smile always and tried to upgrade us but in a casual way where I didn't feel pressure we asked her opinion on dessert and she gave it to us.she asked us for refills and was very on top of her service. Definitely would come back for the service we love TGIF and it's a routine for us .My bf and I have never been to this one and we will be coming back. the only downfall...the bathrooms:( boo"}
{"text":"I have been to many TGI Fridays and it has always just been an ok or bad experience but never my favorite restaurant but this one tops them all, this is the best TGI Fridays I have ever been to and really a great restaurant all around in downtown Pittsburgh.(was there good friday around lunch) The waitress and especially the bartender were fantastic. They are attentive, engaging, friendly and outgoing which seems to be hard to find in this day in age. The food is prepared well and to your satisfaction and really looks like the pictures on the menu. The place is actually very clean from the restrooms to the menus. I was hesitant to go to another TGI Friday's for a meh experience but this one really changed my whole perception."}
{"text":"Not the best TGIFs that I have been too. I have eaten at this location twice while visiting the Ethel M cactus garden. The service is slow, the food is ok. This last visit this past Sunday, the waitress seem irritated that no one of got any of alcoholic drinks. Since I had to drive the other side of town and get family to the airport, drinking was not something I was going to do. The waitress went away in a huff when we decline any alcoholic drinks and most of us ordered water. My cousin got a beer and daughter a Dr. Pepper. The bill came out to a lot with 7 people dining and the waitress got a good tip despite the lackluster service. After we did not order any drinks, the waitress took forever to return for our food order and never bothered to ask if we wanted dessert. Oh well, there are other restaurants to try when we are in the Ethel M neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I enjoy the TGIF'sat Aliante Station. From the lady who seat you to the wait staff, everyone is always on their game. Very friendly. 
They do not hover over you, but are always readily available. They work based on teamwork and help each other out.

If you are looking for a quiet atmosphere, then do not go to TGIF's, it is always loud. To me this is family atmosphere.

On Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, there is a lady named Janet who does amazing balloon art for whoever wants one from children to adults. She does not ask for a tip, but we always give her one. She is quite talented in balloon art. This is a nice benefit especially when you have children in your party. Its keeps them quiet and entertained. This is a nice bonus!

The food is typically always yummy and if you ask the staff they will tell you what is good and just so-so. I had the Caribbean Chicken sandwich the other night and it was yummy. I love the cilantro that was in the burger and the sauce was sweet with some spices. The cilantro Margarita was also yummy, sounded odd, but refreshing. Sweet potato fried were good too. I'm also game to try something new.

My husband had the fish and chips most every time we come, he loves it and the clam chowder. My daughter also does not stray in her choice of food and always has pizza.

The desserts always look so good, but the main meal is always filling, we have no room for dessert.

TGIF'sat Aliante Station is our new favorite place to eat and when my husband and I have a date night, we will stay to play the slots or blackjack."}
{"text":"Great service took a few minutes for waiter to take our drink order so Miguel apologized discounted our meal and thru in a free desert this is awesome customer service.  Plus both of our meals were perfect.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday at 4pm, place was graveyard and seemed dirty. Service mediocre as was the burger, then had a rotten French Fry and lost my appetite. Wanted to try something new, which was a mistake, will never spend my hard earned money here again!!"}
{"text":"Seated us very politely, then proceeded to forget about us.  I finally waived down a host, and told him that I had been there for 20 minutes, and had as yet, not been greeted, nothing..not even waived to.  A server came by, and promptly told me that \"i'm not your regular server, I'm just helping him out\"...hmmm...a disclaimer!  Proceeded to order drinks and food, as we've had plenty of time to decide.  Drinks came, ok.  Food...oh wow...I had ribs and shrimp. The ribs were cold, asked to have them sent back.  Took JUST THE RIBS...I guess so I could eat just the shrimp.  After some time, he comes back with my ribs on a plate, and shoves it next to me without saying a word.  I looked at him, and said \"oh...am I supposed to take them off your plate?\"  He told me to taste them to make sure they were hot.  They were warm, which was an improvement.  For the $70.00 we spent, I feel really cheated. Won't be back EVER!"}
{"text":"TGIF sucks. So why did we come here? Because they had a really good breakfast deal for $3.99.  We had a group of 10 guys. All worn out from a bachelor party. Five of us got there first. We were quickly seated. The next 5 showed up soon after and sat down. 

We sat there for over 5 minutes and no server. The place was dead and there was hardly any customers. Workers were running about. Not one came to serve us. My bud asked a lady for service. With an attitude, she said she'll send someone. We wait....no one comes. 

We get up and leave. I guess the TGIF in LV is the same in LA. Horrible. Go to Ping Pang Pong instead for some decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Our server was Vivian and she was amazing!!! She went out of her way to make sure we were happy. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Call me stupid, I like TGIF. The Sesame Jack Chicken Strips are a great app. and the sauce is killer. My Korean steak tacos were really good as well, loaded with marinated meat. The dessert, Salted Caramel Cake was delicious even though I am not crazy about caramel. TGIF delivers and is as solid as a rock."}
{"text":"When I come here everything is good appetizers, dinner and desert with good service ."}
{"text":"This is the worse Friday's there is out there. Every time we come here the cooks mess something up. Went here last night at that was my final straw. There's was only 7-8 tables occupied as it was still early. We went for the steak and lobster. The server was nice but it's always the cooks that don't give a crap. Ordered a steak with no seasoning and on the flat grill. 45 minutes go by and still no food. How long does it take to cook 3 meals when the place is dead?! They finally bring out out and guess what, there's seasoning on it. Due to having a sensitive stomach seasoning is out of the question. Sent it back are the rest of the meal and another 20 minutes go by and they finally being another steak. Guess what they did, rinsed it off and threw it back on the grill. It was obvious as underneath there was still some seasoning underneath. The steak was now burned not the medium well that was ordered it was well done and burned. When the manager was questioned why there was still seasoning he lied and said there wasn't even thought it was in the juice on the plate and in the napkin that I dabbed it with. 

Also another order was the jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. On the menu it said a full rack of ribs. They brought out a 1/2 rack. I questioned the server and he said they only do 1/2. We were too annoyed at the steak situation but I should have asked for a menu because they charged me for something that I didn't get. See menu photo from their website. What a joke and in the end a waste of more than an hour and a half. Also never bothered to enter my stripes number so I got no credit. Will never return to this place and I live close by. I'll drive to outback or Millers where they know how to cook right and provide better service!"}
{"text":"Sometimes my hubby and I forget why we stopped frequenting T.G.I. Fridays at Sam's Town but it won't happen again. Sunday afternoon we decided to go try out the $14.99 special that's been advertised on t.v. and we were both looking forward to some steak & ribs. When we arrived there were some people by the entrance but no host to be seen. They left and someone finally came by to seat us. We asked to sit in the bar area and he waived us in but didn't follow with the menus he had in his hand so we had to track down some menus ourselves. We sat there watching servers and a manager go about their business without even acknowledging us. Finally the bartender came out to take the order at another table and when the older lady at the table asked his name he replied \"Jake, from State Farm\". No one seemed amused. Anyhow, \"Jake\" passed by our table and grumbled something about bringing over some water. We waited. And waited. Nothing. The manager even looked at us and should have realized we had been sitting there for some time now without water/drinks and probably looking annoyed. But, she didn't take any interest in us either. Needless to say, we walked out and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We often frequent TGI Fridays when staying at a local resort for a quick bite as we pretty much know what to expect-- although they have an extensive menu most items have the typical bar menu flavor & quality. So we tend to stick to the simpler items like the appetizers or an occasion burger or shrimp option. We also normally sit in the bar area as the servers seem much more attentive. 

During our most recent staycation, we stopped in after a movie to grab some appetizers to hold us over until dinner. The server who was doing double-duty as the bartender was very polite and helpful explaining the various options with the appetizers and which qualified for their \"Apps All Around\" promotion. I felt a bit embarrassed for her as she was writing our order on a scrap of paper on the table ... and it stuck to the table. Yuck.  Anyhow, we opted for mozzarella sticks, pan seared pot stickers and some wings. All was as expected. I also ordered the Sriracha Shrimp Roll~ way too much rice but enjoyed the shrimp and dab of guacamole but honestly cannot recommend it. 

For a casual quick bit to eat it's fine... and if you like some creative cocktails they do have an extensive selection."}
{"text":"If i could put 0 stars i would.  Terrible service and the food got me sick. Not the first time either. Go to the ones in tbe gold Coast or the orleans hotel because this place really might poison you. Its Never good yet i give another chance and its always worse than the previous time. And i constantly hear this from others but when I am down that way and I'm hungry Ive given another chance but after tonight,  I took a vow to NEVER EVER EVER go back and neither should anyone else who wants good food and service.   Horrible horrible food and literally made me nauseated and vomiting. Even the water n.soda tasted awkward. Do yourself a favor and NEVER EVER GO HERE ON SAHARA."}
{"text":"We always eat at TGIF at different locations and have NEVER encountered this worse of service anywhere else... the waiter seems inexperienced, our food order took forever to come out, the waiter mentioned the kitchen was backed up, we got our food at different times about 5-minutes apart.. the drinks didn't flow as the waiter wasn't attentive to our table for service. We sat at the table with empty drinks..  When visiting different locations out of state keep in mind not all restaurants including this TGIF don't offer the same promotions! We had 5 people in our group yet we were sat in two tables because the hostess at the front didn't know how to sit us we should have know this was a bad sign!! We don't recommend this TGIF restaurant at all... believe me I've been to many TGIF locations.. never coming back to this one for sure.."}
{"text":"Our server, Jonathan was very nice and encouraged my partner and I to sign up for Friday rewards.... we did and got free delicous chips and salsa and $8 off an appetizer food  came out quick and delicious"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. 

As for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. 

To top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. 

Eating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon"}
{"text":"Last night we ate dinner  here and it was awful!! We ordered  three appetizers  first and they were great, mozzarella  sticks, potato  skins, and jalapeños. Our dinners  were terrible. We had the chicken  strip dinner, smoked stacked burger and the reuben sandwich. All the fries on the meals were cold and way to salty. The bread on the reuben  was soggy. My burger was Luke warm. We will  never eat here again. Don't  waste your  money  eating  here."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of T.G.I. Friday's, but this one missed the mark. Service was poor, and the cook got our orders wrong. When you're paying $25 for each steak meal, you expect it to come the way you ordered it. Instead of cooking the steaks from scratch, they were just sauced and reheated. The sides and dessert were good, but our server forgot our drinks to go with our meal. The place was also pretty dirty. The bus person left water on the table while wiping it, so it was messy. I also noticed the floor and surrounding walls were not clean. Overall, I was very disappointed, since I had looked forward to eating there for my birthday."}
{"text":"My partner & I had a horrible at the TGIF at Rivergate in the Steelecreek area in Charlotte, NC. My partner and I had viewed a special on our phone that TGIF was running. When got to the table the waiter was somewhat familiar with it, but was a little unsure.  We showed him the promotion on the phone which was a meat combo \"2 grill favorites\" and 2 sides. The waiter said ok and took our order. 5-10 mins later the waiter came back and said we can't do that. We had a hard time understanding what was going on from what the waiter was trying to say so we ask for a manager. Daniel came by first said that TGIF ran promotions that were only for carryout. So, we asked \"you mean for us to get this special we have to get our food to go?\" and he said yes....he admitted that it was a dumb and confusing promotion that TGIF ran and then we talked more and Showed him the promotion on our phone....He told us to give him a minute while he went to check on something. He came back and said \"sorry but we don't have a button for that. We used to have that option on the order screen, but it's not on there any longer.\" My partner and I just looked at each other....in disbelief. No button for that....isn't that something you would hear a 16 year old kid at Mcdonald's say? My partner was so aggravated with the situation he wanted to leave but I was starving and I needed to eat. I ordered he did not. Daniel did nothing to help the situation. The answer to this all was \" We don't have a button for that!\" Him being the manager, he could have sold us the dinner that TGIF was promoting on it's site and rang it up however he needed to. We own our own business and realize the importance of making sure a customer doesn't leave with an unhappy experience. This didn't see to bother Daniel at all. TGIF might want to look into retraining some of their staff. Especially, in the wake of poor sales and closing stores."}
{"text":"$10 all you can eat app's. What more is there to say. Service was spot on. Food was fair. I had the Norwegian salmon with lobster. Very, Very good. The filet could have been a little bigger. But was very tasty."}
{"text":"we had a very decent meal here.  We went in around noon, were seated right away in a booth in the bar area.  Our waitress was very sweet, and there was constantly someone serving us, bringing us water, taking away empty plates.  So service was great.  The food was decent to as were the prices.  My bro got some healthy chicken dish, my parents both ordered the California club which came on ciabatta bread, and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders...for appetizers we got an order of nachos and spinach dip.  All the appetizers were half off, as well as my sliders.  Happy hour is all day long i believe!  my sliders were good, as were the rest of the appetizers....I didn't try anything else, oh except for the fries which were good also.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  A corporate joint with decent food.  They're a bit on the pricey side, but the food is better than your typical corporate place.

Service was nothing special.  

I didn't like how loud it was inside.  It made it hard to talk with your party.

I don't typically like to go to these kinds of places because it feels like an even trade.  You pay the price, you get your food.  It fills you, but you're not better for it.  There's nothing here that makes you say wow.

I'm not going to say it was a bad time, and I'm not going to say that I didn't enjoy my evening, but I'd rather be at a place that has a better overall value."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night. He had one of the burgers. I had the ribs. My husband said that the burger was dry and the condiments was on one side making the burger very sloppy. The fries were over cooked. My ribs were perfect. Fall off the bone great. The barbecue sauce was mild. Which is the way I like it. The coleslaw was dry. And my fries were also over cooked. The music was loud and it was hard to hear what my husband was saying. We were there around five pm. The service was ok. We had to ask for extra napkins and wipes for my fingers. This was not our first time there."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, we dropped in here for Breakfast.  That's right, a TGI Friday's that has Breakfast!  Only in Vegas!

I ordered the Skillet Breakfast (Eggs, O'Brien Hashbrowns, Ham, Cheese), $7.99

It was a bit greasy for my taste.  I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but this was a little disappointing.  Maybe I'll give this joint another time...

{"text":"If I could give a minus five stars I would.  This was the absolute worst service I have ever had in any restaurant in my life.. I still can't believe what just happened!  First things first... we sat at our table.  No silverware. Ordered our drinks...first mess up.  Ordered artichoke dip and chips, half the order of chips showed up,  had to ask for more chips. Ordered a second dip... never showed up.  Finally placed our order.  I ordered my meal plus a dinner salad...never got my salad. An hour later the waitress brings us the wrong order.  10 more minutes before she informs us she lost our order... we order again.   She apologized profusely,  promised us a discounted bill and free desserts.  We finally get our dinner and all the vegetables are burnt!  Finish eating and she forgets that we are getting free desserts!  Gives us our bill because the kiosk isn't working...strange, right?  And charges us FULL PRICE!  I'm still in shock!  I can honestly say... I have never been treated so outrageously horrible before... we eat out almost every night... never have I had this bad of an experience.   New management is definitely needed at this restaurant.   If you go here... make sure you're not hungry yet!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Fridays in years! Food was amazing! View was amazing! Emily took really good care of us considering she was really patient on the amount of refills she had to get our table. Would definitely want to go back again!"}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly service
Cons: Slow service, wilted lettuce, waited almost 10 minutes for silverware after food arrived, strong urine smell near bathrooms that you could smell throughout the dining room. Told the hostess and later a manager #nobodycared."}
{"text":"What great happy hour specials they have on food.  

from 3-7pm and 9-1am Monday-Friday and then 11am-5pm and after 9pm on the weekend they have half off on apps.  Their Chicken wings are amazing and really big.  I think you get 10-12 really big wings for like $4.49.  The Rum wings are great as are the bbq.  Miguel and I went there 4 times in two days while he was playing in Lake County.  He kept on wanting to go back.  We tried almost every app on the menu.  By far the best food for the cheapest price I have had with one of my players.  The bartenders were awesome as well.  Nice place and nice atmosphere.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing! Not sure why the low ratings. I was pleased to get such an amazing server Ashley.... Great burger and steak cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Well, the server we had Sunday was wonderful but the other staff that was helping him were horrible. 
They had that poor server working so hard while they just stood around, talking about customers and being  rude to each other. This place needs an overhaul completely with its staff. The manager on duty she seemed to have an attitude and was very nasty to some of the employees. She needs to be removed and placed on wait staff until she learns to how to lead.
It's Tuesday morning and I am yet thinking about our poor server but he did a GREAT job and I appreciated him for all his hard work that day."}
{"text":"Slow.  Cold food that should be hot. Asked for new fries, then they charged for it. Never checked on refills. Also ordered an appetizer,  server (Jorge) didn't remember. Just said 'sorry forgot to put them in'.  They weren't busy, and it wasn't crazy late. Only 10:30 on Wed night."}
{"text":"You know what? In all my 58 years, I've never made or received a phone call that included the words \"want to go eat at TGI Fridays?\". Never ever. That's odd, don't you think?

I haven't been to a TGIF in years. I looked at their menu online today, just wanting something different for a change. I spotted their Skillet Garlic Shrimp, described as \"risotto-style rice topped with tender garlic-marinated shrimp, roasted garlic and a bruschetta mix of diced tomatoes and fresh basil in a creamy roasted Alfredo sauce\". 

So, I hopped in my car and drove the 4 miles for lunch. Two moms and their babies entered just before me, and all of us stood at the hostess desk and waited, waited, waited. The moms finally went up to the bar to tell them no one was around. Eventually a young lady scurried over and told the moms to wait while she set up a table with two high chairs, and eventually a young man walked over and took me to a table. 

Then I had to wait, wait, wait for a server. Mind you, this was at about 1:15 pm, very few customers left from lunch. Also, there was a very stern looking woman standing in the main aisle, complete with clipboard, iPad, arms crossed, watching the few customers like she expected them to steal the silverware. Every now and then she took off at top speed, invariably returning to her post. She had that harsh elementary school principal mien about her that would make kindergarten kids wet their pants for breathing wrong. 

The young man finally took my order, about 15 minutes after walking through the front door. The Skillet Garlic Shrimp was $12.99. It included more whole, un-cut cloves of garlic than shrimp. The flavors were very strong, which left my lips a little numb from the spices, not at all expected by the menu description. What really bothered me is there was NOTHING that came with the meal. No garlic toast, no salad, not so much as a single oyster cracker. The dish was prepared with ingredients that left the skillet just standing in oil. It is not a dish I would want a second time.

As the young man brought the check, the intrusive hovering woman appeared at my tableside with her clipboard and iPad. She introduced herself (you have to picture her demeanor and tone as if she were the person who trained military personnel to waterboard terrorist suspects) as a representative from Pat Henry Research Group. They were conducting research and had a survey that I could either fill out on a piece of paper or on an iPad. In return for my time, I would get a gift card for a free appetizer up to an $8 value to use for my next visit. Well, it's been several years since I've been at this restaurant, and I have no plans to return any time soon, so I declined.

I'm not sure what to make of this visit. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. I thought the meal was overpriced for lunch (the price isn't on the website). I spent $16.58 for the meal and a Coke, paid with a $20 bill, and got 4 dollar bills for change. I guess the guy I assumed I would pay him back in his tip? No interest in returning. I'm surprised this place is very busy, especially next door to the far superior Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had since my days in the military.   Our waitress Danielle was horrible.   We ordered drinks and only recieved one.  Then we got our food, had to wait another 20 minutes for silverware.  I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst Friday's I have ever been at.  First off it wasn't that busy so you would think we would be served quick.  Well, we weren't.  I ordered a soup and burger and my broccoli soup came to me half the bowl.  Next was my burger which I ordered medium rare, it came 20 min later well done.  I mentioned it to my waitress who really didn't care about anything especially trying to rectify the problem.  I do not recommend this location to anyone.  I hope they close."}
{"text":"I called in a to-go order and was placed on hold for 17 minutes.  I hung up and called back. I did not hear a sincere apology and when I asked how long before my order would be ready I was abruptly hung up on.  Arrive at restaurant and they have no To-go parking so you have to park way out.  Then when I went to walk in there were several smokers hanging out by the doors.  You had to hold your breath to walk in.  They have an butt can by the front doors inviting this.  This will be my last visit here and definitely no more to-go orders."}
{"text":"The place was crowded and noisy with a bus load of kids from a religious camp. I ordered the half rack of ribs. The ribs were under-sized and the coleslaw was warm. It was not good. But, the restaurant was busy and I always hesitate to return food to the kitchen. I was also hungry and ate it anyhow. Six hours later I was sick on the floor of the bathroom, weak, cold chills, sweating profusely from every pore in my body and wondering if I should call 911 before I passed out. After several trips to the bathroom, I was able to sleep again, and was weak most of the day but the food poisoning had passed apparently. It was the only meal that I had the entire day that I visited the restaurant.  I went in the location the next afternoon to speak with manager to explain what happened. He was unapologetic, rude and a condescending. He patronizingly said, \"You can do whatever you want\" about situation, as if I needed his permission complain elsewhere. He refused to refund to my credit card for the meal which only would have helped slightly because I would rather have not endured the ordeal. The only thing that visibly got his attention was the phrase \"social media\". I would never return to a Fridays and I would advise others to do the same."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst experience at a TGIFriday's I have ever had. Although the service was decent,  the food was mediocre  and the restaurant were a mess.  Our server was truly a sweet heart and at no fault of her own, the food was really bad.  My steak was tough(I should have known better) and the lobster(again, I should have known better), tasted like last years leftovers.   The restroom was a war zone, and the paper towel dispensers were broken.   This is not what you expect from a TGIFriday."}
{"text":"In town for a concert, hubby and I decided to stop in to grab dessert and watch MNF. We were seated quickly, but it was at least 10 minutes before a server came to take our drink orders. After that, another 5+ minutes before a different server arrived to take our food order. Also, the floors were in desperate need of sweeping. Once we got our food it was decent. No complaints on the brownie a la mode."}
{"text":"This was located in the depressing casino
Known as the Gold Coast. 

We started off in the lounge as it was Happy Hour. Well it was not so happy anymore after I was ID'd and had left it at my hotel. 

After my husband ran back to get it from the hotel, he too got ID'd. This was annoying and led us to eating in the dining room. 

The Happy Hour menu was appy's for 6$ so we ordered chicken wings ( very fatty and not well cooked ) potato skins ( too much potato not enough crispy skin ) blue cheese dressing on the side that never materialized, BBQ chicken flatbread ( BBQ sauce was way too sweet and I couldn't eat it ) 

Lucky I had started off with a mudslide drink that was so delicious and filling it more or less was my meal ( although I got over charged by 3$ and had to bring it to
The waitresses attention) it was the best thing about the entire thing."}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes for our salads and the restaurant was mostly empty of customers. Service is slow"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! We waited 26 minutes for our drinks and we were sitting IN the bar!!! 22 minutes for water!!! Really? 45 for our appetizers!  Manager walked the tables and skipped us 3 times. Wth was going on????? Obviously do not  need out patronige."}
{"text":"Real good food. Yummy frozen drinks. Red Velvet cake is totally delicious! 
It's obviously not fine dining. In fact, I get my food to go."}
{"text":"Our Server Lance was great, friendly, courteous, and genuine.  The food was great and, the company was even better."}
{"text":"Typical chain Fridays with inexperienced servers. 

I sat outside, but it was clear they neglect this area because the tables were dirty and the area unkept. Dull area with no life or action.

I ordered a mango lemonade alcohol beverage and they brought it in a shaker and never poured it.

I asked for cocktail sauce and they brought a weird pink sauce with white in it. I guess they didn't have actual cocktail sauce here so they mixed some concoction...... I def didn't eat it.

Jack Daniels trio Meat was dry and dull as expected.

Now the best part... My server never brought water or napkins. He also didn't bring the wet nap they bring for ribs. He didn't want to clean my table so he asked me to gather all the trash and put it on my plate....WTF? I don't work here you do. I ignored him and he sighed and picked up the napkins like they were the \"plague\".....His service was reflected in his tip...."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but quality of food was below average. Bourbon Mahi Mahi was very dry. Looked nothing like the picture. Had to continuously hunt down the waitress to get refills. My friend paid $8 for a half a sandwich. That was smaller than the length of my iPhone. One piece of turkey and one tomato. Smh. His New England clam chowder was under cooked. His potatoes were like undercooked. Not a good experience at all"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the service here. I went for a quick lunch on the Tuesday before Christmas and ordered  a draft beer and a burger. It took forever for the beer to come, even after I managed to intercept the server to ask about it. When it finally showed up it was flat, and I went through the process again to get a bottle instead, thinking they couldn't screw that up. Meanwhile, I could see the bartender practicing his bottle-flipping moves -and he wasn't very good at that either. The place was nearly empty but the server was usually nowhere to be seen. When the burger finally came, it was fine I guess, but I was too pissed off to enjoy it. I had to flag down caught the manager to get my check. Then I had to get her again to charge the meal to my room - they needed to use a different check for that, and no one asked me how I wanted to pay. The place was not very well run and seemed indifferent to the customers. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I went from saying \"Thank god it's Friday\" to saying \"this is the worst diarrhea I've ever had\" on Saturday."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. 15 minutes to take a drink order, and after 20 more minutes, nobody has come back. Coffee, water and Ice Tea...really?"}
{"text":"Three visits over the weekend; two breakfast and one late dinner.  $3.99 breakfast hard to beat, as is their marinara."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of TGI Friday in general but this place just hit rock bottom for establishments.  There is no one up front to greet people.  Then when we were approached the lady seemed a little rude and annoyed with us.  We had a party of eight but they have a had written sign that states they segregate  groups larger than 6 people.  Not a pleasant experience at all.  Will not return or recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"God damn I hate this place. I hate all TGI Fridays but this one especially. Service is terrible.

I came in here last night and asked the hostess about happy hour. She didn't have a clue if it was running or not and had to ask someone else. 

I grabbed a booth and nobody ever came over or even said they'll be with us in a minute.

Moved to the bar and had a bright spot with our bartender. She was great. Sadly, it wasn't enough to dig out of a 1* hole.

My Sam Adams was flat as all hell. We ordered some food and I asked the server for horseradish. He never brought it.

How can they mess up this many times in a 30 minute visit?"}
{"text":"Have ordered the hospitality plate for room service before. This time we're rudely sent to hold, and then curtly told by the manager that they won't do it, even though it is on their menu. Told her to go scratch and I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Im starting this review in the bar bc service is that bad !! This is the first time I've called a manager over to the table bc of bad service ... I recognize its the bar area but paying customers are paying customers ... period .... we had to ask for refills several times ... she seemed visibly annoyed when we asked for steak sauce ... We had to call her to our table just to order ... that should of been our first clue as to what we were getting into .. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone ... better bars with Wayyyyyy better servers !!"}
{"text":"It takes 20 min to get service after being seated. And the 15 min more to get an incomplete drink order to your table. Our waitresses hardly stuck around to take our whole order so we didn't get a chance to ask for veggies instead of fries on an order. I ordered the boneless wings with sauce on the side and when my food was delivered I was bathed in sauce. Which wasn't a big deal but the waitress addimately argued that I ordered it that way. So frustrating because you get way better service at the Fridays in Sam's Town... you just have to walk thru a smoky casino to get there. 8 ("}
{"text":"I have only been here twice and that is really two times too many. 

How else can I put this: this chain sucks. Every Friday's on earth is probably the same, uninspired, crap food. And how exactly is a chain supposed to offer inspired food? I don't know. Not the business I am in. But I can tell you this: this entire corporation probably has one inspired person involved with it and it is the guy is CEO, solely on the basis of his annual compensation. He probably won't be caught dead eating here because he knows it sucks. 

The first time I ate here was during the Super Bowl when the Saints were playing someone else. I don't follow other people's sports so I don't care; my friends were paying and we were there because we were seeing Avatar afterwards in the faux-IMAX screen that Regal has. 

The food was alright. All food is better when it is free (this is actually scientifically supported). So I go again with the girlfriend a year or so later. This time I am paying so I realise more clearly how shit this chain is. Cannot remember what I ordered but it probably some kind of package deal 2/20$, or some shit, because I am usually a cheapass. It was a mistake. The food sucked and was not remotely good either for me, in the physical sense with the amount of inordinate sodium that is added to try to make the food close to palatable/tasty, or in the emotional/spiritual sense in that it was not pleasing to have my insides filled with that meal. 

The picture we saw afterwards at Regal was probably shitty as well. 

In regards to the earlier visit during the 'BIG game', there was obviously hardly anyone there, and still the fucking service was slow as shit. The service was slow on the following visit as well. Slow service that culminates in shitty food being brought to you. I was rating it two stars but after remembering how bad it actually was, I am taking her down to what she deserves: ONE. Respect yourself and don't eat here. - E"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!!!! We came from out of town and the location back home is great so we figured why not just eat here. Took 10 minutes for a hostess to even come to her booth... waitress got my order wrong twice and food was still cold. She claimed they were out of chicken nachos but had the chips for our spinach dip and all the ingredients needed for the nachos whenever we ordered quesadilla instead... The place was not busy AT ALL not to mention. Just a horrible experience overall. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!"}
{"text":"First I like to say we checked on yelp first but we thought it was just a bad experience  for that person but I guess we were wrong. I would like to start with the service coming into the place . We sat really quick which was great but we ordered endless  apps and drinks, 1 drank came out than 10 mins later the other drank came out we got the first apps which was potatoe skins they tasted old and reheated we asked for ranch 3 times 20 mins later they came out we asked for water at the beginning  and that came out with the second apps we are still waiting  on last apps another 15 mins of waiting. We asked for a refill on lemonade  and we are still waiting.  this was before the place got packed. The waiters were nice but service  needs to be improved drastically. I understand  the kitchen gets backed up. But this is crazy we have no tgif fridays were I live and if service is going to be like this I know why we don't I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our server Sabrina was completely amazing! I love TGI Friday's and she made our night great because of her upbeat and happy personality! She makes coming here so much fun and we will always be coming back! The food was excellent and the restaurant is very clean! Fun environment and very customer service oriented! Love it here!"}
{"text":"I love the endless apps- but the customer service is seriously lacking. The server had such an attitude"}
{"text":"Food was okay...not the best. The waiter screwed up my boyfriends order of pasta and blamed it on him saying that it was his fault. I don't think he would order a chicken dish if he hates chicken.....Meh."}
{"text":"Happy hour is so cool here I always make my way here after drinking. The Jack Daniels sliders are so good, and last time I got the spicy chicken sliders to they're also good, the Bacon potato wedges where kind of mushy. Prices are for 4  Jack Daniels sliders $6.00, 4 spicy chicken sliders $6.00 I forgot how many bacon wages you get cause  didn't finish those but those or $6.00 also. I Think happy hour starts at 10 till closing  not sure cause it's always late at night when go there and it is only in the bar Area there's also booths there too where you can sit not just at bar. I will be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Was not pleased! They were under staffed an a customer in front of me wanted to seat at the bar but couldn't due to lacking of staff members...I asked for a booth and I was seated at a table. I didn't even waste my time spending any money. I got up and left smh will never go back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. You don't have too many of these restaurants in Ohio anymore, at least not from where I am. The waiter was friendly and made suggestions on the food. The place was quiet when I first arrived for dinner, but quickly started filling up for the dinner hour. Good food and location!!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous of times never had a issues once until today. I came in with me and my son wasn't busy at all waited up at host stand for a good bit the employees were just looking at me not even trying to help at all after waiting a while I left and went to chili's. I didn't appreciate that or the unprofessionalism I experienced. Don't think I'll be returning. Only reason I'm giving two stars Ia because I've never had and issue before."}
{"text":"Services are terrible.  I called at 10:27 pm the host stated they close at midnight but the dining room is close so I asked if I could order to go he stated he did not know and that the kitchen was about to close.  Very weird. But eaten here in the past and their service are terrible!"}
{"text":"Worst fckn experience ever! We went here last week after watching hunger games and this rude ass host (young girl w/ glasses) just literally looked at us for a few seconds and looked away after we asked to seat a group of 6 people...like are you fckn kidding me?! We asked again and mind you, we asked politely. She never acknowledge us after that...she looked miserable w/ her job. I've never been so fckn pissed in my life that this stupid, rude Bitch had to ruin Fridays. My friends and I were so appalled that we decided to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here is great! And, the customer service is top-notch. I say this, even after we had a misunderstanding with the restaurant and the front counter of the Orleans. But.... it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. Allow me to explain, we were given a food comp from The Orleans for $50. This was part of the hotel package that we received. We had put down a cash deposit for our stay... we did not use a credit card for this trip. Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m! So both employees at this point had made mistakes, but the mistakes were each based on the fact that there are not proper procedures in place for when a guest checks in with cash as a deposit, and is receiving a comp. Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out. The restaurant, apologized for the employee calling the room at such a late hour, the restaurant offered us a free dinner for the misunderstanding, and the server actually came to our table personally, and apologized profusely.  The manager on duty was very polite and very accommodating to us. And we were very thankful to him. The Orleans needs to figure out how to set the system in place to something like this does not continue to happen because from what we were told it happens all the time!"}
{"text":"I will never visit this establishment again. My wife went into TGI Fridays to get a to go plate. They gave her the wrong order and when she told the hostess the girl slammed the food down on the counter sucked her teeth rolled her eyes and had a major attitude. I will tell everyone i know to stay away from this place. You will never get my money again!"}
{"text":"A pretty good TGIFridays. We go to lunch here from work every so often and have never had any issues with it. The food is generally really good and the service is pretty good. No complaints. I plan on going back in the future."}
{"text":"They're not bad. The steaks are pretty good. The staff is usually good. I've had a few problems, but not enough to hate the place. Just enough to come less frequently. I love their appetizers. The drinks are usually over priced."}
{"text":"they have breakfast at this location in the gold coast!

i had the western omelette's and hash browns and wheat toast! it was delicious and under $10.00!

i will come back"}
{"text":"2/24/2017: Would not recommend. Location was not cleaned and needed to be swept, tables needed to be wiped off. Overall mess!!!

It was a party of 4 (2 adults, 2 children), we all put our orders in at the same time, but when it came out to us it seemed to be here and there for a sides.  My cuzn waited abt 20 mins for a side of spinach.

I'm not sure if it was understaffed or what was going on, but they clearly did not work as a team.

All over the place!!!! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Didn't believe the reviews and the star till I experienced it... first I called to order to go I was on hold forever so I walked to the restaurant which was right across the hotel with me being on hold. I got there I was still on hold so I hanged up and proceed at the bar to order to go. Took them forever to take my order I had to ask if I could order  anyway service is not great... I haven't tried my food yet hopefully it's good as I am waiting for it while I'm writing this review . Are the staff happy? I don't feel the good vibes..."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  Customer service lacking.  We walked in asked for a seat for 4 and a booster seat.  She took us to a table.  When I asked for a booth she rolled her eyes and pushed my 4 year old out of the way and walked to a booth threw the menus down and started walking away.  I asked to see a manager.  The manager came with the booster seat and asked us was the problem was.  I was ready to leave but he reassured that I should stay.  Five minutes later the hostess walked out of the restaurant loudly.  Our food was ok and the server was good but we got stared at the entire time we were eating.  Uncomfortable experience overall."}
{"text":"Went in to the same TGI Friday's that we have always been to tonight, you know, not great food but fills you up, well tonight my wife ordered a dirty stoli martini (as she always does) and when asked for her ID she was refused because her Drivers license is vertical! She is 28 years old with a Valid Drivers License. Obviously I asked to speak with the manager, approached an overweight woman with a look of disdain on her face who continues to tell me that they now will not accept vertical ID's. Really? Keep your crappy food, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed once again not busy a lot of open tables for some reason did not sit people. Ordered the beef dip with fries both came out barely warm so had to send it back was taking forever to come back so told them never mind. Partner found it very difficult to eat. Needless to say after another bad experience at a different fridays I Will not be going into another Friday's. Never expect to hear from any manager from corporate or anyone."}
{"text":"Came to here for the Never Ending Endless App which I say was great for $10 per person.  But the waiter at the bar was my only issue.  She seemed to be over whelmed with customers which made service time so long which in turn frustrated her to the point she had such an attitude.  Like I said before the food was good once we got it but the time and attitude of the bartender was so uncalled for."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to go to to watch the game, have a drink, chill, etc. they have plenty of parking. They say they don't take reservations, but you can reserve on open table, I pretty much always hit the bar area. A Sunday is relaxed but I recently went on a Friday night it was like the hang out spot. There was several staff there to greet and the door but not many tables cleared off. Hmmm that's backwards. The staff were nice and attentive once they were working with you. The food was fresh and good. I haven't had any problems there. They have a reward program where you get a free dessert on your birthday and free meals by points accumulated."}
{"text":"Look - My wife likes this place so I go there now and again just to make her happy. I know it violates the bro code, but I have to sleep with her.
Me personally, I could care less about Jack Daniels sauce (which is basically reconstituted dried onion and molasses with some other 'secret' ingredients.
Too costly for what you get. 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Horrible food, drinks are all ice and poor service do I need to say more, anywhere is better than here."}
{"text":"Beware of ordering take out.  My daughter got all the way home tonight in Mahomet with food for 3.  Things were missing that ruined the dinner (sauces that were key to the food).  When I called they took my name for a free appetizer.  Their food is good but this wasn't handled well.  I could probably get a free appetizer online."}
{"text":"TGIF is your typical restaurant food. They have a couple of options that are unique to them (Jack Daniels items / sauce), but everything else is okay. We went here only because we were trying there 2 for $10 (1 app + 1 entree).  

Menu was appealing because it was quite a variety even with the special.  However, on a Saturday night, it didn't seem like they had enough waitstaff to accommodate. We got seated pretty quickly, but had to wait awhile between the  apps  & entree. In addition, I had to ask another waitress for a to-go box and bag because our waitress was nowhere to be found. I absolutely hate that! 

I got chicken and shrimp skewers with the veggie medley. The skewers were okay, but the zucchini and squash marinated and and served up was delicious.  It was seasoned very well. 

I can't say I wouldn't go here again, as its right across from Concord Mills (convenient), but maybe a different time other than Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Omg omg what can I not say about this place!!!! ITS AMAZING!!!! Why you might ask ummm let me start with the BEST SERVER EVER!!!!! LARRY IS THE WAY TO GO if you want the best service my god I come atleast once or twice a week to eat here and ugh he's the only reason let me tell and anyone who has bad service with the food or waiter pshhh just ask for Larry trust me when I say \"HE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU\"!!!!! He's the only reason why I come back!!! He's off on sun and Mondays lol so come after that for him lol he's worth the wait!!!!! Love ya Larry thanks for all that you do for me and family! 
BEST SERVER EVER!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Our table did not receive service for twenty minutes. There were several waitress that walked past and didn't acknowledge our table. When the food came it was cold. All of it. Very disappointed in the service here today."}
{"text":"Dirty appetizer dishes.  Appetizer sampler of the potato skins were pathetic and I did complain to the manager upon which I discovered the kitchen was a complete disaster, and filthy.  We were not given an apology for the filthy dishes by our waitress who acted as if this were completely normal.  The food is NOT worth the money.  I would skip this place.  In fact, look them up online for food violations... I was quite surprised and disgusted."}
{"text":"The service at this location is hit or miss.  The restaurant is clean,  but sometimes the dishes and silverware are not.  The food is satisfactory for a TGIFridays."}
{"text":"went on Thursday night & we were offered to sit in the dining area or the bar. I double checked to make sure the dining area was still opened.. if not I would have picked the bar. we sat for about 10 minutes & never was greeted. there was a server 2 tables away but never made her way to our table. then she was in the back area talking with other servers. so we got up to go to the host stand to ask if we could be moved to the bar.. stood there for about 5 minutes & never was acknowledged. had I known we weren't going to get service, I wouldn't have came all the way over to the other side of town to end up not eating."}
{"text":"Had to request to be reseated before our waiter came over to say hello. It's been 15 minutes and I still don't have a beer. To his defense he has a party of 13 to help. 

Ok so after speaking to the waiter I'm not upset anymore. They should of never sat us in his section. He's new and honestly feel he was doing the best he could. He took our drink and food order at the same time which was good. 

It's been an hour and just now getting a beer. I'm thinking about dropping it to 2 stars. 
The Pick 3 for All was really good. Beer ice cold. The chicken salad also very good. I'll keep it at 3 stars. 

I'm sure if I had gotten an experienced waiter/waitress there would not have been any issues at all. 

Will I be coming back? Yeah probably so. I'm not on this side of town much but if I am I would come back."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best food but Andrew working our table in the bar section was great.  Keep this guy around!  I would come back just because of him."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, must be,  since I came twice. Late dinner Friday night.  Waitress was very friendly and fast.  Food was delicious and awesome.  The drinks were never empty.  The place had a nice ambiance.  Only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is the hostess.  Both times she was MIA.  I thought we were going to have to seat ourselves.  Came back 2 days later to eat lunch same thing happened.  Waitress was great but the hostess was MIA. The people before us literally grabbed menus and forks and headed to the bar area.

Tip: If you're staying at the Gold Coast, TGIF will take room service orders."}
{"text":"The food is good so are the drinks I go to this location often with my friends because it is the closes one to us even though it is far from our houses this location is always busy which is kinda annoying but I understand why it's so busy the service is never consistent I've had some bad experiences here and some good overall I wish the customer service was better but the managers are always nice"}
{"text":"I rode by this place and thought, why did he stop going to TGI Friday's? Then I ate there and was reminded."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today. Food was fine, but I was mildly annoyed/horrified by the service. Bartender took 20 minutes to make my drink even though the place was almost empty. And the waitress smashed my cheesecake into her boob, apologized, and gave it to me anyways (?!?!). I usually have a fine time at this location but this was just a bizarre experience."}
{"text":"I can definitely say we will not be back again. We were seated immediately (good), but it took 10 minutes to get my margarita (bad). The margarita itself was strong, but had more ice in it than drink. Food came out in a pretty timely manner. Food was not bad. I had the chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. Husband had French Dip. Food was just okay. Nothing special at all. 
They skimped me on the honey mustard sauce for my chicken fingers. So when I needed more, I waited about 10 minutes for a human being (not even our own waitress) to show up. By that point, my food was cold since I was waiting for more sauce. 
Waited forever to get our check, and the 2 tables next to us also were waiting. Waitress finally arrived, apologized and said she was taking trash out (which is usually code for smoking a cigarette). Well, if you have to take trash out and you're going to be leaving your customers for that long, get someone to cover for you. Not that difficult. 
Again, I won't be back. Won't be surprised if this restaurant goes out of business. It's pretty awful"}
{"text":"Service here is horrible. I have tried this place multiple times, just in case of an off night. The severs never check to see how things are or if any reflills are needed."}
{"text":"We always enjoy at least one meal at this TGIF each time we stay at The Orleans, which is 2-3 times a year. We've never had bad service. We have had times where servers didn't check on us because they were busy with too many tables at once, which usually means they're understaffed, but this one always has a lot of employees working at the same time, mainly chitchatting at the hostess section up front, so I'm not sure what the issue is. The food is generally good. The 3-6 steak and lobster \"bargain\" isn't really, you get about 2 bites of overcooked lobster tail. My biggest complaint is the dinner side salads. I always have a Caesar salad when I eat at any TGIFs - don't think I'll be doing that with this location anymore. Their dressing tastes like a lime vinaigrette... not disgusting, but not Caesar, either - and I always seem to get lots of the \"nasty\" bits of lettuce, which I leave in the bowl, it's just a waste to order a salad here. Other than a few issues, this location is decent - not a fave, but it's better than the trouble of leaving the hotel and dine elsewhere. Plus we always get a BOGO dessert coupon when we check in, so that helps!"}
{"text":"I have been to tgi only twice so far. The first time I ordered the filled potato skin appetizer. The portion was big and It could have been great if it had a sauce or something but it was just way too dry. 

And the second time I ordered their Caribbean chicken sandwich with \"Caribbean\" sauce. The sauce was so disgusting I had to send the entire sandwich back. I couldn't even believe they seriously considered that sauce. So the sandwich was grilled chicken breast (very good) with tomatoes, avocados (still sounds good, right?) and then this sauce, which tasted like Christmas and pumpkin pie!??? It definitely had cinnamon and cloves in it... on a chicken avocado sandwich??? Like seriously? That is not Caribbean! Please if you are a staff from TGI Fridays and you are reading this, please take that sauce off of your menu, it is NOT good and my husband and mother in law who tried it, 100% agreed with me. Well, I sent back my food and ordered the turkey burger. It tasted not bad but I couldn't really enjoy it because everybody else was done eating and I felt stressed out. 

Positive was definitely the service though. Always friendly and professional. And they didn't charge me for the first order."}
{"text":"Once again we are very pleased with your restaurant. We stay at the Aliante annually for the March Madness kick-off and my husbands birthday.  On Saturday, March 19, 2016 we decided to have dinner here and was approached by a waiter named Kevin. He  was THE most polite, attentive, and efficient waiter I've come in contact with in a very long time.  His overall personality and kindness will take him very far in life.  Its really nice to see that there are young adults who still take pride in what they do.  Thank you so much Kevin for your exemplary service.  We will be back next year."}
{"text":"Don't believe that big ribs thing commercial with the ppl eating giant St. Louis style ribs and saying that they are meaty!!!! TOTAL FARCE!!! I ordered the $12.99 \"big\" ribs dinner with 2 sides and received regular, old baby back rack of ribs!!! I know the difference between st. Louis ribs and baby backs!!! Stop deceiving ppl tgif.!!!!!! Could have gone someplace else for real big ribs!!!!"}
{"text":"We are staying at The Orleans and have eaten here twice this stay and once before. Drinks are excellent and half priced during Happy Hour. For dinner, you can't beat the Steak & Lobster for $14.99 or the Friday's Jack Daniels Ribs. The service has been \"over the top\" thanks to Will and Carla. We will continue to eat here when we eat in and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This is the worst Fridays service and food of them all! We have been to most Fridays in las vegas, los angeles and others around the country, but the bar service was horrible! 
Rude, messed up orders and the sizzling chicken was very small patties compared to other locations. 
No one should go to this location when there are many other locations in Vegas to choose from!"}
{"text":"it's a fridays so you kinda know what they have. the service was extremely slow though and it wasn't even very busy."}
{"text":"Great ribs and only coast me $11.99 cause it's Wednesday and I had no idea was just coming to check this place out as I have a condo at PANO.

Great service from Amanda & AARON.   Super friendly.   I asked to have the Sharks game on they put it on  

I will be back"}
{"text":"Great Kate night service from Jessica.   That's the best shrimp cocktail for $6 I've ever had.   I didn't know happy hour was 22 hours a Day here.  Thanks jessica we will be back.  

Oh the chicken nachos were great.  A huge portion"}
{"text":"Our server was sweet. Our food was actually way better then the last time we were there...which was about 1 1/2 yrs ago (the food gave my husband food poisoning). Although, we had a TV right above us that was so loud my family could barely hear each other talk, we asked our server if they could turn it down a lil bit. The main bartender IMMEDIATELY said \"No!\" And wouldn't ya know it, a different server turned it down as we were finishing our food!!
Honestly, the only reason why we took another shot at this place was because of the free dessert cuz it's my bday month (rewards \"club\").
And the fact that my Jack Daniels Chicken & Shrimp was $25...nope! It used to be like $15-$17!! 
That being said, the bathroom's were clean & we didn't have to wait very long for a table on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Long wait because there were no clean tables and found a food label baked into my nachos.. NOT TO MENTION THE \"USE BY\" date had passed. Service was crap and didn't finish my food after finding that label. Manager made some lame excuse about how \"it happens all the time\". I don't think I'd ever come back. Cross contamination and expired food. No thanks. I think it needs to get another health inspection."}
{"text":"Standard chain store, standard TGI's. My family and I went to this location the night my husband and I arrived in town, mostly due to how close it is to my mother's home and b/c we didn't want to have the wait associated with most places on a Saturday evening.
Waitstaff was great- friendly, attentive, and quick to fill emptied water glasses, etc. 
Food is AWFUL. We ordered a few appetizers due to having been on planes all day and basically not eating much in the past day. My husband wanted to try fried green beans- they tasted like dirt and were dry beyond compare. I don't know why TGI's decided to offer this dish- no matter how great the frying would be, it tasted awful.
I was very hopeful for my entree- Mediterranean chicken kabobs served with pita and tzatziki. What arrived was again super dry chicken, black burnt onions (the only vegetable on the kabob), and cucumber water. If you know tzatziki, it is a pureed greek yogurt dip with cucumbers and dill. This was literally chunks of cucumber sitting in milky water. The pitas were soggy- the one thing that was supposed to be dry on the plate was wet. 
Everyone in our party's food was the same- mediocre at best. Even for a chain store, I would have expected better due to QC. I would wholeheartedly advise people to either avoid this place like the plague or stick to things on the menu that have been there for years, b/c their new excursions are not faring so well."}
{"text":"I'm sad that this TGIF only has 3 stars !!
This is the only one I go to because we always receive the best customer service and our food has never been wrong.
On this night my friends and I went for a quick meal before going to piranha. We ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (I HAVE to order this every time) it has a little spicy kick, the chicken, shrimp and red bell peppers are what makes this dish my favorite. I can't get enough go try it. I believe it's $15? I also ordered a raspberry mint patron drink. Very good but I wouldn't recommend it with the pasta- too much acid. This drink was $10 probably would've been cheaper to just get a drink at the casino! Lastly the only flaw I have is that if you don't sit at the bar when they have their half off drinks, you don't get them- unless you walk to the bar and pay every time. They should just make it half off no matter what I'm sure they would sell more!
Lastly I want the endless appetizers back!"}
{"text":"It's a sad day when one of your favorite places looses it's sparkle.  Mark D. is my husband and to him this chain can do no wrong.  To me, I'm a little bit harder to please.  (Yep, I'm a food grump.)  I guess I just expect to get what I order and how I want it.  I know picky picky picky.  The last three times I've gone here my order has been wrong and while I try to be passive-aggressive about it, the next time I just might get angry.  

Fridays does offer some amazing deals if you are part of their stripes program or if you sign up for text message deals.  So far we have not had a problem redeeming them.  I love the happy hour deals they offer and I wish they would let the entire dinning area share those deals instead of just the bar.  The bar was packed when we went in today and would have just sat there if a clean table was available.  

The food is okay, it's probably the reason we keep coming back.  I love the nachos and if you can get them half price at happy hour they are the best value on the menu.  I'm not a big drinker but I have ordered a drink called \"strawberry shortcake\" it was basically a strawberry milkshake with a shot of booze in it and it got me buzzing pretty good.  The cheesecake is also quite good.  I will be back I'm sure of it, but if my order gets messed up again some poor server will feel my rage.  (J/K, I am really not that mean.)"}
{"text":"Really really really Loud......They pack you in close enough you can taste the food on any other table. Service? Eh....the people just turn the tables over as fast as they can. The server failed to tell us their name. Food was ok at best. The wait system is a bit dated, they handed out hand written numbers. Wait and hope you hear your number."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to have dinner with our daughter and her friend last night. After arriving we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They were not terribley busy. We were seated and again waited about 15 minutes to be acknowledged.  Our server was polite and seemed somewhat overwhelmed.  We ordered drinks and appetizers. My husband ordered a soft drink.
Our main courses consisted of two rib specials and two steaks. The food was ok, my disappointment is at the fact that during the whole time, did anyone remove our dirty dishes or even check to see if anything else was needed. At the end of the meal the server did come back to ask if we needed more drinks.  Still he did not remove any of the dishes or empty glasses. The busser passed our table several times, and still did not remove anything. I felt as if I had a whole setof dinner wear just piled in front of us. We won't return to this TGIF because of the cutomer service."}
{"text":"This is was my first time at this location. Can't really complain about our food. We ordered spinach artichoke cheese dip with chips,  blue cheese beef burger for my husband, French onion soup for me, and kids meals for the boys - chicken fingers with fries. Our beverage was sweet ice tea, it was like drinking high fructose corn syrup...I almost vomited. Our waitress was very nice and only worked there couple of weeks. She switched out the teas with something else, but I asked her to cut mine with water. Well, when it arrived it tasted like chlorine ice sweet tea. Yuck! Seltzer water was not available. What's up with that? I was very surprised. I won't be coming back there again."}
{"text":"Okay, this place has been a god send for me more than once. I have ended up on a late flight into Charlotte, and this place is open late and is a stones throw away from the Drury. I have had beer, burgers, wings, and all sorts of other things here and have never had anything that I didn't like. Service is always friendly and the tables have always been clean. I will be stopping here again."}
{"text":"Eat here last night. Myself and a few friends. Nice place. No big wow factor. But we did have really great service. Our servers name was Christina, I believe. She was very attentive and quick with all that we needed. One of my friends can never just order off the menu. He made asked for so many changes, I would have kicked him out. But she just took it all down and said ok. Surprise!!!!, everything came out fine. Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Eh. I wanted to be happy with my meal, but I just wasn't. The server was great which is what saved the review from being 1 star. The food quality was really lacking, the food didnt have flavor, and my side salad was pathetic. Get it together TGI Fridays, Ive had much better experiences!"}
{"text":"THe Waitress SABRINA  is terrible. I had the most horrible service at this location last night, I went in around 2:30 AM because I was starving. When I walk in there was no one there to greet us or seat us so we decide to go to the bar and seat ourselves.. When we got to the bar instead of asking us if we wanted a menu she ask us were we ready to order, I said no \"I would like a menu\". After she handed us the menu she took about 30 minutes to come back and take our order(longest wait ever). As I recall there were only four people at the bar other than myself and my friend and everyone else have their food. She was not busy at all she was standing around then finally took our order, I ordered the mahi mahi with fully loaded bake potato, half rack of ribs and steam spinach. I had to remake the salmon when I got home because it was tasteless and dry with no seasoning.... (The order was to go) she didn't even ask us if we would like something to drink while we wait for our food to come out, didn't offer us water or anything.. (I was pretty thirsty and thought it was her job to ask so I didn't even bother). 25 mins after waiting for our food it finally came out and she handed us the check and walk away, came back about 3 mins later grab the check and my card and that's it.. I wrote horrible service on the receipt, I wanted to talk to a manager but I had my uber waiting for me outside. She has no customer service and Has her nappy half dreaded hair hanging down while serving people food,. I had great service here before but not tonight, SABRINA need proper training."}
{"text":"Significantly better experience this time than on my last visit to this location. Sat at the bar area, had my choice of $6 appetizers for \"all day\" happy hour, and finally settled on nachos. It's not the tostada nachos, but I can't remember the name and I can't find it on the interwebs... anyway, there was cheese, chicken, mild salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and a little bit of lettuce. It was pretty good, and it got me full after I had skipped breakfast and gone straight to lunch. I also sampled my friend's Jack Daniels sampler (haha, sampled, get it?), and the shrimp and chicken were both good.

Since we changed two variables, I can't figure out if the service was merely lame on the restaurant side on my first visit or if it was some sort of perfect storm of soup/salad/breadsticks overload by my previous table, but my opinion of this place has gone up significantly. Therefore, I'll give Christina-the-server partial credit for today and highly recommend that you sit on the bar side even if you don't personally order a fancy beverage."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took for ever to order food. Only people here and still got terrible service. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Holy  this TGI Friday's SUCKS!  Waited 40 minutes to be seated during dinner rush. Ordered food and half came out cold, my daughter's food came out 5 minutes later a litter warmer. Ordered again and then sat and waited and waited and waited. The restaurant was almost empty by then. Our waitress came over and told us our food was almost ready... she lied. I'm sure it's still not ready. Our waitress suggested we talk to the manager. Probably because by this time she knew she wasn't getting a tip for forgetting our glasses 4 times that she came over to tell us our food was really never coming. When the manager did come over, he tried to tell us that they were sooooo busy as he pointed to the almost empty restaurant. Delusional is all I have to say!!  Don't waste your time unless you enjoy long waits, cold food, and possibly never getting food you actually ordered!"}
{"text":"Have to say the improvements are noticed. Last couple of visits have been great. French onion soup, sesame jack strips were excellent."}
{"text":"Usually chains are completely reliable when it comes to the identical stellar service or food they provide. 
TGI Fridays seems to have the opposite in the bag. They are always reliable for bad service and cold, sad food. 

Yesterday was the same consistency that I've had at this location before. I was there with my family, Mom and Dad, and my Brother and his wife. We all ordered the unlimited apps for $10. Don't get me wrong, $10 all you can eat apps is a great price point, if you accompany it with good food. This is where Friday's misses the mark. 

Johnny (I think) was our server, and he mumbled through his greet, and struggled to remember if they served sweet tea. We got our first rounds of apps, my brother and I both ordering wings. They were both cold, and the amount of ranch that was brought to the table was less than enough for two or three of their boneless wings. 
 
Second round; Mom got meatballs. They came with little cute garlic bread slices, that didn't taste like anything. The meatballs were swimming in (admittedly, really good) sauce, with just a touch of cheese. Third round, my sister in law got the same thing; and it was completely opposite. There was so much cheese and so little sauce, we thought they brought something different. 

I literally work directly across the street from here, and we've been here on corporate days for lunch for their speedy lunch, but it's always slow and unpredictable. If this place worked on their consistency, it would be great. Their menu would be good if the consistency was there, too. The ideas on there are great! Good savings for happy hour and this app special. If I could just know that it would be good, each time. 

I hope they get their acts together, I wouldn't mind coming here more often. 

Happy Eating, Just probably not here."}
{"text":"Meal was pretty average but would not go on a Friday night again. Very questionable patrons lots of leather tattoos and women that were overweight with tight clothes can you say cheap hooker!"}
{"text":"Whatsoever has happened to my T. G. I. Fridays? My goodness... We have been Fridays stalwarts for decades and while the chain has seen tough times we have stuck with them. However, the last three times we have chosen Fridays for our empty nest/disposable income nights out (full disclosure, one of the three was the Strongsville OH store) it has NOT been good. A few days ago, my wife's Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad was just some chicken on lettuce. Ya, just that. Since she orders it almost always, she saw right away it was missing everything else. Now, the bar guys were fantastic -- and made it right as immediately as they could and apologized \"up one side and down the other\" (as my Mom would say). But the damage is being done. I have 399 Fridays points and frankly, I feel like just deleting the app and starting my Burntwood Tavern Rewards. I am so sorry, Fridays, but I feel like some tough love is needed here. You suck right now and better get your sh** together or we are done."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and while nothing was spectacular, the service was good 4 of us ordered basically anything we wanted for less than 140$. Would I come back, meh, probably not."}
{"text":"This is a nice TGI located just a minute off I-90 in a pleasant area. Our server, Angelina, was awesome. She is so pleasant and efficient. The other staff assisting were also great.

The food was delivered quickly, and everything our table was great. The chips and salsa very fresh. The onion rings perfect. The ribs, oh so good. Even the turkey burger was just right.

This is quite obviously a well run location. We were all very pleased, and will stop back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"My recent visit to Fridays was great! I ordered a 22 oz. glass of Bud Light and my boyfriend ordered a bottle of Land Shark. Both of which were only $3.00 thanks to the happy hour special. They have great prices on alcohol and appetizers during happy hour (which just so happens to be all day everyday). I ordered the Gourmet 5 Mac & Cheese, it was delicious! The boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniels burger and his was just as good. We had an amazing server named Margarita who was fast, very attentive, and provided awesome customer service. After both of our entrees and 4 beers, our total came to $25 and some change. I like that. The only thing I didnt like, is they didnt cater to the current promotion of all sandwiches and salads are $5 due to the fact that they are in a casino."}
{"text":"We like coming to this location because it's not to far and there is never a wait. The last time we came here our servers name was Blanca and she was so polite, at tentative and overall she made our experience very present. Very professional and I loved her! The only reason for 4/5 stars is because the wait for our food was about 20 minutes or more and other people that came right after us had already received their meal so it was a bit frustrating but overall a great place and good food. I recommend the ribs!"}
{"text":"TGIF! I spent some quality years in the 90's, so I associate TGIF with watching Sabrina the Teenage Witch (the drama between Sabrina and Harvey, will they, wont they?!) and Family Matter's (is it wrong to love Stefan more than Urkle?). 

I was mildly disappointing that my favorite TV shows were not playing on a loop in the restaurant, but may be I was expecting too much...

The food in general is definitely A-Okay. Perfectly adequate and acceptable to trade for cash-money. 

On my most recent visit, I came specifically to try the Beyond Burger. I've been reading about it for years, and was very excited to try it myself. TGIF did a very good, standard burger preparation (nice bun, tomatoes, lettuces, special sauce). If I didn't know it was a veggie burger, I think I would have gotten about half way through before really noticing. It does taste like meat, but the texture is just slightly not quite ground beef. It's close, but not quite there. Totally worth getting a second time.

I love that they offer this new meatless meat burger. It was a culinary thrill to try!"}
{"text":"Not terrible on a Monday evening.  A xouple of $5 apps can make a decent meal. Wish they would lose the candy-striped tables, very garish."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a bite to eat and happily stumbled upon the happy hour.

Drinks are reasonably priced and there are many discount appetizers.

Our server was great and quick with refills on our waters.

I recommend eating in the bar area to take advantage of these deals, it is also a fun place to people watch from.  The casino, as always is filled with characters."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time eating at this Fridays, but it was definitely the worst. I went with my boyfriend. Our server was Jennifer. She was nice, but she's the type of server that thinks her memory is good enough not to write orders down. We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer, she didn't write it down and the order for it was never put in. We both ordered steaks. I asked for shrimp with mine and when she repeated my order back to me she said ribs and steak. I had to correct her. When I did, she finally started writing our order down. I wanted my steak medium rare and the boyfriend wanted his rare. We both got well done steaks. We didn't bother sending them back because we simply didn't want to wait around for steaks to be cooked again. When we were done with our meal, Jennifer asked if we'd like our check, we said yes and she came back about 5 minutes later asking if she'd given us our check yet."}
{"text":"We work down the street so we've been here a few times. Service is typically slow even if they arent busy. Today they arent busy but part of our order was wrong. I got a tomato mozzarella salad, and the buffalo mozzarella is hard and yellow. Not sure if it was left out or is just old. My co workers soups are not hot, and two of their orders are wrong as well. I was going to ask the waitress for a different side, but she hasnt come back to ask how we're doing, or bring my side of mayo. We were hoping this visit would be better, but clearly not. Wont recommend."}
{"text":"This place used to be better. Service was good tonight but the food was lack luster. 

I ordered the signature customer favorite Jack Daniels burger with fries and a Dos Equis Ambar. The beer was great but it is hard to screw up a mass produced bottled beer. The burger and fries came out without too much of a wait but the quality was lacking. Oh sure, the burger looked amazing. And the fries, as far as the appearance of fries goes, looked pretty good too. An even cook with liberal seasoning. But upon first bite of each, I questioned whether or not this food was fresh. The fries were barely warm and the burger only slightly warmer. The gooey cheese I was looking for hardly gooed at all. The Jack Daniels sauce to drench the burger in had good flavor but seemed thinned by a liquid other than its name sake. Most dripped right off the burger by the time I finished it. I could not help but wonder how much sooner my food would have come to me had it been brought immediately after preparation. I mean, my burger was cooked beyond my request of medium and still wasn't sizzling when I got it. Kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I used to be regulars 2 to 3 times a week at this Fridays. We knew the wait staff and bartenders. There was a change in management and as of now we will not be going back. The last time we went we sat at the bar placed our food order and waited... FOR TWO HOURS to get our food. Mind you other people were coming in and leaving after they were served their food. We kept seeing the manager walk in to the bar area and eating something then walking away. We asked our server if we were ever going to get our food. 20 minutes later it was brought out. We didn't order anything fancy and there was no reason for that. I spoke to the manager and asked what the deal was, he said he wasn't sure that they were busy. I then pointed out he had time to eat and he said he was hungry... REALLY?? So were we... I wouldn't say the last manager was great either but at least no one had to wait 2 hours for their food. He did give our appetizer we had ordered free though. Thanks for saving me the 8 bucks for the longest dinner ever.."}
{"text":"Today I took my husband out for fathers day first of all as we were seated our server passed our table about 10 × before we got acknowledged then we decided to go with the endless appetizer deal our waiter checked on us once and that was for our first order after that we waited nearly 45 mins just to get more we never got drink refills and barely got service. Way to ruin fathers day I am highly disappointed if I knew our service was gonna be that bad I would have chosen the buffet at least we could have actually got what we paid for! And being busy is no excuse because we were there before the crowd rush."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my family& we were kind of if-y on going because the parking lot was empty. But everything was delicious. Bridget was the best server, she was super upbeat, had great recommendations & was very attentive. Would definitely come back to see her"}
{"text":"Not a place to go... They were stinkers & did not honor the Coupon we got when checking in @ Gold Coast!!! Stay away..."}
{"text":"Ok, yeah, it's just a tgi Fridays... But that alone is worth 3 stars out of 5 -- decent product at decent value.  What makes this one awesome is that it's right off the Las Vegas Strip, where food values like this are few and far between... AND most importantly they provide the room service for the Gold Coast hotel! So when I'm occasionally slumming it at the Gold Coast, instead of paying $40 for a cheeseburger that I have to wait an hour for at Caesars or Aria, I wait 15 minutes and have a $10 burger delivered at Gold Coast. Tremendous!"}
{"text":"today 7/22/15 after bowling my family and I went to this restaurant looking for a perfect lunch, the hostess offer to us the option to choose between table or booth we asked for a booth she told us that they did not have one so she asked if we want to sit at the bar, we decided not to, so she went back to the dinning room and cleaned a booth that was empty and dirty we had to wait for her to come back, after sitting down and receiving the menu, all of us order our drinks and food they took 7 minutes to bring a beer to my brother and 22 minutes to bring our food, we were ready to leave, the order for the jack Daniel burger was supposed to be well done and it was cooked medium so i have to send it back and let my family eat with out me, had to wait 15 more minutes so when they brought it back my family was already done eating i asked for the manager and i show her the other hamburger and it was medium well and i asked her if that was well done , she just said i think it is, what kind of manager is she, she does not know the cooking temperatures"}
{"text":"This was just a bad experience one end to the other. We had a group of 5, the host asked us if we were all over 21. He told us he got in trouble because he once put a group of minors in the bar without carding them (he didn't card us either). He put us in a booth that was snug to say the least. Our server mentally took our drink order and proceed to mess that up. Thankfully she decided to write down our food order. When it came out (much later... so slow... and it was dead inside) 2 of the orders were still wrong and the french fries had obviously been sitting under the heat lamps way too long... worms of nastiness. They did fix one of the orders and brought us a fresh basket of fries. My burger wasn't horrid, but I will never go back to try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying absolutely horrible the food came out and the loaded potato skins had cold cheese on it in clumps and the manager said that's how it suppose to be they brought out serving plates and the plates had food on it from the last guess horrible....I live in henderson and I've been here 3 times and each time I had problems never again will go there to eat or refer anybody!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Years. Today's entire bar staff was rude and basically sucked. We moved to restaurant side. 

Verdict still out"}
{"text":"This is a nice Fridays! It is typical bar food and it can be a little pricey, but overall, it was worth it. They have a great selection of apps and their cocktails are really creative. We had the spinach and queso dip which was really good!! Our server Anastasia was super friendly and was very patient with our large group, so that was a plus!! If you're looking for a fun drink, try the Blackberry Buzz Rita; it comes with a buzz button which is an edible flower that you eat before sipping your drink. It makes your tongue tingle and it enhances the flavor of your drink. It was so cool when I tried it that everyone in our party ended up ordering a buzz button on the side with their drinks. It was such a fun and interesting experience, especially trying it with a big group! All in all, it was a great choice for really great food and drinks, and the friendly staff made this Fridays stand out from others I have been to in the past."}
{"text":"We had a gift card, and we were looking for something fun to eat. Bridget was our server, and she was so nice. She had a smile when she took our order, as well as each time she stopped by to check up on us. She really made us feel welcome. 

We decided to not eat too much food, and we split a Smoke Stacked Burger. This was so flavorful. The description is: Beer-braised sausage & onions, Asiago & cheddar between two fresh hickory-smoked burgers with sweet Memphis seasoning, melted sharp cheddar, Tennessee BBQ sauce, BBQ ranch aioli, applewood-smoked bacon and coleslaw.

This was one of the best burgers that I have had in a long time. The cheese was so good. The combination of all of these flavors was just wonderful. The fries were not my favorite though, as they were not crispy at all. Not quite soggy, but not crispy. 
For dessert we split the Brownie Obsession. YUM. The brownie was hot, and the ice cream nice and cold. Great combination. With the pecans, and caramel sauce. This was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars, place downhill fast. No host waited 10 mins or so host never showed asked 3 servers they were rude and of no help, the 3rd one did seat us at a dirty table no waitress showed after sitting another 10 mins!!! I informed manager on way out as we left stated ok and walked away!! Place is dirty, dull, the ppl working there all look dirty and have attitudes... close this dump down.  Forgot to mention the place was not even busy. Unprofessional, no excuses.. will not return to this depressed dirty place"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time.     No more.      After a long spell of not coming here, we decided to try them again.    It was a Tuesday around 1:30 p.m.     Restaurant not crowded at all.    Menu seems very limited as opposed to what I was used to seeing from TGI Fridays before.   Ordered drinks and meals.   My husband ordered the fried shrimp dinner and I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp dinner.      The fried shrimp were small and tasteless.    My chicken (2 pieces) were overcooked, dry and hard to chew.    Prices at Fridays have really gone up and the quality of food has gone way down.    Too many other good restaurants in the area to waste any time or money here.   So disappointed.   Used to love Fridays."}
{"text":"We don't have a TGI Friday's in my hometown, so my boyfriend and I specifically planned to visit this location on our recent trip to Vegas.

We were seated right away, which is always nice.  We then waited at our table for 10-15mins for anyone to even greet us or smile our direction.  When our server finally arrived, the FIRST words out of her mouth were \"I'm exhausted.\"  She then proceeded to complain to us about her last table as an excuse as to why we had to wait so long just to get waters.

We had enough time to decide what to order as we waited so long.  I decided to try the special the hostess told me about: steak and lobster for $13.99.  What I didn't know is that it was on a time limit.  The server had the nerve to look at her watch after making us wait 15 minutes and tell me I \"barely made it\" in time to order that.  I also order a cocktail at this time.

After waiting another 10 minutes, she finally brought my sangria followed by another 15-20 minute wait for our entrees.  Let me tell you.  This was the MOST unappetizing meal I've ever had to eat.  I am not usually a complainer--even when I'm starving I eat some pretty crazy foods.

The lobster was not \"de-turded (for lack of a better word)\" and my medium rare steak was too tough to chew.

We did speak to the store manager who willingly comp'ed us some items, but I left underwhelmed and still hungry after not being able to bring myself to finish my meal."}
{"text":"Soooooooo ... I generally like TGIFridays.  I proposed to my second wife in one.  This particular location, however, is apparently suffering from a total lack of management (at least on the night we visited).  Tuesday afternoon, 4:00-4:30, light crowd (25% or less full).

The appetizer (chip nachos) was awesome.  Then the burgers came out.  For some reason, all three of us ordered burgers.  That hardly ever happens.  When the food arrived (we had each ordered what was SUPPOSED to be a different burger), the burgers were obviously bit right.  The server could not distinguish one from the other.  After consulting the kitchen, plates were exchanged and everything pronounced okay.  We knew they were still not right, but we were hungry and had a movie to go to. 

We told our server that the plates were wrong, but that everything still tasted good.  He told us he would talk to his manager.  He came back and said the manager would like to offer us a free dessert.  We passed. 

Problems: they kept the itemized receipt (with the survey information on it) when they brought the check back after running my card.  Don't want any reviews?  The burgers tasted okay, but were indistinguishable.  They just looked kind buns with greasy piles of cheese-covered ingredients.  The best we could tell, all three had the wrong toppings on them.  No pride in product appearance whatsoever.  So ... the manager was not ensuring quality food was being served, not making sure staff know how to get orders delivered correctly or identify menu items, and addressing customer concerns is not a priority - what EXACTLY is she or he doing back there?  Candy Crush Saga?  eBay?  Quoting lines from \"Waiting?\"  Whatever it was, it was a management FAIL. 

I will not return until I see some positive Yelp! reviews."}
{"text":"Mother's day eating for dinner with my family. We got here around 4:30pm right after we got in here everyone else started to come. Very busy here but everyone  working here has been so good and very nice. Very busy and loud.
The pretzels and cheese sauce sooooo good. We might some to go."}
{"text":"We used to love to go to this TGI Friday's but about a year ago the service & quality of food was degraded. Yesterday we decided to give them another try using take out because I was having a meeting for lunch. 

When I walked in there was no one waiting for a table and 3 staff members standing around chatting. I said, I wanted to place a take out order. The young man pointed me in the direction of the bar and said at the end is where they take the orders from the bartender. 

Ok 1st of all its a SUNDAY in a CASINO in LAS VEGAS. the bar was packed. no seats at the bar or any of the tables. I hipped my way though the crowd and stood at the end of the bar. 

25 minutes. 

1 bartender. 

Who puts 1 bartender in a bar on a Sunday in football season in Vegas?  

I waited. 

and waited.

and waited. 

She talked to the service station people. she chatted up the people at the bar. she flirted with the guy who was sitting 3 seats down from where I was standing. she chatted with 2 girls who were standing next to me having a convo but NEVER once said.. CAN I HELP YOU. 

for 25 minutes. 

I had all my order prewritten on a green post it (so if anyone from this Friday's is reading you'll know who i was) 
Finally a woman in street clothing came behind the bar and have a few minutes of chit chat -- she (the bartender) pointed in my direction. she came over - not that she could hear me, so i gave her my list and asked if she could understand it.. THEN the bartender decided to come peek over her shoulder. I said.. Do you know how long it will take (thinking i'd sit in the lobby) she said at least 30 minutes.. I said well i've been standing here 25.  The bartender rolled her eyes and said.. we're really busy. 

Really?  I didn't notice. 

at which point i snatched my list back and left. but not before making a sweep though the dining room to count 12 tables. 

and the 3 staff members were back in the lobby chatting. 

Now my biggest issue is that who in the TGI Friday's corporate HQ thought it would be a GREAT idea for 2go orders being placed in a bar?  

to go - unless you are in NYC or SFO - usually means you are going to get into your car and drive. 

I actually ended up at a stand alone TGI Fridays about 3 miles away. again sent to the bar to order and this time very prompt service but the bartender kept coming over and saying are you sure you dont' want a drink? finally i said. drinking and driving don't mix. 

WTG Fridays. You win the day.  (that's sarcasm, btw)"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place! It's a hit or miss. Sometimes i come here i get good service! The next time i come i wait 10-15 minutes until anybody notice i'm there in the bar area. They do have good food and drinks but the service is not that great! When i come with family the dining area is ok but the bar employees needs to be more active, bar wasn't even full for me to wait as long as i did... I was sitting at one of the open tables near the rail where you can people watch and the girl said that section was closed so i picked another seat and later when i came back from the movies the bar area she kicked me out had people there, not like it was packed or anything! Also behind the bar is this blond girl who is just weird! She has been there for a while because every time i come and see her working the bar area i sit on the other side away from her. Just a weird vibe with this place sometimes.."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but the food is always pretty good. They have a whole menu dedicated to the Jack Daniels sauce and it's all awesome."}
{"text":"The TGI Friday is a nice chain restaurant which was located in the Sam's Town complex.
We had drinks  here and plan our game plan for the 3rd and 4 Th  quarter of 2017.
We have lots of fun.
I'm a fan of the fast and friendly service at this location. I will return.

{"text":"Avoid. 

We came here after a wedding ceremony since we had downtime between the reception. I've been to many TGI's over the years and I chose this place because I figured it would be a casual yet comfortable spot for a snack and a drink. Unfortunately, I should have chosen something else. 

The service and atmosphere were poor. We decided we only wanted to grab a seat at the bar which the hostess rudely said: \"Don't sit in any of the tables near the bar, or in the booths\" (there is definitely a better way to say that to walk-in customers).

The bartenders were barely noticeable. To draw a picture, there were 2 other customers sitting at the bar, and 2 bartenders working. It took a while before one even acknowledged us. They made us a few drinks, but their attitude showed that they didn't really want to be here. 

The average 2-star rating says a lot about this place. This is a large chain, and surprisingly this is not the same TGI Friday's I remember from other locations. 

Requires management intervention."}
{"text":"This is your typical Friday's, equipt with all the yummy Jack Daniel's sauced up wings and things. This will probably be our late night go to restaurant. It's 24 hours, which is so convienent. It's a clean, full service Friday's that was pretty packed, but we didn't have to wait because we sat at the bar. The waitress was nice and friendly, and our food was great. My husband and I both got salads. How lame lol. We also got loaded potato skins, which were a little oily, but I'm sure it was because if the cheese. We also had a few drinks, which were mixed well."}
{"text":"I went yesterday around 3pm with my bestfriend and my son. I recommended this place because I went a few weeks ago with my fiancé and the grande nachos were AMAZING. Unfortunately this visit was terrible. When we walked in, a server was just sitting on the bench and the hostess just stared at us. My friend said \"two and a high chair\" and the server that was sitting down just yelled out a table number and the hostess took us to our seat. I used to be a hostess at a different restaurant and that, to me, was completely unprofessional. The server wasn't the greatest. Took forever to get our check and with a whining, tired, one year old, I needed to leave asap. Overall, I wanted to treat my bestfriend for her early 21st birthday and was so disappointed. Food was good though, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Approximately four months after eating here and receiving lousy service,  missing items from our order, and having a totally misinformed and unknowing waitress, went back on Thursday, Sept 12, hoping things had changed.....NOT!  Again, the service was horrible.  Seated quickly, hostess supplied the water (never have I seen that happen before), but waited over five minutes for someone to come to our table and wait on us.  And when she showed up, she asked if anyone had been to the table yet; like what, you don't know what section you are supposed to work?  Anyway, ordered beer and wine, appetizer, and two entrees then waited, and waited, and waited some more, but no drinks, no appetizer, no nothing.   We saw our waitress walk by the bar more than once, but she didn't look our way or say anything.  I saw here talking to customers at another table for about 5 minutes, and decided we weren't going to get served so we got up and left after a total of about 15 minutes of waiting for our drinks.  Walked up to her and told her we were leaving, we weren't going to wait another minute while she felt it was more important to BS with other customers than to get us our order.  All she said was, have a nice day....spoke to the manager who asked if we wanted to be seated somewhere else, and I said no, I didn't want to wait anymore and the service sucked anyway so why re-seat us?  We used to eat here quite a bit, but over the last year or so, the place has gone down in service and the food isn't that good anyway.  If you want to eat here, and get the same lousy service, don't bother to complain to the company, we did that months ago and it didn't do any good.  Friday's is going down the tubes, they have jumped the shark as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"This place right here! Another one of my drunken adventures led my girlfriend and I here, and I can't say that it was a bad thing. Food was decent, on par with applebees and all those other places. People were super nice to us, or maybe I was too drunk to care? Or maybe it was because my girlfriend had a low cut shirt on.....whatevs, good service! I just wish they would've roofied me and said a few kind words before they f*cked me on the price! You would've thought I was eating gold plated, diamond encrusted baby dinosaur eggs or some shit. Geezus. Despite the price making me want to ask my boss for a raise, or rob a bank (sounds fun, actually....), the place was solid all the way around and I'd go back....and make somebody else pay for it! Anybody wanna give me their credit card number? Come onnnnn."}
{"text":"Well, I certainly wish I had time to read reviews before dining here. I find this restaurant to be overpriced for the food they serve, I will get to the wait staff in a moment. My girlfriend and I chose this restaurant because we wanted a place to sit down and have a nice late lunch before we went to Charlotte to ride the Funny Bus. This was on the way and we left ourselves plenty of time. My girlfriend ordered the Million Dollar Cobb Salad adding a 6 oz. sirloin. She told the waiter that she did not want the bleu cheese and could he add extra of the other cheeses, he told her that he would make sure that they added a little bit of everything to make up for the bleu cheese. Satisfaction right? Not in the least. When the salad arrived at the table all I saw was lettuce a sprinkling of shredded cheeses, some chopped onion, some avocado, and 5 small strips of steak on top, and I can guarantee it was not 6 oz. Our waiter did not check back with us until we were half done with our meal. Once he did she asked for more cheese and bacon which I never saw in the first place and he told her there would be an additional charge. This is when we let him know what he had told her he was going to do about the salad in the first place was never done and then came the attitude like we were wasting his time as he set down the smallest cup of cheese I've ever seen in my life as if to say, that's all you are getting along with some ranch dressing. This was on the menu as the Million Dolar Cobb Salad for I believe it was around $14. This salad was not worth $8
I ordered the French Dip sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese. Upon arrival, to the table, the sandwich was of good size with a nice bun, however, the Au Jus was just tepid and by the end of the sandwich, it was cold. The Mac and Cheese were served in a gravy boat style dish and was only warm also. She was having so much trouble with the salad and the waiter I knew we were tight on time at this point so I just ate it instead of sending it back. The manager came to our table to see how everything was as we were finishing up we told her about the salad the waiter and the temperature of our food. She said she wanted to make us happy so she wanted to give us a free appetizer card for the next time we were in. After paying the bill the manager never came back to the table, so we asked a waitress to find her for us. When we were just about to leave the restaurant the manager approached us and gave us both an appetizer card, I would have preferred If she had taken care of the bill because I think that would have been the proper thing to do with all the problems we had with a simple salad and a french dip sandwich with macaroni and cheese. I still tipped the waiter. We had 30 minutes to get to 7th street in Charlotte from Concord, we made it on time.

{"text":"This place sucks. The food is so expensive and tastes like shit. The gm is a nazi psycho who treats all employees like garbage so obviously theyre not in the best mood when they serve you. i hate them. fridays at home rules way harder than this stupid place"}
{"text":"I wish this was a 1/2STAR rating scale, because I would give this location a 3.5/6ish, and if it wasn't for the bartender it probably be a lower rating.  We walked in, (understandable only like 2 wait staff on the floor, you may have to wait a short time before being acknowledged) buuuuuut, this *individual (*I want to say something else but trying to keep it PG).....so this *individual looked us Up n Down, we made eye contact and went on with what she doing.  Now this is not the part that made me mad, after taking the order she turned on her heel and heading *herself (*once again there is a different adjective and noun pairing that I would like to use, keeping is PG).  Customer service, - I'll be w/ you in a moment OR Someone will be w/ you in a moment.  Don't have us standing there looking crazy and shit.   Needless to say we end up walking to the bar and sat down.

However, the bartender Nicki made up for the initial experience.  When we walked up she just put some glasses in the sanitation sink and placing and order.  While all that was happening, an order was dropped off to be served.  Nicki completed the order entry, turn to the right and said: \"I'll be w/ you in a moment\".  Thank you for your awesome customer service Nicki, it is greatly appreciated.  She was amazing, funny girl, every time she walked by to check on us we were cracking jokes, laughing hard. My personal opinion, it looks like she likes her job a lot.  Happy employees make for a happy customer, so as for the experience w/ the 1 chick when we 1st walked in to Nicki at the bar. 

We swing for late night happy hour, apps are 1/2 and 'drinks' ranging from $3.50 to $7.00.  Go try the FRIEND BRUSSEL SPROUTS, delicious! Pan fried (I think, don't quote me) in butter, lemon, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, pair with what I would consider food gold.  When making in-house croutons this can make or break your meal, ok maybe it's just me.  You can have in-house croutons and it be all bad, no flavor, too big, over/under cooked, etc. These were spot on, just the right amount of crunch and the croutons soaked up the balsamic reduction but still maintained it structure...OMG, I want some right NOW!  Very good stuff, the brussel sprouts and Nicki save this from a 1STAR s#!t talking review."}
{"text":"Took the HR team here today for lunch. First clue what's to come is the place was almost empty at noon. The people working there seem bored and/or very unhappy - which is probably why the food was overcooked and dry. I won't be back because unhappy people make sad food and I like happy people making happy food!"}
{"text":"This is the nastiest TGI Fridays I have ever been to the hostess didn't even acknowledge me the bartender honestly hasn't washed her hair in weeks and the place is absolutely filthy.Thank god I don't live in monroeville. I would die. They need to bring John Tafford in this place!"}
{"text":"The food was great, service was fast. Normally I don't eat at chain restaurants but it was near the hotel I was staying in was next door."}
{"text":"Tonight was by far the most horrible dining experience of my life. I ordered a cocktail from the bar and as I was sipping away something poked me in my gum and when I closed my mouth all of the way I realized there was glass in my mouth. That's right glass from a broken glass. I pulled at least 3 pieces of glass from my mouth. I know accidents happen but as far as customer service no one had any urgency around helping me. I don't know if I swallowed any and all I was asked was if I wanted another drink. Ummm. No ma'am. I asked for the manager 3 different times and after 45 minutes he came. The staff including the manager was really nice but not trained at all to deal with this issue. As a customer that frequently visits that chain of restaurant I expected customer service and I did not receive that. I expected the manager to offer at minimum a discount on my food but I was not offered any type of customer service. I had to ask for the cocktail to be removed from my ticket and I had to ask to fill out an incident report. I took a picture of everything because this staff is not trustworthy at all. Not to mention outside of that we had to wait 44 mins for 2 appetizers. They even gave us small plastic cups to drink out of because the waitress said and I quote\"they broke all of the glasses last night\" so now I'm thinking did they break them at the bar??? Am I the only customer that had to chew on glass? I work in customer service so I know things can get out of hand but I also expect exceptional customer service. And I for one will never visit that location on WT Harris again. I actually told them a couple times that they may want to check the sugar at the bar because I'm not sure if that's where the glass came from and it took me saying that 3 times to say that for someone to actually check it. I am highly upset and disappointed at the service I received."}
{"text":"The review is for the family-friendly menu as well as the \"2 for $10\"  (you get more for this one, though) or 3 for $20 deals. Bar is the left (separated by the door), restaurant takes up the majority of the right side of the space.Atmosphere is less kitschy, used to be like Applebees.  

We were seated promptly and were waiting for the other half of our party. Service is a little slow (which is typical), but there was a healthy lunch crowd (it got really loud towards the end of our meal). It did take a while to order. But service got better as we got our food and the server did check on us several times during our meal. Looking around, I noticed the same thing happening, people waiting for their food (so we weren't the only ones). 

We hadn't been here recently, until yesterday for lunch with the family (to celebrate my husband's birthday). For Stripes members, complimentary chips and salsa. We- the adults- tried the 2 for $10 deal, entree, plus and appetizer or dessert. I got the chicken fingers (8 pieces) and fries/unseasoned- pretty large plate of food and potstickers (didn't dip it). I was trying to get the reasonable meal with the least amount of sodium damage (pregnant and watching my diet) so I was pretty much guessing (yeah, good luck to me, right?! just trying to find a happy medium). The potstickers were very good and tasty (6 pieces) though I didn't dip it in soy sauce. The fingers were heavily breaded and crispy, and though it was a large plate, would probably not order this again. I only had two pieces (took it home for my mom). The fries were skin-on, crispy, and thin. My husband got the angus burger- he really liked his burger, came with fries and the oreo madness (two pieces pretty much like mini ice cream sandwiches). Dessert was the best part- very good. This I would order again! (I'd probably order the korean tacos next time).  

My sister got the parmesan crusted chicken and peanut butter chocolate pie. Hers came with small cheese balls and tomatoes My sister said that her dessert was very rich, like a truffle, and only ate half, gave the rest to my older nephew. My brother-in-law got the burger (came with fries) and mozzarella sticks (these were flattened). My older nephew got the chicken fingers plate- he finished it (smaller than the adult plate), and my other nephew got the cheese pizza and fries plate (he didn't finish it, but he doesn't like eating burned food). They also had some mozzarella sticks. They also got kid-size milkshakes."}
{"text":"Though I can't honestly say I am nuts for the food, nor ever have been. At least this place is a short walk away from my hotel and provides food and drinks. A few laughs for sure, people watching, and observing a handful of other people, whom I imagine are on business travel as well, sitting at the bar by themselves endlessly staring at their iphone or blackberry (like I do); pounding back drinks and burning off the idle time the best they can.

That's basically what this place is for in my eyes!

Normally you wouldn't catch me in a TGI Friday's because it usually consists of sub average food, stuff that is just OK but nothing overall exciting, and to be honest they tend to be good for after work drinks and or a luncheon with co-workers. A place to pound back a few beers, talk shit about other coworkers, and maybe eat a few nacho's to only go home and talk about the drunk co-worker who had one to many and began making inappropriate comments to office hottie.

We've all been in this movie!

However, this spot is actually not half bad. I am not raving about the food here, more less the overall entertainment value it has played while on travel for business. Simply put, this is a spot I can walk in, hit the bar, order me some avg food, have a few drinks while watching the game, and at the end of it all; if all was calculated out correctly. I've spend a good hour or two which is an hour or two I am not stuck in a hotel room.

That said, this place is great for that. If you are traveling for business, bored, and need a simple place to hangout, grab a bite, and a drink. This is for you.

The staff here is really cool too. That helps with the environment for sure. I've gotten tips from what there is to do around here to general good conversations. Which is nice for not feeling like a complete loner who is perched at a bar looking at an iphone, staring at the other loners doing the same thing!"}
{"text":"I don't find TGI Fridays great anyways, but the one at gold coast isn't amazing in comparison to the others, frequently on all shifts , I noticed the employees are forgetful and unenthusiastic.  I suggest grabbin a bite nearby at Chinatown or Rio."}
{"text":"your average Joe bar n restaurant.  it's a lot better after a night of losing on the tables and machines.  it's not a bad choice if you're not in the old for Asian food"}
{"text":"TGI Fridays is a staple for Mentor. I remember coming to this place 20 years ago. The food is always good and if not what you thought they make it right. 

Service also is great. Love this place."}
{"text":"The best steak ever, the staff is very friendly.  I had the steak and shrimp with sweet potatoe fries and jasmine rice.  I will be going back alot of times."}
{"text":"Bad service by the hostess. She was rude and obnoxious. Very short and quick tempered. I should have researched their 2.5 star review.  
Good work TGI FRIDAY'S you have some of the worst service in a town with great service."}
{"text":"So got sat at the table the host didn't look friendly no smile or hello, then got sat at the table and she gives the menu and walks away.... Next the sever comes up like he's in a gang and takes the order with a horrible tone of voice.... I must say I hate going to places with horrible customer service."}
{"text":"-The food was edible but that's about it. 
-the service was terrible in the fact that the check was wrong, waiter was inattentive, he asked if we wanted tabasco then forgot about it. Bloody Mary was and and weak. I advise anyone to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the most questionable meals I have ever ate...

Me:what time do you close?
Bartender: soon
Me: what time is soon?
Bartender: 2am

...it's 11:15pm.... that should have been my queue to run. But, I was tired so I gave it a shot..

Have you ever had a 6 minute Collins? Me neither.. and considering I was the ONLY person at the entire bar, I was impressed. But, alas... it did not live up to the build up.. not sure wtf took 6 minutes (I bartend for a living)

I don't know what compelled me to order the lobster and sirloin in the middle of the desert, but I did and I regret it..asked for the steak medium, got it beyond well-done.. I had ordered my food to-go and asked for butter. There was none.. everything just tasted off. I stayed at this hotel on a whim due to pricing restrictions but if I ever did have to stay here again, I would never eat at this TGIFs again. Yuck"}
{"text":"I know TGIFridays is a chain, so it should be expected that the food is always the same. However, I was extremely dissatisfied with this location. The service was lacking, our waiter only checked on us once, which was my only opportunity to tell him I had been given a hamburger when I ordered a chicken sandwich. After waiting nearly 20 more minutes for my meal, the cheese wasn't even melted but the bread was soggy. I probably will never come back to this particular TGIFridays seeing how disappointing the food was."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! The service was bad and the food was worse. They seated us and then never came back. We had to flag someone down. My wife and I ordered steak. She asked for well done, I asked for medium. Both were very underdone. Mine was bloody and so tough I could not eat it. My wife sent her's back and they still could not get it right. After all the problems the waitress told us that the meal was free, then brought us a bill. The manager knew about the situation but never talked to us, because they had to make a phone call. That's what we were told. What is more important, the customer at a table or the phone? I know I will never go back and I'm telling everyone not to go there either."}
{"text":"1st waiter was awesome:
But-
Started with brown guacamole in appetizer
Asked for water w/lemon got water no lemon. Ordered chicken with broccoli & baked potato fully loaded. Baked potato had no butter hence not loaded. Broccoli was going bad where it had black on it and it was turning yellow and tasted rotten. I asked a blonde waitress for a to go box and she must have been having a bad day cause she looked at my plate that I hadn't touched and was so rude cause I asked for just a to go box. Mngr comes to the table and offered to give me a piece of cake or something . This industry is horrible I remember when a piece of hair was in someone's food they at least comped ur plate mine was only rotten after everything else and nothing. So I found my coupon to at least use to comp myself. This was sad cause they New they were wrong as I left they added to this and gave me no reciept . I went back in that's for sure and got it. I use to love TGIF! USE TO! That's not how to treat a customer."}
{"text":"SIT AT THE BAR!! Fair mixture on drinks (not watered or soda'd down) and good music (at the bar). Of course the food is tastey."}
{"text":"This Mayfield location is just garbage...from dirty tables dirty silverware to dirty menus..everything sticky and just gross...to our server literally just wanting nothing to do with us..kind of mind blowing considering tips is all servers survive on. 2 out of 4 entree orders were wrong. Got my French onion soup.was actually great soup..but it would have been great if I got my iced tea before it!!! With all the great restaurants popping up..you couldn't pay me to go back there."}
{"text":"This location of Friday's is in the New Orleans hotel, I don't know if the employees are having problems, but they pick and choose who they want to serve.its just not right. Especially at the bar, the young red head lady just ignore you, this is the second time this has happen to me. I will never eat at this location again. They all need a class on customer service, are don't work there. What ever happen to just being respectful."}
{"text":"This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho"}
{"text":"Our waiter, a fellow Penn Stater, was very respectable, quick and attentive. My family goes here quite often and is rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"I stop here a lot going back and forth to the hospital for my doctor visits. We usually get an appetizer, as long as I get mozzarella sticks I don't care what the rest of them get. I always get a burger here, they are GREAT! I do think at times the service is very slow, but other times you can walk right in, then right out. I also I think sometimes it is very loud in there. Sometimes I feel like I have to yell to be heard. Great place for a burger."}
{"text":"I ordered clam chowder, it looked like \"grey mucus\". The waitress apologized and exchanged it for cheese & broccoli soup, which looked ok, so I eat it. Four hours later I had debilitating stomach cramps and  threw up twice (cheese, broccoli & mucus). This place is dangerous and I will not eat at any TGI Friday's ever again.!!!  \"Thank GOD I Survived\" !"}
{"text":"Business looked clean and we were seated promptly. We did notice there were 3 staff sitting out front of the building smoking. Typically it's not fashionable to have three staff smoking at the same time. I assumed they were bored. We were seated and our waitress attended us within 5 minutes. We all order alcoholic beverages and they arrived within 10 minutes. We ordered  brownie sundae, a sandwich, and some sort of chicken appetizer. Food was good and without issues. 

I did notice all of the waitresses and bartenders eating throughout our entire visit. They would be greeting customers with food in their mouth, chomping away. I found that to be very unprofessional. I also watched one bartender. Make a disguised cup of mixed alcoholic items that she sipped throughout her shift. It looked as if it was a peanut butter jar container or something similar looking. I always witnessed a male customer come up to the bar and have a shot with an employee who must have just got off duty, im assuming. The employee said it's on the house. I figure the franchise owners may want to address these issues. I wonder where the manager was??

I wish I didn't withers all of this because I would have rated it much higher however, the issues I noticed, although I'm unaffected, changed my perception of the company and how it's managed."}
{"text":"I've been exploring the area a bit and was happy to see a Friday's so close to work so decided to tag along with the a coworker today for lunch. It really wasn't busy at all around 11:30 and conveniently located right on 5th avenue. We were sat right away and water was brought out for us. That is about where the good ends.

We both ordered from the pick 2 lunch menu, both got salads while I got Spicy chicken sliders and my friend got the chicken mac n' cheese. After about 15 minutes of no salads being brought out we asked about them and were told by the waiter that salads come out with the entree. We politely asked if we could have them first and he responded with, \"I guess so if you want.\" Almost as if it were a burden. Salad normally comes out first or am I wrong? The food finally made it about 20 minutes after ordering and I was fairly disappointed by the sliders. Just a chicken tender cut in half on a slider bun with the smallest amount of sauce I have ever seen. You couldn't even taste it. Spicy it was not. We had to track the waiter down for the check and when we tried to pay he was visibly goofing around in the kitchen. My friend who offered to pay had to leave her card with me because she had a meeting to get to. Very unprofessional waitstaff in my opinion. I finally got the waiter's attention and paid after a few minutes.  And the aforementioned waters...not refilled once in an hour!  Terrible experience for an eatery in a prime location!"}
{"text":"Dinner after our movie date night! It was a clean setup and friendly service. We got seats in a timely manner. Our waitress was funny and gave great dessert suggestions so I truly appreciated that.

I wasn't too happy at the end of the meal when I saw the bill. Not because I was charged for something I didn't get but because for the amount we paid we could've gotten the French market buffet next door all day pass. I got ribs and lobster so the prices seemed appropriate. However, after it was time to pay one tends to correlate the price you pay to the satisfaction one feels. And I didn't feel fully satisfied. The food was good but not $60 good. The only thing I really enjoyed was the Oreo ice cream pie dessert. If it hadn't been for that I would've probably given a 1 star review. Also like I said, my server was nice so luckily for TGIF it was fine there too.

But from now on I will probably go there just for that dessert, nothing else there is worth that kind of money."}
{"text":"Can't expect too much out of TGI Friday's. I mean, the food is basically microwaveable packages. However, this place is still a fun place to go with friends and just drop buy in the airport before a flight. Environment always gives party vibes and the lighting adds to the fun feeling."}
{"text":"Despite always saying after every visit we'll never go this TGI Fridays again, we clearly have Alzheimers disease because we forget and go back only to be disappointed once again.

Every time it's something different.  Sometimes it's the service. But usually it's the food.  It either takes too long, causes illness, or is just plain wrong.

Tonight we had a wonderful waitress,  but ended up waiting almost a full hour after our steaks came out completely undercooked.  Mine came back the second time just fine but my husband's was still raw in the center. So they cooked a new one. On top of that, they had no beer on tap, due to a cooler problem and the one bottled beer we wanted they were out of.  I mean, what are the odds?

Three separate managers came to apologize,  but when we got the check, it was clear they weren't really sorry.  I didn't ask for a discount but they really should have given one.

Word to the wise...there isn't anything on their menu worth $21. Most especially their 10 oz. Ribeye.  Just pathetic.

Hopefully we won't forget again ...I really couldn't justify ever going back here."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night with some new friends from Canada.  Food was much better than what's served in the one in New Castle, DE.  Bonus, happy hour prices all day Sunday!  Service was so so."}
{"text":"This location has the slowest service. I have an hour lunch and get back late every time. The menus were soggy and falling apart. The waitress didn't come check on us and was quick to leave the table. I never got a drink refill. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"While TGI Friday's doesn't exactly offer up the best food you'll ever eat, this particular location has provided my wife and I with a little renewed faith in the chain. Would I go out of my way to go here, probably not, but we've often stopped in because of it's convenience and I've yet to regret it.

First, it's a newer location, so it's open and really nice inside, which is inviting. The outside seating is a huge bonus, too! The service has been really good the few times that we've stopped in, and the food has been better than we both remembered coming out of a TGI Friday's kitchen. Now, Friday's isn't even close to the best chain, food-wise, but everyone should know that going in and adjust his or her expectations accordingly.

On non-game days, it's a chill place to stop in for a quick bite, as it's never been busy while we were there. Take the nice atmosphere (inside or out), add good service and predictable food quality, and you've got yourself a fail-safe option for a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to get a beer and 1/2 price appetizers, (they now serve Goose Neck IPA!!!!!)
The bar side servers are always on the ball, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Worse service of our lives! The hostess made us wait (no lines!) for 10 minutes at the door. We sat ourselves at the bar ! Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"We haven't been to TGIFridays in a VERY long time but tonight we decided to test it out since we've been seeing the new commercials with the ribs. We were reminded quickly why we haven't been going to this chain. We received our food and were not amused. The plates were really big but the quality didn't match up. The ribs were small even with my husband ordering the full slab, ribs were \"ok\". My son ordered the half portion ribs and had a TON of fries on the plate. I ordered the half slab ribs and shrimp. My shrimp were overcooked and my fries were actually cold and stale. I mentioned this to one of the servers since our server hadn't checked up on us since bringing our food out. She immediately got new fries which were \"ok\" but were not fresh out of the fryer. If it was fresh out of the fryer, I would be able to pick it up with my fingers.  Simply put, the $20-$25 per plate price that we paid was not worth the money when we can pay the same price at another restaurant and get better tasting food."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in Fridays what happened here? The Uncc one is straight hood this one makes food dry and poorly cooked. It took 15 min just to get a water.  My niece's steak wasn't cooked proper our chips took 15 min to get my mom's beer refill took 15 min. The theme here I guess is 15 min or more per item."}
{"text":"This place has been going down hill for awhile which is a shame as I do love the JD menu.  I think we have reached full hood status here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour and our server was Alonzo who was wonderful!! He never missed a beat. Not only were our drinks serves promptly, but he offered us coffee, on him, before we left. Please ask for him if you stop by."}
{"text":"The service wasn't very good, my order came out wrong and was never fixed and the chicken was burnt."}
{"text":"Ok I have said it before and I will say it again, I will go almost anywhere that sends me a coupon! Such is the case with TGI Friday's. The place is a little dark, but the food is very good for what it is and the staff very nice. So I say sign up on their web site for the loyalty program and give it a try, don't be so snobby. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with Geri and Chuck to have a couple of beverages and appetizers and the food was ok but the service stunk!  Sat at the bar which is normally good service but of course our bartender does not understand, \"Customer Service\"!  Ordered and asked for chips and salsa and I had to get up and go to the front door to get them delivered.  Smallest appetizers that I have ever seen at a TGI Fridays.

I am very pleased to say that I won't come back to this location!!  Good luck in keeping your clients."}
{"text":"Great deal on the appetizers (they were all good) and BEST service from our waitress that I've had anywhere in ages. Happily tipped 20% and will return. I wish I'd have gotten her name so I could give her recognition!"}
{"text":"I have been disappointed with T.G.I. Fridays for several years, this time around, my opinion has not changed. I will keep this short....

I haven't been to a T.G.I. Fridays since 2004. Each time i've gone, I felt like I was ripped off. On this most recent trip, I still felt like I got ripped off. The food was pitiful, and the price was outrageous for what I got.

I ordered the Sizzlin chicken. In the menu, it shows chicken on a skillet smothered in cheese and had green bell peppers, red bell peppers, SOME onions and mashed potatoes on the side. Mine looked NOTHING like it showed in the picture. The meal came out on a skillet, but the chicken (the smallest piece they could find) was sitting on top of the cheese (im talkin a pinch of cheese) not smothered at all, I got 1 slice of green bell pepper, and it felt like half an onion! My total meal was over $20! What a rip! I won't be going to another Friday's for a long time again, or until they come off their prices for the food they serve.

I do have to take the time to point out that the waitress was very nice, made sure our glasses were kept full even when she had a table outside that was 10 or 12 people. She did a great job, too bad I don't remember her name."}
{"text":"I used to come here more often but this place is fading fast. Arrived on a Sunday at 7.20pm .... Restaurant has maybe 4 tables with dinners. Waited patiently at Hostess stand. Couple waitresses smiled in our direction but nobody felt it nevessary to come and seat us.
We left after several minutes feeling not welcome and took our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty good experiences all the times we've been here.

We love the Jack Daniels grilled items and sauce. Parmesan steak fries are amazing by the way.

This time our server Christina (with red tinted hair) was pretty awesome. Our drinks was always refilled and we had everything we needed from the get go. She did an awesome job and I would recommend to ask for her, especially since past reviewers are unhappy with the other waitresses service.

Food is pretty decent for a chain restaurant. Nothing too spectacular, however nothing extremely horrible. For thai tacos, two steaks and shrimp,two sides, and sodas the bill was $61, not bad!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! I should have trusted the Yelp reviews! We sat down and ordered our drinks and an appetizer, our appetizer came in about ten minutes... Still no drinks... Or silverware... Or napkins or extra plates for the appetizer. So our drinks finally come and we have to ask for plates and napkins and silverware because apparently the waiter didn't know we would need those things. The waiter took his time talking to the other employees right in front of us not even considering that we were waiting for him to come back to us. We order our food and it comes about 20 minutes later tasting like a microwave dinner and I made the mistake of asking for some ranch dressing. The waiter said oh sure! And never came back lol we could see him talking to everyone not even trying to help us. He noticed we were finished and took our plates with no mention of the items he forgot to bring. Also there was a child at a table next to us that dropped a GLASS and no one came to clean up the glass or the water that was on the floor! Multiple employees walked right by it pretending not to see it. Dangerous much??!! Children + broken glass + a wet floor ?? Hello! Where's the dang manager?? Ugh!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable service.

It has been a very long time since i have actually gotten up and left a restaurant because of bad service, but let me tell you, it was the best thing that I did this evening.

My family decided to take a trip to TGI Fridays because it has been a while since we have visited this location and we were craving the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.

Our visit was on Saturday evening. We arrived around 8:40, actually got a front parking spot in front of the door, and had less than a five minute wait. So far so good, then we were seated and promptly entered the \"twilight zone\".  Our server came over after about 7 minutes, took our drink order and we took the opportunity to  order the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.  Now, after 8 minutes our fried green beans and wasabi ranch arrived, but we still have yet to receive our drinks. We had two waters and a sweet tea.  We were told that it would be a few minutes before the sweet tea was ready.  By now,  two tables have been seated a two top right behind us and a four top across from us. They were promptly greeted  by our server and they began their dining experience.

We ordered a Jack Daniel's cheeseburger, the sizzling chicken and shrimp and a Friday's® House Salad (Romaine, red cabbage, grape tomato, cucumber, mixed cheese and focaccia croutons with choice of dressing and a hot garlic bread stick.) I have added the description as shown on the website and menu. Ours did not come with the bread stick.  When we asked the server, he stated that it did not come with one, we stated that the menu said it did.  After my wife finished the salad he obliged with 2 hot garlic bread sticks, but what was the point, the salad was already finished.

So thirty minutes passed and each of the tables received their salads, and meals that came in after us, we felt we had been neglected enough.

This is where I approached the front hostess stand, requested the manager, and let her know how this was just unacceptable.  The manager stated that it was just a few more minutes, and I let her know that my family had already left and was in the car.  As a courtesy, I let her know that I was willing to pay for the tea, salad and fried green beans, but we were not going to hang around any longer.  She insisted that we wait and have it boxed to go, but I declined, as it should have been presented as ordered in a timely manner at our table, not in a to go box.  (Just remember the food was still not even ready).  The manager said it was not necessary to pay, but this is just not acceptable at a dining establishment.

I am getting really frustrated at the level of incompetence in businesses, and the lack of willingness to provide an effort to do very basic skills. Please take a moment and train the employees of the importance of serving others by understanding the menu and by taking care of the needs in a timely manner.  If one cannot handle more than 4 tables, then one may need a new job.

I am pretty sure that by the other yelp reviews, I am not the only one who is NOT thinking TGI Friday!

Just on a side note: Had I not stopped by the hostess stand and ask for the manager, the server would have never noticed we were gone?  Now that's sad!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, drink prices were good, service was slow.  Pretty much your usual TGI Friday's, won't kill you but nothing to write home about.  Tons of TV's over bar for games was nice...the tv's being controlled by the sportsbook not so nice."}
{"text":"Ghetto and ratchet. Is all i can say. Walked in about 830pm on a monday and all i heard was loud ass music bc they have karokoe on mondays. First walked in and was not acknowledged at all. 5 min later we were finally seated and of course they werent busy to be having to wait that long. We were sat at a dirty booth with trash in the midddle of the floor. So we asked to be seated elsewhere. Had to wait15 min for another seat even though 50 tables were empty. Wen sat again never was acknowledged. We left 15 min later without ever being greeted for a drink or order"}
{"text":"Went for a girls night. We wanted the app special. Service was super slow. After about 20 minutes we finally were greeted & order taken. Then it took forever for our waters to arrive. 
Shortly after receiving the 1 st order of apps I ended up with a medical emergency in which I passed out. Several customers came to my aid despite the manager being notified & being asked to call 911- in which she refused & told my friend to do it. 
Thank you to those who assisted me

Shockingly we had to wait for our bill in which we were charged fully even though we only had 1 serving each of an appetizer. I needed to leave since I was not feeling well. Not that I was looking for a free meal but I felt it in poor taste since we didn't have much at all - the servings were really small

The fried pickles I ate were awful. I've never seen such a weird cut like this."}
{"text":"Food and service left much to be desired. I realize this is a TGI Fridays in the middle of an off the strip casino, however it does have a brand image to uphold, and I feel it did a very poor job in doing that.

It was around lunch time on a week day, and while the casino was hopping and buzzing with flashing lights and bells with patrons feverishly flushing their life savings away, TGI Fridays was dead. I was the only person in the establishment, and I still had horrible service. After I was seats, I waited... and waited... and waited... I eventually found someone to take my drink order and I got an appetizer. 
15 minutes later I placed my order and received my drinks, and after around 15-20 more minutes I inquired as to the appetizer (yeah, remember that appetizer I ordered), I was told it was never put in, and I told them to forget it... 

My food eventually arrived, and it was horrible. Im just going to leave it at that.... Just walk away. You have got a better chance at coming out positive on a penny slot than not being disappointed here."}
{"text":"cant go wrong with Jack Daniels sauce meals. Most of them are pretty good."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are too small. We spent over 40 dollars and still left hungry. The flavor pf the good was good but not enough.waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"good food but portions are now alot smaller, service is good but sometimes a little off. 

hell they got my order completely wrong before. the atmosphere is great if you like it loud like the bar. the jack daniel's sauce is fabulous. the steaks are good, the shrimp is good too. 


waiters/waitresses: showing off by not writing down my order will instantly lose your tip. it is not impressive when everytime it is wrong. and honestly if i wanted my s*%$ messed up i'd go to a fast food joint where nobody speaks english and take my chances there.

drinks refills: if i drink 2 glasses of whatever before my food comes, offer to leave a pitcher at the table or be prepared to run your ass off and not bitch about.

3rd: when we ask for something \"special\" as in not the way it is stated on the menu-do it!! i'm the one paying for this. i certainly don't feel i need to remind you when you bring my food out.

overall-i really enjoy the food & drinks at friday's but the servers? and i'm the type who leaves a standard 30% tip unless not deserved and believe me if we leave \"no\" tip we are taking it up with the manager. $60 bucks for lunch"}
{"text":"Great Late Night EATS!!

OPEN LATE til  3am and also serves breakfast @ 6am (Inside the Gold Coast) 

Very seldom is there a wait.

Great happy hour specials Jack Daniels Menu is GREAT & sandwiches are good too.

Service can go either way but they have tons of TV's, Load Music and a lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have never thanked God for Friday's but it was late, options were scarce and I was overruled on this occasion.  Immediately I was greeted by stench and a slippery floor so pregnant ladies beware (my sister is pregnant and was having a hard time).

Our waiter was pretty charismatic and dealt well with my companions (I.e. my pastor was with me and asked if they could play Gospel music and other annoying little things). He wasn't that speedy but he was nice. 

I ordered Cajun chicken and shrimp after I was assured it was tasty. My table mates ordered ribs, chicken wings, shrimp, broccoli and fries respectively. 

When my food came out I knew it would be trash. Immediately. On sight. Throw the whole plate away. 
I did not spot a single spec of seasoning. No pepper, no Cajun.. nothing Jesus. The sauce was a weird pastel yellow color.. yikes. I tried it anyway..., gross. Worse than a knorr pasta side. My sister suggested I add the Cajun butter to it... took ten minutes to come out but it made a WORLD of difference.

3/4 ribs looked really dry. But the jack Daniels ribs looked superb. Reports say the fries were eh as was the broccoli.

Overall not a good time for my tummy but I made it through."}
{"text":"I took my father who is 82 years old and in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's to this establishment for his birthday before taking him to the Penguins game last week. The wait staff almost completely ignored us and it took about 45 minutes before we got our food which by the way was completely cold. About halfway through our meal my father had an accident and the waitress approached our table and told me \"If you don't get that smelly b***ard out of here I'm calling the police\". I explained to her my fathers condition and then took him to the restroom to clean him up. Upon exiting the restroom there were 2 Pennsylvania state police officers waiting for us and after talking to them they decided that my father and I had committed no crimes and left rather annoyed. The manager said he was sorry for our inconvenience but it would be best if we never came back. I cannot believe that something this appalling is allowed to occur in such a well known franchise chain and I highly doubt I will ever return to a TGI Fridays ever again in my life"}
{"text":"Tasty food, little slow to come out. Friendly service.  Good quality wings with tasty sauces.  Wife's salad was very small for $8; only 1-1 1/2 strawberry in vegetarian salad, definitely needs improvement.  Appetizer trio is tasty and makes a decent lunch (albeit $13)."}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible food , place turned super ghetto . Gross , avoid at all costs..   6pm on a Friday evening .. what happened to the days of an hour wait.. place was dead.. now I know why!!"}
{"text":"this place is normally very good but this time my dinner was gross  i had the chicken and shrimp. the chicken was small with no taste and the shrimp was in a tomato sauce. shrimp in tomato sauce is a no no in my book."}

{"text":"Love the happy hour!

This T.G.l Fridays is located in the Orleans Casino which is the closes one to me because I live in the far South West of Las Vegas. First impressions cute place, my boyfriend and I were seated by the bar area in these cute little booths perfect for 2 people. I didn't know it but I went during happy which was awesome, they had a small but nice selection of half off drinks and appetizers. The customer service here was awesome, our waiter wow! I even think he was a trainee maybe thats why he was so nice. Usually I don't fall for up sales but this guy could talk. So he up sold me into ordering some onion soup. Which was delicious, I love onion soup but T.G.I fridays recipe was a lot different then the onion soups I've been eating idk it was delish! I order a tomato basil pasta that my friend suggested me. The portions were huge! which is totally okay with me I love taking home left overs. In total two entree's a few shrimp cocktails, drinks, and onion soup came out to about $70 for two. Decent price for a great date night."}
{"text":"I've become a bit of a regular and the staff has really improved. Waitstaff is attentive and everyone is very friendly. Jennifer is the best. Bar tenders are great and it's a really nice place to watch the game or just relax. 

Food is good for the price. Nice variety and good specials."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. We received our discounted appetizers, then our waitress disappeared for about 45 minutes. When we finally got her attention, she appeared shocked that we didn't receive our main courses. She went to the back and returned stating their system was down. An hour later, our food comes out (looked nothing like the picture). Top it off, we did not even receive our full order. We were missing a side dish."}
{"text":"I was starving after work as usual so I decided to stop by this Friday's. I was a little skeptical at first due to the rating but I figured it can't be that bad!!!!!! I was immediately greeted at the door by the hostess and I opted to sit at the bar. It was pretty empty but I'm sure it's due to it being a Tuesday and in the afternoon. I'm not complaining about that. I love quick service! The bartender was pretty friendly and he reminded me of \"Mr. Clean\" lol. I ordered up a Ultimate Long Island to start me off with the spinach dip. At first I thought the drink was pretty weak as I could not taste too much alcohol. But boy did it creep up on me!!!! -_- The Spinach dip was pretty bland which sucked. I've had much better tasting spinach dip from other TGI Friday's. That didn't discourage me from ordering more though. I ordered the new bacon Mac n cheese bites as well as the all american double burger!!!!! Bam!!!! They're back on track! Did I mention happy hour is 11am-2am so ummm, half off!!!!! The bites are like heaven in a little ball and the burger was kick ass! They certainly redeemed themselves. I topped it off with an Ultimate Margarita and was out the door. Overall, my experience was good. This is Friday's so you get what you get. Nothing fancy but definitely gets the job done. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the spinach dip not being up to standard. Don't hesitate to stop by for Happy Hour. It's a deal!

The Good:
-Fast service
-Strong drinks
-No crowd
-Friendly service 

-The Bad: 
-Spinach dip was ehhhhh (Not so good)"}
{"text":"Love TGI Friday's chain, however....came to this location inside the Casino to have some drinks and dinner at Friday's, sat down at the bar and the long brown haired female bartender came up to us and was, well \"buzzing, and not naturally\"....she was so obnoxious, loud, unnaturally high? that we ordered one drink and left, weird experience."}
{"text":"Shame on them. There is a reason you see a good number of these going out of business. Arrived on a not busy Thursday at almost 9pm. Stood and waited to be seated for almost 10 minutes. There were maybe 25 folks in the whole restaurant. Waitress was not knowledgeable about drink selection then looked put out when I asked her to please find out about a beer she had no clue about that was on tap. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks. Then I asked for a glass and after another 15 minutes I went to the bar and asked the bartender for one myself. Smh.

About 40 minutes we have nothing. My friend ordered a side salad ribs n spinach. I just got an appetizer. She never came back until the food showed and brought my friend the salad with her entree. Then tried to argue that that is normal. Nope side salad comes first or at the minimal at least ask the customer if they want the salad first. My friend comes to this fridays at least once/week. And why are you trying to argue with your customer instead of making her happy?

Food was actually OK but by this time who wants it and we were plenty unhappy. I asked about a birthday dessert for me because my birthday was a few days back. Fridays always does a free dessert for their card members. She says we only do a scoop of ice cream now. Well I can't eat ice cream. Well thats the only thing we do. Really? Even if it will make me sick?  Let me out of here. Darn shame. Used to be my favorite chain"}
{"text":"This Friday's is inside Aliante Casino, so sometimes it can get a little smokey in the waiting area.  As far as chain restaurants go, this one is  pretty normal for a TGI Friday's.  The service is a little slow (consistently) but usually pretty friendly.  

Nothing really stands out as excellent or horrible.  They do offer a military discount though."}
{"text":"It's in Sams Town, and believe it or not this TGI Friday's is pretty adequate.  Often I show up here after most events in Sams Town *Cough*WWE Viewing Parties*Cough* and the service is pretty good.   

You pretty much get what you pay for here, not to say the food is bad, but it's typical food you would get at an Applebees or Chili's.  Just like the star rating says, 3 stars - A OK!

Stop by here if you aren't in the mood to go to the buffet, you'll be satisfied.

{"text":"Food was sub par but the service was horrible. The waiter blamed it on being busy yet the only area with a lot of people was the bar. Maybe 5 tables to be waited on. Sat a good 10 minutes after a waitress said she'd be right with us. Guessing it was more fun to hang in the back near the kitchen chatting with everyone as that seemed to be the thing to do. Food was ok..can't beat the price of $10 all you can eat appetizers. Of the ones we tried the potato skins were the best. Waited several times to have everyone's drinks refilled. Doubtful we will be back"}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER.  Hardly ANYONE in the restaurant and the kitchen is so behind that it takes over 40 min to get a turkey burger and a hamburger!  Then we talked to the mgr and he act like we didn't have a legitimate gripe.  Came out like \"yeah the kitchen is behind that's why I was helping\" but I'm like how is that our fault?  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Tonight's Dinner in Sin City was Absolutely Delicious. Mark is our Server. Upbeat, Great Attitude And Knows The Menu. He gets to know you and then makes menu suggestions to you. We started out with the Happy Hour Drinks. $6.25 for The Ultimate Cocktails. $3.35 for Draft Beers. We had spinach dips. Very different. The tortillas were cooked in a peanut shell shape. This made it easier to crack and scoop the dip. It also came with Guacamole and Red Tomatoes Sauce. 
Dinner: $13:99 for Steak & Lobster. Lobsters had a good Like til it met John J. Sides were Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes. I had the Cod fish cooked extra crispy. It was on point. My only negative was the tartar sauce sat out where it became a hard film across the Top. Mark and I laughed about it. Mike the GM stopped by to ensure our food was good. Just great hospitality. We were both too full for dessert. Maybe next time. We really enjoyed our visit.

{"text":"The service was horrible and the slowest I've ever experienced. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My family and I ate there this past Wednesday for lunch. While we were at lunch we had received a phone call we didn't want to get. The waitress saw that my family was very upset and having an awful day, she told the manager how upset we were. The manager took care of our check and came to our table to see how we were and let us know he took care of it. We never expected that and our family was so touched by this great act of kindness. Our food was delicious (as always) and our server was very sweet. My family and I love this Friday's and eat there quite a bit. I just wanted to share how amazing the staff was to us on such a bad day for us."}
{"text":"Thank You too this amazing staff! My husband and I have been here twice and have had a good experience both times. Food was hot!!!! And taste sooo good. We try different places on our date nights and I promise....you guys always beat the others. I am very picky about my Bloody Mary's and the bartender (Kaylee) made it perfect!!!! I was surprised. Thanks Kaylee. My server Nick was awesome!!!! Thanks Nick for your great service. Also it was nice to have the manager come to our table to check on us to make sure our experience was going well. Thank you... Laneah.... hopefully I'm spelling names right because they were all great!!!! And you deserve the recognition. We will definitely be back!!! With the service you all provided I do not mind spending my bucks :) FYI..... the only reason for 4 stars..... I had to ask for my share plates for my appetizers we ordered.... and the runner only brought one share plate when she clearly seen two of us seated.... I ate my appetizer off a napkin. However all the good things while dining over shadowed the small mistake. Overall we enjoyed the food and service. Thanks."}
{"text":"I just dont enjoy the food here, why I eat here is simply because i can eat here for free, which equates to about twice a year, I will say I did get good service on my latest visit, and the coffee and sweet potato fries are good,but thats about it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed looking at all the items on the wall.  I had ribs.  The meat came right off the bone.  My boyfriend had the salmon."}
{"text":"TGI Fridays was on my radar as soon as the Las Vegas Wranglers kicked Colorados A*% @ the CMYE Hockey party. GO WRANGLERS..WOO HOO! 

Just having stadium nachos and three beers during a 3 hour game was definitely, not the end of my dinner plans for the night. My wife and I rushed over as soon as the game ended and sat in the bar. Our server was Ricky. He's a low talker for sure, but very nice, and knew what to say and when to say it. Fridays is just like every other commercialized restaurant around the universe. Old records, pictures, random rowing oars hanging on the walls, and constant striped patterns everywhere you look (probably even on the toilet seat covers). But they do have one thing that I was super stoked to see. They have a bell that you are supposed to ring if you received excellent service. Now, when I see a bell, all I want to do is ring it.....hard! I was hoping Ricky, would be killer in the service game, so I could ring that bell. Fingers were crossed.

To start out, my wife really wanted the \"Loaded Potato Skins\"(refer to pic), which I have never had before, anywhere. So I figured, alright, I'm down. They weren't exactly \"Loaded\", or very good. Bacon, yes, is always good on everything, BUT.. the thing they go on still has to have flavor! It can't just be some semi-soggy, piece of cardboard. Anyways, no bueno on the skins. 

For our entrees, we both ordered the \"Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich\"(refer to pic). The sandwich looked good, and came with (over)seasoned fries. The sandwich alone was pretty bad, but when you drizzle the delicious Jack Daniels BBQ sauce all over, it becomes pretty tasty! Not amazing by any means, but good. The fries that came with were just way over seasoned. They were so salty, I found myself shaking each one, trying to knock off all the seasoning, before attempting to eat them. During this ongoing battle with my food, Ricky brought both of us refills, made some small chat, and ended with a smile. I'm not big on complaining about food, and figured it wasn't that big of a deal at the time. 

For dessert we had the Chocolate Caramel, and Pecan Explosion (forgot the name, but thought this sounded awesome)(refer to pic). This dessert was actually very good. It put a nice, big smile on our face's. The chocolate brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream, and chopped pecans. Very moist brownie, covered in rich, flowing chocolate sauce. Nomnom.

Before we left, I had to ring that bell. Ricky was a good server, and I went for the bell. Let me tell you..., it felt so good to ring that bell, I would go back just for that feeling again. All-in-all, bell ringing is amazing and everyone should have a good bell ring daily. Head to Fridays for your bell fix today."}
{"text":"Customer service was good. The waiter was awesome . The wait was not too long. The manager is very nice and friendly. She personally checks on us. And the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Food was great. Our waitress, Jen, was very friendly and accommodating. Restaurant is just a bit too noisy.  Great Hollywood memorabilias on the walls. Food portions were average.  The tables were just too close to each other. I could hear the conversations of the table beside ours.  This restaurant is a great casual meeting place to grab something to eat."}
{"text":"Hostess must have been on some downers and greeted with attitude. Then we were greeted by 4 different servers at our table. Granted it was busy, but no organization of what server takes care of what tables/section. Received our food timely. Was quite disappointed that my 6 oz \"sirloin\" was half tendon. Bacon cheese burger was good. Restrooms were dirty and empty of toiletries.  Watched our server bus tables while waiting to pay the tab.  Had to give my debit card to our server so we can leave.  Received our ticket for the over priced crap food. NEVER COMING BACK!!!  It only took 2 years to forget how bad this place is."}
{"text":"I called ahead so we didnt have a long wait. I checked in when i got there recieved text from them as well as downloaded the no wait tip. All was working until we had one in front and nothing socthey sat 4 more tables and we ask and they dropped my reservation. Luckily the lady at the booth saw my text from them and cleaned a table and sat us right away but that was pretty frustrating being 9 months pregnant w a 6 yr old and my mother in law w back problems and having to stand there when we should have been seated. Otherwise the food was great i got endless apps and it was so filling for the money. Service was excellent we had Ed and we was really great made the experience very pleasant so thank you to him. Overall good experiance other than the reservation experiance and FILTHY bathrooms!!"}
{"text":"I sincerly love Fridays, have for a really long time.  And since the one on Independence was taken from me a while ago I always frequent the one on Harris.  So that's where I found my self last night, I got there right before it got really crowded so I thought.  Any who we got seated pretty fast being that it was pretty crowded, our waitress was nice.  We ordered I food pretty fast, so there should have been no reason for us to get it after we had been there almost an hour.  I do understand that it was busy and I do also understand that people order food at the same time being that it's a restaurant that tends to happen.  So when I asked our waitress what the hold up was that was her response every one ordered at the same time.  So any way, we finally got our apps and waited for our food, finally got the food by now I was ready to go irratated by the atmosphere and the fact we got our food pretty late.  The manager made his way to my table and apologized for the slowness and gave us dessert for free which I thought was nice.  Our waitress only refilled our drinks once which I thought was a no no.  But me being me amazingly I didn't complain I just let it be (amazing I know....lol)  So I got some food to go, I didn't look at just for some reason trust that it was correct.  Got home looked at it, and it was missing a key ingredient.  I ordered a grilled chicken balsamic glazed cobb salad, and well I was missing the chicken can you believe that?  So being that it's a good 20 minutes away from me I didn't make the trip back to complain I just called instead.  I talked to the same manager I'm sure that fixed the first problem and he said sorry and is supposed to send me a gift certificate.  Apparently this happens more often than not because he didn't find it strange at all.  Moral is and I know that I don't need to tell you this but always check your food.  I normally do but for some reason I just didn't last night.  Like I said I really love Fridays and I can't say that I will not be back, but I just wish that they would get it together."}
{"text":"Have been going there a lot since it's convenient and open late at night.  Choices are limited in downtown Pittsburgh.   As mentioned before the food is lower quality than other Fridays.  Service is very mixed.  Sometimes its good and many times it's horrible.  At least I'm familiar with the menu and know what I'm getting most of the time.  I have complained to Corporate several times but never heard back.  Have sent food back to the kitchen several times."}
{"text":"Actually, was quite happily surprised in a good way. Went for breakfast and our server  (Brandon???) was great and very polite. (We'd just came from the LVH (former Hilton) hotel and the service there at the restaurants was absolutely terrible (they are totally understaffed and the staff is unfriendly).
Food for breakfast at TGIF was simple but well prepared. Would go back again if we in the area."}
{"text":"It was busy when we went -ever table seemed to be taken- but my party of 5 didn't have to wait to be seated. The hostesses are very young but do their job well. The waiters/waitresses I have had have been good. 

The kids ordered from the kids menu and enjoyed their meals. The adults in the party ordered the appetizer plus meal for $10 which is an amazing deal. It's a bit too much food for me. So, with all these positives you may ask why I gave the restaurant a 3. Well, the food just isn't great. The barbecue chicken flatbread was  dry- the kids loved it though. I didn't love the dragonfire chicken. I didn't like the veggies though. We ordered the strawberry smoothies and they were just bad. They were very icy and didn't have a lot of taste."}
{"text":"This TGI Friday's is located inside The Orleans hotel. It is a smaller size TGI Friday's. I've been here on occassion to get a drink either after a movie or after some bowling. So far, I've always gotten very friendly service at this location. The hostesses are okay, but I've gotten nothing but friendly faces from servers. One of the things I love about this TGI Friday's is that they have the 3 different Ultimate Sangrias. I'm sure it's not the only TGI that has it, but for some reason, the TGI Friday's in the Bay Area do not have the Ultimate Sangrias. And let me tell you, the Ultimate Sangrias are sooooo good here. Great flavorful blend of wine, alcohol, juice, and sliced up fresh fruit in the drink.

As far as the food, there's not much to say about it. It's just greasy, fattening American food. I wouldn't come here for a meal, but I have to admit, a late night drink + one of their appetizers is YUMMY."}
{"text":"I'm updating my old review to 5 stars. We always enjoy getting Ariel as our server at the bar area. She is wonderful and makes eating here almost every other weekend pleasant. 
Not only is she very nice, she is very on point with her service. Something TGIF use to lack in service often was even simply giving customers utensils, and then having to wait forever while your food is getting cold for it. 

Something else is going on too, where the food quality has gone up. It really looks like someone takes the time to do a quality check before the plates leave the kitchen now.

I recommend any of their burgers, BBQ Chicken Salad, any of their dishes with their signature Jack Daniels Glaze, & the Cajun Shrimp Pasta.

As for drinks, try their mules! 
Speaking of which..Happy Hour is a great deal here too, the beer and appetizers top the weekend off. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the worst fridays. I have given them chance after chance and they always get my orders wrong and the quality is severely lacking. Dont eat here"}
{"text":"An entire new team is needed for this location from manager to hostess. The hostess are so rude, the bar area is not walk up first come first serve like most restaurants. The hostess wanted us to wait 15 minutes instead of letting us sit in the bar area where there were tables available. Once sat the waitress is rude and took hour to take order. New team or better customer service training. 
Update after an hour I found the waitress sitting in a booth instead of attending to customers."}
{"text":"We always get treated so awesome at the bar, and the food is simply fantastic (it doesn't get better than the happy hour Sesame Jack Chicken Strips and Tuscan Spinach Dip with a Beachcomb A Rita). Kimberly the bartender is the bomb."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. We showed up early on a Wednesday night and were just trying to enjoy a family date night. Got right in, and realized that the booth was very tiny. When you are a large man, you need some room to breathe. Our server gave us the, \"Be there in a minute\", which is fine, but then that minute turned into five. Then, she did not know how much a Coors Light was, which was fine, except I was only asking because their draft beer machine was out-of-order. Finally, we got our orders put in. Not our orders, but our orders but in. The food was o.k. Meh, describes it. Disappointed that they told me that the beer would be $3.00, but it was $4.35 on the bill. The manager explained that that was the Happy Hour price and changed it. That was a saving grace. Maybe we should have hit Joe's Crab Shack?"}
{"text":"I went in to meet a friend who works at the mall, and she suggested we go here to celebrate me passing an important test. 

I go in, it's about 3 on a Monday, door magically opens by a smiling young girl. I ask to go to the bar. Lesa (maybe) is bartending, she greets me. 

I order, and my friend shows up. We chit chat with her. She is super friendly, and funny. 

Our food comes out fast, we got endless apps, and we chowed down!! We also took part in the 3.00 cocktails. It was awesome!!

We got wings garlic and the Jack Daniels, cheese sticks, and fried green beans. All good going down, but it did upset my stomach later. Which is why I didn't give them 5 stars. 

So to sum it up, all Friday's are basically the same. I've been in them all over the country, and it's always the same interiors. 

My service was phenomenal. Lesa was absolutely the best service I've had out in months. I'm super critical of service too. 
My food was pretty damn good. The drinks were fabulous! The cotton candy drink she made me is fantastic! 

So thank you Lesa for making what I thought was gonna be a shit experience based upon the reviews a great time!!"}

{"text":"Actually fantastic food and great survive. I loved this trip so much.  The waitress was very nice and gave us exactly what we wanted. we didn't wait long at all and the atmosphere was really on point. We got the bbq boneless wings and it was so good. Just enough sauce and just enough ranch to go with it. At the end we had the brownie and ice cream. And honestly it was heaven. I must compare all brownies to that brownie from now on. Thank you."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Never can get out of there under an hour. Will never return. Filled my own drink. If I could give it a negative star I would"}
{"text":"Got a gift card for Christmas and we decided to go even though the reviews are bad- service is horrible! Went Sunday night and there was a 20 minutes wait to get in, when we were finally seated the place was empty. We waited 10 minutes for our server to come over and say he would be back to get our drink orders waited longer. We tried mozzarella sticks and potato skins, they were both okay. When you go to this location if you show them your movie stubs they take off on meal, that's the only reason I gave them two stars. There was a cook or manager in the kitchen yelling out orders and yelling for food to be picked up. I had the steak and ribs, no meat on the ribs they were crunchy, mashed potatoes were salty as heck. Steak was okay. My daughter had the Parmesan garlic chicken she said it was extremely salty. Don't think we would come back for crappy food and spend our own money!"}
{"text":"The bartender Laurie was so nice to have waited on me even though they weren't open yet. I only ordered a water and and side of fruit so Early in the morning. The bar top was clean not sticky and well stocked. Why am I even so awake enough to want to write a review anyways. Lol I would recommend this place if you have time to sit and grab something to eat."}

I orders the parmesan crusted chix salad..SUPER YUMMY. Dad ordered a big fat double stack burger and the two seniors ordered broccoli cheddar soup and fried shrimp and fries.

Our server Bradley was amazeballs."}

I called 3 hours ahead to advise I was coming in with a party of 9 ( 5 adults 4 kids) at 5pm. 
They tell me ok. Take my name and number... And my manager says if your more than 15 minutes late, we're giving you table away... Ahh ok. See you at 5. 

5 o'clock I arrived family in tote.  They say oh part of your party is here. Umm no they're not.  Aren't you Jennifer? Yes I am? Then who's that?  I dunno but not my family.  Oops. Gave your table away.  
You could tell they scrambled to get us a table.   1/2 hour later... No real apologizes, we are sat at a table.  
We wait.... And wait.... No ones even comes by to ask if we wanted water.  
5:50. My family and I just got up and left, other tables were complaining.  
There was no way I was spending 150$+ for crappy service I was BOUND to receive. Disappointed, dissatisfied can't even describe."}
{"text":"Came here before heading out to the strip since it was conveniently located within our hotel. 

Our waiter (Gonzalo) had a hard time remembering our water let alone our order. We constantly had to remind him of something that he had forgotten. We kept our order simple with soups, salads & a garden burger. Our soups were ok but our salads clearly had sat in the window for a long time because they were warm and all dressing had dried. The saving grace to make me give a 2 instead of a 1 is the garden burger came out ok but the broccoli side was smothered in lemon. 

We'll be trying out some other spots while we are here and would only come back for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this two stars is because our server was excellent. We came at 2am on a Friday night and he was spot on, remembered every request without ever writing it down. I used to love Friday's and came often for appetizers and beer with friends. Unfortunately had not been in awhile and I wish I had kept it that way. 

I am completely in shock still that they changed the potato skins. That is quite honestly one of the only things I ate here, and now will not return. The old potato skins were amazing. These new deep fried things are absolutely THE most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. There doesn't even taste like there is any potato in it, and the thick fried crust crap is oily and NASTY!!! There is the tiniest dollop of cheese now and maybe one bacon bit and the deep fried taste was disgusting. 

I figured I would give the boneless wings a try after refusing to eat the new so called potato skins. Nope. Even the wings had this horrid and truly bizarre deep fried taste that I've never had on a chicken wing. 

Needless to say our party hardly touched their food and went home sick. We all had awful stomach aches before we even left the restaurant. 

It is sad because Friday's used to be the perfect late night spot for appetizers and drinks. The quality of the food however took a very serious nose dive. I still cannot wrap my head around why they would change the potato skins to such strange fried things. Will not return =("}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday, June 4th 2016. Service was good. Our waitress  was sweet. My food wasn't the best. I got the chicken and shrimp pasta. There wasn't enough sauce on the pasta and it tasted dry. The shrimp tasted overcooked also. I've had it before where it was good and juicy. Not this time. I never ask for things to be redone tho cause I'm always scared it will get spit on. Yes, I've seen the movie Waiting way too many times. I wanted to give them two stars but the service wasn't bad at all. It must have just been an off time in the kitchen when they made the pasta."}
{"text":"Terrible. The food was nothing special and the service was even worse. To top it off, there was a hair in my food. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Its a chain, the food is the same as in all others, what differs from place to place is the service.

The hostess at this location was not at the front when we arrived and she seemed surprised to see us waiting when she came back.  She seated us and we waited and waited and waited.  Finally I went back to her after sitting there for almost 10 minutes to ask her if we actually had a server?

Finally a server came over and took our drinks which came pretty quick.  Our food order was taken and then we only saw her when she was standing at another table talking with some people she was just talking with, they had no other needs.

Our food came and we had to flag someone down for anything we needed from napkins, to sauces to refills on our drinks.  When we were done and wanting our bill, I had to flag down someone who looked like the manager and ask her for our bill as our server was no where to be found????

Like I said, the food is pretty much the same at all locations, but the service is what makes or breaks a place and for this location, it is one I am not in a hurry to return to as the service needs a lot of help here."}
{"text":"What a waste.  I remember TGIFriday's being busy and exciting in college...I guess that was a LONG time ago huh?  This one was a waste of good money.  I just had a burger, but come on.  It sounded good, but was not.  It was supposed to have beer cheese sauce, which was non existant.  The food seemed tiny for the amount you paid.  Maybe their drinks are good, maybe not, I had water.  We had dessert too, but not particularly worth mentioning.  It's just a blah atmosphere, blah service, blah food, just don't go here."}
{"text":"Food just ok. Had to come because Texas Roadhouse was packed. No wait that was awesome. Ok place if in a hurry. Unfortunately order right away took the food forever to come out.  Soup was cold.  Oh well done with Friday's."}
{"text":"Sitting at my table as I type this. I've now been done eating for a good 5 mins. Our server hasnt been around in about 15 mins. My husband has asked the server for the next table(not our server, God knows where he is) for a box three times.  All three times he was IGNORED. I get that it is Friday night and has the potential to be busy but it isnt. There is absolutely no reason for this shitty service.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"If I were to describe this place in one sentence I would call it a mediocre, and cheaper version of Bettis 36 on the North Shore.

My wife and I won a gift card in a raffle.  We went for lunch on a Saturday. It was not crowded

We entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way.

Our server took our drink order and returned promptly.  We got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger.

Our food arrived promptly and the appetizer was \"fine\".  10 years ago I would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were.

The same goes for the main course. The fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers.  

The bill was also fair.  The meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got. The server was pleasant and attentive. All in all this Fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience.

I would return here for lunch like I did today."}
{"text":"This was probably one the worst experiences we have had in a long time, we came in for dinner and we order our dinner and ask for another order to go when we was almost done with our meal, the young lady came over in the middle of our meal and asked did we want our meal yet and we told her no, that we would tell her when, in the middle of our meal a gentleman on his way out came over to our table and sat a bag on our table and walked away and we said we was not ready for our meal yet, about ten minutes later the waitress and someone that she was training came with our ticket and asked were we ready to go and we told her no that we wanted dessert and that we did not ask her to bring out to go order, because we did not want our food cold, she said oh sorry I thought you was ready for it I will go put it in the Warmer, at that time I got very upset, so when she came back I asked to speak with a supervisor, she said ok about 10 minutes later a supervisor came over never introduced himself or apologized to us , when I explained to him what was going on, and that the waitress never came back to refill our drinks or asked if our meal was ok! because my friend had an language bearer and wanted me to speak for her, he said so do you want a whole new meal I replied yes that would be nice! He walked away not happy, when the waitress finally came back over I asked her her and her supervisor name she told me her name was Tenia and her supervisor name was Brian.. I believe that customer service still should be the first priority when you are in the business to serve others!"}
{"text":"Before I begin this review, I will say yhe service was excellent and I had the best long island I've had in a long time. There were 2 main problems with the meal. The first was the potato skins came out with almost no bacon and it seems like the cook forgot what salt was. The main reason for 3 stars was the ribs. They just aren't any good. First problem... The membrane was still on them. Big no no. Second problem, they had to have them sitting in water to get them to where you could pull the bones apart. This takes flavor out of the meat and that was evident. And speaking of meat, there's the third problem. Where is it? I buy a rack of baby backs from the store, I can eat maybe 4 of them. Here? There's barely any meat on them. Where does it go? Friday's is a decent choice, but don't pay for ribs. They ain't worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here intending to try the all you can eat appetizer for $10 but we decided to go to the bar and split 1/2 price appetizers instead so we could try more dishes.
The service was great with the two bartenders switching out who came to the table. The drinks were phenomenal - $3 martinis on Wednesday. And not just the plain old vodka and olive but fun drinks too - I had a chocolate martini and a pink pink Cosmo (which they put cotton candy in and fill from the shaker at your table).
Sadly the food was only so so. The mozzarella sticks were great, the pot stickers and buffalo wings were nothing special and the potato skins are exactly what you get when you buy the TGI Fridays frozen loaded potato skins at the grocery store.
While the experience was just ok the price was definitely worth a return visit especially now that we have narrowed down the appetizers we liked"}
{"text":"Ordered French dip with sweet potato fries. Only 4 oz of fries and had to pay $2 extra, for WHAT? asked manager and he says it's prepared by weight. That's lousy when you pay $12 and $2 more for sweet potato fries and get a skimpy serving."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a TGIFridays in a few years. We saw this one inside of Aliante and decided to give it a try tonight. We were seated immediately and the hostess was extremely nice. Our server, Perry was also very fast and friendly. He answered all of our questions and never rushed us. The 3 stars were won by the service. The lack of stars was due to the food and drinks. I had the turkey burger and it was very bland and tasted like it was seasoned with pepper only. My son had a cheeseburger and kept saying it tasted weird and only ate a few bites. His Sprite was also absolutely gross, but we didn't realize that until we were leaving and I took a sip. Poor little guy didn't even complain about it. He just didn't drink it. My hubby had a Blue Moon and it tasted like it was going bad. I got a frozen Daquari and the chunks of ice were to large to even get through a straw. Not blended and weak on the alcohol for $10. My husband had some monster bacon burger and ate it all so I'm assuming it was fine, but you never know with him. If he's hungry, he eats. My son and I however, are way more picky. Also, we were planning on getting the endless apps, but they charge $12 per person at the table. Not a good deal when my son would have eaten a cheesestick and been done. Before we got our food a manager came by and was very nice. Still, not worth $70 and won't be making another visit. The service was great, but everything else wasn't worth returning."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Friday's is one of the better options. I'm normally more interested in checking out local spots with fresher food but every now and then you gotta go with an old faithful and this is one. I normally would give 3 stars to an establishment with service and food of this quality but I believe that they are a two steps ahead of their competition so I upped the rating.  

I really enjoy their jack Daniels sauce and potato skins. The other half usually gets a burger but this past trip we discovered that on Wednesday nights in the bar you can get a rack of ribs with two sides for only $10. We both left full and spent less than $30 so I don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"Eaten here before, never really had any problems, but tonight was a little different. We were seated and our waitress, Ashley, was very nice, professional and accommodating. My only complaints were that out of the two steaks we ordered one was over cooked, but the manager did send out a new one. And about two minutes after we received our appetizers our entrees came. So we didn't get to really enjoy our dining experience. Very rushed."}
{"text":"How the hell do 2 employees look at you while waiting to be seated and IGNORE YOU like you they didn't see you? How the heck is this being allowed here? I DJd at the banquet hall and after my event me and my assistant were hungry and trust me I wanted to spend here. I wanted to have a couple drinks and get some food and hit the tables. I have NEVER came to Aliante because it's far from where I live and since it was the first time being here I felt like relaxing a bit but if I can't even enjoy a meal and a drink at a restaurant here I have no reason to be here ever. The fact that these employees looked at us and walked away pissed me off. May I add that there was only a total of about 9 customers in the entire restaurant so they can't even say it \"was too busy\". Never again."}
{"text":"We went two nights in a row. The food was fantastic, the drinks were awesome. Service the first night was iffy but it always depends on your waitress, the second night was awesome. Would go again!!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here has really declined since our last visit. The clam chowder was ok and the service was good but one of the salads had such slimey lettuce that it was inedible. The prices were much higher than before also. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Yawn... 

Yet another chain, same food different atmosphere. I did try something healthier by choosing the Mediterranean Naan and it was pretty tasty -  it had fresh ingredients and I loved the cucumber sauce on it! 
I ordered the sweet potato fries to accompany my sandwich- they were sparse and cold.
It was okay ... let's leave it there ..."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite got the sampler and loaded potato skins, skuns weren't loaded but tasted pretty good. The ribs we're really tasty and cajun shrimp was good. Our bartender was really nice and made a great mojito."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant 3x in 4 days, excellent service. Darius and Holly get special shout outs!  Exceptionally customer service and conversation. Darius and my boyfriend had sports talk in common and although it was only Holly's second day she was greay too! If you get one of these two tip them well they deserve it."}
{"text":"Went there for a friends going away dinner/happy hour and the waiter was very informative and kept our drinks full. Highly recommend the nachos during happy hour since all appetizers are $6 during that time. Best TGI Fridays in town."}
{"text":"This TGIF is horrendous if you sit anywhere, but the bar.  Slow service or no service every time I go eat there.  Then why do I go back?? Because my family put a gun to my head, tied me up,  and dragged me there so they can use their comps.  Ugh.  I noticed it doesn't matter which server I get.  They will seat you and sometimes it takes 10-15mins before anyone notices you didn't even get drinks or place settings. Then it takes another 15-20 mins before the server asks for your order.  Once you get your food, you better make sure you have everything you need when the server asks if you needed anything else otherwise you will not see her till she/he brings you the check.  It's like they go in the kitchen to chat or something.  The place isn't even busy during the times I've gone.  This franchise ruins TGIF's brand."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever in a restaurant. 
I asked to be seat in the back away from the crowds because we had a party of 10. 
After 15 minutes waiting in an empty restaurant we were told there were no servers working in the back.  It was 6:45 pm. On a Thursday ?? Really. ?
So they seat us right smack in the middle of the aisle with not enough chairs for our party. 
We got the eye roll from the server for asking for separate checks after she asked if we wanted them. 
We waited a very long time for a drink order to be taken. Long story short. All orders we mixed up. He sever told me we were too loud and she couldn't hear us. So my 5 year old grandson waited 2 hours for a kids salad. Mandarin oranges. I order the black bean burger plain. Which had to be sent back. Because we have special food needs and there was cheese all over it. 
Needless to say I had an instant stomach ache when I got home. And will never visit again. 
The manager was clueless ?"}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here. Looking forward to coming back.  Great food great atmosphere. Everyone is very friendly and energetic. Jordan excellent server."}
{"text":"So tonight we decided to choose TGIFridays at Aliante over ALL of the other restaurants for a light dinner and a drink.  We've dined there several other times and the service was marginal back then.  Tonight poor service came to an all time record low (and they weren't even that busy).  We ordered an appetizer plate, 1/2 rack ribs (4 total ribs with hardly any meat on them) and 1oz lobster tail, two beers, a coke and a desert to go.  Although we sat at the bar and there were 5 bartenders - I said five people actually working the bar, it was if we didn't even exist.  Bartender poured hubby's beer but forgot about my coke.  It took 15 minutes to get anyone's attention.
We had registered for a free appetizer or desert and was told that it didn't apply to this meal.
The total check was for $75...for marginal, bad quality food and horrible service.  Needless to say we will never be back but do they even care?  I doubt it as they were way too absorbed with anything other than caring for their customers.
I would NEVER recommend this Fridays to anyone.  The rudeness of the hostesses (and host) at the front desk, coupled with the horrible service and skimpy portions along with everything else listed above,  places TGIFridays at Aliante on our worst restaurants ever."}
{"text":"My family used to got to TGI Friday on the west side but it was closed some years ago. We had a chance to dine at its east side restaurant. We tried sirloin steak and bucket of bones, which were very delicious. Friendly and prompt services were also offered."}
{"text":"I was hoping that the two star rating was not still applicable. I was then pleasantly surprised by the relatively good upkeep of the place. However. The poor customer service is the issue. The business model that you can't accommodate a party area than eight in a restaurant that's half empty is the reason. We waited twenty minutes to celebrate a friends birtday."}
{"text":"This Friday's was cool. We went on a not so busy day so that was a plus. Idk about my friends but I enjoyed it. It was no different then the Friday's in California. My artichoke dip was on point and my pasta was delish. I'd recommend Friday's over the buffet that the hotel offered."}
{"text":"this Fridays took the place of the coffee shop at Sam's town . they have specials on food and a great happy hour. bartenders do tricks while making drinks. you can eat in or at the bar ."}
{"text":"I've been to this TGIFridays with my brother several times before seeing movies at the Orleans! The food, especially the burgers, are very delicious! My brother loves the ribs ( which are half off on Wednesdays!) Though the staff is nice, it's quite difficult to flag anyone down to get something !!!! Our drinks came way after our food was given to us!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is for sure one of my favorite restaurants! When I went today with my mom and brother, the service was impeccable! Both the hostess and the waitress were very sweet and attentitive! The food was delicious ! I loved my Jack Daniels burger and cheesecake! My family love their bacon and cheese burgers as well! Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Monday after Christmas, about 5:30, turf & surf special for $14.99.  Guy waiter wanted to sell me beer, not interested, I could tell he wasn't very happy.  Steak was a bit rough, waiter only came by for drinks and check.  Dude dropped check off, no thank you or have a good day.  My part of tab was about $16.54, left $17 in envelope.  Tough luck buddy"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 10/100

Volunteer work at the Alzheimer's Association booth today (for the Senior Spotlight Spectacular event) left me and my friend Hungry, with a capital H. And so after looping the first floor of Gold Coast Casino, we found this TGIF branch and settled with a simple order of cheeseburger sliders ($9.99) and an extra side order of fries for an additional $1.99. 

It looked like there was quite a shortage of staff and our waiter was literally zooming around the restaurant like a ninja, much so that he ended up giving me a glass of ice cold water instead of hot water like I asked. To his dismay, he came over about 10 minutes after he handed the drinks and apologized sincerely for the little mistake, thanked us for our patience and reasoned that it was such a busy day which I totally understood. In fact, I really appreciated the gesture. 

As for the food itself, I'd say average. The burger patties were juicy although the dinner roll bread made it feel more like a sandwich than a burger. The pickles were fashionably placed above of the bread, topped with a cherry tomato and our side order of fries were well, what can I say, some pretty neat fries. There was no 'X' factor (for a lack of better vocabulary) that made their food stand out. Would come back here, but only if it were the sole option in the area."}
{"text":"Good heavens, why are you thinking of eating here? Overpriced and over processed  . Waitress suggested lemonade, perhaps a raspberry one. Imagine my surprise when it appeared I was served a melted blue snow cone with two maraschino cherries. And I'm not twelve.
I tried the lunch special of cesear salad/shrimp entree. Portion was fine for the price, but was the salad ever bland. At least the lettuce was fresh. Paul Newman's dressing is better. Three tiny croutons on top and flavorless cheese. Meh. Shrimp seemed to have heavy flour breading  with pepper and cayenne to disguise the flour taste. I won't be going back. You want to go chain, at least go to one with better food or better pricing. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Amy and Zachary were on point, they saved the day after we left the other restaurant.  We were able to get good food and good customer service all in one place"}
{"text":"Good \"big box\" food joint, with lots of different options.  Nothing crazy good or crazy bad.  Chili's fraternal twin."}
{"text":"This TGI Friday's is not the greatest.  I sat at the bar, which almost wraps all the way around.  This seems to be a common down fall of TGI Friday's.  They have too big of a bar area and never enough servers /bartenders.  You can go neglected at the bar for quite a while.  

The food is mediocre. I was hungry after a long day of travel,  so I ordered the Jack Daniel's steak with lobster tail.  The steak was cooked well and tasted ok,  but would not recommend the Jack Daniel's sirloin.  Is only cooked with that BBQ sauce and some on the side.  It's not worth the extra price.  Get the regular sirloin and maybe ask if you can get that BBQ sauce on the side.  

Also,  do not get the lobster tail.  It was ridiculously small.  It had two bites of meat in it and they didn't even serve with melted butter.  NOT WORTH IT. 

The macaroni and cheese was pretty good and works for a side.  The \"fresh\" broccoli was fresh out of the refrigerator.  It was still cold,  not cooked well."}
{"text":"My brother and I ate here because the buffet was closed (at 9 PM on Saturday). I thought that the food and atmosphere was good. Our waitress was friendly, and discouraged us from rushing."}
{"text":"Tried to order 2 beers for me and my wife and they wouldn't let me unless I had 2 id's.  Makes no sense since it takes 15 minutes to get 1 beer.  Don't drink here before Penguins games.  It's not worth it.  There's plenty of other places around to go."}
{"text":"Went in the morning for breakfast. Ordered a ham n bacon cheese omelete with potatos. The food was excellent. Cooked to order. Service was phenomenal as well. Also, they have FREE wifi, something the airport does not provide.  Recommended, at least for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have lots of different comfort foods. But restaurants where pieces of flair are a fashion statement are always a comfort food gold mine. Maybe it's because I grew up on Applebee's?

Nonetheless, I like this TGI Friday's better than most others. The food is just what you'd expect from any other joint in the same franchise. My personal favorites are the wedge salad (or as my friends and I call it \"the iceberg salad you have to prep yourself\") and the Jack Daniels dishes. I actually have occasional cravings just for that. The only \"downside\" at this location is the quirky mix of staff. But just see for yourself on that."}
{"text":"Usually can't go wrong with the JD chicken and shrimp.  Desserts are pretty satisfying as well."}
{"text":"I continue to love dining at Friday's.  Sometimes the service is sketchy but not this go-round.  My husband and I stopped in late after a movie nearby and were lucky to have Gerri as our server.  What a treat that was.  She is energetic and friendly without being annoying.  On the contrary -- she was just the right amount of \"upbeatness\", making suggestions, answering our questions, making small talk, and just had a nice overall presence.

We were excited to learn that they offered endless appetizers for 10 buckaroos.  So we each ordered the appetizers.  The first one you order comes out full-size; thereafter, they are half-orders.  I started with the pot-stickers, followed by potato skins while my husband started with chicken wings.  The most expensive part of the meal happened to be my 2 peach sangrias but they were good so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Today we dined indoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  I realized I'd never been inside before, only out on the deck facing the trail/river.  While I love the outdoors and would always choose that first, it wasn't available today so inside we go.  This particular Friday's is nice inside with space between tables.  The one in Monroeville seems quite a bit more cramped.  

The purpose of this update is to brag about their burger.  OMG! This was the best burger I've enjoyed for quite some time.  I've been to specific burger joints that just simply try too hard and either I've had bread components that fell apart immediately upon being held or various edible entities on the burger that just didn't go well together or overpowered the burger itself.  

Here, I opted for the \"your call burger\" in which you select a cheese, a spread, and 2 toppings for 11.95 and it comes with fries.  I opted for Smoked Gouda for my cheese, the Truffle Aioli for my spread and Onion-Bacon Jam and Crispy Cajun Onions for my toppings.  Note that the spread comes on the side which is nice as I didn't use very much.  

Again, let me rave about it and tell you this is the best burger I've had in a long time.  The burger was moist and juicy and well-complemented by the cheese/toppings/spread/bun.  I ate every morsel plus the fries plus a small side salad and was a happy diner.

That is all.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! After about 45 mins with no food, we asked to have it boxed to go. The waiter said there were about 5 orders in front of ours!! After an hour, our food comes thrown into the containers...no Jack Daniels sauce, no ketchup etc. My co-worker asked to speak to the manager, not knowing the woman he asked was the manager. She rudely replied, im the manager and ur not going to speak to me today!! Horrible customer service! She was the only manager on duty, so after 10 mins of standing in the lobby she finally comes over to talk to us. She stated that the mayor came in with a large party and overwhelmed the kitchen! So she made everyone wait while the mayor got his food! 
Never going back to this Fridays again! She let us have our food for free but that doesn't excuse her rudeness and lack of customer service! 2 thumbs down :-p"}
{"text":"The service and the food was great but we walked into the restaurant and it seemed like the hosts were almost bothered by our presence. Rather than having a nice greeting, they sat on their phones and continued with their personal conversation until they sat us. As a restaurant worker, hosts are usually or SHOULD usually be the nicest workers but it seemed opposite. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Really like Happy Hour here. The price is right!    My only complaint, which is not unique to Fridays, it's a lot of bars, is the seating that is 97% high tables. I use a wheelchair, and there is only one table in the bar at my height, otherwise, the table is at my eye level. I was accommodated by the staff and the understanding people at the one low table, but I would hope I wouldn't be forced to eat/drink at a high table to enjoy the Happy Hour prices only available in the at area."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people are skeptical of chains, but if you want a guaranteed great experience at a chain restaurant, go to this Friday's on Sunset and sit at the bar with Erica. I would call ahead to see if she is working before heading out to be sure.
I don't know what nights she works but we usually walk in and she's there. And we're always glad because she is the best. (She makes really good flavored sangria by the way).
You don't have to worry about a bad atmosphere or negative energy from a bartender like a lot of establishments with Erica. 
If you like sitting at a bar top and relaxing with good people and eating half off appetizers, you should be very well pleased after you leave. 
The Jack Daniels sliders on the appetizer menu are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here for the $10 endless appetizers. We sat in the bar are since there was a 25 minute wait due to lack of servers in the dining area. Once we sat down it took a bit for our server to come to the table. My husband ordered a beer. I asked how the peach tea cocktail was, server replied \"I don't know\" I took a chance and ordered it. It pretty much a peach long island. I tasted it, all I could taste was peach syrup. My husband said the same thing. I told the server about it and she said \"ok\" .. she never offered to bring me something different. We told her we were both going to do the $10 endless apps. She said \"oh its not $10, its $12\" .. I pulled up the online advertisements that showed $10. She had her manager come over to tell us that they had changed the price a week ago but not everything is updated yet. Keep in mind there was a commercial on tv that day advertising it for $10. We ordered a few items. We looked at each other and laughed! I pulled up the online advertisements of what the food was supposed to look like, showed my husband and he shook his head. The food was bland and cold! We left a plate sitting there to show the server. It took her a while to come check on us and how our food was. We asked her if the cheese on the nachos was supposed to be chilled, she looked at us like we were stupid. The cheese sauce felt like it went from fridge to plate. The portion sizes are NOTHING like they advertise! Once the next round came out cold and disproportionate, we decided to take pictures of everything that we ordered. At this time, my drink has been empty for 13 minutes. I drank it since the server was unable to take it back. I asked for 2 waters, it took more than 10 minutes for us to get them. Once we decided that we were done, the server quickly got our check. She asked how everything was, we replied \"this is why we don't eat out that often.\" We paid our bill and left. Will post pictures of the tgi fridays webite advertisement, the food expectations and reality of what was served. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Upon arriving we thought they might be closed but hours sign says open  til 1am Sun-Thurs.  It's a little after 11pm so we go in.  I go to wash my hands & by the time I get back my bf is still awkwardly standing there waiting for someone.  So no biggie we aren't in a hurry so we just sit at the bar.  We could hear people in the kitchen but after about 15min we decided that they must be closed & that they just forgot to lock the door and don't adhere to the hours on Yelp or the front door.  Sad thing is we usually love this location & had not been there for a long time.  Now it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth along with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Our service was great!!!! Daniel was very attentive and on top things. I use to be a server myself and he is was what I see in a great server. I go to Fridays  occasionally because all my friends always hate the service, I recommend Daniel to be your server for anyone. I'll def go again!!! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Took wifey here for lunch (had a coupon) and was quickly reminded why we don't come here. The service is mediocre at best, the food is the same. I asked for well done fries, well done fries aren't mushy and don't bend easily or at least when they are first brought to the table they shouldn't. The next time we eat here, the coupon will have to be for free food."}
{"text":"First time here with my children during a break from the park. We ordered burgers. I got a stacked burger and was completely disappointed at the quality of this almost $14 burger.... the double patties were literally the exact same as a McDonald's burgers. Not to mention the freezer burnt taste. I also had a coupon for a dessert. How can you mess up a brownie?? Well you can mess it up by delivering a brownie and ice cream to a table with children and not give any napkins, great service. Then the brownie itself didn't even have the texture of a brownie... it's like they unwrapped a little Debbies brownie and slapped ice cream on top. I guess next time someone tells me not to go somewhere.... I will listen, no matter how hungry I am!"}
{"text":"We had a very unpleasant time during our last visit, here are few reasons:

1) Drinking  water tested so awful , we checked the lemons in the water it was Ruined, then we order big appetizer, waited almost 30 minutes they brought the dinner, I asked the waitress where is the appetizer, she told me she forgot, that's it, no apology, no nothing we told her we don't want it anymore, she just said ok, the food was cold , and if you ever been in Tgif you saw the size of the food and noticed how little it is, they trying to say the quality of their food justify the price, their food is most expensive in those kind of chained restaurants, with $85 we paid  for family of 4 with no appetizer and drinks and poor service we could go to a lot better one,"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day.  This Fridays is located in the Aliante casino right by the front lobby.  

I had the Jack Daniels chicken and my wife had the parmesan chicken.  Both meals were actually quite good and definitely good amount of food for the price.  

The only downside of the lunch was how slow the service was.  We were one of only two other groups in the entire bar/restaurant area and it seemingly took a long time for the bartender to greet us, get us our waters and even longer to order food.  She was friendly but there was just not much for speed of service.  

I'd suggest having a server as well in the bar area as I can't imagine how slow it would be if it would've been any busier."}
{"text":"To review one restaurant in a chain is to review all the resultants in the same chain.
This place is okay, just okay. Diligently check your blood sugar and hypertension at the door.

At this particular location the staff is doing its best to be overly cheerful and helpful. 

The food is the same as the others, as far as I know. I've not been to a TGI Fridays on over a decade. And for good reason. The place has crap food.

For the same price you can get good food that is more healthy and far superior in flavor. Not to mention overall nutrition.
  
But when it's a bad day why not just go for the gold huh?
So so sad I ever went here. The Bourbon burger is horrible."}
{"text":"I just want to start by thanking the ENTIRE staff of this location! As a server, it's incredible to see such friendly staff all the time! Sometimes we get off of a late shift and need some food or a drink to unwind from our crazy day! We come after work, sometimes in larger groups or maybe just as pairs, but each and every visit is like our first experience all over again! We absolutely love sitting at the bar and having laughs together and GREAT conversation with your staff. The endless apps and $4 long islands make it SO affordable to have a blast! We love Katie and Chris, the bartenders who go the extra mile just to make our visit so much more memorable! Although no matter who we are visiting our food is always outstanding and it most certainly keeps us coming back for more every week! This has easily become one of our favorite hang out spots and I cannot thank this establishment enough for giving such excellent customer service and making us feel at home! You guys are doing a phenomenal job and a HUGE pat on the back!! See you soon!"}
{"text":"I usually don't go out of my way to post reviews... I have more exciting things to do but this was such a bad experience I couldn't help myself.  Sign said under new management.  Well I used to come here all the time and things were good.  Today we ordered two steaks one Ribeye and one Pan Fried.. both were like leather.  Horrible to the point of you just can't chew it.  I wondered how it was going to come out when we realized they never asked how we wanted them cooked... Worse tasting piece of dead cow I have ever had.  Plus to top it off the mashed potatoes and broccoli were so cold we had to send them back.  And, how in the hell can thy call those thing mashed potatoes????  No taste at all.  Like eating water.. Food took forever to come out and there really was not much of a crowd. Waitress must have went out for a smoke cuz she was missing for a long time.  Totally clueless to taking care of her tables.  My advice to the NEW MANAGEMENT... find another line of work... You took a good restaurant and took it to an all time low..."}
{"text":"So this is my second night at this location (tonight is Wednesday, showed up Monday night and couldn't get seated because there was not a host and the server seemed incapable of putting us at a table). Tonight I showed up and sat myself in the bar area, though not at the proper location apparently (the server Erin got an attitude about us seating ourselves, even though there was no host or hostess present). 

After almost 10 minutes we finally got drinks, and she sent the manager over without our requesting him to try and \"understand why we seated ourselves.\" (I assume that's what the server said)

I informed him about the situation with the host stand both evenings, and then he apologized and took our food order. 

During the small meal, the server never stopped at the table. She would only ask \"you doing okay\" as she was walking quickly by. She then came to our table when the meal was almost over and asked if we were done. As we said no, we were still working on the food, she tried to pull the plate away. I then informed her again that we were not done but we would definitely be needing our check. 

She walked away and actually hollered loudly to the manager and told him to take us our check while she disappeared into the back. 

The manager came over and apologized again, letting us know that she should not be acting that way. Additionally, another server came over and apologized to us, saying she saw the horrid service and felt bad that we had to experience that. 

The manager also let us know that he was working on getting the restaurant up to the standard it should be, so I truly hope he evaluates Erin and helps her get better or move on to other opportunities outside TGIFriday's. 

You know the service is bad when other servers come over to you and apologize."}
{"text":"Currently writing this review as I sit at he bar waiting for food I ordered 30 minutes ago with an empty drink in front of me as the manager stands 2 feet in front of me and hasn't acknowledged me once. Just looking at liquor counts. The bartender has had his back to me for 15 minutes talking to a waitress. Another waitress is just standing on the floor in the middle texting.  

Yup sucks here. If you are staying at the waterfront don't come here. Just don't. Trust me. I live off of Yelp and in 5 years I can count on 1 hand how many times I've posted a negative review."}
{"text":"Came here around 2:30 am. Was seated in the bar area. Waitress was nice but the service was not good. Our appetizers arrived with our meals (which took forever). The bartender took quite a while with the ordered drink. Definitely seems like they're understaffed. Not a good experience"}
{"text":"Just your typical TGIF'S. The food was pretty good. I'm here for the endless apps!!!! Lol Jack Daniel boneless wings are so good and Pot Stickers. However, the potatoe skins were not good. Tasted flavorless. Eh! But most importantly, the waitress was very cool and friendly. Also the manager even came around to say hello. It's a good place to stop in after a long day of shopping on Mcknight Rd."}
{"text":"Ok, so many of us have been to several TGI Fridays, and the food is generally the same. However, the service might be quite different. And that is what this review is about. 

I recently tried out the TGI Fridays with a friend for dessert and a drink. First of all, the restaurant atmosphere is nice, your basic TGI Fridays. But the tables were dirty. This was odd because it was not even busy in there. We sat at a table in the bar area. Nonetheless, have the server wipe it down and move on. But we sat and waited, sat and waited, sat and waited (you get my drift) and finally someone came to our table to take our order. I was so confused, I even asked my friend whether or not we were supposed to go to the bar to ask for drinks and food because of the long wait. 
So anyways, the waiter was pleasant. But again, we had to wait so long for everything (to order, get our food, get our bill, get the bill charged, get it back). This TGI Fridays is next to the PPG Paints Arena that hosts extremely large events as such as the Penguins Hockey, major concerts, etc. So, I am wondering if they are this terrible in attentiveness to customers during a slow time, then how are they handling business when it is busy!?
Just as they were in no rush to serve us, I am in no rush to return. But I will say, the Pink Punk Martini was very delicious."}
{"text":"I don't have any real complaints.  They are just blah.  Nothing special stands out about them.... just another restaurant chain with mediocre food and high prices."}
{"text":"I was meeting a couple of friends for dinner.  I've been a lot no time customer of TGIFridays for many years.  One of the things I like about them is their Stripes reward program. My meal was free because I had points to redeem. They have quite a menu but one of my GoTo's is the Jack Daniel burger. It's a traditional burger which includes lettuce, tomato, and purple onion. It comes with a small cup of Jack Daniels sauce. That's a lot of goodness in that cup. I pour some on my burger and dip my fries in the leftover sauce. The sauce is sweet and smoky. The burgers are always juicy so have a napkin ready. Burgers come with  what I refer to as rustic fries. They are skinny and have some potato peel on them. They are a rough cut so they are different sizes, but always cooked nicely.  Good food at a good price is always nice."}
{"text":"Fridays seems to have gone down hill. I was quite surprised when we went and there want a wait. I thought we had lucked out. We were seated quickly and our server came over quickly. There was only one other table that had people in the section we were in. 
I ordered a Jack Daniels burger-cooked medium. Our food came quickly. My burger was well done and dry. Without the Jack Daniels sauce there was no flavor at all.  The fries were pretty good.
I was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone.  Thankfully our server did a nice job."}
{"text":"Always busy but 10 min. Wait was worth the grilled wings and ribs. Cooked perfect. Service was good. Waitress placed wrong drink order. Long island tea very watery. Tile floor need deep cleaning lots of food and debris on floor.
Overall food and service was exceptional and price was perfect for a lunch or dinner date."}
{"text":"I would say the service tonight was the second worst service we have ever had. Our server would just drop items at our table and disappear almost as quickly. Drinks were quick, but she was gone before even asking if we were ready to order, or had any questions, that was the theme of the night. She had 3 tables including ours, it wasn't like she was slammed. Luckily the other servers were a bit more helpful. Appetizer came out, we had no place settings, no plates for the apps, and no server around to ask until it was half way gone. By the time our food made it to the table our son had almost finished his. By this time we had bonded with the table behind us over the terrible service. The food was not terrible, but not great. My husband's appetite was ruined by the service anyways so we finished what we could, asked for the check and decided that we won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I normally try to avoid chains when I travel, but when I arrived at my hotel and saw that it was going to rain in the next hour, the last thing I wanted to do was get drenched and then have to drive my car forever.  So down to the TGI Fridays I went.

I was actually a wee bit impressed.  I've occasionally had a quick lunch or a happy hour here, and this was my first visit since the upgraded menu.  Prices are up a bit, but the food was good & the service was spot on.  I did eat pretty early (around 5:30) before the crowds came in, but my server kept good tabs on me during my entire visit (the manager stopped by, too).  Nothing worse than eating alone and then waiting forever alone for something you need.  I had the new berry mojito (not amazing, but not shabby) and the California Club with fries and a side of ranch.  The fries were piping hot and the sandwich was monstrous (it made a nice late night snack).  A little more avocado would have been nice (just two tiny slices), but for sub $10 for a sandwich, I'm not sure it's worth a complaint.

The chances that I make it back to this location are pretty low, and this is definitely not the \"best food ever\" recommendation for the area, but for a quick, quiet dinner after a long day on the road, it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for a drink after the movies. There was no wait, chill atmosphere, with friendly staff. We order the appetizer sampler. I wasn't crazy about the Mozzarella sticks but the jack Daniels boneless chicken was yummy. Ordering the cotton candy martini made \"ladies night\" official!"}
{"text":"I've been to other T.G.I. Friday locations two or three times before, and was unimpressed. This location totally changed my opinion of the franchise. This was a very fun experience. The restaurant is clean, well-maintained, and has a great atmosphere. The staff was extremely helpful and available to meet any needs we had. Our waiter was pleasant, funny, and very knowledgeable on the menu. He was one of the best servers I've had at any restaurant, ever. 

As for food, we took advantage of their $13 steak and lobster special, which was absolutely perfect for me and my fiancée to split. Later that night we went back - due to our incredible experience earlier - and got a bunch of appetizers to split.

If I'm back at this hotel I'll be sure to return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here for dinner around 930/10pm, we sat in the bar area due to the 30 minute wait time for a table. After sitting in a booth we waited another 20-30 minutes with no one stopping to take drink orders or offer menus. I then proceed to order online while sitting in the booth & walked out to sit in the car to wait for the food to be done. This was successful until I went back inside to get the order & had to wait another 40-50 minutes for my food after the online app said it would be done by 1056pm. My food was finally done @ 1130pm, no explanation or apology given by staff or managers. I will not be eating at this location EVER again unless it's during the day when I know service will be better & there won't be a large crowd."}
{"text":"Food was passable, while service was tolerable. Out of steak sauce? Really. Double fries looked barely enough for a single order of fries.  Then they charged us twice!"}
{"text":"I came in with my family of 4 for a late night bite. We were seated and after 15 minutes of no one coming over to take our drinks and even say hi we were about to leave but we spoke to the hostess and our waitress Ashley came over and was so apologetic. It turned out that a fellow waiter played a joke on her and told her she was off the floor. Ashley was so professional and so personal . She made us happy that we were there. She is such a joy we will defiantly ask for her when we come back."}
{"text":"Pretty typical airport/chain location. Bar tender was friendly and quick even though she was busy. The Bloody Mary was pretty low end, probably some of the cheapest mix they can get, but I was in and out quickly, which is important at the airport. Don't expect anything spectacular, it's a TGI Fridays at the airport after all...."}
{"text":"Good God...parmesan meatballs!   Take a meatball, bread it, deep fry it, and serve it with marinara and mozzarella!  Just wish the service was more consistent.  We ate here more than once on the trip.  Lunch was great - greetings at the door, prompt/friendly service, and good food.  The late night dining not so much.  No greeter, no water when we ordered, no silverware with the food, no one to bring the check.  Hmmmm...  Need a little work.  I understand it's late, but if the restaurant is going to offer late night hours they need to be sure the guest experience is up to standards."}
{"text":"Typical Fridays experience. Food was good, meat prepared as ordered. Service was fine. Location was clean and parking was convenient."}
{"text":"The food was good...but the customer service was very ummmmm strange...the waiter was nice, but we never saw him and when I did I had to ask for water, napkins, and everything else.  I will probably be back because I love the Hotel, but if my customer service is medeoker again imma act a forum and demand my food for free."}
{"text":"Have been to this location 2xs in the past few months. 1st visit was for a weekday lunch, order the soup and salad combo which you would assume would be fairly easy and quick? Wrong! Took 30 minutes to get served...okay it's lunchtime and their fairly busy I get it soup must not be readily available for the server. 2nd visit a weeknight not very busy, started with coffee, server did not return to take our order so after 25 min and we had to flag him down to just get a check...will never go back."}
{"text":"Best fridays. Went to the bar for great service. The new interior is awesome. They finally have big screen tv's.

The sriracha shrimp rolls and the blueberry pomegranate long island tea are legit."}
{"text":"We are locals in Las Vegas, we get tickets to concerts at the Orleans, so tgi's is the logical place to eat. Not the best, service there is not very good, it is hit and miss, sometimes we get great service sometimes horrible service! We went there on Nov. 10th for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd concert, the hostess sat us and took our drink orders and only brought water, not the beer my hubby order. We had to order from a waitress, did that got our drinks and appitizer, but hubby ordered the garlic shrimp that was supposed to be served on risotta style rice, uh what is that?? We thought risotta, not so..just burnt rice, in fact it was all burnt. We had no time to re order as we had a concert to get to. Just be sure when you go, order a burger or basic food, get there with plenty of time in case you bad service. Don't expect too much!"}
{"text":"Ive had a variety of levels of service here. A few times service was so slow or no existent that I sat at the table and had no service and left along with other tables around me. That being said, ever since I brought it up with management it has improved. The last few visits went so smoothly, nice food and everyone was quick, efficient and I didn't even think if leaving at anytime. In addition, the manager was apologetic for the service issues and encouraged me to come back."}
{"text":"Place is the worst service is bad  they made me feel like I was bothering them when I told them my chicken was rubbery the manager came by and said sorry then walk away I didn't eat nothin and they still charge me I hate Fridays now and everything about it"}
{"text":"I go to Fridays a lot since they have a late happy hour, so I'm very familiar with their food quality. This Fridays is located inside Sam's Town casino. I'd say the service was good and the food came quickly. One thing that was disappointing was that the pretzel sticks were over cooked. They were very dark brown, harboring close to a bitter taste. The rest of the meal was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Stay far away from this place!!!!  We came here just to get a quick bite to eat and have some drinks after a long day.  The parking lot wasn't full so we thought great... No long wait.  As we entered there were a few tables with customers and we were greeted promptly and sat soon after.  Appetizers were fine, our server was attentive and polite.  When our entrees came out... My husbands chicken was completely raw which he had to spit out.  We called the server and she also was shocked and embarrassed how raw it was.  She took it away quickly and called the manager who came and apologized.  When she brought another plate out... Which didn't take that long... She gave him another napkin roll with new fork and knife in it. She waited to see if the chicken was done so As my husband unrolled the napkin... All the silverware were soiled.  So he returned the dirty utensils to her.  She and the server at this point were mortified.  Frankly so were we.  We didn't even want to finish the rest of our meals.  They comped his meal... But we will never come back.  Just imagine what else they aren't doing properly or what corners they are cutting.  Proper cooking (especially chicken) and proper cleaning is lacking in this place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money on the food! You might as well buy it from Walmart in the frozen section. Our waiter was not very attentive and made a couple mistakes with our order. One of them being the shrimp cocktail we changed our mind on, but he still brought to the table. I wish we would have sent it back! For $13, we got the smallest cocktail shrimp you can find at Walmart. Yes, again with Walmart. That's the best and truest comparison. Next time we'll just buy a slice of pizza at the Food Court. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered two beers right off the bat. We waited and waited. Our appetizers arrived. No beers. Our dinner arrived. No beers. Finally the beers showed up. The manager Melissa was notified but no action was taken. She even asked us to donate money to a cause! (Which we did) Not going back!"}
{"text":"The service I had was ok. They messed up my order but it was corrected. Food took a little long to get back to us and waiters seem more interested in other things then working . In a good location and food was good as well."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was ok. The visit was going great until the server brought back our change. Instead of $19 there was only $9. When we alerted the server she surprisedly stated \"oh did I not put the $10 bill in there\"?, before she even proceeded to count how much money she gave us back. That's about the best admission of guilt I've heard. We got our $10 back but I won't be returning for sure."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I came here today for lunch with my sister and mom who is visiting from Florida. Our waitress was good but the food took forever to come out even though the place was empty. The food was alright except for my sisters food. The chicken was terrible. It looked like yesterday's chicken that had been reheated in the microwave. It was brown inside. Awful. The manager brought her food out the second time and ducked out of here like the place was on fire when she said it was still microwaved. This was terrible. The wall against the table was crusty with old food. 0/10 would not recommend and definitely will not come here again."}
{"text":"Bottomless boneless buffalo wings for $10...
That's a great deal, but the meat is not that great...
The food is good, as can be expected from a national chain.
I wish Friday's would get away from Jack Daniels sauce.  Jack Daniels is ok for a bar, but STOP putting it on everything.  It's seriously horrible on everything.  Please stop!
That being said, I'll come back...  But it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night, there was no wait and our waiter was awesome! There were $5 apps and $5 drink specials. We ordered the wings which were great and I ordered the orange cooler drink and my boyfriend ordered the blueberry Long Island. My drink was way too sweet so we ended up switching drinks.
Food- I order the chicken and shrimp and he ordered the ribs and steak. The food was good for the price but was not mouthwatering."}
{"text":"So far so good. Was bite loud with screaming kids. Parents using restaurant as a play ground  :("}
{"text":"I got to say that I LOVE our Bartender ANDY!!!! He makes good drinks and is very quick to serve and on top of things! and is such an entertainment. He juggled oranges for my friend Gloria and I, even tho he failed he was really great. The food takes long when you order in, but usually I just get a small order of fries and a Long Island so it doesnt take that much, Lol. 

We are going back to Vegas again on the 26 so we look forward to being served again by this this fella. Hopefully you can juggle 7 oranges by the time we go back, keep at it Andy!!! Lol"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for dinner. We had 4 adults and 4 kids. We didn't have to very long to be seated. Our waiter was really cool. He had a fun personality and entertained our kids.  Our food came out fast and was good. All of our drinks stayed full. our entire experience was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Food is always great but the service was horrendous. Sat for 10mins at a table before the server bothered to come over and offered no apology. I understand if the place is busy but there were approximately 4 tables of people dining at the time. Spend your money elsewhere with servers who will take care of you especially in Vegas where phenomenal servers are everywhere."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  My food came out before the bar decided to work on my drink order.  I had to ask for silverware and I had to clean the table of debris from the last customer.  Worst service of any restaurant."}
{"text":"It had been many years since I went to this Friday's location, since my wife and I used to venture that way to go here, or Max & Erma's next door when it was open.  This will probably be my last time ever.  I ordered the 'Dragon Glaze salmon', and it was just average, and 'honey they shrunk the portions' too, apparently.  The amount of rice and veggies they gave me, as well as the salmon, was pathetically small.  They also did not have the 'Jack Daniels salmon', as they had years ago, and the prices have shot way up.  Lately, i've noticed many chain restaurants cutting their portions, lowering food quality, and raising prices.  At this point, methinks i'll just stick to smaller family owned and run diners and restaurants where I can get good portions at good 'value driven' prices!  Dissapointed."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food... Not so much. Couldn't eat the chicken in the Pecan Chicken Salad. Let the bar tender know and still was charged for the salad. Probably won't be back..."}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews first. I was in town for a funeral/memorial service for my cousin. This restaurant was within walking distance from the hotel, and my cousins and I wanted to spend more time with each other before we left the following morning. To begin, we arrived and were told it was a 45 minute wait for our table. TWO HOURS LATER, had to inquire what happened to our tables as we had been sitting at the bar waiting to be called the entire time. We ordered drinks and appetizers at the bar, and were passed over numerous times by larger parties to be seated.  I attempted to pay on one of the tabs with a giftcard. The gift card had $9.20 left on it. I literally checked the balance the day before when I was cleaning out my purse. They said the \" machine wasn't working\", and I was unable to use my giftcard. When we finally were seated, they messed up our food order and we didn't receive several items. They messed up our drink orders, and the tabs were mixed up between patrons. To top if off, they switched out waiter/waitress THREE TIMES; while we were in the establishment actually seating. 

The best part was that we at least had decent drinks, and we were able to catch up as cousins while waiting a ridiculous time. We made our own good time. 

We walked, but parking was a lot. There was plenty of parking. 
The Food, when we finally got it, was decent; and tasted like traditional TGIFridays. The endless /bottomless appetizers were the best deal at $12.99."}
{"text":"I have had annoying visits with the Fridays in the past, but I decided to give it another try. I am pleased I did. I came in with my boyfriend for apps and drinks before a Tuesday movie. 

The Service: Very fast and the server was very friendly. 
The Drinks: Exactly what I expected
The Food: YUM. We shared their new \"tapas\" menu. I LOVED the Mac bites. My boyfriend cant wait to try their meatballs again. 
The Price: $40, not great but not bad either. 

The only downfall? I was too full for a whiskey cake for dessert."}
{"text":"This TGI Friday's is similar to the one at Gold Coast, with the same 24 hour happy hour specials. This place is not as good as the one at Gold Coast. The portions were a bit smaller, yet the food was still good."}
{"text":"The best place to snack at in Las Vegas is this Friday's inside Gold Coast. 1/2 price appetizers during their 24 hour happy hour. I visited this place with friends probably at least a half dozen times during out trips to Vegas. The servers were nice and recognized us on our repeat visits. Much better than the Friday's at the Orleans because of service, quantity of food and atmosphere. Recommend the Jack's Chicken Strips and Sliders."}
{"text":"I won't return to this location. 

One thing I can't stand is waiting for silverware to arrive, more so after your food arrives. It's not the job of the hostess to bring napkins and figure out where our refills are. 

I ordered the Fridays Shrimp platter. It was ok. Nothing amazing and I've had better at other Friday's locations.

Our service was slow and it wasn't even busy. I'm a pretty patient person and understand when it's super busy that things have to wait. Waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to come back to your table to get the credit cards to pay while she just stands around and chit-chats isn't cool.

We looked at the bill and noticed an error so we brought it to her attention that she added an item to the bill that we didn't order. I guess she assumed that we wouldn't see. She then stated, \"Oh yea, sorry, it happens sometimes\". 

Wow. Nice. And the way she said it made it seem like it was done on purpose as if to round-up the bill to an even amount."}
{"text":"Only come here between 11am-3pm and ask for BJ. He's the greatest waiter, ever.

My low rating is for the service you get after 5pm. It stinks. Waited 20 minutes just to get water and iced tea. Never again will I return for dinner. We walked out today."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Here with my client and she is enjoying her food as well. Thanks so much for a great experience."}
{"text":"It's a decent chain restaurant said in Sam's Town. They have steak and lobster for $14 every day between 4 and 6 and $4 20-ounce drafts during the happy hour. Who Ops 2 with very slightly overcooked the stick was spot-on they have a tomato and mozzarella salad that I like the rest just pretty standard fare. But it is it good place to eat on a budget if you're in the casino I would not make the trip but if would not make the trip would not make the trip if I wasn't already in the area."}
{"text":"The only reason why I am rating this location with more than 1 star is because it is conveniently open 24 hours, and because the wings that my cousin ordered were cooked perfectly.  Other than that, the service here is horrendous.

I came in late night last week for a quick bite after a night of drinking and gambling across the street at The Rio hotel.  When my cousin, boyfriend, and I arrived we sat down at a table and someone who we thought was our server brought us menus.  We asked for 3glasses of water, and I shit you not, it took about 15 minuites for somebody to bring the waters to us.  Some guy brought them over and said that he was our server?  We were confused, because the original girl who gave us the menus was sitting at the bar chillin.  We thought that maybe there was a shift change, but nobody bothered to let us know.  We put our orders in with our server and ended up waiting another 15-20 mins for our food to arrive.  During our wait our server was nowhere to be found.  We couldn't order any additional drinks, and we were not even offered refills on our waters or anything.  It took like 10 minutes just to get some extra napkins.  I would not recommend coming here late at night.  Hopefully their service is better during the day."}
{"text":"Food was yummy, service was fast, and the vibe from the server was awesome! - I would definitely return !"}
{"text":"My mom and I went for dinner! She and the jack daniels burger and I the jack Daniela chicken Sammy - both of which were really good! Also had the brownie obsession which I'm a long-time fav of! The service was decent but there was blaring music during dinner hour on a Wednesday so that was a little much."}
{"text":"Normally I like TGIF. I won't mention the name of the server, but he was rude to my fiancé about almost everything she ordered. She asked for coffee and he told us it was horrible. She then got tea and the water was somewhat warm and when she asked for hot water and a new teabag he said he would have to charge us. We are also vegetarian and chose a vegetarian option for a burger and he made fun of us. Really weird guy. He shouldn't be servicing people. Maybe he was having an off night?"}
{"text":"Really great experience. We have been going to some chilis and applebees a couple times a month remembering all 3 of them being pretty much the same restaurant with a different name so not making an effort to pick one over the others. We wandered in to this Friday's simply because it was convenient and right next to what we were doing that day and I am glad we did. It seems that they have worked to distance themselves and put themselves a notch above the other two. Very happy with what we found."}
{"text":"Came around midnight, very good service. Although I was a bit upset that we couldn't eat outside because it was already past a certain time but other than that , pretty good! Steak was juicy and delicious, waiter was very friendly and on top of things. Food was freshly made!"}
{"text":"I ordered the potato skins and they were GROSS!! The cheese was nasty, I seriously thought it was from their frozen food appetizers!! I ate 1 and was done!!"}
{"text":"Business trip, solo male, sat at bar, quick, and attentive service.  Food was always hot, first beer had an off aftertaste, last next to me said her martini had same thing.  Asked for a new beer, no problem, and taste fine.  It's TGI Fridays, you should know what to expect if you're eating here.  Food was fine, nothing amazing, but good.  If you want tip top food, go to Hyde park and pay for it.  If you want some bar food, ribs, and beers, this fits the bill well."}
{"text":"Had great service. But the food was horrible. I got so sick after eating here. Was up all night sick. Don't go here"}
{"text":"If you're white, don't bother. You will be the only one there and the hostess will make it crystal clear you're not welcome. It was 4 in the afternoon, place wasn't at all crowded but the hostess, I had to ask her if she worked there, said there would be a 25 min wait. She glared at us with a look on her face like what are you doing here?! Again, STAY AWAY if you're Caucasian. We had the good sense to leave."}
{"text":"The restaurant is attractive and comfortable. The highlight of this meal was the excellent service from Chelsea and the warm and gracious treatment by the staff at the front desk, including one young lady rushing to open the door for us as we left: a lovely touch.  The food is fine, but it does not measure up to competitors for quality and quantity.  I agree with the writer who stated that the offerings are pricey.  Our hamburgers were a good size, and were accompanied by a tiny order of french fries.  My iceberg wedge salad was reasonably priced, but small, and the bacon featured in it was miniscule.  For the money, one cannot beat Primanti Brothers, less than a mile from this location, which for the bargain price of $7.99 offers a great burger with choice of cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomato, and which includes a large order of the best french fries around.  My wife is allergic to monosodium glutamate, which this hamburger apparently contained in abundance.  After eating the large portion of the burger that she took home, she was so ill that she thought she might be physically sick."}
{"text":"The bar is great have to see laura during the day she is awesome, lunch specials are good have to get the burgers,"}
{"text":"Awful. Extraordinarily slow service. Theming is all over the place. My daughter got the pasta and I got chicken strips, and her portion was far larger than mine and twice as cheap! The food was very bland. Sad!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend...the server was great but my steak arrived charred instead of medium-well. I sent it back; it took a long while, but a new one finally arrived and it was fine.  Drinks were good, but I won't be returning anytime soon as to the impossibly long wait time for the food (it was not a busy night.)."}
{"text":"I really liked the servers, they were nice and have really great attitudes. We sat in bar area and happy hour was so good!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I literally didn't know what we wanted for lunch and were just about to put names of restaurants in a cup to draw...but when we wrote down TGIF...well...lunch fell into place for us! Lol! 

So when we got there they had a banner outside advertising a 2 for 10.99 on a half rack of BBQ ribs...i made my mind up before I walked in the door! They actually give you a separate sheet of paper for their 2 for 10.99 offers so I guess you HAVE to ask them for it or you'll never even know that menu exists! I ordered my appetizer (garlic, tomato basil(?) bruschetta) and my ribs...DeEELiCiOuS!!! That Jack Daniels BBQ sauce is something else! The entree comes with fries and cole slaw...I asked if they could replace it with a rice pilaf or something but that 2 for 10.99 won't allow it I guess :( ...but the slaw was surprising okay! It has green onion and cilantro in it...kinda reminded me of the inside of a fish taco minus the fish! Lol! We also ordered a whiskey caramel cake a la mode...idk what it's called....but that was TO DIE FOR!!! decadent and not super sweet perfect blend of flavors! Great way to end the meal!...AND...you get $2 off desert at lunch! :) I love a discount!

The staff was awesome! Super attentive...definitely will go back for more! :)"}
{"text":"I just stopped into Fridays (on Friday) and sat at the bar for a quick snack and a cold beverage.  Big Christmas Ale was $6, which I thought was in line with other restaurants, and for food I went with the Three for All (Shared).   For once everything was cooked as expected but the two things that they did get wrong were 1) the boneless wings had barely any sauce on them (had to order extra) and 2) we asked for blue cheese and celery but got ranch.  The bartender hooked us up, apologized, and we moved on.  I prefer the Fridays out on 306 because of the happy hour specials and Sunday game day goodies, but if you are just looking for a quick snack after shopping, this will fit the bill."}
{"text":"If you haven't been into this Fridays, you really need to.  They are currently under food wars with all the other restaurants on the strip and have one hell of a happy hour.  I'm talking wings for $1.50, shrimp cocktail for like $2.00, hot dogs for a $1, and the list goes on.  Now I might be a little off on the prices but trust me, if I am its like by $.50.  If I'm in the area, I ALWAYS stop here and fill up on snacks.   It's a typical Fridays other then the happy hour with regards to layout, atmosphere, service, etc.  Lots of TV's to keep you up to date with the game and bartenders that seem to know what they are doing.  Next time I stop in, I'll take a picture of the happy hour sheet and post on Yelp.  Until then, go in and enjoy, don't bother with the Quaker Steak chaos."}
{"text":"Food was iffy , service sucked . Waitress would rather stand around 3 guys in the back and talk then take orders or check on guest. I love I'll not be coming back"}
{"text":"Over priced food that I could have bought at Walmart and cost less only good thing the staff was good for a busy hockey game day at ppg paints arena"}
{"text":"Food - 2/5
Value - 2.5/5
Atmosphere - 1/5
Service - 4.5/5

Great restaurant for appetizers and a beer. Has Dos Equis Lager on tap. Main meals can be hit or miss. Service is fairly quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Broccoli and meat with the taste of freezer burn always get the one star from me. Bad service gets the same. Little or no working heat (or so it seems) on a cold day is another turnoff. 

If you long for the Friday's experience of the 1980s, don't go to this one. The Friday's at Concord Mills Mall gets about three stars compared to this location.

At the same time, this chain is past its prime. With so many great restaurants in this area, the only reason someone would stop here is the expectation of name recognition.  Sorry, but this site may disappoint."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. I order the steak and lobster. My steak was supposed to be cooked medium and it came out medium-rare. My husband ordered the ribeye and lobster with bread sticks. His came out medium-well and no bread sticks.  We had other food but that was great! These were the problems. 

The waitress (which was awesome) didn't bring out the steaks. The person that did, didn't wait to see if our steaks were to our liking and both of them were wrong. My husband also asked if the bread sticks were coming out and the guy said he would check. Never saw him again. We had our 2 month old with us (first outing with baby) so we didn't want to send the steaks back and wait for fear baby would wake at some point and disrupt the restaurant. So, I ate the part of my steak I could and my husband who is definitely a red meat eater suffered through his over cooked meal. The waitress came back around and asked if all was good and my husband explained the situation.  She said she would get right on the bread sticks. At this point we were almost finished and didn't need the bread. 

She came back to the table said she checked what she put in the computer to make sure she hadn't made a mistake and the bread would be right out. My husband told her we didn't need it now. She said she would take it off the bill and we could take it home and she would send the manager to the table. 

This is why this gets 4 stars. Kim (I hope that was her name), the manager, is amazing. Although, she was really busy doing other things she really took her time with us. Not only did she LISTEN to us about our meal issues, she took the the time to have a CHAT about other things, like the baby. This might have been a way for us to not leave angry but it sure felt genuine. In the end our bill was greatly reduced."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience.I didn't even come on weekends, very poor customer service. The person who served us came only three times. Before ordering while serving and at the paying!!! Food is not that good also!"}
{"text":"Friday's is Friday's, the food doesnt often vary much.  The meal was good, everything was very delicious, but my sisters Rueban got served to the wrong table, and by the time they corrected the mistake and brought her the right one, everyone had finished their meals.  They nicely took it off the bill, so they were able to recover somewhat.  Food was good though as usual!"}
{"text":"So I came here before a concert cause we had arrived a little early.  I mean its a cool location and all, but I think their prices are a little ridiculous.  I am sure all Fridays are the same prices, but this is the first one I have ordered a drink at.  If I am paying more than $5 for a crappy well vodka drink, someone had better be holding the glass up for me."}
{"text":"Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad."}
{"text":"Fridays is probably one of the worst chains I've been to, we got 5 or 6 different appetizers and they were all extremely bland and boring. Service was good but food sucked, sorry"}
{"text":"OMG food is really good but service sucks big time. We got seated then waited about 10 ms for waiter. Once we order food took about 30 mins to come out the. Waited 5 mins for silverware. They missed my wife salad and 3 waiters said they would bring it out. Nope it didn't come till half way through dinner. 
The only one thing was fast was the bus boy. He was on his game. Will not come back to this place ever and we live down the street"}
{"text":"Pretty annoyed that a restaurant that claims to be family oriented but has no changing table in the bathroom. There is plenty of room in the handicapped bathroom to put in a changing table. There is also not enough room on the counter because the sinks take up every bit of room. I think it should be a law that restaurants have baby changing tables in every bathroom; men's and women's. I honestly don't want to patronize a restaurant that doesn't meet my needs. I love the food at TGI Friday's but it's not worth the inconvenience. My choice is change the baby in the car or on the table. I hope someone in management will see this review and talk to corporate about making the necessary changes. Until then I will no longer eat here."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday 1-7-16  evening for my step dads birthday an waited approx 20 minutes for a table (not sure why they had over 20 tables available ) so finally we were seated an the waitress took our drink order then shortly after took our food order. The food portions seemed small an it was a very long wait to get our food (we were a party of 6) we tryed to overlook it but seeing as how the restaurant was far from busy the wait was way to long. So anyway we got our food and it was all extremely  good (the new Mahi Mahi is ok ) waitress came to ask if we wanted dessert we said no we were to stuffed everyone was done eating except 1 person an plates were empty yet she walked away an left them there she came back about 10min later with the check an still left the plates there. They brought my step dad a ice cream for his birthday then she took a couple of the plates away. She was very friendly an patient though. But due to my over all experience I will not be back."}
{"text":"The clam chowder was kinda gross. But the lobster ravioli was delicious. The shrimp cocktail was pretty good, but its half price if u sit in the bar. The honey mustard chicken sandwich was gross. I couldnt even finish it, I had to leave and order something else in the food court. Waste of $. But I do have to say the angel hair pasta w/ grilled chicken and tomato & fresh basil was good. That I would order again. Just be careful what you order. Don't order something out of the ordinary. Who knows how it might turn out.  PS the margaritas were WAY too sweet."}
{"text":"Awesome waiter and Great food. I always enjoy visiting a Fridays when I am traveling. If I find my way back in this area I will visit again. Thanks again for always having great service and never being a disappointment! Will recommend to friends and family that live in this are or visit to try this location"}
{"text":"Not where I wanted to go in the first place but there was a special of endless appetizers going on for the month so we went to try that. Sorry, that special ended, What?, it's not the end of the month. 
French dip sandwich was barely okay, pot stickers were okay, service was friendly, prices way to much.
But, my bitch is condiments, don't they ever clean the caps or wipe down the menus. I was a waitperson for decades and there are many managers that would have fired us if we ever served anyone a dirty Tabasco bottle or ketchup running down the side of the bottle."}
{"text":"We had a desire for ribs on Superbowl day. The current ads on TV are advertising a special $14.95 baby back ribs. Our mistake was going to the one inside the Orleans Casino which was very close to our location. The waitress said that this special ended last month. 
Bologna. Rather than leave we paid the higher price. The ribs were great as well as the sides..I did call a free standing TGI Friday on Sunset yesterday and they confirmed that the $14.94 full rack is available everyday."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their baby back bbq ribs special for $15.99. The waitress inform ed us that that special was over 2 weeks ago.Well I had ribs on my brain so I went for the $24.95 whole rack. Changed from regular french fries to sweet potato fries.
The ribs were perfect. The service was too slow...1 star deduction."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I give it 3 stara because ita soooo slow. Food took almost one hour to come out.

Sunday is Happy Hours all day!!"}
{"text":"The food & drinks were great, the service was excellent but in the lobby and outside were a huge group of teenagers hanging out the entire night. They were yelling and screaming and being generally disruptive for almost the entire 3+ hours we were there! It was very off-putting and if they had been there when we walked in, we would have left. It was awful and the staff of the restaurant did not say anything. They didn't ask them to be quiet or to leave. The kids never got a table or purchased anything. We will go to another Fridays next time."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had  eaten at this particular location which is located inside the Aliante casino.

Right from the beginning I knew our experience was going to be very good because our server was amazing. She had a great attitude she was joking around with us,she was having good conversations with us and she kept our appetizers coming as we ordered.

This lady made us feel as if she knew us and overall just give us a very good experience. The appetizers were really good, our food was good, and The customer service that she provided us was without a doubt terrific. I would give this restaurant, and experience a 3.5 stars rating."}
{"text":"Stopped here while on a business trip after landing in Akron around 3pm on a Monday. The restaurant was rather quiet and we were seated quickly. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I was traveling with a friend who is allergic to onions so she normally has a hard time finding a menu item that she can enjoy. Our waitress triple checked her requests to make sure she could eat what she ordered without risk. I had the Sizzling Chicken and Spinach which was on the 'light menu'. It was really tasty! Plenty of food, fresh mushrooms and a tomato/mozzarella side. The restaurant was very clean and everything was as expected. A nice stop off of the highway."}
{"text":"The service at this location is beyond slow.  My mother and I were the only party in addition to a group of eight having lunch and the server couldn't handle it. God forbid they had a full house.  It took forever to get our drinks and food.  I ended up speaking to the manager who took 25% off my bill for the crappy service-she also offered a free dessert but 20 minutes later it was still not at my table so we left. 

I've always like Friday's and typically order the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp.  It wasn't that great at this location.  This particular location needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Worst experience in Vegas ever, 15-20 min to get even water, waitress (Rachel , glasses with tattoos on her arm) Took the order of another customer who came in 5-10 min after us , over 45 min to get food , ordered a side of rice for $2 and it looked like it was scraped from the bottom of the pot and was cold as ice, yesterday's maybe?? Cheese burnt, very little butter on toast, no jelly or other type of spread available. Was so mad did not even finish half my food. Never thought I would wish I had ate at McDonald's over a place like this which was my second choice since mcds did not have rice. At least I know better than to eat here ever again!! We have clearly stopped eating and waiting for our check but our waitress has to serve the other guest that came in first and got their food before us. So 1 hour later I'm still waiting for my check , ( yes I am that pissed that I had to write a review on the spot and I do have time since our waitress has never come back to check for refills on our drinks or even bothered to check on us and the quality of our food) honestly I am tired and frustrated already . When you're in Vegas you wanna do things not be waiting around to be served. Luckily there are no zero stars review. Well then again they do get1 star for Diane who showed us to our table and was very friendly and even helped us get our check since rachel failed to do so in a timely matter I was so mad I felt later I was rude to her when she had nothing to do with the poor service and I am truly sorry to her for that but not for this review which is tame compared to how I feel still and hope this is not a precursor to the luck for the rest of my day."}
{"text":"We got there and the hostess was having a conversation with a co-worker. A long enough conversion that Friend and I thought maybe we were invisible. 

While we waited, I used the restroom, which was badly in need of service. 

Leaves were blowing around the waiting area. 

Service was friendly and not good.  Our soup never arrived. 

My steak salad was good. Friend's Ribeye was cold, sweet potato fries were colder, broccoli steaming hot. So apparently that's what the hold up was...

Dessert?  No thanks.

We had a BOGO coupon for dinner.  You should say no thanks, too."}
{"text":"Dinner with family. Good for people with kids, as it was loud. Three stars for the menu. I wish there were more veggie choices. Typical chain. I'd go again, if need be. Service was good. Food took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"TGI Friday's is one of those casual dine-in restaurants that has been around for decades. Being the closest location to my home, this is the one I attend the most. And despite some questionable decisions by their corporate people, there is no arguing with the fact that this place has some excellent food. 

This is a very casual chain of restaurants. When you go in, you'll quickly notice a strange assortment of decorations/pictures/props on the wall. The staff always have a positive attitude, and succeed in creating a \"welcoming\" atmosphere. 

The food itself is far better than you would expect from a place like this. The menu is quite large and features variety galore. From a cheese-covered grilled chicken breast right down to nachos, there really is a little bit of everything. Plenty of dessert options as well. I don't think I have had something here that I didn't like. Plus, the servers are usually pretty good at taking requests if you want something made a particular way. 

The biggest complaint I have about the place has nothing to do with the quality of the food, atmosphere, or personnel at the restaurant - but with the decisions the corporate people have made. Numerous delicious items have been taken off the menu, with no rhyme or reason. I thought corporations were supposed to listen to what their customers like. 

But at the end of the day, despite the poor decision making of those corporate fat cats, it is hard to argue with the quality of the food here. In addition to the stand-alone Friday's restaurants, most of the Coast Casinos have one, so regardless of your position in the Vegas Valley, there should be one near you."}
{"text":"Well if you like the smell of sewage then this is the place for you. Something in the bathroom area has made the entire place smell of raw sewage. I'm surprised they haven't been shut down for this smell. 
The food is always the same. Microwaved or flash fried. Service is already bad but the cheap prices make up for it. If you don't mind bad smells and bad service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I went in at 5 o'clock in the afternoon with my wife and we were one of 10 tables filled in the restaurant. We saw our waiter only three times. Once for our drinks, once for our order, and once for our check. She never checked on our drinks, she never asked how was the food, and our order took forever to complete and it was basic chicken strips and a burger. I will never come to this restaurant again after such poor service."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Jack Daniel's steak & shrimp and the potstickers as an appetizer. As we were at our table I saw the bartender water down a couple of drinks (belonging to someone else) when they didn't quite make it to the rim. Immediately turned around and saw in big letters on the wall \"Ultimate Cocktails.\" I couldn't help but laugh. I'm SO not a drinker so I don't even know if this is normal! Maybe a fellow yelper can clue me in? Anyway, potstickers were great as was the Ultimate Strawberry Shortcake we ordered for dessert. The steak was quite dry, the shrimp way too crunchy and the squash/zucchini was soggy. The Jack Daniel's sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli were good though."}
{"text":"The server was great buttttt . When they made my chicken sandwich it was wrong. Instead of bringing it back to the kitchen to fix it she wanted to just bring me out the stuff they forgot ... Wow!!!I got up and found the manager and let her know if I wanted to make it myself I would stay home and left . I will never go back .."}
{"text":"My last visit was horrible! They completely change the sesame jack chicken strips. Mine was served in a big bowl drenched in jack Daniels sauce. It was more like soup then chicken strips."}
{"text":"Jeff is the best!  He went above and beyond to help my friend and I find the perfect drinks and meal.  We ordered the three tasting plates he recommended we loved all of them. He also got us to try those amazing pear mojitos, if you haven't tried them, do it. Ask for Jeff if you go, he will take amazing care of you."}
{"text":"Seriously Fridays? Could you get any worse. Your service is horrible for a chain. You continuously let us down. Every time we give you another shot you disappoint us again. Strike three."}
{"text":"Over priced and not big portions. The service was very good but very disappointed with the portion sizes and over all quality of the food."}
{"text":"Sad service and at the bar with only 4 others taking up bar chairs. Dropping my food on the floor of course was an accident however letting me wait nearly 20 minutes before I had to ask for another beer is ridiculous. How was my food? She wouldn't know because she didn't ask. 
Friday's is still going downhill."}
{"text":"If zero stars were an option this place gets it. WORST SERVICE IN VEGAS OR HENDERSON. Three serve staff walked past our table after we sat down and not one even glanced at us. After 7 minutes we just walked out. No one batted an eye. Fire the whole lot of them, owners!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow!!  There was four in our party and we were told the wait would be 40-50 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. We told them we'd take any table, even in the bar area.  We were seated at a bar table in about 25 minutes.  Our waiter was very nice but not very organized.  It took over 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 10 minutes after that for him to take our food order.  One of the drinks had a long black hair in the glass so we had to send back.  Gross.  Our food came fairly quickly, however we were missing part of one order.  We notified the waiter and also asked for more napkins.  Neither the rest of the order nor napkins ever came.  There's no excuse for that.   The waiter also never came back after that to check on us. This was not a good experience and I probably won't go back.  I had high hopes when it was opened but sadly does not live up to expectations."}
{"text":"I had lunch their today, the food was ok but the service sucked! We were there one hour before out food got thrown at us by a rude bartender/server."}
{"text":"Giving a 3 star for a server whose nice but he took forever to get our box food to go and the tab . Food quality is good i mean i got the petite steak and salmon medium well with rice and brocolli atlleast thats good ! But the waiting sucks !!"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at various TGIF's and the service I had tonight at this location was the WORST restaurant experience ever! I'm honestly fuming inside. My fiancé has worked in a restaurant for over 15 years and we're usually very understanding and forgiving, but tonight was unbelievable. There were sooo many things that went wrong and the manager actually refused to see us until we insisted to speak to her or our party of 16 was going to walk out on the bill. I will be calling the GM tomorrow."}
{"text":"Staff was great Jordan was our server and did an amazing job.  I had the Jack Daniels Burger based on his suggestion and it was delicious and cooked to a perfect medium well. The salt and pepper fries were just as good all washed down with a Guiness."}
{"text":"They have good food, the Green Beans with Wasabi sauce are to die for. 5 of us get two orders they are so good..... But....
 The food was cold, almost all of it. Two things were sent back.
 How does a baked potato arrive cold through?
 Also, the waitress took the food back but didn't seem to care about the shitty quality. 
 The bar is always freezing, bundle up. It is loud, but that's part of the fun, I guess.
 They have Lobster Tails, grilled or boiled. I love them grilled but again refrigerator cold takes some of the joy away.
 All told I guess unless I want a salad I'll go to Applebee's."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed going there for the Wednesday rib special. It has been awhile since we were last there so I called first to make sure they still offered the special. I was told they did.
There were 7 of us and we were seated in a corner which was so dark we couldn't even see the menu! We adked the young man who seated us to please turn on some lights to which he replied \"oh, the bulbs are burned out.\" Instead of offering us different seating, we had to ask him to move us. Strike 1! When we got situated in a more lit area, the 2 children with us wanted to color the children's menus they were given (without crayons). When I adked for crayons we were told \"we're all out of them\". Strike 2!
Then the waitress approached and took our drink orders. My husband ordered a coke and when she brought him his drink, she daid \"here's your diet coke\". He said he didn't order diet and she grabbed the drink and as she was walking away, muttered something under her breath. Strike 3!
When she came to take our orders, 4 of us ordered the rib special. She told us that the Jack Daniels ribs were $18.99 and the BBQ ribs were $14.99. I replied that's not the special to which she rolled her eyes and said they didn't have the special anymore. I told her I called ahead and was told they did still have the special, which she replied \"well we don't\". Her attitude was beyond rude. Everytime one of us would ask a question, she got nastier and nastier! After taking a census of the table, we all decided to cancel our orders and go somewhere else! 
You won't be seeing us again, TGIFridays!"}
{"text":"Quick place to get a bit to eat and a drink. Located right beside Galaxy Theater so this is a good spot to hit up a quick meal on happy hour. 

Not ideal for a date night or anything. 

This location seemed a little outdated. We sat in the bar area and it felt like I was sitting a few years back in time. The drinks and food were ok. The well drinks I wouldn't recommend. Never even heard of the names.

I got the quesadilla and wasn't impressed. Pretty soggy. Nobody likes soggy food. At least I don't.

Again, ok place to get in and out."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love coming here anytime we can. Besides the awesome food, our server is the best! Heather B. has become our requested server every time and she makes us feel like family sitting down in her home. Tonight we had the pleasure of sitting near her dad, who had come for dinner too, and it was so nice seeing how everyone interacted (including the other servers and management). Every time we go we are immediately recognized and greeted with enthusiasm and warmth. The food is always delicious and done right. Friday's is doing something right with either their hiring process or their training. Whichever one, every time we go the service and the food is impeccable. Easily the best experiences we have dining out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have a routine when coming here. Sit at the bar get some beer, 1/2 priced apps, and we split the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. Bartenders are friendly and attentive. We always leave happy. We will not be changing our routine, especially after reading other reviews."}
{"text":"Used to be THE place to go.  Now it seems the general manager and his staff just don't care. The last three times we stopped in to eat at the bar and use our Friday's points it's been a huge hassle. Stacks of dirty dishes near the frozen drink machine is disgusting on its own. No bus pans, just stacks of dirty plates right there. Unsanitary and unappetizing.  It also makes no sense that a food runner should return to the kitchen empty handed.  They stand and chat with the staff and walk away.  Anyways, food has been substandard.  I was given a lecture on why I chose the wrong coupon for my last order, and the so-called woman manager gave me the eyeball as I  being reprimanded and embarrassed by the bartender. 

Needless to say, the 1000 points we earned by going there will never be used at the Monroeville store. They need a wake-up call but sadly it seems that the attitude there will not change. 

Don't waste your time nor $."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the mood for TGI Fridays (which is seldom) I  always end up disappointed and regret wasting my time and money. It is just never as good as I believe it to be! Last time I was there, my burger was supposed to have avocado and onion straws on it. The three onion straws that we're on it were soggy and wet. Th avocado was MIA and the burger was well done when I asked for med-rare. The server was nice and brought me new onion straws and avocado,but  I was to hungry to send the meal back so I just dealt. But as I remember all of the times I've been to TGI Friday's I have never been all that impressed or satisfied. I think you would be better off at the B Spot or even Applebees."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is just for the server Ileanne (sp?) and for the cheeseburger meal off the kids menu 4.99. The horrible experience with the food reminded me why we do not frequent chain restaurants. This place was walking distance from the back entrance of the Marriott Courtyard where we were staying at and they offered room service delivery for a small fee but we decided to take a short stroll for a family dinner. It was a Thursday night so the restaurant was not crowded.  We paid 10.99 for 2 of the saddest looking and sized crab cakes that was not even big enough to share. It was just lump crab meat mixed in egg whites and pan fried, that really was it. The Friday's shrimp was over priced and left the bf starving. My pan seared flounder had no seasoning, and for me to complain that there is no seasoning is rare since I don't require much to begin with. The steamed vegetables and rice seemed like they were boiled in the same water without any seasoning. In hindsight, I should have ordered a burger, much cheaper but I was trying to be supportive of the bf's new diet. I took a bite of our son's cheeseburger and it was perfect. The bf had to order a salad to take back to the room because he was still starving. We will not be returning and it will probably be a few years before I think of visiting this chain again. Seems like all the chain restaurants are just charging for overhead nowadays, not quality or taste of their food. There are many more restaurants within walking distance to choose from."}
{"text":"Been eating here fairly regularly over the past 2 years. Increasingly getting worse service, longer wait times, poor server and bartender  attitudes.  Last Friday night, I  met a friend here for Endless apps and some drinks. Poor greeting at the door, waited a long time to  order a cocktail.  Waited a long time to order. Ordered 2 apps at once to help out the kitchen?  Got the 1st, and a beer. Then a cocktail.  Ordered 3rd app and got it. Ordered another cocktail and asked about the missing apps. Nada. No food, no cocktail.  Got a bill, though. I guess it's endless when they stop waiting on you.  Everything was on the bill, we just didn't get OUR orders. We asked for no jalapeños.  We got jalapeños.  And meatballs that we didn't order. 
We were fortunate.  Three other couples never did get food ordered."}
{"text":"The only positive thing about this visit was that the food was average, still tasty. Everything else was negative. Our server had a very bad attitude serving us throughout our visit. He was also creepy with us. The service was very slow considering that the restaurant was filled with empty tables. Staff was not customer friendly what so ever. They were so slow that another group of customers walked out after waiting too long for them to take their orders! Very poor customer service here, go to another Fridays with friendlier and faster service."}
{"text":"TGIF has disappointed me extremely bad today. Ordered the appetizer trio. Skins mozz sticks and boneless wings. My plate came out with every bodies else's food, which was fine except the plate had to have been in a micro wave because even the celery was super hot. I might as well have ordered a pound of grease. The skins had no taste and just fry oil through and through! The mozz sticks, stunk! And the boneless wings where over fried. Never returning to this location or maybe any location again."}
{"text":"The steak and shrimp were good but we waited 40 min for the ribs. I understand it was rush hour but no apologies for the wait? When the waitress handed me the bill I thanked her and she decided not to respond at all. Wow! Common courtesy is all I ask for especially when I'm a paying customer. The only reason I'm not giving a one star is because the ribs were good and it's a clean place."}
{"text":"My recent trip only consisted of having some drinks.

Certain locations have pretty cool decor. This particular location help the randomized decoration which I always look forward in a TGI location. Especially The Blues Brothers tribute small statue they had near the bar. I am a fan!

Alan was my bartender for my visit and he was very helpful and funny. He entertained my friend and I during our interactions at the bar. This guy should be applauded for his outstanding work and customer service. I came in with a specific shooter for my friend and I. Alan made it happen! A++ for his dedication.

Alan, YOU ARE THE REAL MVP!"}
{"text":"They took like 5-10 minutes to bring us water but eventually we got it. The food was really good for the most part our orders were accurate. The service was non-existent after we had our food. A few of us wanted to order more drinks but nobody ever came back to assist us."}
{"text":"this TGIF is in the casino, but it is a fun time during happy hour!!! the bartenders are hilarious and funny! 

AMBIANCE: 5 - it's a regular TGIF, it might even be a bit fancier because it's inside a casino! sometimes it smells weird because its an old casino lol 

SERVICE: 4 - service is pretty good in the bar area! outside of the bar area it's a bit slow. 

FOOD: 3 - Drinks are bomb!!!!!!! but the food is just so-so! it's expensive for such small bits of meat, if you're ordering steak! They're healthy portions, but it's overpriced, and not excellent! 

that Oreo ice cream dessert is yummy, and really fills the spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to try here with a friend for happy hour as it was the closest one to us. This TGIF is located inside the Orleans casino. The wait wasn't too long even though it seemed fairly busy.
It was sad to hear they didn't participate in the $3 Thursday appetizer & drinks or 2 for $10 app n entree. They did have a happy hour that had different specials. $6 appetizers cept for seafood and samplers. $3-4 beers and well drinks, $5 sangrias and $6 ultimate drinks. We caught them near the end of their midday happy hour, no specials between 7-9pm. By the time my friend wanted to order a 2nd drink, our server informs us that happy hour had ended. Not that it was required, but most places I go for happy hour usually my server will be courteous enough to give a heads-up when happy hour's about to end so we can get our orders in. Maybe I'm spoiled? haha
Food was ok, nothing amazing, nothing horrible for the most part. My friend's cheesecake apparently had been sitting out too long as the outside of it was pretty hard and dried. Next time I want happy hour at TGIFridays I might have to try another location and hope they participate in the good specials."}
{"text":"Tried one of their \"famous\" burger stacks, asked for medium got a burnt to a crisp burger the size of a McDonald's quarter pounder all for 3x the cost. Small portions for way too high prices. Floors were sticky menus were sticky nothing looked particularly clean. Service was adequate. Overall would not recommend and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I did not actually dine here, but attempted to. Three friends and I attempted to grab drinks before heading over to an event at Consol (this was after not being served at Buford's next door), and when we walked in, the place was pretty much dead, so we grabbed seats at the bar. We were completely ignored by every single bartender for 10 minutes and I know they saw us. Considering this was the second time it happened in the same evening at a place that was not even busy, it was just weird. Staff members were standing around texting and playing grab ass with each other, but not helping customers. Maybe the issue is all the bars by Consol?"}
{"text":"First time I went to this location. Waitress (Mia) was wonderful, efficient. Food was wonderful! Had a delicious 6 ounce steak ! Cooked perfectly mashed potatoes were mixed with cheddar and chives. Yummmm! Son had chicken and French fries loved them. Food was perfectly cooked and served quickly! I WILL be returning to this south hills t.g.i.f. Again soon! 5 stars"}
{"text":"So bad so bad so bad. The restaurant was maybe 50-60% full. Steady not busy at all. We sat down to grab a drink before we checked out access. For 15-20 mins literally we didn't get help. Finally a manager came out and took our order. We got our drinks 20 mins later and it was two beers. The bartender on Wednesdays nights is absolutely terrible. What can I get ya she states..... wtf. Yeah 30/40 mins later..... and there was SEVERAL dirty plates next to us. Our presence should have queued her to clean it and the hour we were there nothing.... gross. And we came back an hour after being in access country club across the way and found this 2 hours in place at the bar. And this was after I wrote her a note to let her know she should clean that garbage. Like wth do you need? She's an idiot!! And a terrible bartender."}
{"text":"Ok, overall the food is typical Friday's food. But, I have to say, these are above and beyond the worst potato skins I've ever had!!! It's like they fried some potato, let it sit out, re-fried it, let it sit out and fried it again. Then they took a chunk of poor quality cheddar, stuck it in the middle of said potato piece and put it in the microwave. I don't go to tgif expecting gourmet but seriously...  So disappointing. I will also add (for purposes of photo, I got without bacon)."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has REALLY taken a nosedive. This used to be one of my favorite chains to visit. Today, however, I was pretty disgusted with the entire experience. We arrived around lunch time and there wasn't a staff member in sight for a solid 5 minutes. Someone finally came around and sat us. We ordered an appetizer and entrees. We waited and waited more. Entrees came, no appetizer. I asked about the appetizer, waiter said he forgot to put it in. I then realized after he walked away that I was given the wrong salad dressing. He didn't come back for a solid 20 minutes. At that time I had already tried the dressing I was given and ruined my salad. I bit into the appetizer. Something I wasn't quite right. I looked at the chicken tender. PINK in the middle!!! Is there anything worse than being served raw chicken??? Manager came out in a dirty apron, took the chicken off the bill plus another 7 dollars. I was not pleased. We will absolutely not be back to this location. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner on Fri/27 Sep about 6 pm with a buddy:
- Happy hour was going on so we sat in the bar area.
- I'm in their TGIF rewards program (which is free to accrue points for your purchases) and had a voucher for a free sandwich/burger combo and my burger was fine.  
- My buddy got the Jack Daniels sampler platter: ribs and fried shrimp were good, the popcorn chicken(?) wasn't so good.
- Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The reviews were not good for this location but it was beside our hotel. The service was very good and the was was great. It didn't take long to be seated or served."}
{"text":"Great service, good drinks and food. Open very late which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol."}
{"text":"I'll keep it real, The food sux! The Stake was dry and chewy even when I requested medium rare. The Shrimps tasted like they fried right out of the freezer. This is my second bad experience there and wanted to give them another chance to make it up, but No More! Waste of $60"}
{"text":"The slowest service I have had in a very long 
time!!! Do not go here. You will want to gouge your eyes out before leaving. Food was ok, waitress nice.......but the wait was unbearable.
Stay away!"}
{"text":"We had Larry as our waiter!  One of the best ever!  He really helped with our choices and caitered to our being weary travelers!  Excellent food with fair prices!  Sams Town awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous viewers who panned the service at this location.  I waited over ten minutes for someone to even take my drink order, and we were only one of two tables.  Our waitress was just shooting the breeze with the hostess, and I guess she didn't feel like coming over and taking care of us.  They were laughing and having a good ol' time.  Hope it was worth it when the waitress saw how pitiful her tip was.

The whole experience was just negative.  Our waitress didn't know what the vegetable or soup of the day was, our order was wrong, AND the other table's order was wrong too.  On the upside, we made some new friends with the other diners.  On the downside, the topic of conversation was the crapiocity of our dinner.  I realize that TGI Friday's isn't exactly fine dining, but that's really no reason to be served cold, rubbery freakmeat (I think it was supposed to be chicken) an hour after ordering it."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because our server was a super nice young lady and she was very attentive to our needs. We were a party of 5, and 4 of us ruined toilets within hours of eating. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice. I had just left the Renaissance Festival and stopped by this place for dinner, and she and the lady who took us to our seats complimented my elf ears. However, even though the place was mostly empty, she took a very long time to get us refills. I suppose some of that was due to the Panther's game going on on the TV (they won another game!). The mozeralla sticks we got as an appetizer were good. The harvest apple salad I got was okay. But, the chicken tenders my friend got were terrible, and chicken tenders aren't hard to make decent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for appetizers. Love the endless apps. My favorite server is Karly. She is always smiling and very friendly."}
{"text":"The food taste really cheap and the guy working there is rude and disgusting  disrespectful and terrible service, his racist and he spit in our drink and he came out asking for tips wow what type of unprofessional business is this? Seriously I would never come here again you lost a big spending customer, no more visit to your locations because of 1 bad experience.




STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS AT ALL COST THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WANT A REFUND."}
{"text":"It has been ages since I have visited TGI Fridays. As soon as I got my rental car at the airport, I did a search and drove to this restaurant for lunch.

It wasn't all that busy in the parking lot. I got there just after noon. I walked in and was immediately greeted. I got a booth.

I was charging my cell phone with my portable battery. My server came over, introduced himself, and asked if I wanted a beverage. I ordered a Diet Coke. He looked at my battery and loved that it was solar.

I ordered potstickers as a starter. I then went with the $14.99 special. You order two proteins, which come with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I choose the sirloin steak and bacon-wrapped shrimp.

The potstickers were okay. There was a distinct pork flavour, which made me ponder that the filling needed some help. In general, the potstickers are pretty consistent at Fridays.

My main lunch meal came. The steak was perfectly medium well for me. I loved the bacon. However, the shrimp seemed undercooked.

I was pretty full, so I didn't order any dessert. I got my bill fast.

The women's washroom was clean. No complaints here.

I liked being in a booth. I got to stretch my legs out. It was comfortable.

{"text":"I understand its a chain, and pretty standardized everywhere you go, but I found this location to be especially bad. First, when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, but smells like the entire joint needs de-greased. Second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. The waitress, a \"professional\" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she 'saved' herself by telling us that she didn't know why our food wasn't ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after. She reeked of cigarette smoke, so i'm going to make a dumb assumption and guess that's where she was.  The food, typical TGI-fridays food, good enough, for a chain restaurant.  Extremely unlikely that i'd return."}
{"text":"We love coming here to eat. Before we get seated at a table, we always ask for Brooke. She's amazing...fun to talk with in general. She's our go to server when available. Food is always great, you can't miss out on their dessert either. I love that it's at a casino. We always play a little after lunch. Or watch a movie upstairs at their theatre."}
{"text":"Service is excellent! 

We always get the same waitress and she remembers us each time we come in. There was a time we came in 5 days a week and ordered the usual frozen magaritas.... Mango berry and raspberry cherry, the raspberry cherry taste like the red starburst yum! And the full order of potato skins! And chicken tenders. Love the booth seating in bar area.

Faves --- frozen flavored margaritas, potato skins, and the asian chicken tenders."}
{"text":"This place smells foul when u walk in, which should have been my queue to leave but it was Sunday after church let our and we were starving. Our food room forever and we ordered a Cobb salad, a trio and a kids meal. Our server was slow also as it took him 15 mins to bring our drinks out. The food was not good either. Pretty disappointing overall. Never again."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. The endless appetizer promotion is a farce! These are just frozen reheated appetizers. Then they only let you order one at a time. We ordered boneless wings and were told that we could only get celery sticks with the first order. How ridiculous is that?! Then the waitress was super loud for no reason. My sister ordered a long Island iced tea that was watered down. The restaurant wasn't clean either. The Jack Daniel's sauce was watered down and tasted more like a too sweet teryaki.  They need to do better."}
{"text":"As a chain I like TGIF due to their Jack Daniels Ribs which are outstanding, but I came to the TGIF in \"The Orleans\" because a buddy wanted to hit up some $10 all you can eat appetizers. 

We chose mozzarella sticks and boneless wings. 

Mozzarella sticks were fresh and tasty with hot melted cheese right out of the fryer but they don't give you enough marinara so we had to keep asking. They sprinkle some parmesan on top which is nice.

Boneless wings never tasted like they were hot and fresh but not bad considering we got 4 orders of each...that's 8 appetizers for $20.

Service was extremely friendly but the servers minds were on another planet
1. Ordered boneless wings...were brought potato skins the first time.
2. Ordered Dr. Pepper, got diet coke.
3. Ordered blue cheese for wings, got ranch...told them again we wanted blue cheese, NOT ranch...still brought us ranch.

The atmosphere in the New Orleans is horrible, we were sitting at the tables outside near the casino and for 20 minutes the alarms were going off inside the casino as though there was a fire...and the alarm kept going and going and going...no one turned it off for a crazy amount of time considering it was a false alarm...didn't enjoy eating through that. 

Also parking there is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Gave two stars because the service was pretty good.

Otherwise, skip it. 

I thought Friday's was trying to compete with other chains. With the prices we saw, it just isn't happening. 

Ordered Jack Daniel's chicken & shrimp. The breast is what a lot of places are doing, cutting a full one in half thereby doubling their profits on every single breast. It was TINY. Five bites at best.

Don't care to ever go back to a Friday's now, though the server I had was excellent."}
{"text":"I think T.G.I. Friday's is a fine establishment, especially for chain restaurants. But this spot is terrible. I've been here twice and have been thoroughly disappointed. The first time my problem was with the service. It took forever to be seated and to be served. The second time it was with the food. My wings were undercooked and my well done cheeseburger was pink. Then my date's well done burger was pink also, by that point she didn't even want to send it back because we already sent two things back. And on top of that the waitress took forever to return with the bill. I know some casino restaurants are crappy because they don't rely on repeat business and make it up with volume. But this one is pathetic. I will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"Under staffed and overwhelmed with a dash of lazy. We sat in the bar area and we've been here about 20 minutes and all the empty tables are still not bussed. Just sitting there dirty, but don't worry because the wait staff will set menus on those tables while walking by instead of geez idk cleaning the damn table. It's dingy and dirty in the bar area. This used to be a great place but the GM needs to keep his staff on their toes.

I had to add that the waitress was sweet. The bartender was horrible. She had no business tending bar. I saw a table of 2 women send their drinks back 4 times. My first drink was horrible. She's wasting liquor by the shots!! A mixed drink is supposed to be mixed. The ultimate Mud Slide which is supposed to be frozen and delicious was like warm milk with vodka in it."}
{"text":"No one ever got in touch with us about this issue . I got a email saying the manager at that  Fridays would contact us, but they didn't , we even went back one day during the day and said something to the assistant manager and all we was told I saw the email, nothing else. We still like the food , and most of the employees , Joey, Larry and Amber are great host , but for the managers not to take this serious is still unsat. Every time we have friends from out of town we always take them there , but this time was very embarrassing with out friends from out of town , just bad. We will not take out of town guest there ever again. We will probably still go but not as often but we are still very embarrassed by the night our friends were there with us , after we had bragged on the place so much. And for them not to care enough to even call lets us know we not the \"valued customers\" as they pretend we are ."}
{"text":"Well like I wrote before we went to this Friday's the first of the month, (November) and spent over $40 for food we brought home and threw away. It was terrible, I contacted them, it has took over  MONTH to get this resolved, we have been going here for 4-5 years but we will NEVER go back!! For our food we couldn't eat they gave us a $10 food voucher, really? We usually tip that much , this was insulting and we will never go there again. We usually take our out of town friends there when they come into town, because they have always been a nice place to go till now. If we ever go back to Friday's it will not be the one at Samstown I assure you that!! They was very rude about this and very insulting . They just lost 2 loyal customers !!"}
{"text":"It's so unfortunate that this restaurant does not deliver in service and speed what it delivers in flavor. The food always tastes good (sometimes hotter than others), but we have been 3 times and we have has incorrect orders, missing food, and long waits. They do not staff properly, so while they might have open tables, they cannot seat you because there is not server working in that section. This is a huge frustration; I hate seeing empty tables and then be told I have to wait 40 minutes to be sat. We have had great service on occasion, but this seems not to be the norm for this location. As we love the food (especially the Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich) we will likely return with many hopes that management will work to provide a better guest experience for their customers."}
{"text":"I am giving this business a 3-star review based on my over all experiences here. The waitstaff is decent , nothing spectacular but they get the job done. The past few visits the ribs have been excellent , but its hard to get a steak cooked to your liking correctly. The unlimited apps menu has been slashed in half , but the price is still the $15 raised price. This location is fairly clean aside from the restrooms."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Food for our group came out at different times.  Drinks took forever to get.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"So the service sucked!
We went in around 8 pm on Friday night. Didn't look packed at all, there was a lot of tables that were open but nobody cleaning them. So they told us that it was going to be a 30 minute wait so ok we waited, we didn't get our table till 10 mins to 9! Almost an hour waiting! Our server took forever with our order and drinks. He even looked drunk! People who got their table 5 mins before us already were leaving when we were still waiting for our food, even people who came in after us got their food wth?? We didn't have a special request order so why the long wait idk! We got our food, it wasn't even hot, our kids French fries were soggy and cold. By all means this place would do a lot better if they hired employees who cared about customer service in general! Overall food taste was ok. But still rating this place a 1 star"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I've ever had. 
I will never be returning to this location. 
The waiter we had yelled at us and insulted us in front of all the other guests.   They sat us in the bar area in a booth and waiter asked for an ID. I explained we were not drinking, she said well you are in a bar and need to carry your ID.  I said my ID is in my truck at valet and again were not drinking.  I asked if we can sit somewhere else? At that point she started to get rude because I asked if we could be moved.  She then stormed off to the host stand yelling at the host kid saying we don't have our IDs and want to move.  At that point we asked for a manager and after talking to him and seeing how he could care less we left."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  They ran out of shrimp so they gave the whole table free desserts!  We are coming back tomorrow for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good service. We came in on Thursday in March during NASCAR week. 5 minute wait. Clean restaurant. Food well made."}
{"text":"Two times I've come here and it's always way too hot, we asked for a seat where the heat wasn't blowing down on us and the server suddenly became rude and frustrated I'm guessing thinking he wouldn't get us as a table but then he ended up still having us a customer, he was rude the whole time with a fake smile and put a damper on our dinner experience. This happened both times. Servers need to find some customer service skills."}
{"text":"I feel so bad because the staff is always so friendly here but the food never meets my expectations. I don't come here often but when I do I remember why I've stayed away for so long. My recent trip me and my dad were starving after shopping and we both agreed that the food didn't taste like it has soul. The salmon was under seasoned the food took quite a bit for the place to be empty and the server asked if we wanted a box before even looking at our plates. Friendly people is nice but what about the food?"}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone would give this place less than five stars. No one goes to Fridays for a gourmet dinner. You go to Fridays for the atmosphere,  cheap food and drink specials. The staff here are just the friendliest of people and that makes coming back so much easier. My fav thing to munch on while I'm here is their BBQ Buffalo Chicken flatbread pizza. My new fav drink is their sangria'rita! It's not a sangria but it's not a Margarita. It's the best of both worlds. I have no complaints.  Fridays knows what their good at and they stick to it."}
{"text":"First off let me say this TGIF is gonna get the brunt of a couple of other TGIF visits I've had around the Charlotte area. I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud. 
It took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. 
So I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time. Fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me, fool me three times......."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service!  Poor customer service from management and poor table service.  You should not have to wait 40 minutes for your food when everyone else is eating.  Even people that came after us were eating.  And telling my they can bag my food up so I can take it home is a joke,,doesn't that defeat the whole point of eating out.  Oh and thank you (insert sarcasm) for paying for one beer!!! I will never eat at this Friday's unless corporate shows them how to improve their customer service.  What a joke.  I can get better service at the drive thru at McDonalds and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about 5 times. I like this place. However, do have some negatives about it. The service was always good. The servers are helpful and check on you. I never have trouble with the service. 

The only problem I have is the food. The appetizers are great but the bigger meals not so much. I once had the fish and chips, and it was greasy. I just went back recently to try something new and had the Gourmet Mac n' Five Cheese. It wasn't what I expected. It was really dry and not very cheesy. I was in the mood for a dessert and got the strawberry shortcake ice cream and that was terrific!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews. I come here all the time, as I live nearby. Great location, open late, cheap prices, tasty food, delicious drinks, nice and attentive staff. Plus, listening to the late night bartender chuckle all night is the highlight of my week. He seriously has the best laugh. It's absolutely contagious!"}
{"text":"This was an utterly disappointing experience. My husband and I have been to Friday's several times before-- but we usually go to the Crocker Park location. We also don't get the opportunity for \"date nights\" very often since we work opposite shifts.  Therefore, tonight we were excited to spend some time together and grab a bite to eat. We went to this location for dinner and it was absolutely terrible. We had both ordered the $10 endless apps, and I'm not sure if that somehow cued the staff to thinking we weren't going to tip well since we ordered \"the deal,\" but that's never the case. We were ignored and our drinks sat there empty alongside finished plates for 16 minutes (yes I counted after our first plates/drinks, came out and then sat there forever). Several servers kept walking by us-- I literally thought I was being punked.. where are you Ashton?!?! So ridiculous. Best part... when we asked for our checks (although we wanted another drink each and my husband wanted one more app (after the first appetizer they bring out baby portions- which is also dumb because that's more work on them)), the waiter stood there waiting for him to pull out his credit card and said \"I don't want to keep you waiting.\" Oo my the irony. Seriously?! Never again."}
{"text":"We eat at Fridays 2-5 times while staying at Gold Coast stay because...

+ it has a huge bar seating area (which we find has superior service).  Jose, Jackie, and Kathy are great, but we especially love the guy called McLovin, a super outgoing and attentive, skinny, bespectacled drama-class nerd. 

+ it's open 24 hours, everyday, NOW, with a great happy hour, and great weekday special

+ and, best of all, with a Bingo receipt: get a free entree with purchase of entree and two drinks, or a free dessert with two drinks.

NO!! that is NOT a dauber in my pocket.

Why not 5 stars? The drinks are not particularly strong, so stick with beer, wine, or shots.

As for the food...
The ribs were excellent.  The lobster tail was small (and a little cold) but still great.
The breakfast skillet is good. The chicken fingers are good.
The ABC (All-American Breakfast Club) is superior.  Get it on Texas toast.
The 1/2 sandwich, (limp) fries, and 1/2 salad were fine, and a good deal.
The strawberry shortcake is kinda gross.

TGIFs is one of the reasons my wife wants to return to Gold Coast, actually.
That, and her smoking, old, Chinese people fetish."}
{"text":"Having been to many other tgifridays I can say this was the worst I've seen.  Service was subpar.  Having to ask three times for silverware is not acceptable.  Food took forever and came cold.  The portions were definitely smaller than other locations.  Prices way too high for poor quality.  Bathrooms filthy.  There are much better choices in the area."}
{"text":"My memories of Fridays center around suspenders and buttons, and forgettable food. I stopped going to Fridays years ago for lack of interest, boring food, and excessive prices. I've not wanted to party like it's 1989 for some time. 

Well, I gave Fridays another shot, and I've not been disappointed. I went earlier this month. And it was so good that I returned a second time this month. 

I have actually been impressed twice. The food was really great the first time. The service was really great this time. The manager immediately took care of a minor glitch on our latest visit. 

I have to hand it to them. They really have moved past the era of the red and white stripes, ugly suspenders, and over the top buttons Their menu is better than it has ever been. All six people in my household want to go here, and that's saying something. I might even make it a threepeat this month. 

Whilest this is not \"smack your granny upside the head and ask her why she can't cook like that\" kind of delectable fare, this place is pretty damn good. 

Good stuff, Maynard."}
{"text":"I love the bar here w the food . 
The servers are very friendly they kept coming checking in on us to make sure  we had everything we needed ."}
{"text":"Trashy customers, dirty sticky floors, sticky menus, mixed drink lacked fruit flavor and alcohol but had plenty of ice. Guacamole was a joke with a teaspoon full in the cup, but the waiter did bring us more."}
{"text":"Eh, perhaps I'm coming to my senses in regards to this chain. I gave the TGI Friday's in Robinson an honest-to-God 4 star review since I truly did like all that I had. However, my dining experience today at this South Hills location was not outstandingly good or bad. 

I remember having the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips at the West-of-Pittsburgh franchise and for some reason liked them more there. Not that these were inedible at all. They had crunch for days and days and the jet-black sauce was syrupy and appropriately alcoholic, but the chicken itself merely whimpered in terms of flavor. I felt as if I was eating a batch of Chick-fil-A's Nuggets upratcheted mischievously by Alton Brown and nothing more. 

A half-rack of the Jack Daniel's Ribs served as my main course, and while they pulled from the bone fairly easily, the slab itself was lacking in meatiness. The same drunken, sticky sauce that I dipped the chicken into coated the ribs but failed to elevate them above mediocre. 

The side of ginger-lime slaw merely tasted like undressed shredded lettuce. Where was the dressing?

The french fries, on the other hand, were sticks of salted, hot-fat perfection. 

Our very shareable dessert, the Salted Caramel Cake, was probably the peak of our late lunch. Flakes of shrapnel made of hardened caramel were embedded in a vanilla ice cream that flanked cuts of a vanilla pudding cake mortared with more crispy caramel and embellished with even more caramel in liquid form. Whew! Briny, granular, milky, and rich all at once, this is a dessert I feel could hold steady with anything offered at a more prestigious restaurant. 

Micah, our waiter, did an excellent job, so no issues were had by us there. 

TGI Friday's gets an unduly negative rap from the foodie crowd, but rate them more than average this time around I cannot and will not. Are my tastes becoming more refined? I really have not a clue. I just know what tastes good to me and what doesn't. Today, I found TGIF's fare to be mostly mundane.  I wonder if I'll rate the next one I go to a 2 or a 1.

P.S. We came around mid-afternoon and didn't find the place at all \"loud\" as one drive-by reviewer put it."}
{"text":"Thank God It's Friday, indeed! Our calamitous week was over, and weary from the possibly demonically-influenced chain of events that plagued us, we decided to play it safe and dump one of those birthday gift cards my father (and his sense of humor) gave me. 

Kay claims that this is the hipster's preferred chain. Pop culture memorabilia fills the walls. To my right I could see a mint condition Gold Key Fat Albert and The Cosby Kids comic book http://www.milehighcomics.com/cgi-bin/backissue.cgi?action=fullsize&issue=31320133744%201 (it's worth over 50 bucks!) next to a blown up photo of Archie Bunker. Irony: It permeates the joint.

What also permeates TGI Friday's is competent food and service. 

Kay had her heart set on the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips, which come off as redneck Asian fusion, like Maylene and the Sons of Disaster jamming with Sigh, those sesame seeds and Panko crumbs marrying that Jack Daniels glaze and chicken in a double shotgun weddin'. 

It was the equivalent seeing a goateed kid in a trucker cap and Alabama Thunderpussy shirt and finding out he's actually pretty cool and not fronting in the least. I mean, he really likes suvvern metal, and he wears the trucker cap because that's what he truly does for a living. Yee haw and hell yeah! 

In fact, I was so enamored with that scene, I got the Captain Morgan Caribbean Conga-Line Chicken Sandwich.  Ya get a chicken breast slathered in Captain Morgan's rum, which is put it in a brioche bun along with avocado, sour cream, pineapple pico, and...holy cilantro Batman! Cilantro's becoming my favorite herb, I swear. It does not taste like soap. I mean, these haters need to start speed dating or volunteering or something...

http://ihatecilantro.com/about.php

Enough about them. Instead of sweet potato fries I got the Loaded Mashed Potatoes. I dunno, I like cheddar and bacon in my mashed taters. If my mom made them this way years ago, I might have learned to like mashed potatoes at a much earlier age. I didn't know they still had them (it's been a few years since I've been to TGI Fridays). I had to ask for \"those mashed potatoes\" and nod a certain way. Our burly and very cool server Brian got the picture. 

Kay got a beautiful steak that looked like a brick shithouse and tasted like a dream. 

Dessert then commenced. I got the Oreo Madness which is just a big Oreo cookie with ice cream in the middle and hot fudge and caramel on an oblong plate. I picked it up and ate it as Kay and Brian chuckled. 

\"That's the way to do it, man,\" Brian said. 

I don't dismantle my Oreos either. You people who open them, eat the cream, and discard the cookie are misguided, man. 

Kay got the Brownie Obsession, and I hadda help her out with it, and it was good enough that I didn't mind. 

Kay also ordered a Pink Punk Cosmopolitan drink, something that involved cotton candy and was very girly. 

She accuses me of hating on chains just because they're chains, but she's wrong because if a chain's good, I won't hate on it, and TGI Friday's is pretty damn good even if they remind me of a certain classic of 90's comedic cinema...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md_dg8B8tmk

Brian didn't have any flair yet, but the flair was elsewhere fer sure. 

Hails...

{"text":"Just horrible. .. very inexperienced staff with absolutely no sense of urgency. The food taste very commercial and the portion size is very disappointing as well. I will not be back although I live right across the street."}
{"text":"Came here AGAIN to use a gift card. Food was decent. Service was ok. The lady had three tables and rushed around, stressed out. Tried to pay and was told the gift card system \"was down\". AGAIN. The manager offered no solution, told us it'll work again someday. Bummer dude. We're locals and we won't ever be back. Any day."}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey and never had issues at TGI's there, like I did here. I was on vacation and decided to stop by because I love TGI, worst mistake ever. It was me and another person I had a regular entree, the person I went with, went with the endless apps. So towards the end I wanted a to go container and was told I could not take my food home because I had order endless apps which doesn't allow it. Which I was not told, or made aware. Regardless what made me so mad was that they did not want to give me a to go container even though I still had food from my actual entree I order, my bill was about $70 u would think for the amount I'm paying I could at least take the rest of my entree home? No because the waitress which also mentioned she had managed the store before \"Claryssa\" could not break the rules for me but that she had before for people that didn't get there money worth. Which mad no sense to me because I had purchased a entree which I had all right to take home. I've never been told before that I couldn't take my own left overs home. Anyways I go to Vegas at least 3-4 times a year, will never be going near this place !"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great, food good, but waiting for our food was long. Our waitress made up for waiting on food with her attentiveness and great personality!  Hopefully next time wait time will be better."}
{"text":"Where to begin. It was a Thursday night at 6:30 PM.  The parking lot was filled. Normally, I would call that a good sign. But in this case, not.
I ordered the Fish Sandwich. I was picturing a breaded fish on soft bun. However, the Fish was dried out Mahi, rolled into small balls, placed in a pita-like bread and absolutely smothered with Balsamic Vinegar and raw garlic and onions. There were mushrooms and field greens thrown in with a yogurt sauce. 
This might have been the worst sandwich I have ever tasted. The balsamic was so thick it overpowered everything else.
I promptly ate it like a salad and pushed my bread to the side, as it was impossible to eat.
The Waitress was kind, but very hurried. She stopped at the table, but took flight as she asked for an answer to: \"You guys ok?\"
He ordered a Chicken Club, which was \" nothing special.\"
The iced tea was served absolutely warm. If only the restaurant employees remembered the phrase: \"the devil is in the details. \"
Apparently, the tea was just made and no one took the time to stir the ice into the glass.
The entire meal should have been sent back.
However, with a Server that is too rushed and not focused, the meal remained on the table.
The meal was awful and the service, reckless.
The bill was $27.00. I really wish we had gone to Olive Garden instead."}
{"text":"Service was great!  They welcomed us, promptly came over and asked us what we would like to drink (and brought us free refills - we were however drinking water) and I especially liked the fact that they had most of their televisions set to watch the local Vegas Golden Knights playoff game (round 2 - game 1) but once the food was delivered, well, it was game over. 

The nachos were bland.  Then came the hamburgers which were tasteless.  Nothing more than overcooked beef slapped between unseasoned inserts.  I had the cheese burger - wife had the non-cheese burger.  Both uneventful and borderline inedible.  Thankfully the Knights won the game but TGI Fridays has lost us at least at this location."}
{"text":"the yards here are cheaper compared to that of the strip's.  but getting the yard to the strip can be rather tricky.

marc out."}
{"text":"I went this time with an online coupon for my birthday and the Jack Daniels burger I ordered was not how I remember it tasting like? The burger patty was pretty much dry...not juicy at all as I remember it? Shame on them..this is a signature item at best??? I don't know but, I do know their baby back ribs are the bomb, that's for sure! My friend ordered the endless apps, but didn't like their teriyaki chicken bites...their pot stickers are great though! The server was great to say the least. She made our visit an all in all good time. Congratulations to these servers!!! They really make your visit a great experience, regardless! Hahaha"}
{"text":"I was there last night with a friend and the service was very lackluster and the shrimp cocktail was horrible.  E had to continue to flag our waiter down who failed to ever check in us and never asked for a refill.  I am a local that goes to the Orleans often but will never go back to this location.  The shrimp was chewy and old.  For $12 shrimp cocktail it tasted like old shrimp was served from prior days.  There was also lots of bats flying around...disgusting."}
{"text":"Poor service! Manager has a bad attitude because they messed up my order and I called him out! Basically, he tried to say they no longer serve the salad with an item, but its on the NEW menu! When I called him out, he proceeded to get loud and walked away! WTHay! #poor_customer_service
#pissed
I am calling the GM! Pronto!"}
{"text":"Because the loaded potato skins and single glass of Zinfandel came back up this morning after a night of tossing and turning, Friday's gets one star. I think it was bad wine I'm weary of this type of chain restaurant. And for good reason. 

I came with a group of gals to watch game 4, so it was packed. We were sat in an area where there were no tvs. So I had to squint from afar. Service was decent. I don't think I saw my waitress crack a smile. She wasn't rude, just seemed overwhelmed.

Food was about the same quality as their frozen options in the store. I thought my skins were decent. What I make at home is much better. Salads were served with dressing, which some folks don't like. I just can't get with Fridays. It's one of those places where I can always think of a better option."}
{"text":"walked in on a Friday afternoon in between lunch and dinner rush times and stood at the hostess stand for roughly 5 minutes. 3 waitresses and a bar tender looked right at me, made eye contact and never bothered to seat me. no where did it say open seating. very unprofessional to have a customer stand there and multiple employees just look at them."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years but tonight was the end of our TGI friendship. I ordered the NY strip .... medium well and it came tough and mooing. The manager was a lil snappy but her feet probably hurt. Finally they took it off the bill and we thankfully left .... hungry. Hopefully MCDonalds ice cream machine is working!"}
{"text":"I came this past weekend for a quick dinner there was hardly anyone in the restaurant , and it took us 20 mins to be seated and the hostess was very rude. The food was good but they need to work on there customer service ."}
{"text":"Convenient location in the casino. Slow service though and sirloin was not that good tonight- lined with a layer if tough fat. Used my entertainment book coupon so that helped and nice that you can charge to your room. We 'll be back but I'll order something different."}
{"text":"Loved this place food was good! Giving it 3 stars because Maria the server was kind of rude. She greeted us nicely but as soon as my boyfriend and I said \"we're only doing the endless appetizers\" her mood went from 100 to 0. She took the regular menus off went to grab the endless apps menu and just slid it on to our table and proceeded to the next table. We finally ordered and on our second round my boyfriend said \"are these the only apps?\" and she sighed, rolled her eyes, and nodded.. wtf María..


We over heard her talking to the manager about her second job and how she's stressed... I get it Maria, I was a server too once, and I too have problems at home, heck we all do.. If you're reading this Maria, don't stress, be happy, God only puts us through as much as we can handle, so the people who struggle the most have been chosen by God to be the strongest ones.. 

Just be mindful on how your attitude can greatly affect others..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 5 years, the service is always good and the people are friendly. The manager Chris make it a point to come around to check with us to make sure that we are being well taken care of. Also they update their menus often so there is always something new to try."}
{"text":"The food was just okay on a late Sunday night.  We had the sliders, chicken strips, green bean fries, and buffalo wings.  Didn't care much for the chicken strips though.  They were on the sweet side and breaded too much.  Since it's happy hour all day and night here, all of our dishes/appetizers were half off. 

Unfortunately our happy hour ended early.  We had a server who was rude and lifeless, not at all happy.  We never saw her smile and she was always rushing.  It really looked like she hated her job....which reflected on our dining experience."}
{"text":"We came for drinks and dinner around 9 on a Friday night! We were told that we would have a 30 minute wait,  but it ended up being close to an hour! Luckily, we found seats at the bar and were able to enjoy drinks while waiting. I understand a long wait when a place is packed, but they weren't that packed! They had at least 10 tables empty, most that were waiting to be bussed. TGI Friday's tends to become the club after a certain hour so I wasn't surprised to see a cop there starting around 10:30. Once seated, I enjoyed some fries while my friends ordered steak and chicken. The food is decent at Friday's, but the fries have too much seasoning.

I would return to this Friday's for drinks, but wouldn't plan on dining."}
{"text":"Great service, unfortunately horrible food. We're all in bed, with food poisoning since eating at this location last night. We had buffalo wings which looked spongy. Tasted weird. Cheeseburger, chicken and cheese, and steak. 5 of us respectively. We all had water. Now we each tried each others food so we really don't know what got us sick but when we went back to complain, Nor Fridays or Sam's Town is helping us as we are here doing horrible! Do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \"chain\" expectation. 

I order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.

Fortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. 

I'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day."}
{"text":"Why would a local go to a TGI Friday's inside the Orleans... good question.. that was definitely a lapse of judement! Fiance and I were looking for somewhere generic to eat lunch that was inbetween our offices.. I expected reliable, pretty good food

I ordered the turkey burger with cheese. Burger came out without cheese and then the guy proceeded to bring me a cold slice of cheese on a plate when I noticed it had no cheese. The burger was so cold the cheese wouldn't melt.. eww. seriously, throw it on the grill for a minute, how lazy are you? Oh and the bun was stale.. and kept breaking off as I ate it.. and the burger sucked. Nothing good about it. Service was obviously bad too."}
{"text":"Had heather born tonight at this location. Best service I've ever had in a Friday's, went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed/wanted. Every time me and my wife come back here we will be requesting her. Best service ever!"}
{"text":"Fridays is always a good place to get a meal, but I've noticed their prices go up. You can purchase a meal with an appetizer for $14, which can save you money, but overall I think that the food isn't worth the $12+ price for most items. The spinach artichoke dip is very good and they give you a lot of chips, which is nice because you don't have to ask them to refill it. The service was pretty good, although the hostess didn't direct me as to where my party would be, and I had to attempt to find them myself. The layout of the place is a little confusing and I walked all around the bar before I could find my party! Overall, I'd probably go to this particular Fridays again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I'd choose other Fridays locations before I go to this one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Fridays in the uptown area! I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with tomato mozzarella salad and jasmine rice pilaf, which was nothing short of amazing! The Jack Daniels sauce is to die for. I always order the tomato mozzarella salad. It is so good and it only 110 calories! The serving is rather large and the taste is unique from other restaurants' sides and is so yummy! The rice was good, though it is really high in calories (420), you'd actually save about half the calories eating fries! The rice was nothing great, so I would definitely order something else next time. The staff was really nice. We were even addressed upon leaving with \"Have a good day ladies!\" These simple things really do make a customer feel comfortable and appreciated. Our server was a young girl, and our table was difficult, some people making her wait as they decided on what they wanted to order, which I thought was rude, but she waited patiently and didn't show any frustration. She truly served to the best of her ability! Wonderful experience with staff! The food came out quick and refills were always replenished. My meal cost about $16, which I thought is a little pricey for chicken breasts, but that did include the sides and sauce. Although this Fridays is smaller than others, the staff and food is great compared to other Fridays and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! When asking to wait to be sitted, I asked why do I have to wait if you have 2 tables with no reservation empty. Jamie (Host) said that that's the wait it works and we have to wait, when asking why are you yelling in front of the customer she said \"I'm not yelling, I'M LOUD. When asking for the manager (Jeff) he said I will take care of that and THATS IT. We never received an apology and we did not feel appreciate. PLEASE, do not go to this place, there are tons of places you can go for a better dinning experience. Do not promote a fun atmosphere as a corporate marketing when this is the MOST unsatisfied place to go."}
{"text":"We usually stop in for their specials at the bar. On a game night we stop in for a drink or two and have some finger foods. Always had a great experience and our food is always delicious. I mean you can't go wrong with some fried food and a beer. Probably won't stop in for dinner, but it's a good place for casual drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"TGI Friday's is one of those places you go when you can't decide on anything in particular so you leave all possible the options open just in case. It's not a bad restaurant/bar, it's just uninspired. I will say that this TGI Friday's makes very good drinks. My sister orders some sort of Grey Goose peach cocktail and it's always tasty. The food is again not amazing and usually overpriced for what is essentially meat and potatoes. Even as I type this I added a star for the drinks and the nice servers. I have a thing about people bothering me just enough as I eat and TGI Friday's has it down. Enjoy that extra star, guys."}
{"text":"The jack daniels rack of ribs are yummy and I highly recommend the Tennesee Whiskey Cake.... so delicious. I gave this TGIF 4 stars because the drinks were not on point. Service, cleanliness and ambiance is really good too."}
{"text":"This place is always packed so i would suggest some out side seating to help with the over flow but other than that i am always back for the jack daniel specials, this fridays holds the standard"}
{"text":"No promotions here.  Was interested in the \"Endless Apps\" but apparently not available here.

Ordered a Jack Daniels Flat Iron steak with broccoli and sweet potato fries.  Waiter said SP fries $1 extra.  

Food was good, overall very well TGI.  Typical of good cooked TGI food.  This restaurant seems reasonably busy even when theres no events at the Consol, that combined with too few servers does mean service inevitably suffers. Don't come here if you are in a rush but they have good decent speed Wifi so its a nice place for a laid back meal if you find yourself in the area looking for food.  I would come here again! 

Read the reviews, the lower rating is due to service, not the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Normally our go to place at times before or after the movies at Alliante when we don't feel like doing the buffet.   The food is good, and the service ok to good depending on the day you go.  But we did noticed that their prices went up slightly compared to other restaurants like Apple Bees, Olive Garden, Chili, etc.   Inflation we guess.  However, their deserts are pretty darn good.  You've got to save room when you come and dine!"}
{"text":"Please look for LouAnn for your server. Food is great we ordered cajun pasta it was awesome"}
{"text":"Decent meal. Small portions, dirty forks,uneven chairs and they don't come back to refill drinks. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This location by far tops any TGI Fridays I have ever visited. First I will start with the hours of operation. This location is open 24 hours and has an abundance of bar seating, as well as tables located in the bar and restaurant area. The location is pretty central to anywhere you are in the Gold Coast. Second, the food is great if your looking for your usually chain restaurant type food. The temperature is always hot, and comes out in a timely manner. 
They have a great happy hour from 4pm to 7pm and starts back up from 9pm to 6am. Happy hour consists of $6 select appetizers as well as drinks. 
The best thing I would say about this Tgifridays is the staff! The staff really makes the dining experience. Majority of the time I end up in the bar area, so the bartenders really accommodate my friends and I. A big shout out to the staff that make this place run at the craziest of hours. Amber, Jose, Sabrina, Tracy, Selena, and Brandon are great people that always have a smile on their face, even at the most hectic of times.
I would give this location nothing less than 5 stars. Being local and living in Vegas, I have had terrible service at restaurants located on the strip. This is a great place to come and enjoy food, company, and great service. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"We met friends staying at Sam's Town, so decided to hit the happy hour at TGI Friday. The manager greeted us and asked if everything was OK, before we even order. A little too quick on the draw there. By the time our server came over to us, happy hour was over. We did't complain much because our friend had a gold card. And the service was still horrible. The service was incredibly slow, with maybe three tables filled. The staff was standing around the bar gossiping. Each time we tried to flag someone over to our table, it was always with an attitude. Good thing they checked out of Sam's Town, and no need to go back there."}
{"text":"Food is great I can't say much for the service and the hostess who upon arriving welcomed us with a \"what!\""}
{"text":"We sat at the bar because we were told it was going to be a 20-25 min wait. So we sat at the bar which wasn't crowed. It took about 6 minutes from when we sat down u till we were asked for our drink orders. In that time I went to the restroom and discovered that there were at least 8-10 tables on the other side of the restaurant that were open. After we placed our order our food did come out in a timely manner. Our appetizer came first and shortly after our entree. The attitude and person-ability of our waitress was great. Our entree, we ordered the Sicilian stacked burger and the smoked stacked burger. Let's say the presentation was terrible. It looked like a child assembled both burgers. The meat on both were over cooked and charred.  The flavor of the Sicilian was bad. The smoked was just ok. For both of us who are on a diet and this being our cheat meal we were berry disappointed. We should have went to Applebee's or red robin for burgers. Definitely won't me back to this location and do not recommend.  I only give it a two because of the waitress."}
{"text":"Ya know how when one gets a deli sandwich at a deli they pile  the meat two inches high or more n the center and the thickness drops to a millimeter or two around the edge, imparting a sense of over-abundance?
Fridays took a page from that playbook with their new Reuben, but forgot the part where the meat's two inches high in the center. 
It was two millimeters high under 60% of the bread and trailed off to nothing around the perimeter.
To make one think there was actually a meal involved, they made it a triple-decker, and then piled one half-sandwich atop the other for an excellent presentation promising aplenty and if one planned to eat toast, supplying it as well.  If one actually expected a reasonable portion of protein, it was a no-show!  
Opted for the steakhouse fries over the standard ones for an extra buck, cause it costs more to cut the potato in wedges than to cut it into fries  I guess.
The other party's New Orleans shrimp and chicken dish was fine sans the several un-chew-able bits of connective tissue or silver skin that was left in the chicken breast medallions. 
Service was quite good, but it seems that leaving one's \"Give Me Stripes\" card out on the table no longer automatically generates the complimentary chips and salsa, nor a query as to whether or not it is desired.  Oh well, no huge loss there."}
{"text":"Currently on my way to the ER from severe food poisoning. The service here is wonderful but I won't be going back. My margarita also smelled like old sponge as I watched the bartender dip the rim of the glass into what appeared to be a dried out sponge to salt the rim of the glass.  I should send them my hospital bill."}
{"text":"*Endless Apps for $12 Review* Out of my own volition, I uncharacteristically sought out TGIF to get the endless appetizer special because I was starving, and the fat girl in me thought this was a good idea for dinner on a Friday night. For all interested parties, you can only order 1 app at a time. 

BRUSCHETTA: Definitely the best appetizer out of the 3 I tried. A little heavy handed on the balsamic vinegar, but the bruschetta overall was tastier than I expected! I liked that the bread wasn't the usual crusty kind of bread. 3.5/5

MOZZARELLA STICKS: The cheese didn't taste fresh or real enough. They were just barely okay. 2.5/5

LOADED POTATO SKINS: Is this even edible food fit for human consumption? I asked for no bacon, being a vegetarian and all, and what was served in front of me was appalling. The potato didn't taste like a potato and the nacho cheese tasted old. I could barely stomach one bite. Plus, I found bacon bits on the bottom of some of the potatoes! I think they messed up on my order and tried to reserve me the same potatoes. Gross! 0/5

SERVICE: Started off slow but once our waitress showed up she made sure I had lots of apps coming in one after the other. Refills took longer to get than I would've liked and plates weren't cleared that fast either. 2.5/5

Worth a Return Visit?
Hells to the no. This recent visit was TGIF's last shot at winning me over. After consistently being disappointed in their food, I'm giving up on this chain completely.

{"text":"The food is pretty good though I wish it wasn't ha. 30 minutes to be seated, waited 20 minutes for drinks, another 20 for food. They told me they aren't allowed to mention $10 unlimited apps. After finding this out I cancelled my steak and got the apps. Perry, my server, was cool about it."}
{"text":"What happened to Friday's?! The quality of the food has gone down tremendously. I've always been a huge fan of their spinach dip, but now it's a spinach-queso dip. Sounds amazing, right? Wrong! The only thing tha was halfway decent were the Jack Daniel's chicken strips. Has anyone else noticed that their prices have also gone up, but the portions are smaller? In my college days, this use to be the spot. Now it feels more like TGI Monday's."}
{"text":"Tanesha is the best bartender around she's very nice and easy to talk to! She's constantly smiling and is very good at what she does! I definitely come here just for her!!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to a movie and stopped at TGI Friday's afterwards for dinner. They have a special steak and lobster that was extremely good.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection.  Served with a very fresh baked potato and really good broccoli. I personally am not a fan of lobster but was extremely impressed the flavor was tender and sweet. I am definitely a fan and would definitely come back here. Service was fabulous."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife, daughter and grandson for lunch today. The service was extremely slow as they forgot one persons order. The manager did apologize and took an appetizer off the bill. I ordered pot stickers, corned beef sliders and French onion soup. Ehe pot stickers were the highlight of the meal. The sliders were ok, but the soup was dreadful. Not even any cheese in it with a couple pieces of bread floting on the top making it look like an unflushed toilet.  Don;t need it."}
{"text":"Service and food was good. We had the chosen sandwich and the half rack of ribs. Would eat here again. Our server was attentive. Also had pot stickers and cheese sticks. Yum!"}
{"text":"wow so good. smashed the chicken quesadilla appetizer as a meal. greatest thing ever. the bday ice cream was bombbbb as heck!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a guys night out. The apps are the best and I would recommend this place to my friends and fellow Yelpers.  The waiter was very friendly and the service was at a great pace. The crispy chicken fingers are the best and so is the burgers too. I do not normally get desserts but I did for this place and I am glad I did."}
{"text":"10 minute wait for an empty dinning room due to \"the kitchen being backed up\" - waitress even says kitchen is backed up. So guess we will be here a while. If backed up hope the food coming out is atleast good!"}
{"text":"Dude this places sucks. You want \"meh\" service this is the place to come. You want food that's not properly heated or you want your food to come out at different times as the rest of the table - then come here! Got sizzling chicken and cheese, turns out the dam cheese isn't even melted on a God dam sizzling iron skillet. And when you talk to the manager and he acknowledges the server messed up, he just looks at you blankly. They comped the drinks, so that's why they regained a star but far from a 5 star Las Vegas eatery."}
{"text":"Quality of food was quite disappointing. Haven't been here in years and it still is mediocre at best. My lobster was burned and my ribs barely had any meat on them. My dad got the steak and lobster special, which is quite misleading for how small the lobster tail is. I could get a much better meal at a restaurant like Outback honestly."}
{"text":"Ate at Friday's today w/ the wife's team from work.  We had a nice day of bowling and dinner.  

I ordered the Fish n Chips on this trip and they were really, really delicious.  The french fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I think these are some of the better fries I've had anywhere.  The fish was cooked well in a delicious batter and it was light and tasty.  Very good!

The service was excellent, but even though we called ahead, we still waited about 15 minutes for our table.  But that's okay because there were 13 of us.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a co-worker today at Friday's.  The host ignored us when we walked in, but he did seat us while chatting with another employee.  That's okay because our waitress was super friendly and nice.

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side salad and it was good.  My co-worker ordered blue cheese burger and he really liked it.  The prices here are a little high for the amount of food you receive, but the food was pretty good.  

With all the good restaurants on Mayfield Road, I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The wait here was really long and our waitress seemed uninterested and annoyed. But the food and drinks were great. Chicken was a bit dry but the lobster was surprisingly good and sweet."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game last min.  Service is slow and food in always cold.  But watching the game is great"}
{"text":"The service wasn't bad. I just wish they would hire more servers so that they don't have to rush around. My server had a group sitting next to me complaining but if you saw him you would see he had to many tables. My review isn't because of him. It should be where they have enough servers. The food was just ok for the price."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices only if you sit in bar is wrong.  Place looked over staffed. Time would have been better spent cleaning drink and food menus. This Friday's looks a little outdated. Maybe that's just me. It has been a while since I have been in one. Too many choices on the menu. I thought it a little odd that the only way to get the pecan encrusted chicken was in a salad. It was good. Had to go out of our way to get to it. Don't think I will again."}
{"text":"Went in very hungry and left on an empty stomach.

I had ordered their \"Balsamic Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad\", which seemed very appetizing as advertised on the menu. Prepared with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, balsamic marinated chicken, parmesan cheese, croutons and a balsamic vinaigrette. Yum, right!? When I ordered the dish, I asked for no croutons or cheese. After waiting for 30 min they brought me a plate of nothing but plain romaine lettuce and two saucers of regular caesar dressing. Yea.. Just a plate of lettuce... No chicken. No cherry tomatoes. No balsamic vinaigrette. It was a plate with nothing but old brown wilting romaine lettuce. Come on... If you are going to bring me a plate of just lettuce at least let it be fresh and green!

So I called the waitress over asking where my missing ingredients were. She apologized and said that she'd be right out with what I ordered. I also asked her twice to replace the lettuce with some fresh cut romaine. Waited about 5 minutes and she came out with the \"complete\" plate of caesar. However, guess what? Still the same old nasty lettuce, the two regular ceaser-filled saucers were there. The kitchen only added a saucer of balsamic vinaigrette and a tiny piece of chicken, which was not balsamic marinated and added tomatoes.

I simply lost my appetite by this time. It was too difficult for them to get a simple salad straight so I cancelled my dish and left. All I had was a soda."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star, I would. The last 4 times I've been in this place, I've waited almost 10 minutes to be greeted and the ONLY reason I WAS greeted was because I physically got up to speak with a manager about NOT being greeted after 10 minutes. Food is shit too. Everything tastes like I bought the TGI frozen apps from the grocery store. Piss poor service, managers are half ass apologetic and it's a disappointment bc it's so close to me but I will NEVER repeat EVER give this place my time or money again."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Sam's Town location on Tuesday night with my wife and daughter.  Wasn't sure what I was hungry for, but my daughter ordered herself a wedge salad with a side of sweet potato fries.  My wife and I wanted to split an order of the fried green beans.

My wife decided she wanted the ribeye steak with shrimp because the picture looked good, and I agree, in the menu the picture looks very good.  I was going to go with the burger and bottomless fries for $10, but decided that the steak looked so good that I'd have what she's having.  

My daughter got her salad and fries very quickly.  The salad looked okay, since it was 90% plain iceberg lettuce it's hard to mess that up.  She also liked her fries and said they were good.

Our green bean fries arrived next, and I was so disappointed.  I remember getting these before for around $6 and you good a fairly decent amount of beans.  This time they were about $8.50 and there was a modest amount of green beans.  I was frankly shocked at how few beans there were.  I will say though, they were hot, crisp, and delicious.

Our steaks came next.  The best thing I can say about them is that they were cooked properly, mine medium and my wife's medium well.  We got the shrimp scampi, which for some reason came on a barbeque stick and looked grilled...hmmm, I thought scampi was baked in garlic butter sauce.  Also, while I know I'm not high-class, I hate having to peel my shrimp to eat them.  I find it unappetizing and then you're left with the matter of where to put used shrimp shells - not fun.  The Parmesan cheese fries were tasty, but there were only about a half dozen of them.  The vegetables were terrible, I thought they had been soaked in vinegar - awful!  The problem with that is that the vinegar soaked into everything on the plate affecting the taste of everything negatively.  I thought it was just me, until my wife spoke up about how strong the vinegar flavor was.  I felt relieved that it wasn't just my tastebuds acting up!

The namesake steak was flavorful, but quite gristly and fatty, although I know and expect some of that from a ribeye, I guess at $24 bucks each I expect better - hell I could have gotten Fillet Mignon for $20 at Billy Bob's in the same casino.  

When asked how we like our dinners we commented that the vinegar taste was displeasing and inquired what part of the meal included vinegar, or if it was a mistake.  The waitress said she would go into the kitchen and inquire.  She returned a few minutes later with the bill.  Never said one word about the vinegar taste, I looked at my wife, and we agreed we weren't going to get any answers from this server.  

Very disappointed in this dining experience, and it especially burns as the bill came to $85 including tip.  I struggle to think how this restaurant can survive when you can get a much better meal, and service, from at least 3 other restaurants in the same damn casino!"}
{"text":"I usually like to eat at this place but it is going downhill and very fast.....
Why is there a 5-10 wait for 2 people when there is clearly 18-20 table empty and not counting the tables that had not been cleaned yet?
The greeter did not want to be there and it showed from the the he held the door open.
The only saving grace was our server was very friendly and attentive. Even though it took a rather long time for our food to arrive and we ordered salads.
I give it a 3 because the server was professional and food was good....."}
{"text":"Very dirty establishment. Had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, there are about 20 tables (at the very least) empty. When I asked why there was a wait, The hostess said the wait was due to the kitchen, not seating. The pictures I posted are from the surrounding tables around my husband and I after 10 minutes of us already seated. The prices are just as high if not higher than a steakhouse. Need I say more? The food was dry. Ribs seemed like they were a day old. I've been waiting for a water refill for 15 minutes. The waitress asked how my food was, I replied that it wasn't that good, she said she sorry and walked away and I haven't seen her since. I'm really disappointed."}

{"text":"When my date and I came here, it was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table.  Our server didn't visit us often, but she was very nice.  The veggie burger that I had was good.  Not extraordinary, but I'd come back here again.  I enjoy bowling here at the Orleans, so it's a good possibility!"}
{"text":"Love coming here after work..... Just love it.... People r nice , food is good..... Drink is cheap!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Scenario:  you're looking for some inexpensive food and a drink before you have to wake up early for work the next day.  You head into Olive Garden but their ridiculous wait sends you straight for the door.  You go down the road to about a quarter of a mile to Friday's and immediately get a seat-yourself booth in the bar area.  Score... proceed to have an enjoyable meal with a decent drink and mediocre service at great prices.

This is the scenario we found ourselves in last night and were glad we did.  We took advantage of happy hour at the bar (which actually lasts all day).  It offers $6 appetizers (which are otherwise 8 to 9 dollars) and inexpensive drinks.  The apps were incredible!  I especially loved the hibachi chicken skewers.  We split three apps and we were STUFFED.  

The service is as good as it could be in one of these places on a Friday night... slow but easy enough to get what we needed.  

They have a \"Give Me More Stripes\" rewards program where you build up points that give you free apps and entrees over time.  You'll also receive emails to \"jump the line\" if there's a wait (obnoxious if you're the one getting jumped in front of lol) and 20% off the entire meal.  

Overall they have some pretty good stuff here if you're in the mood for this sort of thing.  The prices are good and the rewards program can make them even better."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has such bad reviews. My family and I shared a meal here on MLK. We were pleasantly surprised. I know chains are pretty much hit or miss which is why we tend to stay away from them. My CLT family really enjoys this place...we shared a sampler app,steaks, burgers, salads and kids meals. We no complaints, we finished it all and really enjoyed our visit. Our waitress was from Cali and very chatty but very pleasant! Will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience at this venue to date.  First they have a bogo free entree when you show a movie ticket. I showed them my tickets in my iPhone wallet from fandango. The Manager said he needed a copy of the ticket emailed to him, because the owner didn't trust them about giving away free food. The standard with the ad has no such statement. The wife's bacon-wrapped shrimp was raw. They did nothing about the unhealthy food. 

This was unforgivable.

{"text":"We came out for a birthday lunch on a fairly empty Sunday. We were a larger group, so we expected it might take a little time. They apparently were very short-staffed and our wait times definitely reflected that. 

I ordered the New York Sour Crush and the husband ordered a draft beer. We waited almost 45 minutes. I can understand a limited wait time for a cocktail that has to be made, but a beer? Additionally, three members of our party each ordered one of their drinks that has cotton candy and comes with its own shaker. The server came over with a single shaker and tried to split it between all three of them. Only one glass was filled, the other wasn't even halfway and the last didn't see a drop. Once we spoke with management, they came over and the issue was cleared up (i.e. all three people received their drinks), but by this time, I was still waiting for my cocktail, another person had ordered, received and finished their cocktail, my husband was still waiting for his beer and I was just over it. I told the manager she could cancel my drink, but she showed up with it in hand a few minutes after that. I don't know if she didn't hear me or just decided to bring it anyway. For what it's worth, the drink was good. Not good enough to wait for almost an hour, but good all the same. 

The food was merely okay as well. I ordered their $14.99 special with the salmon and ribs. The ribs were nicely charred, but incredibly tough. The salmon was moist and had decent flavors. The mashed potatoes were good and the Brussels were okay. This is after I had to send the food back to be reheated, though. It clearly was one of the first meals prepared, but was sitting nowhere near a heat lamp or a warmer. It was barely warm when they brought it out to me.

Eh. I mean, it's TGI Fridays, so it's not like I was expecting to be blown away or whatever, but hot food and drinks in a timely manner really isn't hoping for too much and they did not deliver on that at all."}
{"text":"we came by for lunch after checking out. i wanted nachos and mama wanted a salad. i figured this would be an ideal spot to facilitate those needs.

the hostess who sat us was not very pleasant. she tried to seat us at the bar section, on a bar table. mind you, we have our luggage with us and didn't ask to be seated at the bar. when i asked her for a dining room booth, she looked less than thrilled to be burdened with this task. she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses. 

our server was a nicer individual. we ordered nachos and mama had a cobb salad. mama gets picky with her orders sometimes. this time she didn't get \"too\" picky. she did ask for NO bleu cheese though. we thought it was simple enough. i also asked for a lemon for my water. needless to say, i point those items out because they were not accomplished. the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad. we ordered dessert, the brownie with ice cream. that was real good. 

would've gone with 3 stars, cause the server was nice. but, the hostess and the missed items make me have to drop one. call it 2.5"}
{"text":"I have gone from a TGIF fan to completely removing them off our restaurant rotation.  We used to come here on a regular basis for a weekend lunch.  I love their Yucatan Chicken Salad and was ordering the lunch portion of this salad every visit.  As for my bf, he likes to try something different and it happy with the choices.  

On our last visit, I was told they no longer offer the lunch portion of this salad on the weekend even though this is not indicated on the menu.  And reason being according to our smart aleck little server, they have a new manager and he says no.  So, of course, I ask to speak to the manager and our server wanders off.  When she returns, I am then told that I can have my lunch portion salad after all.  If this sound trivial to you, the lunch portion only has 400 calories while the regular portion has 760 calories.  That's a big difference.  So, even though the price difference is not that much, I am not ordering the 760 calories version and then trying to decide how much I should actually eat. 

I am further annoyed when the check arrives and we are being charged for the full size salad.  So, of course, we ask to speak to the manager, but our server does manage to correct the check.  Do I need this nonsense when I go out for lunch?  No, I do not.  Ciao to you TGIF.  Sorry, there are other restaurants who are customer friendly."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for happy hour with my boyfriend, we told the host we were there for happy hour which he said was only in the bar area. We looked in and saw several open tables but he told us there would be a 10 minute wait since there weren't enough servers in the section, no problem. So we said we'd grab a drink at the bar until a table was ready. After waiting at the bar for about 15 or 20 minutes, I told my boyfriend to go back to the host stand just to clarify that we still wanted a table, he did and the host assured him that he would come to the bar to get us when a table was ready. Well, that NEVER happened! After a few drinks at the bar we were starving so just ended up ordering food there, which was fine, but not what we had planned. We were going to just politely mention it to the host on the way out but he was nowhere to be found, my guess is his shift ended and he never told the next host about us. As far as service at the bar, it was friendly although somewhat slow considering that the bar was not very busy. I had been craving a frozen drink but the bartender said she was new and didn't think there was a menu with frozen drinks on it, but if I came up with something she'd make it. I did and it was fine, nothing special though and I just really would have liked to have some kind of specialty concoction at a chain like this. Our food was decent, nothing special though, and I realized after leaving that my appetizer was not discounted for happy hour, oh well. This was not a great experience and with so many other options in town I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Friendly staff. Great price! The Italian dishes are superb. Especially the veal meatball."}
{"text":"I had to wait for almost 20 minutes at the bar before the bartender appear to take my order.  I thought he was stocking are doing some business but really he just he came out with nothing in his hands it's obvious he wasn't doing anything I waited for 20 minutes at the bar before he took my order and had to wait another five minutes before I got my drink it was very disappointing.  I could see if the place was busy but it was really slow and it's a shame that I has wait so long.  

I will say this the draft glasses are amazing they're so cold the beer came out ice chilled one of the most refreshing beers I've had in a long time.   I had the spinach dip and the barbecue chicken flatbread.  The dishes were average however we did not have to wait long service in the food department was really good!

The food service and the chilled glass save the review, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the most awful experience there tonight! Went with 5 other girlfriends for girls night out. Started off ok but quickly went downhill. The server, Brianna, was gone for long periods at a time. But the worst part was that she FORGOT to put one of our orders in! The rest of us got our food but my friend's order NEVER came! We waited and waited and then flagged down another server to check on it and she got snippy with us. Finally our server came and said she FORGOT it but it should only be 5 or 10 minutes. So we waited and waited. Then they brought all the food to the table behind us, including ribs which is what my friend had ordered and NEVER got! She was STILL waiting and the rest of us were almost done eating! So we asked for the manager and then WAITED some more! It took her forever to get to us and then she was NOT helpful at all! She did apologize in some way but basically made all kinds of excuses and made us feel like it was somehow our fault! My friend finally got her food and immediately put it in a to go box to take home. She had totally lost her appetite and was so mad by then that she couldn't eat! Even the table behind us was appalled at everything and how terribly the manager handled the fiasco. Needless to say, none of us left a tip and we'll never go back there, not to mention that we will tell everyone how awful it was! All they did for my friend was not charge her anything. But it really ruined the night for ALL of us! More should have been done to rectify this! Never again!"}
{"text":"Go for the 13.99 Steak and Lobster special, stay for the...well, don't stay. Just eat and leave, cause this is TGI Friday's and the rest of Las Vegas is just outside your door!

{"text":"Yeah, 4 stars.  I don't quite understand how this is possible myself.   I almost stopped myself from doing this review considering the ridicule and shame this could potentially bring to my Yelp name.  Ultimately the truth has to be told, and if I'm the one who has to say I had a 4 star experience at the TGI Fridays in Sam's Town, then so be it.

So it was Sunday, and I sat in a booth at the bar waiting for my friends to arrive.   First thing I noticed was that Happy Hour prices are in effect ALL DAY on Sunday in the bar and dining area (TGIS).   Good start to the visit, but I figured maybe their happy hour was limited to bottles of miller lite and some sugar loaded kool-aid tasting drinks.  To my pleasant surprise they had 20 oz glasses of Guinness for $4.  Hmmmm, this is turning promising.  All appetizers except the platters?  $6.  I started questioning why I'd never been to a TGI Friday's for happy hour at this point.  Friends finally arrived as I was finishing my first Guinness (3 more would follow), and we ordered the following appetizers throughout our visit:   Pretzel sticks with cheese and bacon sauce, Spinach dip, Hummus plate, Cheeseburger sliders, Some chicken bites thing, and potstickers.  I've seen several reviews mentioning poor service but our experience was anything but poor.  Adrian kept the drinks flowing and the food came out at reasonable times throughout the entire night.  As for the food, it was all good for what it is.   I don't expect the Hummus to rival that of a great mediterranean and it certainly didn't, and the sliders didn't make me forget about Bachi Burger, but if you're fine with sodium and calorie laded comfort food that tasted better with each frosty beverage, you might enjoy yourself as much as I did.  

Splitting the bill amongst our entire party I think we ended up spending about $25 a piece which I thought was an incredible value (though I'm sure my doctor would disagree)."}
{"text":"Blargh! This place is pretty bad. To be fair, when your Grandma tells you she \"wants the shrimps, Angela!\" and wants to go to TGI Fridays, you take her. Obviously, this place has bad corporate mojo vibe all over it, but our server was nice (almost too nice?) and the food came out at decent timing, so I guess thats good?

Everything else was ick. Wait, thats a lie. I liked the fried green beans, but who doesnt like anything fried? Lets get to the main dishes. I had some sort of bruschetta pasta dish with chicken. That must have been the saddest chicken ever. I imagine when they were slaughtering it, the chicken was like, \"Go ahead, just do it. I hate this dark, sick world\". Yes, it was the driest, limpest, most flavorless piece of meat they could plop on some overcooked, gloopy pasta. Just bad. No one else at the table seemed too impressed by their meals either. Even Grandma only ate two of her 12 shrimp."}
{"text":"First time at New location, little pricier than I remember TGIF.  The food was as good as I expected.  Our waiter wasn't as attentive as he should have been.  Would come back if the opportunity and desire to arise."}
{"text":"I never like to leave bad reviews but this experience forced me to. They served us burnt pretzels which we returned , they gave us a  new order which wasn't as bad . We should have left but we hoped it would get better . IT DIDNT . Bottom line our main meals were so bad , our stomachs were killing us while we still were in the restaurant. We literally had to go straight home and both use the restroom . Gross , disgusting . Will never go back ."}
{"text":"It has been probably 6 or 7 years since my last visit to a TGI Fridays and now I remember why.

Perhaps Im showing my age a bit here, but I recall 15 - 20 years ago that Friday's was the place to be and had relatively good food.  Alas, those days are long gone.

We started with the Warm Pretzels and \"craft beer dipping sauce\".  How bad could that be, right?   Well, instead of pretzels I would swear that these were your average restaurant bread sticks with some sort of egg wash and salt added to them.  Other than the salt, these tasted nothing like a pretzel.

My wife got the broccoli and cheese soup as well which looked and tasted exactly the same as the cheese dipping sauce for the pretzels with a few stems of broccoli thrown in.  

We held out hope for the Burger and Salad that we ordered for out entrees, but there was no hope to be had.  The Bun was old and stale, the burger was definitely frozen and had a bad texture to it and of course, the fries were cold.

My wife ordered the Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad.  She had 4 or 5 bites and was done.  It was just off tasting.

The service was decent - what could be expected these days at the middle of the road chains.  We never saw a manager, but I guess if I was serving this food, I would be hiding in the back office as well.

What a shame to see Friday's fall so far.   I mean, is it really that hard to make a FRESH Burger?  If the mall kiosk can make a pretzel, why can't this place.  

I really had reasonable expectations going in, but yet they still found a way to disappoint."}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars only because the food was good. Awful service ! Server had to triple check the drink we ordered before she put it in and brought us the wrong drink anyways. When we told her it was the wrong drink she argued that it was the right drinks. Finally had to show her the ingredients to prove we were given the wrong drink.

{"text":"I've been to TGI Fridays' numerous times with the \"gang\" from work, we go to celebrate someone leaving the group, the holidays, or just because something came up.  We go because of the cheap apps and drinks during happy hour.  

Today I am here with my husband and we have a coupon for a free entree so we're going to take advantage of it.  We started with an appetizer, the crab cakes, there are two cakes on the plate with a good dipping sauce.  The cakes are pretty good, you can taste the crab meat.

For an entree I got the salmon with lobster.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, however, it was to have a mushroom and lobster with alfredo sauce.  It was barely covered in sauce so it was slightly dry.  There were a \"glob\" of mushrooms all stuck together as if it was spooned out of a jar and thrown on top.  I asked for double vegetables instead of rice or potato to decrease some carbs and it was mostly broccoli, slightly undercooked. 

So as for my meal, I would say very disappointing, but for drinks and appetizers, it's not a bad place to meet.  Glad we had a coupon!"}

There was no wait so I just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area. Service was quick and I ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings. Food was on par like with any other Friday's franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce. 

Lucky for me I was able to charge it to my room so I cab earn some points for my stay."}

First we made the mistake of coming here while a Steelers game was on, so naturally, everyone including the wait staff was more focused on the game than anything else. We saw our waiter one time throughout the night and the rest of the time he was standing there watching the TV, not even 20 feet from us. 
Our drinks never got refilled. 

My boyfriend ordered a 3 meat sampler plate which was not cheap- about 24 dollars I believe. It was advertised served with seasoned rice with mixed vegetables. My boyfriend asked them to hold the broccoli - I believe it was- and the waiter said no problem.
When his food arrived, there was absolutely no rice or veggies- just three measly pieces of meat on a plate- Not even enough to satisfy one person as an appetizer. When my boyfriend asked what happened to his rice and the other vegetables, the waiter said that the broccoli was already mixed in with everything else, so instead of telling him that, they gave him nothing at all. The waiter didn't even offer him a different side dish. We were not paying full price for 3 TINY pieces of meat.

Luckily the manager came over refunded the entire check. This is the last time we will go to this Friday's due to the seriously poor service."}
{"text":"Airport restaurant/bars, you have only one job: to get stuff out fast. Nobody's hanging around lounging at the Airport TGIF's for the whacky atmosphere. The concept behind having a limited menu at these places is, ideally, to get food up fast by reducing the number of things that have to be prepared. In this particular case, as a satellite operation to another TGIF's located in the core, I have my strong suspicions the food is cooked at the core kitchen and brought out through the service corridor. Because after waiting for over 40 minutes after ordering for my food to come up...it came out cold and kind of congealed. As if, oh, maybe somebody had forgotten it and left it waiting for a long time. (The server assured me a couple of times that the food was on its way, although that may have been boilerplate.)

The only reason I don't give them one star here is the server comp'd my drink order after I'd sent the food back, but I'll never get that hour back in my life and ended up having to stuff some overpriced peanuts from the newsstand into my craw in order to get a \"meal\" before my flight left. (The server was nice, and relatively attentive which leads me to believe this was a kitchen screw-up.)

I don't like writing angry bad reviews as a rule of thumb based on a single experience, but future fellow travelers, if you have a choice, it is what it is. You are warned."}
{"text":"So the location and the Menu variety lead us to this Friday's location. In town for March madness and game watching we got hungry. We were greeted promptly and drink order fulfilled. TV's had basketball on and no seat at the table was in bad viewing area. Food order placed with specific details that seemed to be pretty easy. No cheese on a burger and different bun....seems easy enough we thought...food is delivered with cheese and wrong bun. We notify the server, he says he will take it back. After 12 mins go by and everyone is done eating we inquire about the entree whereabouts....server says \"it's real busy back in the kitchen\"...Sad to hear that... After another 3 minutes go by the burger comes out...wrong bun but at least no cheese. At this point we just wanted to get and go. I could see from this point that the service would go downhill from here. Our ticket arrived I picked up the entire bill and left gratuity. In future when we visit we will look elsewhere as we have many choices in the area.

{"text":"This place has gone down like a sinking ship the food quality is horrible except a select few items. I had the black bean burger with avocado it was great . My wife had the cajun shrimp pasta it was good . The appetizers were horrendous the bacon nachos they served us had stale chips tasted like the Morton salt factory and cheese and probably undercooked bacon didnt look done . The chicken quesadilla had 2 slithers of onion no pico on the side nothing . Service is ok here friendly staff but slipping on the basics like napkins on the table wowww 4 napkins for 2 people with the endless app deal . I should say the endless slop deal Im a big food person and I have been cooking since I was 9 and this is the worse of any of the corporate restaurants Ive seen. The burgers are all good so if you eat here play it safe folks I better get my Donagel ready now!!!"}
{"text":"I can only guess the positive reviews for this restaurant has gotten our either paid posters or workers at the managers have made post while they're dead like they are here today on a Friday at 4:30.

How  bad,  I had to call the restaurant from the front door after waiting to be seated for 5 minutes. Yes I had to call the restaurant and tell someone to please come out and greet me. This  was while four to five people were walking all around didn't even say didn't even say hi.

Or your side of onion rings I got four.

New bigger rib special is a joke. First set were at best a 1/3 rack at any other place.  Meat was thin and so tough I could barely get what little meat there was off the bone.


It's not like they're busy, in the hole restaurant the blank 9 tables for people sitting.

My waiter Jeremy was the only bright spot of the whole meal. 

If you noticed most of my views are four to five stars.

I hardly ever leave a bad one.
This place is the worst experience you'll ever have.

You have been warned  don't come here."}
{"text":"Chaos. Choose another restaurant. Drink menu was outdated and needed to be replaced, so server had to give us the real menu verbally. Ribs took forever to get there and were tough and not much meat. Fries were cold, but our sweet server brought us some fresh hot ones. Whoops, no silverware at our table and another 5 minute wait to get it. Tennessee whiskey cake for dessert was also mediocre. We heard another customer complain loudly that he was waiting a long time for his meal. Remind me not to come here again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant - quick service and nice location.  I think it tends to be busy, but we hit it at a decent time and only has about a five minute wait.  I had the chicken smothered with cheese and veggies - it was good and more than i could eat.  Hubby ordered the fish and chips and said it was excellent.  Service was fast and they were even running a special for bogo entrees when you showed your movie tickets...made for a nice, inexpensive date night."}
{"text":"I went to this TGI Friday's on a Friday night, so I went in knowing it was going to be a pretty busy place.  I didn't think it was going to be as bad as I experienced.

When my party walked in, it didn't seem like the five people at the hostess stand really wanted to greet us and were more concerned with mingling amongst themselves.  We told them we had a table of five, and one of the hostess' informed us it was going to be an hour wait.  Since we were hungry, we walked out of the restaurant, and one of the workers started waving us down because they had an opened table.  The sad part?  The opened table that was already clean was RIGHT BEHIND them.  Five people couldn't see an opened table clearly behind them?  Wow.

After we sat down, we were greeted by a nice waitress, but her service was not all that great.  Through out the night, it was hard to find her or get her attention because she would pass by our table.  She also didn't seem as concerned when I informed her that my appletini glass had a lipstick mark on it.  My friend was able to spot it across from the round table we were sitting at, and she didn't even see it before she handed it to me.  

The food was good, but took way too long to receive.  I think that we waited a good 30 minutes for our appetizers.  I don't even know how long we were waiting for our entree as I started getting cranky and moody like I always do when I'm hungry.

I feel that I probably won't be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"If you want amazing service from the best bartender in Monroeville then the bar at TGI Fridays is the place to go... But only if Jody is there! She is my favorite - always remembers to say hi to my boyfriend and me by name! It's the little things that make a difference. She has an infectious laugh and its hard not to have a good day when she smiles.  I cannot say enough good things about her. She is usually there on Saturday afternoon. If you go, tell her Steve and Teresa say hi... She's so incredible she'll know who you're talking about!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch with a friend on a Sunday. Lauren, our server, was great! She gave us time to figure out what we wanted, without abandoning or harassing us. I wanted another beer, but the keg was tapped. She kept coming over to update me; the keg was getting changed, the keg was changed but all foam, it's almost ready... Finally, I got my perfect pour! Some places just leave you hanging. I really appreciated this service. 
The food was also great. The wingman's burger had a lot of flavor without being overwhelming to the taste of the burger itself. The brownie possession..well, let's just say it's rich, gooey, and delicious! I think it paired nicely with my Sam Adams Boston lager. The sweet and the bitter..ooh lala!"}
{"text":"This Fridays was clean and the service was OK.  When we asked to see the nutrition information they wouldn't provide and when we ordered the server seemed confused that I wanted the sauce on the side.  Overall it was nothing impressive."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked inside, my friend and I were greeted instantly with a smile and friendly conversation.. 

Our server was very friendly and polite. The appetizers were delivered quickly and tasted delicious. Check was pricey but you get what you pay for.. 

This is a restaurant you go to when you're trying to enjoy yourself and receive great food with friendly service. I would gladly come again."}
{"text":"Great service in the bar. Half price apps after 3:00pm. Happy hour drink specials also"}
{"text":"I don't know what was going on with them this Sunday afternoon but worst service I've ever had at TGI!! Food took extremely long and we didn't really know who the sever was. 25 dollar steak and lobster was a 2/10. Friday's inside of sams town was way better food and service wise."}
{"text":"I saw all the bad reviews after I had already been seated. I was expecting crap service and crap food. I got neither. Jeffrey was our waiter on a very busy Friday before Memorial Day. He was awesome. Brought water without even asking, and my biggest pet peeve, having an empty drink. Jeffrey brought a refill a little bit before my drink was even done. He was on point. 

The food, after seeing the reviews I got scared and just ordered a burger. I was completely surprised at how nice and juicy it was. It didn't even need condiments. The fries were a little bit over seasoned but still yummy. 

We even had dessert, something we never do. We got the fudge brownie with vanilla ice cream. Ah-mazing"}
{"text":"Food was cold, we didn't get half of it, I had to ask twice for them to bring my drink. The manager wasn't helpful AT ALL. They offered to recook my steak that was over cooked, and the replacement was also overcooked. This place should be called TGIMondays because Monday's suck."}
{"text":"The service here is always prompt and friendly. We were greeted at the door and sat in the bar area. Nice big booth with a hard seat cushion. A bit drafty because the fans were on high so we got a little cold. The appetizer came quick along with our beverages. I had a NY strip with Jack Daniels sauce. It was prepared as ordered except I wanted the sauce on the side. Good thing for the cook I liked it. My companion had the grilled salmon with lobster sauce. She liked it very much. Thank you Rebecca and TGIs, we enjoyed our dining experiences very much."}
{"text":"I had the jack Daniels chicken sandwich and it was so flavorful and juicy down right delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.lots of tvs,
has large bar area with tons of seating.
Great deserts.

{"text":"First time to this location and actually to a TGIF's in a while. Hung out in the bar section with friends before a night out. The service was pretty good and comical at the same time. Two waitresses waiting on our table, neither knowing that the other was working the same table! One would come and take our drink orders and then the other would come and do the same thing just minutes later! Communication obviously doesn't happen here. or they were just making sure we had what we needed since the party was so big. Yeah...that was it! 

Outside of that, very friendly staff and a generally clean establishment. I ordered the nachos and they were ok. Nothing to brag about by any means. Just ok. I'd probably visit this location again on a whim, but that's about it. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"The food and prices are okay.  
It's really the service at this location that isn't good.  
The afternoon we went, our waitress was trying to serve so many tables and we saw that she was mixing the drinks too!  We had to wait 15 minutes before she even got around to us.  

We were pretty hungry, so we ordered an appetizer and specifically asked that it come out ASAP.  Of course, she completely forgot about the appetizer.  The food took like 25 minutes and she didn't even bring us a crust of bread to fight over!

The folks that I was with said their steaks were tough, but to TGIF's credit my Sizzling Cheese Chicken entrée was nice.  The mash was good, the chicken was better.  Oh, and the Long Island Iced Tea was pretty potent too.  

So it is what it is, but it's sad to see one person work horsed that way.  We left her a good tip because we were sure it wasn't her fault that the place was woefully understaffed, but I can't leave them a good rating because the experience left much too much room for decent customer service.  

As it turns out pity is quite the kill joy.  
Who can have a good time while your belly is growling, but you won't complain because you know the lone waitress is doing the very best she can?"}
{"text":"Omg amazing!! Our flight was delayed which was seriously upsetting. However, James was very accomadating. We really appreciated his kindness and his fabulous mojitos!! Great experience!"}
{"text":"After a movie, I took my daughter to Fridays on April 9, 2017 at the Waterfront in Homestead. This is the first time at the location, usually i go to the one in Washington, PA.  After being seated, our waitress came up to out table and we ordered an appetizer, dinner and drinks.  Well we waited and waited, our appetizer never came, but our dinner did.  I ordered the ribs, and my daughter the marinated chicken sandwich.  After taking a bite, she didn't like the texture of the chicken, (tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way though) So we asked for another one. After waiting sometime, they brought out another and was told that this is how it tastes, a rubbery feeling.  So she changed her order to fish and chips.  The waitress brought out shrimp and fries.  At this point we both were disgusted with our service and asked for a manager. Again after waiting sometime we spoke to Megan, who was understanding and somewhat helpful.  They took off the chicken and appitizer, but honestly i shouldn't have paid for any of it, including my ribs, which were average.  She then proceeded to type me a letter starting that i can get $25 worth of food, at that location.  Again i called and told her that i don't ever go to that one, and have no desire to return. why couldn't you had just given me a gift card?  She then said she would call the washington location and give them my name, but why?  I wasn't heading there at the moment!  Very unprofessional, and i even called my oldest daughter who worked for Outback and she was livid, agreed i shouldn't have had to pay and got a gift card.  She also give the the DM name which i plan on reaching out.
I could have and should have went to burgatory.  Much better service.  Never had this problem in Washington, which i have gone to for 7 years."}
{"text":"I will definitely not be going back here.  Went in for dinner & a few drinks in the middle of the week.  Sat at the bar.  The restaurant & bar were not busy at all.  There were maybe 8 others sitting at the bar.   The blonde bartender waited on us - I can't remember her name.  She messed up my food order (ordering the completely wrong meal), then told me it wasn't her fault, and didn't apologize when she was told by the other bar tender the wrong meal came out.  She also never once smiled the entire night & didn't seem very friendly.  I pointed out to her on the menu the actual picture of what I wanted & that I pointed to the exact same picture when I ordered it from her & she saw me point at that picture.  Finally she decided to apologize for the error when she handed me the bill -- which I'm sure was just because it was time for me to tip. The only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that other bartender was very nice & handled the wrong meal situation right away.   She also smiled & I could see her having great interactions with the customers she waited on.  But I won't be going back -- for average food & a below average beer selection I have many other options that provide much better customer service."}
{"text":"Hard day bargain hunting across the street at Bed Bath & Beyond deserved (in my mind, at least) a good, albeit late, lunch. A warm, breezy, 71 degrees demanded sitting on patio. The daily drink special persuaded me to order a Long Island Ice Tea, and man, was it potent. The only reason (other than self control) that I've never been drunk, is I never drink on an empty stomach. This LIIT was kick-you-in-your-butt potent. Geez, you'd think the bartender was my BF. Thank God for the granola bar I always carry.

Dave, my server, was GREAT. Fun, postive, polite, fun, professional. Had nothing but nice things to say about my other favorite server, Kim. That's class!

I'm open to suggestions, so Dave suggested the Sizzlin' Shrimp & Chicken. It arrived piping hot, with two tidy mounds of creamy potatoes, topped with fresh, chopped scallions.

The six small shrimp, peeking from under the chicken, were still in their shells! This was not a welcome surprise, and I asked Dave about that. He said he too, was surprised, and they shouldn't have had shells. The manager stopped a minute later, and apologized. He used to instruct his chefs to remove the shells, but then corporate ordered the shells left on. He comped my LIIT, though I asked for nothing, and asked me to make sure on future visits to ask for him personally if I needed anything.

Botoom line, it was good food, potent drink, a beautiful day on their patio, and Dave was attentive, friendly, yet professional. A nice bonus, my entree was free, using my Friday's rewards. Dinner done right."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and this review is just for the bar.  It is a nice little bar  in Sam's Town.  It's crowd... well if you want to call it a crowd... seems to be 30's and above.  I guess that is what you get when you are in a casino really made for the locals.  So, I have no complaints as my friends and I are in its wheel house.  So here were my observations.

 - We walk in and were given a friendly greeting as we sat at the bar.  The bartender put down drink napkins and took our order.  I stuck with club soda while everyone else in our group planned on pounding beers that night.  So, the bartender said that it was great that I was the designated driver and comped my drinks. The drinks were a little pricier than they were at the casino bars in Sam's Town but that was expected.

- They have a pretty nice set up.  Plenty of seating and a pool table that didn't get used by us that night.  As a matter of fact, I didn't see anyone using the table.  

- We got there early so I don't know if things picked up after we left.  But, while we were there we were taken care of very well.  It was nice to just catch up with and watch my friends get their buzz going.

So, after a few drinks we left to walk around the casino.  One of my friends loves the show in the Atrium.  Personally, I think it's not that great but to each their own.  Maybe it's better if you are buzzy."}
{"text":"Rude and horrible service - plus food is just so so. Find another location."}
{"text":"You know what you get here the only thing that differs is the service which isn't that great at this location."}
{"text":"This has to have been the WORST service I have EVER had at any chain restaurant. My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday where we ordered endless appetizers. Each app took over 45 mins to come out. The waitress was inattentive and unconcerned with the quality of service we were receiving. When she went to refill drinks she reused the same cups and ended up giving the wrong cups back to each of us at the table. One of the boys was given cup with a straw that had my lip stick on it (just to show how oblivious she actual was). The manager was less than concerned with our complaints and offered nothing for our less than satisfactory experience. After waiting to be seated at a table for 45 mins that was already open, waiting over 2.5 hours for our meals and the things mentioned above I wouldn't recommend going to this TGI Friday's & if you do I hope your experience was better than mine."}
{"text":"Quality Burgers here. Love the Crispy Onion, Bacon Topping. Patty about half pound. Fabulous Char flavor on the QUALITY meat. Bun tender and fresh made daily.

Saw the steaks lobster tail. Ribs(Hint). TGIF Place was packed. At late night in the Orleans Casino. Its just Wednesday. Actually its past midnight. So its Thursday.

This Oleans casino is a Definite Fav of LV Locals and our family. I mean. Has 70 lane bowling. 18 movie Theaters. An Arena showing special events. Our Super Deluxe 2 Queen, with Living area with Sofa, Couch, Coffee Table, even separate area with desk and chair cost us about  $45 weekdays.

Ok. Now can focus on the Oyster Bar eatery, heard their Clam Chowder is the Boooooomb"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Ashley was awesome & our food came out quickly. Love happy hour all day in the bar. We watched the game & the sound was just right."}
{"text":"Service was really bad, would give them zero stars if I had the chance. Our meal took a while to get out. Waitress kept going back and forth, and forgot about us."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a bar to go to and just want to have appetizers, beer, and spirits then TGIF's is the place to be! If you are looking for this place to be \"family-friendly\", than do not sit in the bar area or do not bring children there after 9pm.

I frequent this particular TGIF's a lot, but I only sit in the bar area because I usually plan to only have drinks and appetizers and to enjoy the excitement of the bartenders and the numerous new people I meet there while in the bar.  

I went with a friend on this particular visit to have a girls' night out, have some drinks and have fun! And boy did we definitely have some fun! We ordered the pretzels with the craft beer cheese dipping sauce and chips and salsa as our appetizers. The pretzel appetizer is my favorite and I always get it when I go to TGIF's, the craft beer cheese dipping sauce is very good and is mixed with green onions and bacon pieces. So to wash down the pretzels and chips and salsa we had to order tasty and refreshing drinks. TGIF's has a full service bar and the bar is fully stocked with the best alcohol and they have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, from the traditional drinks to their signature ones. My friend had an Appletini and I had their signature drink, the Captain Morgan Island Rum Punch. The bartenders there on this night stuck their feet in these drinks, because they were AMAZING! The drinks were not watered down, I could taste the alcohol, and we got our money's worth.

After sitting at the bar for awhile, we started to get hungry again, so we ordered an entree and both got the salmon with maison butter, mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley (zucchini, squash and red peppers). It did not take long for our food to come out, our food was hot and very tasty. We ate all of it!

I recommend their bar service to everyone, but do be prepared for it to be crowded, loud and busy, so sit back, grab a drink and have a good time!"}
{"text":"Nice place. A bit slow on the service. Our server was very friendly. We ordered BBQ boneless wings they were about 12.25 those were average amount of time to come which is good that I ordered because the rest of the food was gonna be pretty slow to come. And took a while for her to even take our drinks. 
 
Ordered the Wingmans burger. Which was not for myself but I was told the meat was kind of burnt on the outside. Excessively burnt. Still she enjoyed the wings but said the cream was waaay too salty. 

I ordered the BBQ bacon burger. Which was also a bit burnt but I don't think it was as much as the wingman. I enjoyed it not as good though. I remembered too late I wanted cheddar cheese. Lol okay. 

The manager however was there helping out the servers and some of them were very attentive. But next time ill send the burnt something back."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Possibly the slowest service I've ever received. Placed order for our entire meal immediately. Forty five minutes later, no refills. No food. When it finally arrived, order was wrong. It wasn't even busy so there's no excuse. 
In general, TGI Friday's is always a good experience. This location just seems to suck."}
{"text":"This location was fabulous.  Toooo bad thats all it had....The worst food an upright should endure.  Appetizer platter served 55 minutes after ordered.  Celery was older that all at table combined. Fyi very sparce clientele.  The 2 burgers as my husband comented were hockey pucks.  Sitting across from him while trying to eat was disguiting.  Grease and some cheese grunge oozing out..just say no.  Worst food..."}
{"text":"The prime rib loft should take a lesson frim these guys! Busy Monday night these guys rocked! Got me seated n the bar server was very busy food was hot beer cold not rushed and felt like I was at hone. It kinda stunks eatung alone but my server took great care of me! comort food and a couple of beers!!"}

Recently, I called in an order and was put on hold as usual.  Because I was moving to a new home, I did not hang up.  Instead I kept packing.  Two and a half hours later I hung up when my phone battery was low.  No body ever answered the phone!!!  Don't waste your time calling for carry out.  YELP needs a rating lower than one star."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant..i know its a chain restaurant..but is one of the nicest and cleanest TGI i know around here. The staff are really friendly and always nice. The manager is always attentive and friendly as well. And the food is spectacular!! I always come here in the weekends with my friends to grab ahi tuna..or their spinach artichoke dip! For entrees I love the cajun shrimp pasta and well as their steak and fries!! I have no complaints for this place!! I love it!"}
{"text":"Last visit to vegas went to the one at the aliante, which I would say is better overall esp in service and atmosphere. Got the $10 unlmtd app- potato skin & buffalo wings. Potato skins couldve had more on them, and when I bit into a rotten skinned one and asked to get something else since they're all $10 I was told no but could get a new order. Dissapointing. Waitress was pretty good but the atmosphere of an older group staring@ me & my husband was akward. Is it cuz we r interracial? Got more food than u? Idk... but made me u comfortable. Went at 1am btw. And all potato skin orders had @ least 1 rotten skinned spot on a potato. Not too good wont suggest that to anyone. Beach bum drink (alcoholic) sucked. Mostly pineapple juice & no garnishes. 

Wings were good and so were the ultimate grand margaritas. Prob wont come again though"}
{"text":"The food was alright like any other tgif but our server ignored us, i think she saw us maybe 3 times never re-filled my coffee, This was far the worst Friday's I have ever been too, I will not be going to TGI fridays again. Service was bad, food was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I was surprised when I saw this tgif had a bad rating. The see staff is always vey kind here.  At times we do wait a couple long minutes for our food, but it's only when they are short staffed. The manager is great. She is always asking everybody how the food was. And many times i see her passing out plates herself. Great job!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night (late night) and tried their burger and garlic steak fries. It hit the right spot. Service was good and prompt. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"TGI Friday's is another chain restaurant you can find across the country. They have a full service bar with diner's tables and chairs surrounding it on different levels. They have interesting decor ranging from celebrity photos to various signs.

They offer weekly lunch specials where you can save some money. Normally I visit here with family or friends just to have a casual meal. On this particular visit I was with my son and learned that they have a promo going on where if you buy a hamburger you can \"text\" a free one to a friend. He did this and enjoyed his burger with fries.

I had their strawberry salad since I know that season is short and I love strawberries. They offer a good French onion soup as well.

Meals can range from sandwiches, salads, and soups to full course entrees. Everyone there is pleasant and very attentive to your needs. They do have Wi Fi and will give you the pass code if you wish to use it.

I've never been disappointed here so I will come back as the occasion warrants it."}
{"text":"Had lunch with girlfriend. They have lunchtime specials where you can pair a meal for a reasonable price. I had a coupon that entitled us to either 20% off meal or get one entree free with purchase of two drinks and an entree.

We had French onion soup along with a turkey sandwich. Food was okay. Our waiter was kind and helpful but failed to tell us that the coupon doesn't work on meal specials. He did however, give us the discount to make up for the error.

Food is okay and average. Great spot to go to for informal gathering of friends. Will come again next month and will abide by coupon rules."}
{"text":"Aloha to the summer, and welcome to the fabulous Luau Party with some new Tiki cocktails! I gave the strawberry one a try for $6 plus an additional $5 to keep the new Tiki themed cup (wrapped up nicely)! So I thought today was the first day the the Tiki cups were on sale, but apparently a lot was selling out today, and the waiter had to double check to make sure they had some available to be sold. 

Anyhow, aside from the super awesome mug, the appetizer dish with wings, potato skin wedges, celery, mozzarella sticks and a side of pot stickers was fairly delicious. We also got a full stack of ribs to go along side fries and an upgraded mac n'cheese. All combined together as a very fulfilling yet also pricey meal.

My boyfriend got a Poppin' Boba drink (a twist on the classic bubble tea that you can find at most boba shops) and said it was way too sweet, so at $3.99 a piece, I'd say to pass on this one. 

Also, it is wayyyyy too cold at this store, I know it's summertime and it was fairly warm out, but I would appreciate if the AC could be turned down a little. It makes it hard to drink cold drinks and feel like it's freezing. 

Otherwise, decent meal and I was quite satisfied. I don't usually come to TGIF on a Friday cause I assume it to be busy. I know last time, we had to wait quite some time to get seated, but there was plenty of empty seats today. Shout out to the nice hostess that opens and holds door for people coming in and out! TGIF!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin.... We were just 2 in our party. First off service was super slow and everyone around us was served first, including larger parties. Our waitress was in attentive and seemed annoyed with any requests. We ordered 2 expensive dishes with lobster which was Not impressive, but the small steak was pretty good. I ordered a side house salad which was a waste of time and no where near worth the price. I sent it back and had to ask multiple times for it to be removed from the bill. The worst part of this trip and restaurant was with the bill. We asked if there was a military discount and they do offer one but only to the military id holder. EVERYWHERE else literally gives the discount to the entire bill, but nonetheless we were given a small discount to the cheapest entree but nothing else. The manager came over to the table and not only clarified the \"rule\" but made a point to mention that generally they don't give the discount to spouses. I am completely appauld by this behavior and disrespect to the military. Not only will I be sharing this story on multiple review sites I will be contacting corporate. I urge you not to give this place your business. It's not about the money it's a principle and respect. Oh I almost forgot, the manger and waitress acted like the discount came out of their personal check... Kudos to you for your company obsession."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night around 8pm for the endless appetizers deal. It's a big restaurant so we were able to be seated right away which is always a plus with me even though there were a good amount of customers in there. Our waitress, Candace, was awesome! She was pretty on top of filling our drinks and getting our food coming at a flow. The endless app deal was well worth it as you can put in your next order when you get your first order! DON'T GET THE POTATO SKINS THOUGH! They tasted like they were frozen from before and reheated. I liked the boneless wings the best."}
{"text":"Giving it 4 stars because we didn't eat, so trying to be fair. The drinks were great though! Had a pomegranate top shelf margarita and loved it. Great size for $6! Erica was very nice and we will be back."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a TGI Friday's. Total of 3 tables occupied during lunch hour and still waited an hour for our food. The food wasn't worth the wait either. Only thing good about my experience was the Jack Daniel's sauce!"}
{"text":"Its all my fault.  I knew I was was going to eat corporate vomit food.  But like when you're in an airport or at a conference, sometimes it can't be avoided.  I could walk here from my hotel, and I didn't want to drive down to the real town.  So I blame myself.  I should have known better.  But you know what makes bland greasy tasteless food even worse?  When the staff is a bunch of attitudey brats who act like they are above their shitty corporate service jobs.  Guess what, idiots- there's a reason you're behind the bar working for tips.  You don't get to act like you're more important than the customer.  This place SUCKS."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star, I would. 

It's a Sunday evening on Mother's Day. It's just my boyfriend, my son and myself. We waited 15 minutes on our table and when we sat down I noticed that not all of their tables were full. Weird. 

We ordered spinach dip and it came out dry and looked as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. 

Then we waiting 45 minutes on our entrees. Ridiculous! 

Although we waited forever for our food and it wasn't to die for the manager was nice enough to comp our drinks and my meal. 

But we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to this location on a Friday night because it was close and unlike all of the other restaurants in the area, the parking lot wasn't full and there was no wait. The hostess (there were three of them),asked if a table was ok and I told her we preferred a booth. She gave me a look of disgust as she set off to find if one was available. There were MANY. She seated us and that was the last we saw of an employee. Well, many passed by our booth, but all chose to ignore us. We talked for a bit before I realized that no one had stopped by our table to even offer drinks. I asked my partner how long had we been there and he said 10 minutes and he was wondering if I had noticed. At that time we decided to leave. We took the menus back to the three hostesses that were still there talking. I told them that it was a shame that no one had stopped by our table in 10 minutes. They just looked at us and I heard them giggle as we walked out of the door. This wasn't my first negative experience here, but it was definitely my last."}
{"text":"Bad service, prices are not worth what you get, and just the experience is poor. Really, sitting at a table with a bad chair and table, with dust sitting above you on the lights."}
{"text":"My experience at this Friday's was not what I was expecting. I am always looking for new Friday's locations to eat at. This one, made me want to toss the warm beer the bartender gave me, right in their face.

Anytime I go to a Friday's I order one tall glass of the best beer in America, Bud Light. This beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold. Well, like I said above, the bartender gave me a warm glass of beer and it was not my Bud Light, it was a dumb craft beer.

What is a craft beer? Why was my beer warm? Better than that, why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer? I did not find this funny at all!"}
{"text":"-Waited for a table for 15 minutes, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. 
-Waited 15 minutes for our server to greet us & take our drink order, again there was 6 tables occupied. 
-Server was the SLOWEST I've ever had! 
-Waited about 30 minutes to order our food!
-Had to wait another 15 minutes for our SERVER to bring eating utensils then said I'm sorry I made you eat with your hands!!! (Good thing we ordered appetizers!)
-Tried to speak with a manager was told they were really busy.
-Last but not LEAST emailed Guest Relations, was promised a phone call back, never received ANY contact back from ANY TGIF member(s). 
-WILL NEVER GO TO A TGIF!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would.  After arriving at said Fridays, we were immediately seated and waited for our server to arrive and take our drink order.  After 25mins go by, not one server was in sight. Nobody came to check on us, let us know that someone would be with us shortly, none of that. Next thing you know, I watched another table get seated.  They waited for MAYBE 5 mins when suddenly, POOF, their server came to take their order. That was my cue to get up and leave."}
{"text":"They answer the phones here with \"Best Friday's on Earth\" and they mean it! Larry was our server tonight, and he took such great care of us. Be sure to ask for him, he was timely in checking in on us, and patient with our indecisiveness.

Food is your standard Friday's fare, which is always quality in our experience. They apparently have different specials at casino locations than at standalone Friday's."}
{"text":"Best chain restaurant around! This is the only place in Charlotte that I can rely on for consistent, good service for a reasonable price.

Drink specials are decent. They always have some odd, creative drinks. We got a Punk Pink Cosmo that was some cotton candy style drink, LIT, a berry mojito, and a Fiery Apple... OMG- it was the weirdest concoction ever but so good. 

This is the best Friday's in town simply because ofood.They never fail me and the boyfriend on date night. We got the loaded potato skins as an app...they were so-so and definitely overpriced at $8. I got a sirloin and sautéed shrimp and he got sirloin and ribs. The steaks were cooked to perfection! We both got mac and cheese as a side and it was surprisingly delicious! 

Service was a great like always!"}
{"text":"Went here this last Saturday and I have no complaints. It's ALOT better than most chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's. Hostess was sweet and our server was attentive and funny. They had a good special on beer which the boyfriend loved. They also had plenty of deals like an entree with an app for 15 and many others that were similar. We ordered the potstickers for the app which were pretty good. Boyfriend got the appetizer sampler for his meal. A plate of meat so and he had complaints. And I got the sirloin medium and it was cooked to perfection. It wasn't packed when we got there around 3pm so I will definitely be coming here instead of attempting to maneuver the CCMills food court."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this location! I am not a fan of national chain restaurants because the food is usually very bland and it is all pre-packaged and not home made. A group of 20ish showed up on a friday night to celebrate my cousin's retirement from the Navy. They got us set up in no time at all! They coordinated it so that our food pretty much all came out at the same time and made sure everyone got exactly what they wanted and ordered. I was very impressed with the servers! We were there Friday February 20th so whoever served us I hope their management reads this and gives them big time kudos! 2 thumbs up from 2 fluffy foodies!"}
{"text":"Sloooow service--cold food--very unhelpful manager and waitress.
      Our meal took almost 45 minutes to arrive and then it was only barely warm! The manager had said he would try to speed things up but obviously failed.
      One member of our party had a walker, which the staff had trouble dealing with. The uneven brick floor made all of our chairs wobble, creating a rocking boat/seasick effect.
      The cold temperature of the food made it very unappealing. If you like hot meals, tasty food and prompt service, you will have to go elsewhere. We couldn't wait to get out."}
{"text":"My best friend and I drove down to Charlotte to see a musical. Afterwards, we were super hungry and didn't want to make the 2hr trek back home on an empty stomach. I pulled out my handy dandy Yelp app to see what was open at this hour and had a full bar. Our choices were slim because it was already 11pm. However, you can't go wrong with a chain restaurant. The great thing about this particular location is that it's open until 2am. Sweet!

When we arrived, we waited for about 2 minutes before we wondered if we had to seat ourselves. 5 minutes went by and we were finally greeted. The hostess apologized and seated us immediately. Our waitress came by and took our drink orders. While I was breezing through the drink menu, I mentioned margarita, she informed us that frozen and iced margaritas were $3 on Thursdays. Win!!!! I ordered the hot wings and my girl got Jack Daniels steak and we split her double side order of fries. I was super hungry because I don't think I stopped to actually taste the food. The fries were delicious though, I remember that much. The margaritas hit the spot and soothed my craving for citrus and tequila. Our waitress was amazing and patient. She kept the drinks going and chatted with us casually. The place was pretty clean, the staff seemed attentive. The only issue I had here was the bathrooms were a mess. I did let my waitress know about that, though."}
{"text":"The vibe is right but the food could be better. Cold baked potatoes come on now it goes in the oven not the fridge lol. The overall service and cute girls that work there make it worth the return."}
{"text":"There happy hour specials are great, as well as the red zone specials. Everything is priced really good for Vegas! Big props to our server Jeff! He was prompt, fast, friendly, and on top of everything, even while very busy! We came back 2 more times and very happy! Definitely will be back when we come to Vegas next time! Thanks Jeff! We appreciate you putting us in the friend section."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect.  Pretty good food and decent customer service.  Came in on a Saturday night and got right in.  Pretty slow for a Saturday.  Food was pretty good service was decent.  Will come back with the kids."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, we were standing at an empty host table for 15 minutes until I decided to call the restaurant off my phone. 

I ordered a sandwich with the broccoli cheddar soup and my friend ordered the salad and broccoli cheddar soup. 

The broccoli cheddar soup was absolutely NASTY. It tasted like spoiled milk and I couldn't finish it. I'm not over exaggerating either. I had a spoonful of it and tasted a sour taste that doesn't usually come from a broccoli cheddar soup. 

My sandwich was average along with my friend's salad, but that's as assumed so we weren't upset about that. 

Aside from the poor quality of the soup, our waitress was especially accommodating. She was amazing and gave the two stars to my review. She understood our complaints and instead of making a big deal or giving a snide remark, she was super understanding and apathetic about it so we gave her a well above average tip. Hoping to see her again or see her in a different restaurant!"}
{"text":"Friday's is my go-to place. I usually go to a specific one (Sahara) where my friend works at, and get a deal. But I was in the area and decided to try this location. Bathrooms were clean, tables were clean, plates and silverware were also clean. We sat in a booth close to the bar, directly in front of a television. A college basketball game was on which was cool. The service was great, prices were great, no complaints. Just like any other Fridays. Most likely will return in the near future since this is the closest one to me now that I moved to Henderson."}
{"text":"I'm always at Fridays... It's cheap and simple. No matter what state I'm in I am a regular. This one is inside SAM'S TOWN CASINO. Other than the cigarette smoke lingering around it was ok. Service was great. We sat at a booth far away from the casino floor, which was great. Ordered a strawberry lemonade as I always do along with a dish I've never tried before: Fettuccine Alfredo pasta with shrimp. A large Caesar salad and new england clam chowder. The chowder was sort of thin and could have been better, but it is what it is for $4 bucks. The salad was good along with the main course. The shrimp was nice and tender. The pasta was soft and the alfred sauce tasted great, especially with some pepper. Will always return to TGI Fridays just never know what location! :-)"}
{"text":"Slow......service spinach dip was divided chesse on one side and whole spinach on other with bread crumbs. Steak/lobster were bland steak tough, broccoli over cooked. Chicken quesadilla over cooked with some orange meat, plate was hotter then food WTH, left hungry just like we entered :("}
{"text":"Worst Fridays ive been too and ive been to them here , in Cali, and in Arizona..... The waitresses dont know the menu and when u ask a question the say ummmm im not sure. Not im not sure but let me ask but just im not sure PERIOD. Their happy hour was more expensive than a regular fridays and their steak literally disgusted me to the point that putting it my mouth was like a chore and my husband didnt finish his food at all. Service was poor drinks we watered down and my frozen margarita had ice chunks still in it.... Wont be back"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've had in awhile. Came here with a friend to eat and watch the NCAA tournament. No hostess at the door, walked ourselves to the bar. We were quoted the wrong time for last call and the kitchen closing after sitting down by a bartender. The other bartender came over and corrected what the first one said. After that my drink order was taken his was not (during the entire meal). My drink came out wrong and had to be made again. Our food order was put in as 2 appetizers for him and one app for me along with fried shrimp and fries. My app came out in good time but his never did. Then after 40min of waiting and watching ppl who came on way after us get there food we asked for a manager. He went to check on it and after 5min 2 of the 3 dishes came out. His second dish never came. Thankfully they took that off like they did us a favor and gave us a 15% coupon for next time. 

Never coming back! I would suggest avoiding the place"}
{"text":"Do NOT listen to the previous reviewers claiming you get good service here. It's a joke. It HAS to be. I've been to another tgi Fridays at the Orleans and the service there is a lot better than this place. That's not saying a whole lot though because that location was almost as bad.

They screwed up my order not once,  but THREE times in LESS than an hour that I had been there.

I ordered mash potatoes as one of my sides but they brought me cole slaw, a completely different drink, and my lobster was warm, and very...wet..It was the weirdest lobster I have EVER encountered, and I've been eating lobster steadily since I was 3!!

Do not come here. Heed my warning!"}
{"text":"These joints like TGIF and Applebees are a disgrace to food. All they do is take frozen things out of the freezer and throw into fryer or onto a grill. You don't even to have to be a real chef to work in this place. Just a reheater. Had their appetizer samplers last night. Disgusting. Chicken wings were so old and had been frozen so long. The bones inside were black. Nothing fresh on the plate. Service mediocre. My pet peeve is  taking 20 minutes to pay the bill after dinner. Waitress busy gabbing back in waitress station."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger and some bowling at the Gold Coast, and must admit for the first time in a long time, I actually enjoyed my experience at this chain. My hamburger with mushrooms and swiss was cooked a perfect medium, and my son's chicken dish got the big thumbs up. Nothing spectacular but a good lunch out of the sweltering heat of Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrible. Had to bus our own table after 45 minutes of empty plates sitting in front of us. Would like more drinks but the waiter is overloaded. Especially like that they ran out of wine glasses. Had wine in a water glass, a brandy glass, and another weird shaped glass with lipstick still in it. Come on management get your shit together."}
{"text":"Yeesh. The server was friendly and the place was open at 10pm. But it looks tired and dirty. From overuse not neglect. You have families with babies who drop fries all over the floor, spilled drinks, you name it. As for the food...must you ask? It's all the same, Chili's, TGIF, Applebee's, they get all their stuff from the same supplier. If you're a tourist, it's edible."}
{"text":"Delayed flight + time to kill = unhealthy eating!  I stopped here for a piece of Oreo pie and it was good.  The bartender was super friendly and I noticed she was very nice and informative to other customers as well.  She offered people \"to go\" cups if they'd been having coffee and she was as friendly as could be to me. 

The food here comes from the bigger TGIFriday's location in the airport so it might take a little longer but it's a nice little place to stop."}
{"text":"We just wanted something quick we could take back to room to enjoy before we checked out. Since we weren't particularly hungry we decided to split a bacon cheeseburger with fries. They weren't very busy so it didn't take too long for our order to be ready. 

Going back to the room with it we sorted out that is get all the tomatoes and she's get the pickles, thus making sure we each got the maximum amount of our favourites. We were sadly disappointed to open the burger and find out that the only toppings were the cheese and bacon, despite the menu description that included lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles. We didn't have to go back down and complain but we were definitely unimpressed."}
{"text":"This would've been a five had a little cockroach not ran across the table after we paid the bill.  Service was great!

- Ultimate Sangria
Yeah, super good!

 - Warm Pretzels with Craft Beer-Cheese Dipping Sauce
One of our new favorite appetizers!  The pretzels were obviously deep-fried.  But that's ok, they were super hot, crispy on the outside, and pillowy inside.  

- Jack Daniel's Burger w/ Fries
- Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich w/ Chips
It was a burger kind of Friday night, so that's what we both had. No complaints"}
{"text":"Well I was back here. For the food on the grill. The waiter was nice not offended I was in a rush for the game. Got in and out just in time for the t. Really like the chicken skewers you get good portion of broccoli and brown rice. The sauce was like a soy barbecue sauce type thing really good. Chicken had a great bite to it. Nicely charred and fully cooked, it wasn't burned.  All the vegetables had a wonderful crunch to it. I will definitely get that again. And will be back before a pirates game to got a few more of them coming up"}
{"text":"There's a very good reason why this place is empty...

We were served frozen mozzarella sticks, then sent it back and were served burnt potato skins with solid strips of cheddar cheese. 

The steak was smaller than the baked potato that came with it. It should at least reflect the pricing.. on the bright side my bf thought it was cooked well and he enjoyed the bite size steak. 

The chicken and shrimp skillet was literally cooking in front of my face. Who wants fried oil jumping and popping up onto your skin...They might as well have served it with a chef coat and spatula! 

By the time I let it cool everything that touched the skillet was BURNT TO A CRISP! Not to mention the mashed potatoes they served...definitely boxed, old and reheated in the microwave! 

During our entire meal the bartenders were throwing mixing tins in the air and dropping them everywhere. Umm people are trying to eat here..????

Ugh. $52 wasted dollars for two people, crappy environment and teeny tiny portioned microwaved tv dinner meals. 

*side note* Is there a reason the lemonade is $5 here?? There must be a lemon tree growing in the kitchen! Fountain drinks should never be priced that high! 

Please run, don't come here. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday night and the place was empty. The host greeted us by saying \"two\", grabbed the menus and started walking toward the table and threw the menus on the table and kept walking away from us. 
We were aggravated but decided to stay given the time. Waitress was friendly. Food was poor. 
We are accustomed to TGI Fridays on the east coast and this place is a very poor reflection of the franchise. 
I agree with the other reviews. Poor service and food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am grading the food. To me, the basics have to be right before I can judge the whole meal. I like soup and salad along with my meal and I REALLY wanted salad with blue cheese dressing. Turns out they are serving a \"new White Cheddar Broccoli soup\" which is one of my favorites. Soup should not plop, should not be goopy and shouldn't look like someone just opened campbells cream of mushroom and dumped it cold into your bowl. Yes, it was hot, but still that is how it looked and it tasted like overly salted canned soup. I guess you can't mess up lettuce but the \"blue cheese dressing\", pretty sure that was straight mayo. For these two items, which tonight were all I ordered, they were TERRIBLE! I paid my tab and left after two bites (one of each).  I have had other meals here that were okay, not superb or even great but mediocre. I just think that the basics should be considered."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on 1/31/11 with my sister. \"Really? We're eating at a Friday's inside THE ORLEANS?! of all places? Ummm WTH Sarah?\" Of all the places to eat, this is where she picked. Le sigh. 

Because it was \"happy hour\" I got the French Onion soup ($3) and we split the \"inferno\" chicken wings ($6). Sarah got some sort of salad ($?). 

The food came out relatively quick. The soup was kinda bland and the chicken wings, although red as blood, weren't that spicy. I like my spicy food to at least make me feel like I need to dab my nose with a napkin. I love spicy food and I would say these are more of a \"mild\" wing. 

Our waitress took FOREVER to come over and pick up our cash and give us $10 in change. We literally waited for 10 minutes for her. Ridiculous. Will I be back? No. Was it horrible? No. It's a Friday's. What do you expect?"}
{"text":"The food is always phenomenal. The skillet chicken and cheese is mouthwatering. Sweet tea is pretty great, too. I had bad service today, though. The bartender was our waiter.. my husband had to ask for dressing after his salad came out and he waited on it for about ten or so minutes. The guy didn't refill our drinks. He didn't have very good service. 
Every other time I've came I've had great service though. I love coming here. Hopefully I'll get better service in the future."}
{"text":"TGI fridays is our go to any time happy hour in the bar.  We have never I do not think ate in the dinning room as we always head for the bar for a 24/7 happy hour.  Bar food is decent and they have added a few new items lately.
Our fav's are the potato skins, and boneless wings.  Whats not to like.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here before a Wranglers game on a Friday night. I was cautiously optimistic about eating here because I know these kinds of places can be hit or miss, but we had a nice time. 

There was a pretty long line outside waiting for tables (both dining room and bar) but it went by fast. We sat in the bar area to have the Happy Hour specials. $6 apps, $5 sangrias, $3 bottled beer. 

The Food: We got the pretzel sticks, pretty yummy, I think they were fried, which is different than I am used to, but I still liked them. Potato skins were yummy, good sized and there were a ton of them. Loaded skillet chip nachos were delicious, loved the cheese. 

The Drinks: Raspberry Sangria, pretty sweet, definitely needed food to help balance it out, but I enjoyed it. 

The Service: Everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very nice. Waitress was very attentive and checked up on us several times.

Overall a good dinner experience and a place I would certainly choose over a Chilis or Applebees."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful from the food to the waitstaff! 

Everyone's food was fresh and delicious. I'd certainly eat here again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick drink before we boarded our plane...quick did not happen. Service was too slow for an airport restaurant bar. It took even longer because she added an extra item to our bill. Really not impressed. Is it a bad sign that our waitress went across the hall to the Subway to get lunch?"}
{"text":"Dinner at Friday's was a disaster! We went there to celebrate my nieces birthday! The waitress was incapable of understanding how to multi-task when taking orders. This is been by far the worst service I have ever recieved! My 6 yr old niece was the first to order chicken strips and a salad she got her food last!!! The manager came over oblivious to what was going on, after I have her a run down of every order, which was cold, too spicy, or late. I asked what she was going do for the poor service. Please understand we came here on purpose to have an enjoyable birthday celebration, unfortunately we did not have this experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this as a TGI Friday's. The service was slow, wait staff leaving personal belongings in seats, dirty glassware, understaffed to name a few. I got the sizzling chicken, took a long time to get it and it was tough. Ordered a tall beer, no talk glasses ended up with two small beers for the same price, not a bad deal if the short glasses would've been clean. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Apparently you cannot give zero stars or that would be my grade of this place. Coke was flat, food was cold, order was wrong, waitress wanted to argue about everything and was totally rude, so i made sure to return the favor, will not be back, EVER !"}
{"text":"I am normally not a big fan of franchise restuarants like these, but since I was a Friday's reward point member, I had a coupon for 20% off, so we came here. When we walked in, the hostess asked if we were reward points members, and when i said yes, she gave us a VIP card on our table right away for free chips and salsa. Then I realized I forgot to print out the coupon, but I showed it to my waitress on my phone and she accepted it. So far, I was impressed. The service was excellent and the food was tolerable. Nothing bad I can say, will come back the next time i get another coupon in my email :)"}
{"text":"The food wasn't terrible but the fact that they had the one girl working and running around by herself to serve everyone was just sad. If you're in a casino, perhaps you shouldn't gamble with your chances of ever having return customers!"}
{"text":"For my first visit my order was the special of Jack Daniels rack of beef ribs. It was amazingly delicious and enough for a meal at home,too. Of course I went back again as soon as possible. This time there was a problem with my order. The service person and the chef were so gracious and quickly remededied the issue. I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"When I heard about the return of endless apps, I was hooked. When I heard they implemented endless options, I immediately grabbed my wallet and ran for the nearest TGI Fridays. 

Unfortunately, a bachelor's degree did not prepare me well enough to figure out that a Friday night at Friday's would be a crazy, chaotic mess. We were seated immediately, but our waitress was so occupied with 10 other tables that service suffered; however, she was very friendly and checked in on us as much as she could. 

In our first round, I tackled the BBQ Chicken Flatbread (minus the chicken) and the \"Crispy\" Green Bean Fries. The flatbread was satisfying only because I was chewing at my own foot by the time the food came, but it definitely tasted like a nuked frozen pizza. Nothing was worse than the soggy, oil-soaked green bean fries. I will finish any disgusting food before I see it go to waste, but even I had to draw the line. Throwing in the white flag on this one. My second (and final) round were the Loaded Potato Skins (minus the bacon). Super crispy outside layer, but the inside tasted like a raw uncooked potato. My boyfriend breezed through four plates of boneless wings and pot stickers. The only wing flavor he enjoyed was the sriracha buffalo, while the others ranged from okay to downright disgusting. The skin to the pot stickers were so dry and chewy you could barely bite into it. 

To summarize - do NOT go for the endless apps. Yeah, I saved a couple bucks, but aside from feeling like a human grease ball afterwards, nothing tasted remotely good and I wasted hours of my evening sitting in a loud, filthy restaurant. Don't make the same mistake I made."}
{"text":"I ordred skrimp & ribs both cooked to perfection will have to come back again, server funny !"}
{"text":"My visit was wonderful.  As is typically the case, we were pretty hungry.  We arrived ahead of the dinner crowd so there was no wait.  We weren't happy that there was no $10 all you can eat appetizer special but we quickly moved on.  I don't recall the name of our waitress, but she had only been with the restaurant a week.  However, she was clearly not new to waitressing as she was swift and efficient, friendly and courteous.  The food arrived in good timing and we were pleased with our drinks and meals.  Our waitress even read back our order to ensure she had it correct, and she did.  Great service and food."}
{"text":"TGI Fridays always delivers a good menu. The serving staff here did a great job and was friendly."}
{"text":"Our server was great! She was so nice and calm. The cooks weren't all that good. We waited more than 20 minutes to receive our appetizers. One of my friends mozzarella sticks didn't have any cheese inside of it. It was not busy when we were there so I do not understand why we got that experience."}
{"text":"It shouldn't take an hour (plus!) to get a meal, especially when all tables around you are empty. Can't even comment on the food quality because it still hasn't shown up. Will not be returning. There are way too many options in the north hills to put up with poor service."}
{"text":"Went to T.G.I .Friday this evening for dinner.Started out by ordering soda's.had lemonade didn't taste too good so asked waitress Eve if could switch to Coke?I guess she wasn't too happy with having to go back to get another soda because she made a  grunting noise when she took my glass of lemonade.Ready to order our food and asked Eve about Steak and Lobster special,she said the order has to be in by 6:00pm and it was 5:45pm so she started to rush us into ordering our dinner.We got our dinner and my steak was cold,so I told Eva that my steak was cold and if I she could take this one back and get another steak for me,she them let out another loud sigh like it was a bother to her.I then told her that she didn't need to give out those sighs and I needed to speak to manager.I told her manager about her conduct and will never be going back there again.WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Friday's is the worst  But their food is  mediocre.  I left  unsatisfied. For the amount of money we spent we could have gone to a steak house.  The service is horrible.  Our server checked on us twice. Once right when the food came and then when we were about finished.  The cajun chix and shrimp pasta was good, but a bit too spicy for me.  And they charge extra if you want bread sticks with your pasta  App sizes are small for the price they charge.  

The hostess is also rude.  She actually questioned us on our way out if we paid our bill.  Trust me It would be pretty hard to run out on the bill with young children in tow.  Put in a complaint but highly doubt anything will come of it.

Overall, I hate to say...it's chain.  Because I've been to other locations that was good.  This one, even without the service problems ranks very low for us."}
{"text":"My neighbor and I decided to come here tonight. Happy Hour at the bar! Woohoo! Dave the bartender was extremely friendly, helpful, and had the most amazing energy.  He truly made things easy and enjoyable for us. We got our food really fast and it was all delicious.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of my Salmon. It was so Delish! Perfectly cooked with a flavorful crunch on the outside. The side of sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes we also perfect! They are also considerate to your time as most customers are needing to get to their gates. Five stars!"}
{"text":"We had ribs and shrimp service was excellent food good and atmosphere was fun lots of people having fun."}
{"text":"We were turned away from the restaurant because \"their computers were down\"."}
{"text":"We were eager to try their rib special, because they had been advertising that their ribs were now the meatiest ever. My ribs were the driest, skimpiest ribs I had ever eaten. There was almost no meat whatsoever on them - how did the cook or server (Matthew) not notice this? My iced tea was empty for twenty minutes and was never refilled. My coleslaw was warm. This was a very terrible birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I've only been a few times but I can't say the service is that good. This recent visit we even felt slightly ignored.

No complaints with their overall food, once you know what you like there.

Personal favorite is their Jack Daniels ribs. We always get the full size so we can have it as leftovers as well.

At the end of their menu, they also have a value menu, for those of you (like me) who don't eat very much in one sitting and want to save on amount of food + pricing.

There's only so many choices in Orleans in terms of where to eat and I will always come back but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"This place has Terrible, I repeat, Terrible service! The hostess that sat us was in a bad mood and threw our menus on the table and simply said, \"Here you go\". I said, \"Thank you\" and got no response from her. Then it took the waitress in the bar area 15+ minutes to even acknowledge that we were their and take our drink orders. To be safe we just ordered our food as well so we wouldn't have to wait another 20 minutes for her to ask about that. My bf ordered a soda, a root beer, which is supposed to be free refills, but they ended up charging us for each one that he drank. It was also in bottles so I dk if that made a difference, but we didn't ask for that and I think it was very grimey for her to not have told us that we were paying for each one and to have not brought the soft drink in a cup like she did mine. Terrible. Then when she did bring our food (I ordered the $14 jack daniels platter) she just left it on the table and didn't ask if we needed anything until we were almost half finished with our meals. My bf couldn't eat his wings cause she didn't bring enough bleu cheese and mine was terrible cause all of the yummy dipping sauces for my huge platter were left off the plate. Needless to say the staff here really needs a lesson in customer service and satisfaction. I would NOT recommend coming here. The service is terribly unfriendly and not honest and the food is average at best. Just drive a little further to the Applebees on Rainbow and Spring mountain and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food here was NOT good, not even acceptable.  Ordered steak fajitas that came with soggy and hard tortillas, black beans that looked like the chef dumped them right from the can without washing or cooking them, rubbery steak, and green peppers that were more gray than green.  My husband had the Jack Daniels burger with fries.  He said the burger was ok-decent but there were about 10 fries that came with the burger.  My son had the child pasta & marinara with mandarin oranges; his favorites!  Unfortunately, he barely touched them.  We tried to relay our dissatisfaction and disappointment to our waiter, who simply replied, \"yeah, the kitchen is pretty busy tonight.\"  OK?!  And?!  First of all, it wasn't really busy, there were plenty of empty tables and no one waiting to be seated.  We've lived in Aliante since before the casino was built.  We've tried TGIF many times thinking it HAS to be better than the last time we were there.  Nope.  Never is.  It's unfortunate because I enjoy having the casino in the neighborhood but I don't see how it stays in business with restaurants changing every few months and terrible ones that stick around.

I have been to Happy Hour a few times with girl friends and the bar area has better service.  We usually get apps (usually fried - hard to mess that up) and share while we are having drinks.  Happy Hour is the only reason I will give 2 stars, but never again will I be eating in the dining room."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. We got there around 7:30 and the hostess offered for us to sit at the bar area for happy hour or for a 10 minute wait for the dining area. We opted for the dining area. (happy hour stops at 7..so that was never really an option?) the service was pretty slow. My husband stupidly agreed to ordering cheesesticks when the waitress offered.. I was definitely not impressed with the $9 cheesesticks. He ordered some kind of pasta dish and I ordered a salad. The portions we got for both were not very big, they tasted fine, just small. The check took forever to come. The only thing that really bothered me out of the whole night was I was looking through the drink menu when we had first sat down and the waitress suggested a mason jar drink that is apparently popular.. I can't remember the whole name something palm.. Anyways the drink came in a small square mason jar.. And it was really tasty.. But it literally couldn't have had any alcohol in it.. I mean like none.. And when we got the check the drink alone was $10! I was expecting $5-7 like a normal drink. Especially considering the small size of this one.. I've had drinks before on previous visits and usually 1 drink an I can at least tell I've drank something, but this time 1 small $10 drink that might as well have just been ginger ale. I was really not happy with the whole situation. Maybe had the drink had more alcohol I wouldn't have been so upset about the big price for such a small drink.."}
{"text":"WARNING: THIS TGIF DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE UNLIMITED APPS PROMOTION (pretty whack considering TGIF is a large chain) 

We walked in a couple of months ago for the first time to take advantage of the unlimited app deal advertised all over tv and the corporate website. We were pretty disappointed to be seated and told this location does not honor this deal. Instead we settled for a happy hour special blue moon and spinach dip. They were alright, nothing special. I gave a star because our server was good, not great. 

I also called in a couple of days ago to see if they offered the updated promotion where you can mix and match unlimited apps for $12. Still a no. To be honest, I'm not sure how this place is still standing. This is a huge promotion that should bring in a lot of business, this location is passing up a good opportunity if you ask me. 

Won't be coming back here without an exceptional happy hour or the unlimited app deal."}
{"text":"I've dinned here a couple times without incidence but my recent visit was very disappointing.  The hostess put us in the bar area though there were several seats available in the dinning area.  The bar was so loud as it was Super Bowl Sunday and I had a lovely headache to start with.  

A young male waiter came to take our order and he was great.  Soon after leaving, a waitress named Ingrid told us she was taking over our table.  But Ingrid did NOTHING.  Someone else brought our appetizers, food and desserts.  Dishes piled at the corner of the table though she repeatedly passed by and my dessert was mushy and melting from having been left so long.  

There was a table with about 8 to 10 guests a couple tables back and Ingrid along with three other waitresses served on them hand and foot.  Too bad the staff couldn't pay attention to other guests.  I'm a high tipper but Ingrid got about 50 cents.  Not sure if she got the message about my disappointment.  

Besides my mushy desert and my strawberry missing the bottom half of it, the meal was delicious but to me, customer service is paramount in a business!"}
{"text":"We took family out to dinner here on Halloween night. We has the absolute rudest  server in all history. Ordered a steal and it tasted stale. His reaction was \"what do you want me to do about it\". REALLY?  Took him we would like another.  Took until everyone else was done eating before he showed back up with it.  Then he slammed it down on the table,  had to literally get up and Look for him to get refills on drinks and to pay. Took 2 and a half hours to eat !  They were not that busy."}
{"text":"While I typically don't believe in writing reviews for change companies, the experience I just had at TGI Friday's deserve nothing less than an outstanding review. my employee just had oral surgery, and was reduced to being able to eat nothing but mashed potatoes. When I arrive to pick up the order we had called in for a quart of mashed potatoes, I was pleasantly greeted by what would appear to be the owner, possibly the manager. he escorted me to the bar and on the way proceeded to tell me that the they were going to cover the order for free due to the sympathy they had for our employee. I would expect a small business to have more compassion than a big business simply because it's easier to connect with small businesses. Act of kindness blew me away regardless of it being a bigger company. 

My boss and I come to this TGI Friday's semi-regularly for meetings or just a lunch break, and every single time we are here we are treated with exceptional service and the food is always great and reasonably priced something I have come to expect from a TGI Friday's."}
{"text":"It's not as bad as the other reviews- that is for sure. It is however a chain restaurant. Our server was nice and attentive. The menu is your basic burgers, ribs, pasta type of food. I ordered a shrimp/chicken combo and the shrimp was supposed to have a pico de Gallo but it was most definitely jar salsa."}
{"text":"I had a gift card.....LOL barf. got major heartburn after eating here. Not this restauant's  fault, I think its just cheap 3rd class  bar food....What do you expect.?  Cool deals and stuff, but I think I will pass on all the food slathered in Jack Daniels sauce. That shit taste like its made of corn syrup.
Only thing I liked was the green bean fries.
The world would probably be a better place if restaurants like this did not exist."}
{"text":"Been here first time, food was worst . We ordered chicken nachos, onion soup and crispy chicken sandwich, soup was decent,in nachos there was hardly any chicken, sandwich was disaster. We will never be back"}
{"text":"I've been to all the TGI Friday restaurants in town and by far this is the WORST one yet.

There were only five other customers at the time and me and my friends (We're young adults) went here to eat instead of lucky penny over at Palms I insisted that we went to Lucky Penny instead of here but ya know they're dumb kids who only believe in what they already tried in... (I mean I even offered to pay too) But they still refused, again dumb kids. (Why would they refuse to a free meal?)

Again I didn't want to eat here but my two friends said they preferred to go here instead of Lucky penny. Oh and boy did they regret not listening to my advice.

So, we were seated immediately which was good and we ordered immediately because we're starving teenagers.

The server came back and apologized to us telling us that we had to wait 10 minutes because the was some technicalities in the kitchen.

At this time a mother and her child arrived and was seated across from us.

She ordered chicken with fries (I don't remember the actual name so i'm going with chicken with fries because it was basically that)

My friend also ordered the same thing but yet somehow she got her order instead of us?????

WHAT???? I DON'T UNDeRSTAND? ARE WE NOT A PRIORITY BECAUSE WE'RE CHILDREN?

So we didn't act up or anything we're good kids... So we left after the server said that we had to wait another 10 minutes for our order.

In the end we had to walk another quarter mile back to Palms to go to Lucky Penny and in the end I treated them because i'm a nice guy.

But one of my friends didn't even say thank you to me so... yeah that was a big no no and now in my mind she is a giant doo doo and i'm dropping her butt"}
{"text":"A late night stop around 11:30 and the food is still as well cooked and presented as if it were in the middle of the day. I had the two pieces of grilled chicken with Jack Daniels, broccoli, and sweet potato fries. The broccoli was crunchy to the bite and the sweet potato fries were well seasoned. The grilled chicken looked wonderful and it was pretty juicy on the inside as well. The Jack Daniels sauce tied the whole meal together and was a good size meal as well. The waitress was also friendly and quick. Good place to come if you want some late night good food."}
{"text":"Finally a TGI Fridays that hasn't turned the bar into gaming... SO happy to be able to bring our son in the bar so we can still enjoy all the great Happy Hour specials... Happy Hour is all day everyday!!"}
{"text":"I haven't returned to TGIF's in a while... haven't really had fantastic dining experiences there. However, I went with my family this evening and noticed they had Korean tacos on the menu. Hmmmm...that sounds interesting. I'll get that.

Service was a little slow (thank goodness we were not in a hurry) but the server (a female) was very nice. 

When our food did come, the tacos and rice were served on a skillet and smelled delicious. 

Let me just say the tacos were fantastic. And not just for TGIF's, but in general. Great flavor and had a slight kick to them which I loved. The rice on the other hand, which looked good, was bland beyond reason. It looked like there was cilantro on top and peppers mixed in the rice but there was absolutely NO FLAVOR. No idea how that was pulled off. So A+ on the taco part of the dish D- for the rice part. 

I would order that dish again without a doubt but I would definitely request a different side dish."}
{"text":"I know it's just a Friday's.  I know it's a chain.  I know not to expect mind-blowing food.  But I still expect cleanliness and service.

I came mid afternoon on a Sunday.  It was 2 or 3 pm, the place was not even close to crowded.  Most of the tables had dirty dishes from parties that had left, and the tables had not been cleaned up.  Most of the tables were empty, but there was nowhere to be seated so we had to wait 15 to get seated.

But once they finally sat us at the table, we might as well not have existed, because nobody tried to serve us for another 30 minutes.  I think some of the staff were changing shifts, but still ridiculous.

We came here because were were starving, this was the closest thing, and we figured major chain would be predictable food and relatively prompt service.  But figured wrong.  I won't be back.  Not even with a coupon for a free meal. 

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came into this branch on Wednesday night around 8pm or so. I must tell you I am not pleased with the service we received from the moment we walked in till the time we left. 
When we walked in the young lady at the door stared at me until I said it was just the two of us.  With no words what so ever she grabbed menus and started walking away. We were not sure if we were to follow our not because she hadn't said a word to us.  She turned around and waved us to a table. She then put our menus on the table and walked away. I thought wow. It can only get better from here.  Boy was I wrong.  
We waited ten minutes for our waitress to come to our table and she started with. \" what can I get you\". No name.  Nothing about the menu.  Nothing. I asked if there were drink specials.  She brought me a book and added they are all fruity drinks you won't like them.  So I ordered a whiskey.  My gf ordered a water with lemon.  Another few mins pass and we both get waters no lemon. After ten more minutes I finally get my drink. BTW there are upwards of 25 tables that have no one sitting at them. Not real busy. I'm really hungry at this point so we stay to eat. We order the pretzel appetizers. They came fast but they were placed on my table with no words spoken again from the staff My gf orders the \"474\" jd ribs. In return she got a rude comment. \"Oh those ones\" like im cheap or something. also BTW there are no indicators that this comes with sides in the menu. The waitress says it comes with fries and Coleslaw. We want to upgrade to different sides and we get an eye roll. Whatever. I order the jd chicken with mashed instead of slaw. Food comes out pretty fast and tastes pretty good. But my last problem is that the whole we sat there my drink was never refilled and never was I asked if I wanted another one until I was done eating. Again the food was good but the service was terrible. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Vinny is the best! We love sitting at the bar every time we come to Fridays. The bar tenders are always so nice and personable! Vinny made this pregnant girl the best mango peach lemonade and even gave me one to go! Great service!"}
{"text":"Meh. The chicken strips with Jack sauce were the worst I've ever had. Dry. Burnt. Small. Kind of like old remnants of hours old chicken heated up in a microwave. The Jack sauce made them bearable. 

Recommend the peach sangria."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to my wife! 

We came here to celebrate and get the night started. But last night, we were not so happy about the food and drinks and ended up paying for a free birthday dessert.

You see the picture!? Looks good right? Not!
The fries were super salty and stale.
My burger was dry and burnt on one side. 
I asked for medium well, they cooked it extra charred! Ha!
I got it replaced. The second one was good.

The drinks were really watered down and to much ice..
It was a strawberry hurricane and a blue citrus something. I don't think those were the right cups for those kind of drinks.

Now it's dessert time! So we already told the waiter it's our birthday. He said we can get a free dessert. Great! We ordered one vanilla bean cheesecake. We took two bites then asked for a box to take it to go.

We got our check and I was charged for 3 burgers, 2 drinks, and dessert. Now hold on wait a minute! It was 2 burgers and the waiter said we can have a free dessert. When I asked him again he says only the chocolate sundae was free. Wtf! But you said.. you know what nevermind! He didn't even bother to fix it. There goes his tips! $12 tip went down to $1. 

Next time I come back, this better not happen again.!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and drinks were great almost half off all drinks and appetizers from 4-7 I believe. Got the steak and lobster with a baked potato and rice, I heard it's under 15 bucks before 6 which of course we got there after 6. Steak I ordered was pretty tough but I would not send it back since I work in the restaurant biz I know how it is when a customer sends food back to the kitchen, no bueno lol."}
{"text":"Wow. Ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp platter. The plate was not sizzling. And the chicken was not cooked! Asked for a replacement and it looks like they quickly slapped a plate together. Second plate was again not sizzling. Cheese was not melted, could totally see the straight edges of the cheese. And apparently just your basic single sliced American cheese (see photos). I know its TGIF and nothing fancy, but really!? One star for at least making sure the chicken was cooked this time."}
{"text":"We went in there last night around 9:30, and boy oh boy was that a bad decision. The bad service started off with nobody even approaching our table for almost 10 minutes. When our server finally got to our table he seem flustered, nervous and impatient. He made constant mistakes throughout the night and kept having us repeat information. 

One of the runners that brought food to my table spilled half my food all over the table as she was trying to put my plate down on the table. The most unprofessional thing that i witnessed as an employee who was on break sitting with customers, being extremely loud and inappropriate and talking about x rated things with her friends. She was so loud I could barely hear my friend who was only sitting across from me. It was like all the employees were clumsy, forgetful, rude and disrespectful. Sorry,next time I'll go to another location."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food was cold. Took forever to get refills. Quality of the food and service sucked. TGI Fridays is going down hill"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Friday night, not bad during dinner rush time at 6pm. Not too busy just right. Went in as I got an offer for buy one get one entrée free with a purchase of two beverages.
I ordered the jack Daniels baby back ribs with the cajun style shrimp. The tops of the baby back ribs was charred more than the normal but it was still great. 
My friend ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with shrimp and the came out with just chicken on the plate. so we had to ask for the shrimp. They brought the shrimp out, but people around us was sending the food order back. Either the kitchen had screwed up or did the waitress. 
The Chicken was way too peppery that made it had to eat, but had jack Daniel sauce to drown out the peppered taste.
I've always enjoyed TGIF, but there constantly changing up there menu which is great , but for me who haven't been jack in months was a throw off for me as good thing I eat the same thing .
Every thing else was fine as service was up to par and we still left waitress 20% which was too much . 
At least we got checked on by waitress and manager that was walking around."}
{"text":"When I was in high school I used to come here with a group of friends nearly every other weekend to enjoy the offers for the happy hour. Since then this location has went through an extensive renovation with remodeling. Unfortunately, the food nor the service (especially the service) wasn't like what it was back in the day.

The two times I've been here after the renovation, the first time our waiter was foreign and had a difficult time understanding what we wanted for our order. The wait on our appetizers and dinner was longer than expected, and the music during this time was turned up to a very uncomfortable volume (when requesting that they lowered it down in our section, nobody even cared to do so). The second time we returned, our waiter started out nice, but became very shrewd once he mixed up our order with someone else's. From that experience, I didn't want to come back to this location anymore, despite how much I loved it back in the day."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!! I went for dinner Sunday night, with hopes of watching a couple games while I dined. I sat in the bar area and I had to wait 14 minutes for anyone to greet me and take my order. I got my potstickers and meatballs, both of which were lukewarm at best! I told my server, who took them both away without any apology. My food was then brought back to me by another server who simply threw it all down in front of me and walked off. I ate that one round and after waiting what had to be no less than 20 minutes to see my server and to get a refill on my water, I asked for the check and to speak with the manager. My server returned with my check told me the manager would be over shortly to speak with me. I paid and waited to speak with a member of the managers staff. I waited a full 30 minutes and NO MANAGER EVER CAME OVER TO MY TABLE! When I asked my server again about speaking to a manager, I was told to please be patient and someone would get to me as soon as they could. This is not only unprofessional on part of the server, but also on part of the management staff. A complaint from a patron should be addressed immediately or at the very least the patron should be informed that their concerns are important and will be taken care of in a TIMELY MANNER. I waited another 30 minutes before finally leaving and deciding to right this review. While I would love to give them another chance, I highly doubt it matters to anyone at this location."}
{"text":"The customer service here is very VERY poor. 

24 February 2017 

We were a party of 3 

Our server name was Anna ; Table 16. 

When we got sat the server Anna greeted it was 2 of 3 us. She handed the menus and disappeared for 15 minutes, came back took drink order, disappeared again. 

If its not because we call for her attention only God knows how long more it would have taken to take our order. 

We did a very simple order too. 

Burger
Nachos
Beer 

Nachos arrived 20min. 
No burger. 

Burger took 35min to arrive. 

3rd person arrived and ordered Ribs. Since we were already upset by then - 

I asked Anna how long it would take - she said 15min, I then told her that if it were longer to cancel it.  

A bus boy came by and dropped the Ribs - they arrived in 10min. So that was good. 


However, no silverware. I had to go to the Host and request silverware. 


Anna (server) not once stopped by after taking the Ribs order and having bus boy drop it off. 

We had to request our check from another server. 

After 10min - still no Anna. We wanted to pay, requested to pay already, the other server was very nice & said she would go look for Anna, thats when we said \"we need to pay now or were walking out\" in that second the server saw Anna coming, she arrived and we paid. 

I wrote in the Receipt how poor the service was but still tipped her. 

We didnt speak with the manager bcus at that point we were just too over the shit service, we just wanted to gtfo. 

I maybe thought Anna was running behind at first bcus it was a Friday night 8pm ish but noticed how the other servers were being attentive w their table. So I was like wtf? 

At the end, Anna nicely greeted goodbye, like really? Your service was shit, just go get lost again like you did the whole time. 


...should've checked the Ratings here on Yelp before stopping here. 

Never again. Never. Unless there is new management & staff. This service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's day. The service was good. There were quite a few issues but Management handled them well. I love this restaurant. Thanks to Kim the manager."}
{"text":"We had a party of eight, four adults and four kids. Everyone was happy with their food, and our server, who I think was named Alyson. A star deducted for a pathetic men's room. (See picture.)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress made us move tables and didn't carry our drinks or menu's or offer to carry it.

We moved tables to the bar area and waited 10 minutes until we flagged down a waitress.

I had noticed my mock tail was missing raspberry so when I asked very politely for some raspberry syrup to be added she told me that that wasn't how the drink was made.

When I kindly told her it's in the drink menu. She picked it up saw it and slammed it down she snatched my drink away. By that time we were annoyed so we got the check and left.  She was annoyed about us wanting the check too! Can you believe that. Terrible terrible I will never go back to the casino or restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst I have had on the road. I stood at the entrance way for 3-4 min, and that was with 3 workers, then another came up, turned her back to me and started talking to the crew. Then finally a crew member ask, how many to your guest? I then said I'm here to pick out an order... \"Oh, just go to the bar\".... Then I get to the bar, I don't drink or smoke, but that was jus t another 5-10 mins more. Even though my pice up time has past by 10mins already. So I get my food and walk across to the hotel that I'm staying at, get to my room, go to eat my food it was the correct order..... But..... The food was COLD....... TGI, on WT HARRIS, in Charlotte NC, please get it together,, you never know who is in your presence."}
{"text":"This place is located inside of the Orleans casino. We came in around 5 pm for early dinner; even though the place was packed, we were seated right away. However, it took a while for the waitress to come around to us to take orders. We had the Sampler for appetizer, bacon cheese burger, and chicken sandwich. We're full with the appetizer before the main courses got to us.  Overall, the foods, service were good and we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So disappointed. We were told the wait would be 20 maybe 30 minutes. Over an hour later, with several empty tables visible, we still weren't seated and were told we had to wait until another large party finished and left. They wouldn't push 2 tables together to accommodate our party of 8. To top it off the bar was closed for a $10 app event and we were given grief for wanting a drink while waiting. Needless to say, we tossed the 20% off coupon and went down the street to a restaurant that appreciated our business. 
No stars from us today. :("}
{"text":"Ordered: The really good burger
The burger was pretty good, juicy. The flavors are there. Their mixed drinks are well mixed. Definitely a tryout spot. Service is fairly nice."}
{"text":"Flat Iron Steak was prepared very well, delivered Medium Rare exactly. Exemplary service and friendly staff.  My iced tea glass was refilled regularly. Nothing to complain about here. Good chain restaurant with predictably good quality and predictably good service."}
{"text":"Due to my heavy accent they did not want to serve me a beer - they thought I was drunk! This is discrimination how offending!"}
{"text":"DONT GO DONT GO DONT GO.....my girlfriend and I have been to the sunset rd one 4 times over the last few months.  There is always a problem.  !st time we ordered the 2 for $20.00 and each had a drink.. our bill was over $60.  When we asked the waitress she said \"ohhhhhhhh i rang it in as a regular order\".  This has happened twice.  Come on I wasnt born yesterday.  They are scamming so if you dont look over your bill your paying full price.  Then just this Saturday night 8/11/2012 we saw a 2 for $10 comercial and figured hey 10 bucks lets give it one more shot..  We were seated and given our menu's but no 2 for 10- menu when i asked for it they said they dont have the 2 for 10 anymore.  I said i just saw the commercial and its on your website.  She said we dont have that she then said they had a 3 for 20.  I looked over the 3 menu's they hand you and no 3 for 20 so i had to call her over and ask for it.  I then asked why isnt the 3 for 20 menu included with all these others. get this response \" ohhh if you dont ask for it we dont give it to you\" . I then asked for a manager and she dismissively informed me that on any specials if you dont know about it and ask for it they dont tell you about it..  Are you kidding me.  Needless to say we didnt ordered and i just paid for the drinks and left.  Also this place has gone down hill in the clean dept.  Floors dirty tables not cleaned.  What a joke I will never eat at a fridays again.  When we asked the manager for the corporate number we had to wait 10 mins for it and she doesnt even include her name on it we had to ask. SCAM SCAM SCAM SHADY PLACE.  AGAIN DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service very slow despite almost nobody in the restaurant. The only thing that saved it was our waitress was extremely friendly and sweet. She helped us celebrate our nephews birthday with so e ice cream. She was smiling and kind."}

{"text":"Upon viewing the new menu, I was happy to see that pan-seared Pot Stickers have returned as an appetizer at the TGI Friday's at Sam's Town. My wife and I received a good greeting upon our arrival, and all restaurant employees we encountered were very friendly. I showed my Stripes card and was told that all Stripes members can have free tortilla chips and salsa if they wish, as an appetizer. So, we made such a request, and this complimentary dish was quickly produced. Unfortunately though, the red and tan tortilla chips were lukewarm and served with unmemorable, very mild tomato salsa. But they were free (although mistakenly charged on our initial bill until that was corrected), so I have no cause to complain! 

I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade after our server recommended this beverage to us. After a wait of about 15 minutes, and far after my companion's Sprite had already been placed on the table, I had to ask again for this to be produced. Then the server RAN to the bar before taking our food orders, and returned quickly with the drink. Although the lemonade contains no alcohol, we were told that it is prepared by a bartender, which caused the delay. Refills are provided--but at 50 cents a pop. The beverage itself projected a rich strawberry flavor, but not to the degree of the Strawberry Lemonade served at Red Robin or southern California's Tony's Spunky Steer restaurants that includes several large fresh half-strawberries in the beverage. A requested refill was accommodated fast. 

Our leather booth was comfortable to sit in but the wood grain on the edges of the table top was worn thin by continual customer use. The restaurant, situated on the casino floor, has a very dark woodsy appearance, with a Las Vegas theme incorporated in the wall hangings. 

Pot Stickers were very good but not quite hot enough for all 6 pork-filled dumplings to retain the heat in time for dipping in the Szechwan-flavored sauce. The same lack of robust heat was true of the French Onion Soup, the broth of which was not as flavorful as I recall enjoying previously at many other TGIFridays locations. The Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta I ordered was suitably hot and rendered very spicy by a generous application by the chef of Cajun Butter sauce. For the most part this entree tasted very good, with tender cooked shrimp and supple hunks of white chicken. But one piece of gristle and a small bit of shell struck discordant notes in my mouth. The portion was huge, and almost half of the dish was taken home for a hearty lunch the next day. Meanwhile, my spouse enjoyed Friday's Shrimp that was lightly battered and cooked just right except for one spicy-tasting shrimp that likely got too close to someone else's order of Firecracker Shrimp. Announced in the menu as a dozen shrimp, she actually counted 13 plump shrimp on her plate. This was another generous serving; 4 shrimp were packaged for home. 

Although there were a few miscues, overall this was a good dining experience, and we plan to come back again."}
{"text":"The food here is usually better than at other local TGIFs, but on my last outing with friends there were massive service problems.  A server was slow to arrive at our table, and I had to get my own silverware from an adjoining table in order to have eating utensils.  My Iced Tea order was first forgotten, and when it finally did arrive  contained almost no ice.  One of my table-mates had food gunk visible on his initial knife, and loud chatter from adjoining tables mixed with too loud piped in music made it difficult to carry an understandable dinner conversation. 

Complimentary homemade tortilla chips for being a TGIF card holder were very good dipped in salsa, but our table was not bussed of empty appetizer dishes until almost at meal's end, and then only at our party's urging.  Worst of all, the waitress totally forgot to put in an order for a fellow diner's salad and cheesy chicken skillet, and then took at least 15 minutes just to bring the salad.  The entrée did not arrive until the rest of us were finishing ours.  

Onion Soup was good, except the cheese top floated on two croutons.  My Spicy Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Pasta dish was very tasty, and a Hot Fudge Sundae was good, and for once included enough hot fudge.  So, on this visit the food was good, but the service was decidedly not.

XX-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"At last I had a 4-star meal here!

Although the hostess acted disappointed that we didn't want to be seated in the bar area, and it took about 10 minutes to get water (our only drinks) after asking for same, we enjoyed the best cooking and service we have had here to date.  We were present during Thursday night football, so the place was packed, and the few available servers seemed to be somewhat overtaxed.

Even though we each ordered an entree, because it was only $1.00 more to have \"Endless Appetizers\" we (rather foolishly) opened with Endless Pot Stickers and Endless Potato Skins.  They were very tasty, but all we were doing was stuffing ourselves and gaining weight for no ostensible necessary purpose.  Just because there is a deal is no reason to blindly seize upon it!  So, since I could barely finish my second round of Pot Stickers along with everything else, next time Endless Appetizers are available, regardless of price differential I will be satisfied with just a single order of an app.

Beyond the abundant apps, we accepted complimentary warm Tortilla Chips & Salsa for being long-time Stripes members; I had my usual cup of tasty French Onion Soup; and I again enjoyed a generous portion of hot and creamy Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta, with plump shrimp and tender chicken, while Diane liked her golden Friday's Shrimp & Fries.

Overall, service by our server Audra was first-rate; we were given enough time to enjoy each course before the next one was delivered; and the manager even came by once to personally check on our satisfaction."}
{"text":"We had a large group with kids & our server was able to offer us happy hour specials ;) He even came by our table a few mins before happy hour was going to end to see if we would like any more (happy) drinks haha. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food & drinks."}
{"text":"They have one of the best reward programs anywhere! Every other visit we have stripes points to use for a free meal and it's great! Drinks are great, appetizers are on point, and about 3/4 of the servers bust their butt to make sure you the customer are happy! Will we be back? Heck yeah! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Kind of surprised by the amount of bad reviews. My father just stayed at the Orleans for the last week and we stopped in here many times for appetizers and drinks mainly. I'd reccomend bar area for seating. Happy hour has some good deals on appetizers and drinks in there. Always polite and prompt service from the wait staff. Food always came out hot and fresh. I only wish this location was 24 hours because the tgi Fridays at Gold Coast is terrible compared to this one."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of this location at all. Stopped in with my gf to have a drink and talk for a bit. Sat at the bar and asked for a drink menu. Did not receive a greeting at all and the reply to our question about a drink menu was \"I have that\". This I not what I asked for it was showing some items that were on happy hour. I wanted the actual drink menu that you flip through that shows the pictures and ingredients. Asked again for the drink menu and got a sigh and treated like an inconvenience that she had to go to the other side of the bar to get it for me. Sorry to inconvenience you I'll make sure to not come back and ask again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service and seating arrangement known to mankind. I cannot believe this restaurant is actually redesigned to accommodate bigger crowds better. The wait staff didn't even acknowledge our party  of 9. When they did they seated us at 2 different tables because they couldn't figure out how to accommodate us. See my attached photo of how absurd the situation was because they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"We went yesterday there the server Joe I believe it was his name it was pleasant accommodating but the food still sucks"}
{"text":"Just like any other TGI FRIDAYS inside a casino happy hour no so good any ways $6 for mozzarella cheese sticks a wings are small but good hot sauce super busy in dinner hours...we may come back 
I did remember long time ago the 2 4 20 
Or 2 4 25 deal no more. ... well all bartenders working hard ..."}
{"text":"Wow, the service was horrible. AVOID THIS PLACE! We waited 45 minutes for our food. My husband ordered a full chicken Cesar salad. First the salad didn't even fill the plate. I asked if that was the correct size because there was no way that the salad that arrived was $13. We had to send it back in order to get more lettuce. He also said that the dressing was mayo based and not a traditional Cesar dressing. Due to the fact that the salad was smothered in the dressing it was inedible after my husband got half way thru. I ordered the jack Daniels ribs with French fries and broccoli. When my meal came I asked for my broccoli because it didn't come out with my food. Only after I asked was I told that they were out of broccoli and all veggies so they just decided to give me double French fries. My brother's girlfriend ordered the veggie burger and was less than impressed. My parents ordered hamburgers with French fries. The kitchen switched the hamburgers which made a huge difference since one ordered medium rare and the other ordered medium with a touch of pink. My father also got French fries with salt only and my mother got unseasoned French fries. Finally, the bathroom was disgusting. There were USED feminine products on the floor. The bathroom smelled terrible. It was a mess with paper towels all over the floor. Our waiter wasn't attentive at all. When we finished our meal we over heard the table next to us send back their steak because it was improperly cooked and cold. After our meal was done the plates just sat and sat and sat on the table. We are definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Really can't go wrong with TGI Friday's for going to a commercial restaurant. I like this stand alone location better than any of the others they have that are inside of casino's.

They have a special that you have to ask for now by request only, as per our server they ripped it out of the menu. They must have been losing money as I think the special went over a bit too well lol. It is really a lot of food for $10 bucks!

The two for $10 menu is great, you get to select a main entree and have your choice of an appetizer or dessert. I had the new Korean tacos that come with Jasmine rice on the side. Three tacos very filling, the Korean beef is a bit sweet and the hint of chili sauce just makes it perfect. I will for sure order this again! I was in the mood for a salad so ordered that as my appetizer, it was a nice big wedge salad with bacon and tomatoes, very generous!

My sweetheart got the cheeseburger w/fries and selected cheese sticks as his side, very filling a full appetizer which is normally $7.99 alone. We both ordered the two for $10 special as you can't beat it!!!

Service was Amazing, we had Meagan as our server and she was Fantastic! Always dropping off a drink before we finished our previous one. I love refills on drinks without having to ever ask and she kept them coming! We sat in the bar as we wanted a booth and could watch TV during our dinner which were all of the sports games, basketball this night. 

We will be back as always to this location only. The food is always great and service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok but the highlight for us was the Mr. & Mrs. Santa Claus group that was meeting in the banquet room. That was fun.
The restaurant was slow and quite which is nice for a morning in Vegas. Coffee was served in big coup cups with soup spoons.
The breakfast special for $3.99 included two eggs, 2 strips of bacon, hash browns and toast. I liked everything but the shredded hash browns had a little 'off' flavor. I couldn't put my finger on it but i didn't care for them. They just seemed to greasy and crusty. The eggs, bacon and toast were typical. The price on the menu was $5.99 but if you ask for the special, you can get the $3.99 price. We'd eat here again."}
{"text":"I usually go to TGIF but after this experience and the previous ones NEVER again!

Im susbscribed to the rewards system and i usually get free appetizers or deserts for my points plus i get the 20% off or buy one get the other free in the mail. When i began coming here the waiters were really cool and they would accept both my coupons because they are not the same but lately, they've been jerks! They say the cannot accept both but they can its been done before in other TGIF restaurants as well. 

Like one of the waiters said \"I dont see why not its not like you are giving me 2 of the same coupons\"

Service has been horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. At first we were seated at a booth with a leaky roof and ants. We moved to a new both that had no leak, but still had ants. The manager assured us the ants were only in the dining room, not the kitchen, which I guess was supposed to make us feel better. I ordered a mid rare steak and it came well done. The second one came medium and I gave up and ate it. It was freezer burned and had chunks of inedible cartilage on it, you could barely get through it with a steak knife. Both chicken dishes were burned on the bottom and overcooked to the point where they were basically hockey pucks. The bathroom was unusable, the floors were sticky, and even the billfold we got our check in was gross and covered in food. The restaurant was empty, we were our waitress's only table, and she still rushed us, asking if we were ready for dessert four bites into our meal, then dropped the check off, then came back while we were still eating to see if we'd paid our bill yet. The manager offered us coupons for free entries on our next visit, which meant she didn't listen to a word I said because who in their right mind would eat there twice?"}
{"text":"The service here is trash. We got seated and waited 20+ minutes for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to eat and we said we were ready to order everything and she took our drink orders and then walked away so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get our drinks and order our food. We got the food and my moms order was wrong and took 20+ minutes to get a SIDE OF FRIES. We wanted ketchup while we were waiting for the waitress to come back and another table had just gotten up to leave and they had ketchup. My mother asked another server if she could have the bottle of ketchup and the server stopped and looked at the ketchup and then walked away. What the fuck. I'm sitting here eating my food. I'm surprised it's even warm. Very disappointed, I used to love eating here."}
{"text":"overall not bad, great portions for the price. pretty good, average food. def a great place for just a run of the mill type meal. 

(2 people 20 bucks, cant really complain)"}
{"text":"They changed the cheesy broccoli soup to a white cream and broccoli soup with just a few sprinkles of shredded cheese on top. The broccoli was barely cooked. The chicken from the chicken shrimp dish was burnt and dry. We ordered a dessert and to go box at the same time. Dessert came, was ate and still no box. I was getting ready to leave the left over edible food if I would have gotten the bill in a timely manner. Got the box and then has to wait for the bill. Probably will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"The food was decent at best,  service was awful.  Lazy host, slow service,  mediocre food.  I would not go back to this location.  Management needs to work on the customer service for this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Not too good. Service was a joke. The server forgot items. We did not see her for a twenty minute stretch, and the straw that broke the camels back she forgot my daughter-in-laws dinner. We came to find out that she never placed it with the kitchen. The manager did end up picking up the tab for the 5 of us and tried to apology but it was a little too late by then. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since May, and the first couple times they 'had' good fast customer service. However, lately they have been extremely slow my husband and waited a long time to be seated and and service just horrible what does the staff do??? Your supposed check on you customers and have at least 1 person to welcome you in \" Like!!!! Hi Welcome to TGF\" not of that here \" what are we supposed to seat ourselves down or what!!!!\" The waited for the waitress took over 20 minutes awww!!! Chills has better service than this!!'"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant space for an airport because it is much larger than the typical restaurant you find in a terminal. Our waitress was very nice. Good was good. Nice view of the terminal. We would definitely go back. Good atmosphere to relax in while waiting for your flight"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Happy Hour? I mean you're supposed to be Happy, right?

Happy Hour runs in the bar area (very large might I add). We (Dao N.) ventured over after a day of students, grading, and paperwork everywhere and ordered Potato skins, Buffalo Chicken Wings, Nachos skillet, and Wild Berry Sangrias!

I originally ordered a peach sangria but they didn't have white wine or something.. but that's fine because the Wild Berry Sangrias were DELICIOUS!

Service was in my opinion a bit slower than what I'm used to, but I try to live in a fast lane and managed to enjoy my dinner."}
{"text":"We got to this restaurant at 6:30 pm was told there was 15min wait. It took 40 mins before we were seated by a unfriendly hostess. It is now 8:05 pm and I still have not been given my drink and we are now almost 2hrs here still with no drinks or food.. I've asked for actually waiting on manager to come out now. Fortunately the manager -Mike was professional and apologetic for the service or lack there of due them being short staffed. We asked why didn't the hostess tell us they had a major service delay oppose to 15 min wait. I would not recommend this location for anyone who has a life to live and not be held hostage waiting on service. It has been 10mins since the manager was out. Still no drink and my order finally came and the order is wrong. I don't even want a discount. I could've cooked my own dinner for how long this has taken . 
Im going to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Another bad experience here with service.  It took us a long long time to eat dinner here on a Thursday night when it wasn't busy at all.  Looks like our server was socializing with another and not keeping track of his tables.

On the upside... I always thought ordering asian food in an non-asian setting would be weird, but their Dragon Fire Chicken was pretty good - I like the combination of citrus, spice, and cilantro.... makes for some flavor explosions on your tongue."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day...  I'm still skeptical about a place like this doing asian food as I spied a  Hibachi Steak and Chicken option on the menu, but I decided to go with the Santa Fe Salad which was gi-normous, filling, and very tasty.  

The hostess and waiter were pretty friendly as they didn't seem all that busy for lunch.  It did feel like it took a while for the food to come out, but it all worked out in the end:  they got their money and I got a decent meal."}
{"text":"Tgi Fridays is one of my favorite places to eat and I was very excited when I found out is was coming back to champaign. 

With that said our visit there was poor, and it was clear the wait staff was poorly trained and managed from the hostess to the kitchen. 

I'm giving them a 1 star in hopes the owner will take these reviews into consideration and fix the problems since I want this place to succeed. I will update my review when and if they turn it around."}
{"text":"Welcome to the 'sh*t show'.  Staying at the Courtyard next door.  Walked in here at 11:00 pm for a quick drink.  This place was out of control.  

It's hard for me to fully describe the situation. There we're two separate families with young children out of control.  The majority of people seems to know each other and we're having conversations across the whole bar.  

There was a person at the bar who was a regular and - without judging - apparently has a mental disorder.   She was arguing with the staff over her \"to go\" order and eventually tried to leave without paying.  This caused a major scene.   Everyone in the restaurant saw the whole situation.  

Ok.  So, this was just one day.  But according to the bartender, it's something that happens frequently.  

You can judge for yourself.  But with half-dozen other chains nearby, I'm skipping this place."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant where a server that wasn't serving my family constantly glared at me the ENTIRE time we were there.  It was the most uncomfortable experience I've ever had.  It was like she was watching every move I made.  Weirdest shit.  The food was gross to boot.  So it made this first time visit the last one.  I will say though, the server we had was sweet and did her job well."}
{"text":"Place smells like mildew Seats are sunken and worn 
Not enough help and food is gross Mgr does not care about customer service"}
{"text":"good food good price! love the happy hour special with the steak and lobster tail!!"}
{"text":"if you have a large party of people, go here, you'll get great service. upwards of 12 service staff helped the party of 30 while the parties of 2 and 4 were neglected. we waited 11 minutes to be acknowledged, then the waitress told us normally they wont allow sharing on the unlimited apps but shell allow it this time because we had to wait. 10 minutes later the app comes out. 2 minutes later our meal then our 2nd app. the apps were good but the burger buns were too bready, it was thick . too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"We have been at this restaurant for an hour and a half. If you're here watch out for the server Toni. We haven't seen her in about 25 minutes. Ordered three slushee drinks for our table and I ended up just going to the bar to pick them up myself. Service improved marginally after that (after watching the bartender run into the back to tell the staff a customer is coming to pick up their own drinks), but all she does is make excuses for why there are constant issues getting food. It took us the full hour and a half to receive our appetizer and we received it before I went and retrieved my own drinks. I count perhaps 10 tables occupied at 7:45 on a Monday. 
This might have been the most appalling restaurant experience I've had in a long time.
I will make the drive to the Mentor Friday's if I'm craving next time."}
{"text":"Happy hour only and all's well. $6.25 cocktails, $6 apps, $5.75 sangrias, $4 glasses of wine, $3.25 droughts are a decent deal.

Do not expect service from the host or hostess at the front. When calling in an order, make sure you order from the bartenders. This place is notorious for lazy service, except at the bar. I hope the managers and corporate read these reviews. 

But the top shelf Long Island Iced Teas are delicious and will give your tummy that warm fuzzy feeling."}
{"text":"Last week, it was TGIF on a Wednesday!!! 

I've enjoyed TGI Friday's many times in the past, but have not been to this chain in over 2 years. All I can say is YUMMMM!!! 

I was taken there for my birthday lunch. That day, I had also signed up online for TGIF's \"Stripes\" Card! When we sat down, our server, Nicole, informed me that as a Stripes member, I receive free chips & salsa every time I go there! What a great perk! It was a HUGE platter of fresh, hot chips and salsa! Nothing \"small\" about this place!! 

My favorite, decadent cocktail has to be TGI Friday's signature concoction, the Mudslide!! OOOOOhhh, a chocolate/vodka/Kahlua/ice cream orgasm for sure!! After indulging on a Mudslide, I was served a healthy portion of Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. Spicy and heated, it was thoroughly delicious. But, I could not finish it, and got a \"to go\" box. 

My lunch mate secretly told Nicole that it was my birthday. Before I knew it, Nicole and two other servers came over to the table, put a huge slice of vanilla bean cheesecake in front of me and sang their birthday song. OK... so, it's kind of silly -- kind of embarrassing -- but, I enjoyed it!!! Like being a little kid again!! Now, cheesecake is my favorite dessert, so I did not want to save it for later... I managed to savor each bite! 

Overall, TGI Friday's never disappoints. The menu is expansive. The food is fantastic. The service is top notch. The Mudslides are the BEST!!! 

5 YUMS UP!!! ;)"}
{"text":"our server \"doris\" was not very pleasant last time I was here she was very condensing and even got in an argument with ANOTHER guest as i was there. fast forward 2 weeks later i gave this location another shot and sat in the bar area.. crowded but i got a seat.. PAIGE was my sever this time and she was complete opposite of doris.. very happy that things seem to be changing around here i dont know if they hired an entire new staff or what but everyone was a fresh of breath air compared to what this location was previously.. i only knocked 2 stars off because whatever they changed about their potato skins has totally destroyed them.. the cheese is disgusting please go backkkkk."}

{"text":"By far the worst meal I've ever had. Ordered an Ahi Tuna Harvest Apple salad. Upon arrival, it was tiny for $10, I expect more than 4 pieces of 1\" tuna and a cup of wilted, dead lettuce. Immediately sent it back and waited for my daughter to finish so I could go to the food court for a better meal."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and will not be returning. From the moment we walked in, the hosted was not friendly and almost seemed annoyed to be there. Our waitress seemed nice at first until we received our food and my bf (who never complains about food) expressed his dissatisfaction with the food. It was way less than the picture made it seem to be so the waitress offered to bring the menu so he could order something else but at this point he was so hungry so he decided to just eat what he had. When he ate his burger he was not at all happy with the taste (or lack thereof ) and again expressed it to the waitress in a nice way and acknowledging that he knows it's not her fault. The waitress asked if we would like dessert and of course we declined and i told her we would be stopping somewhere else to grab something for my bf to eat. I expected, at some point, for the mgr. to come over to apologize but no one ever did. I then expected to have his food taken off the bill or, at the very least, to have our 2 non-alcoholic drinks taken off the bill but this was not the case. It was all incredibly disappointing.
On a slightly good note,  my parmasian chicken with tomatoe and mozzarella salad was ok..not great but ok!"}
{"text":"This is a review of TGI Friday's in general, not this specific location.  I had lunch here yesterday and was disappointed to find out that they had dropped Thai Pork Tacos from their starter menu.  TGI Friday's had so VERY little on their menus that was lower in calories, and then to take one of the items off...  This chain was not a place that I personally picked myself, but I would go if other people suggested it.  Me thinks not anymore.  They just got put on my list of NOTs, along with Cracker Barrel and Texas Roadhouse.  True, at least TGI Friday's DOES share their nutritional information.  It's just that it's ALL too high in calories (YES, even the salads!).  And seriously, if I wanted to eat a salad, I'd stay at home and make my own!"}
{"text":"I didn't even get a chance to eat here because the experience was so awful. As I walked in to eat at the bar, I saw no less than five tables just covered in mountains of dirty dishes and glassware. Bad sign. No bussers?? Rule #1 of any bar or restaurant is cleanliness. But I forged on and sat at the bar. Something felt... off. Then I realized it was because the lights were so bright it felt like high noon in Red Rock. Is this a bar/restaurant, or an operating theater? Holy smokes you could tan in here. I got up and left. Dim the lights, people, maybe I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"I forgot how good this place actually was I very much enjoyed my happy hour dinner with my wife here"}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck, yuck. Came here for dinner and I'm shocked I didn't get sick. 
Walked in and it wasn't very busy, but was told it was a 20 minute wait...ok. We were seated within 10 minutes. 
Our waitress was ok, not too friendly but not rude. We all ordered waters and a couple beers on draft. The straw I received was already opened? When the beers finally came they weren't ice cold. 
Our food was ok. Just bland. Took forever to come out and one order was incorrect. Then it took a long time to remake it. Seems like there's no sense of urgency or efficiency here. 
I saw a manager going around and apologizing to a few tables. But she never checked on us. 
This place wasn't very clean, the table was kinda sticky and I noticed something floating in my water. 
I'll never return here. Such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before going to this place because it was HORRIBLE. So right away the host asked us to wait 5 to 10 minutes. When we actually got into the restaurant my boyfriend and I were stunned to see so many booths and tables open, and even two hidden rooms completely empty. Second I noticed it took the busy boys at least 10-15 minutes to even clean up a table after customers next to us had left. We asked our waitress to see their 2 for $22 special menu and she took at least another 5 minutes to come back with it. Our appetizer was probably the most appealing part of our meal. I ordered a pasta dish that was just disgusting. It had angel hair pasta and what seemed like refrigerated sauce, and the chicken pieces had no taste and parts of it were well burnt. Our waitress never asked us for a refill for our waters, a most obvious sign of bad service. My boyfriends dragon fire chicken was good but his vegetables had too much salt and pepper. Then we ordered dessert and it took 12 minutes, I repeat 12 minutes, for them to bring it out. When they did it was so hot it burned my tongue and the ice cream was already melting to the side of the brownie. She took the dessert of our bill because it took so long but we still didn't leave a tip. This place was horrible with bad service and bad food. I work at a restaurant myself and I, or my manager, would never let this kind of service be held to our customers."}
{"text":"Did I just have an amazing delicious and carbless lunch of herb grilled chicken with grilled veggies, insalata caprese, and a frozen margarita with a salted rim for $10? Did I get service that was quick and friendly? Yes, I did! Go immediately to TGI Friday's for lunch! So good..."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre; service was perfunctory and insincere, but the manager did stop by to talk with the patrons at each table. When I indicated that my BBQ Chicken Flatbread was stale and chewy, she comped it and made sure my subsequent order was done right. That's good customer service. Wish they'd get it right the first time but nice that there was a recourse! For context, I really loathe TGIF but there were no other options to sit and work while I waited three hours for a flight...."}
{"text":"Friday's is usually a good spot to stop by for Happy Hour when you're hanging out at the Gold Coast. I usually end up here before or after bowling. Service is standard and I like their Happy Hour Specials. They have a large bar that extends out onto the casino floor. I entertain myself by people watching and drinking a rum runner."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Haven't been to this place in a long time and it seems to have went downhill since. I called in an order and was on hold for close to 15 minutes which is embarrassing I waited that long but I was hungry. The order was completely wrong and the food was not that good. Price was too high for the portions. Also, it was pretty empty when I got there but still had to wait inside for about 15 minutes. All in all I'm going to bed hungry. Thanks TGIFridays."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Fridays restaurant here in Maryland most of the time with family and friends, the ambience is pretty good with all that American vibe. I had to wait very long time for my food and all the dishes came out at different times. Also the waiter was busy chatting up the cook, and while we were trying to get her attention. We were sitting right across from the kitchen entrance, and could see that she is having a conversation with someone in there. The food was ok but not great! I have had better services at other locations but just not this one."}
{"text":"I absolutely adored the hostess and our server KC. Sweet as pie. As my rant goes, keep in mind this is my FIRST time at Friday's.

The food was basically crap. 2 friends and I ordered the 2 off the grill and 2 sides. One of my friends... his Mac n cheese didn't come out when the food did. My other friend, her ribs were COLD. Like they just thawed it out and didn't even microwave it. My sirloin steak (which I asked for medium rare) came out well done but was still cold. The broccoli was just soaking in butter for mine, my friend's was soaking in lemon. The jasmine rice was good. There was a mistake on my order, I had asked for salmon.. I got shrimp.. they didn't bother to put my food on a different plate when they took it back, which sucked because what if I had a shrimp allergy? Meh.. whatever. By the time my salmon came out, everyone was pretty much done with what they could manage to eat out of primal hunger. For that many mistakes, our food took incredibly long for the mistakes to come out. 

If it wasn't for KC, I might have flipped as many tables as I could as I left.. but she was so kind and sweet, I couldn't do that to her. She did ask a manager to come out. Dani... come to find out, she's a manager in training. She is probably the most passively condescending individual we encountered tonight. She just had this attitude like she didn't give 2 flying shits about us. She took off one plate. A table sitting not too far from us also were pissed off because their food took 30 mins.. Dave (the actual shift manager) comped their whole meal. My friend was livid. She began to complain how fucked up it was that their entire meal got comped when we had similar issues and ours came with mistakes on EVERY order. THIS CRAP MANAGER said, \"I probably would have attempted something about it had you not talked to me like that\", and walked off. 

I come from the food and beverage industry as a manager... I would NEVER say some crock pot bullshit like that to a customer unless they threatened my family, which wasn't the case. EVERYTHING was wrong with ALL our food.. who wouldn't be pissed upon hearing someone else getting comped and we had to pay. This place is crap. I'd advise driving further and trying a different Friday's.. 

I came home and threw up. Safe to say.. my night is ruined."}
{"text":"I love TGI's revamped menu. Lots of new options, fusion dishes, and overall more balanced. 

I've always had an issue with the service at this particular TGI. The hosts aren't the most friendly, service is ALWAYS slow. Don't expect refills. They're often understaffed. When things get busy, expect panic. The cherry on top is that they expect a good tip, and you'll be able to tell."}
{"text":"Just ate here and had the steak and lobster special. It was delicious and a fantastic price at $13.99.  Our waiter, Justin was OUTSTANDING!!!  He was attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed. He was amazing acknowledging our 5 year olds birthday!!!  Awesome experience!  Thanks tgif!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it, stopped here today waited over 30 minutes for my steak dinner and I got so mad when they came out with the 2\" square steak dinner that is priced well over 22.00.
The steak looks like was recook, didn't look fresh and the mashed potatoes had human hair in it.
Complaining to the floor manager did no good, she said \" I don't have any control over the people in the kitchen \"
This time I didn't take any chances so we got up and left.
While I was waiting for our food two other tables had problems with their food also but they got free dessert so they were ok with the free dessert.
You can't buy my silence with free dessert."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but i figured if i could change someones mind about eating here then it is worth it. Parts of my broccoli were actually rotten when my food came out along with mash potatoes that looked like they were pre-plated 2 years ago. They were definitely not a healthy color. Chicken was really dry and the lemon on my plate actually looked like it was pulled out of a garbage can. This place needs new management. I think someone should check to make sure they are tossing out bad food."}
{"text":"Bad service. Appetizers came out after meal. After I asked to just cancel it. Tea was sour, she said she would replace it and never did. Sarcastic attitude when asking about meal. Baked Potato with the works on side. The side never came."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Was at the bar on Wednesday..barmaid was rude! Never got her name..Kevin picked up her slack! He was ok! This is why I go to TGI Friday in Brooklyn. But I'm sure this place don't care..posted on their Facebook also!!"}
{"text":"I started going to TGI Fridays about 5 Yrs ago. I've been around the country, and the TGI's in Monroeville is the best. The staff is very friendly and the prices are on par with the typical chain restaurants. Now let's get to the important stuff, the food.  My wife and I had been looking for a place to make \"ours\" since I moved up here a few years ago. We had tried many places, but for some reason, not TGI's.  We stopped in there one afternoon at random, just because we were passing by. When  we tasted the Jack Daniel's sampler, we were in love. Lots of chicken and shrimp and ribs, an appetizer big enough for a meal (in fact my wife frequently orders the app for her meal). The potstickers are excellent too, very addictive.  On to the steak. I'm a major carnivore. I firmly believe that good meat doesnt need messed with much. At TGI's, the steaks are good quality cuts, cooked perfectly to order. I usually don't even add seasoning or steak sauce to mine. Try a bite first before camouflaging the meat, you'll be pleased! For those who like seafood, get the salmon with langostine lobster bites, it's every bit as good as the steak! Out of all the meals at the TGIs in Monroeville, and the takeout (two bags is the norm for us), i've never had a bad meal.
They also have a great bartender. My wife loves the dreamsicle, and while I'm not fond of sweet drinks, that one tastes exactly like the ice cream.
So to summarize, THIS TGIs should be used as an example of how to serve food and make people happy."}
{"text":"Fridays has been around forever so of coarse this isn't going to be an extravagant review.Last night my guy and I  went and met some friends across the street at fridays for drinks and they were bragging about how fridays has a rack of beef  ribs with 2 sides for only $12! Well it's true and more food than what we expected to get.Sometimes when we are not in the mood for dressing up and just want to grab drinks we will roll over to this fridays location you can't to much go wrong wtih the drinks at fridays,welp we had a great Friday at Fridays!"}
{"text":"I used to love TGIFridays back in early college days, but now I'm not so fond of it. This restaurant is inside the Orleans casino and was super convenient for us to kill time before our movie. 

Luckily, we came during happy hour and took advantage of ordering a few appetizers and my husband got a beer. We tried the Sesame Jack's chicken strips, spinach and queso dip, and crispy green bean fries. 

Our server was nice and came and asked for ID's since we had to sit at the bar area to get happy hour. The food was just okay. The sesame Jack's chicken strips was a bit too sweet and some pieces were hard and unedible. The spinach and queso dip tasted more like queso dip than anything, but the chips that they came with were good. The green bean fries were my favorite thing about the meal. The sauce for it wasn't too spicy."}
{"text":"Last meal at Friday's forever. I was carded when I asked for a beer. I am 50 years old. When I questioned why I was being carded, the waitress said if you look under 60 it is policy to card you, and walked away. The manager stated the policy was if you looked under 40. I had my work crew with me and we decided to order water, eat quickly and go to a real bar.  This policy, whatever it may be, will cause the loss of my business forever. Hopefully others will read this and force the policy to change or cause Friday's to go out of business."}
