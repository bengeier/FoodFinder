{"text":"Came here in November and gave it 4 stars because the service was good, the food was prepared well the waitress was nice and so on. 

Came back here today and it was such a disappointment. The waitress we had was very rude, the music they had was the radio-nothing nice and soothing for the mood, the lights were way too dimmed and last but not least, the food. We got the fried calamari for our appetizer- first it took a long time to come out and it wasn't even done well. It didn't have any taste, and wasn't cooked correctly. Second, we tried out a burger... came out with the bun completely burnt to crisp- hard as a rock and completely black. We asked the waitress to give us a new bun and all we received was attitude. After the burger came back it was ok until started eating it. The burger was half medium and half rare when we asked for it done medium well(barely pink, warm center); Therefore, it was definitely not done correctly and done carelessly.  I only go to nice restaurants but decided to come here because it was cheap and had good reviews the first time. Really dissatisfied & definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Extremely Professional service, and great food.  We showed up late to our own wedding rehearsal dinner, because or circumstances outside of our control, and they were very accommodating. The food was delicious, not greasy and very tasty.  I highly recommend having an event here, because of the kind service (both from the servers and owner)."}
{"text":"D'Agnese's Bistro in Seven Hills is a relatively new addition to the landscape of local Italian Restaurants, but certainly no newcomer - Franco Boffice has been in the restaurant business his whole life, his father operated restaurants around Montreal, Quebec before Franco opened his first restaurant in New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore in 1968. He opened at the corner of Pleasant Valley and Broadview in 1989 and has been going strong ever since, moving the restaurant operation to Royalton Road near Broadview and running a party center in the Seven Hills spot before converting it back into a sit down restaurant.

The food is classic Italian with a broad selection of sandwiches, salads, pastas and beef, chicken and seafood entrees. The decor is contemporary; well lit and comfortable with white paper on the tables. The Italian soundtrack was your standard \"Frank and Dino\" sort of thing, probably a little on the loud side but the restaurant had only two parties dining when we came in.

At the time of this review, there is a \"Like us on Facebook\" special plus an online coupon that was very lucrative for our party of five - the \"Like\" special resulted in a free order of Bruschetta; the coupon resulted in two free pizzas for the table since we were a party of five.

The bruschetta was big; 16-20 total pieces of perfectly toasted bruschetta topped with a very fresh tasting tomato, celery and basil topping dressed in a tangy sort of vinaigrette with a balsamic drizzle. The Pizzas were small appetizer pizzas, with white sauce and roasted chicken and artichoke hearts. They were also accompanied by diced tomatoes dressed with a vinaigrette on greens. 

The potato soup and the sausage soup were amazing. The potato soup was slightly cheesy, creamy and earthy. The sausage soup was spicy and meaty. One of our party had the Bistro Salad which was a large dinner salad with roasted chicken. She enjoyed it and the vinaigrette it came with - the portion was very large. The order of kid's spaghetti and meatballs was declared delicious and completely finished. We also brought home most of a Pollo Pesto pizza; feta cheese and chicken and artichoke hearts with pesto on a light crust, an excellent pizza but there was so much food we couldn't finish.

We also ordered spaghetti carbonara which was very good, and the smothered chicken came with gnocchi and red sauce - perfectly fork tender gnocchi, sweet but savory sauce - it was very good. And the chicken was delicious also; pounded and seared, then smothered in cheese, mushroom, mustard sauce and bacon. Too much to finish.

There was no dessert; we didn't have a chance after all the food we ate let alone what we brought home.

All in all, a good dinner and the service was pretty good as well. Our waiter was knowledgeable and generally prompt and we didn't feel like we waited for our food. We enjoyed everything about our visit to D'Agnese's Bistro in Seven Hills today and are likely to return.

Wed - Sat they are open til 10 PM
Sundays they close at 6."}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to eat at D'Agnese's one night when I was in Akron.  I am alway in search of good Italian food and there are some good places to eat in this part of Ohio.

I started with a bowl of Italian Wedding Soup.  I thought it had a nice flavor with only a few meatballs.  There was a little pastina pasta but not a lot.  It was good but not great.  

I had a house salad with the house dressing as my next course.  The salad greens were firm and fresh.  I liked that it was not an iceberg lettuce salad that some places pass off.  The salad had fresh mozzarella which was very firm and lacking flavor.  The dressing was not much to talk about as well.

My main course was a sautéed calamari dish with Kalamata olives over fettuccine in a spicy marinara. This is the main reason why I give this restaurant a  four-star rating. The calamari was cooked perfectly, not over cooked like many places serve.  The fettuccine was cooked al-dente.  The sauce had pieces of stewed tomatoes in it.  It was a yummy dish.

The service was good and my waiter mad sure my water glass was full.  The maître d' was friendly and seated me right away.  It was helpful that the restaurant was not busy.  I would recommend this place for people looking for good Italian food."}
{"text":"We were looking for an Italian restaurant in seven hills and noticed the five star reviews. We know why. Off the main road with a nice view of trees, clean and quiet, with nice music playing- jazzy favorites ! Frank Sinatra is always a good thing. Our waiter was pleasant, friendly, accommodating and made sure our meals came out in a timely fashion. The bread was warm and flavorful and came with an herb butter and seasoned oil.The salad  was crisp and flavorful and the crab cakes were wonderful. The shrimp and spaghetti sauce were SO flavorful. The veal was tender and pizza was fantastic. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just was here for our work Christmas party (yes, in January) and they were absolutely wonderful. This was my first time here and everything was fabulous. They were very accommodating and pleasant. I'll have to check them out during regular hours :)"}
{"text":"Being from the East side, I don't often make my way out to the Broadview Heights area; however, after reading about this place courtesy of a Plain Dealer review by well known local restaurant critic Joe Crea, I was convinced that I had to try it!  The interior of the restaurant presents a calm, dimly lit ambiance that highlights the classy setting of this gem.  As I was alone, I took a seat at the bar and was promptly attended to by the alert female bartender whose name I can't recall.  As the menu was replete with excellent choices that range from pasta to seafood and everything in between, I decided to go the distance.  I ordered the minestrone, a mixed greens salad with pecans and strawberries, and the stuffed Salmon with a side of pasta marinara.  The minestrone was a tomato based broth and was excellent!  The salad was a half-portion with a house vinaigrette dressing that captured the savory blend of the greens, strawberries, and pecans. Bread is included with every entrée and it comes with a green olive drizzle on a small plate for dipping!  When my entrée arrived it was expertly presented in a sizable portion with a small plate of pasta.  The fish was cooked perfect with just the right amount of redness and the crab topping was simply decedent!  As for the pasta, it was as good as it gets and could easily serve as a meal by itself in a slightly larger portion.  In total, my bill came to $32.45, which was excellent considering the volume and quality of the food.  If you haven't been to this place then make the drive and check it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a little confused.....is this a restaurant or a party center.   Didn't dare to enter on a saturday evening with only one car parked outside. 
The online menu seems more impressive that the actual place.  If only I had virtually tasted something to add more stars:-(
drove 20+ miles based on the ratings on yelp!! Hoping to have a great dinner in a restaurant.... Not a party center!!!
PS: probably the catered food is good. But this is no traditional restaurant"}
{"text":"Just got back from D'Agnese's Other Place American Bistro, Bar and Party Center. This place just opened in the former D'Agnese's Restaurant space tucked back off Broadview Rd. I was impressed with the space, nice and bright and open, bar on one side with the main dining room taking up most of the space. I had an appetizer order of mussels and they were delisious! The broth was not too heavy on the garlic or lemon. Well balanced with a bit of tomato and fresh basil. It is a pound of mussels! I am a big guy, but this was substantial enough that I did not get the sandwich I had planned on ordering - will have to revisit for that! I also had the Chocolate Fallen cake which was hot and served with whipped cream and blueberries. Very good! I took home a bacon cheddar and onion crisp burger with fries for my brother, who pronounced it, \"Excellent!\" All around a great fist experience and I look forward to going back and sampling the eclectic menu. By all means give this place a try!

Well done Brian and Sarah!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Italian food!!! Amazing staff and great service. Beautiful restaurant. Gnocchi just so good risotto best we ever ate. This is going to sound crazy but even the water was great !"}
{"text":"Great Food & Outstanding Service!!! Having been to the other location I know the food is good but the service at the other 82 location wasn't bad but wasn't overly outstanding like at this one! They went above and beyond to make sure everything I my parties dining experience was perfect! Plus the amazing food an perfect wait time made our visit spectacular."}
{"text":"Fabulous food with a great atmosphere! Sometimes they have live music. Our favorite spot. We LOVE this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. I was greeted with a smile. Served promptly, and the food is awesome. I am so glad they reopened in seven hills. 
Love this place"}
{"text":"D Agnese's Other Place just opened in the same spot that was previously occupied by the original D Agnese's Restaurant.  I have already enjoyed dining there a few times since they opened almost 2 weeks ago.  This restaurant is more casual than the original one. I have already tried: Veggie Pizza, Steak, Grilled Cheese and Spaghetti and Meatballs and all meals were great.  The atmosphere is very inviting too.  I highly recommend it and I am already a regular there.  ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow for it being a Tuesday evening. We had to wait for our service for almost 20 mins to bring us a check. However despite the slow service the food was delicious. Very large portions and decent prices. Just focus on improving service and this place will be stellar."}
{"text":"D'Agnese's is a delight to have at an affordable price.  Its not often enough I get to write such reviews for such wondeful places. You can read my entire review but let me sum it up quickly

Bountiful Poritions, Excellent Service, and awesome atmosphere at an affordable price.

My wonderful GF & I visitd this site a few weeks back after always seeing how busy it is (compared to the competitor directly accross the street) and wondeful smell when driving by.

As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by pleasant staff who asked us if we had reservations.  We said yes and were promptly taken to our seats.

The menu is big....good selection, Many choices and the hostess also briefed us on the nights special plates.

After examining the menu, both agreeing there is a great selection, we chose to go all out.  Prices seemed great but we werent sure how the portions were going to be, and let me tell you....they were plenty, especially for 2 people who had litterally not eaten all day.  

We started off with soup and appetizers....Italian Wedding & Tomato Basil.  I had the Italian wedding and it was quite tasty....mildly oily but nonetheless good tasting and good porition.  My date was quite pleased with her tomato basil and i too agreeed that the blend of essence of tomato and basil is my mouth was soothing.  

Our appetizers came out with our bottle of Red Wine...which I think was a Zinfindel.....

I ordered stufffed italian sausage peppers and my girl recieved crab cakes.

With these kinds of appetizers, the portions are usually very small and kinda poor quality....not the case here

2 butterflied full size hot peppers overflowing with sausage atop a light tomato sauce marinade.  PERFECTION.  

The Crab cakes were good....but I think the sausage overshined them.  She agreed.

Our dinner plates were Veal Saltimbocca & Pan Seared Scallops with risotto.

The veal was greeat.  Amazing portion of veal.  scallops perfection.

i forget what the sides were but it was de-lish!

there of course was some table bread in there as well with an olive tapanade type thing (sp?) that was exquisite.

the aromas in the air, the tastes of ALL th food, the crispness of the wine.  mmmmmmmm amazing!

We shared Crem Bruleee for dessert and it was the perfect way to end the dining experience.

Highly recommend this place, call for reservations if you can, ALWAYS busy

As a note, I am Italian and I judge Italian food the toughest...not a big fan of chains.....this place does it right!"}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala was FABULOUS! Service was a little slow at lunch, but the salad, bread and entree was worth the wait."}
{"text":"The service was fine. Food was terrible. Over sauced, over done. To much salt, garlic, oil and cheese on everything. Oh, and not a place to celebrate birthdays."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have had in my whole dinner life

I ordered crab stuffed mushroom. That fake crab was very low quality that had really strange taste and they should have described as fake crab instead of crab. And I also ordered spicy seafood pasta.

Because, I like pasta, seafood and spicy. Calamari was too dried I couldn't eat and mussel got too much fish smell I was afraid to eat pasta because I can't afford sickness.

I decided not to eat and asked a check. Surprisingly, they charge me the pasta clearly I home eat and didn't want to take to home"}
{"text":"I placed an order on a pizza for pickup.  They told me twenty minutes.  So, I arrive as they suggested, and the pizza was not ready.  The restaurant was not really that busy.  I waited another twenty minutes, and still no pizza.  At that point I left.

TL;DR This is just another poorly managed Italian restaurant in the Southern Suburbs.  The food might be good at times, but the building is a dump and the service is clueless."}
