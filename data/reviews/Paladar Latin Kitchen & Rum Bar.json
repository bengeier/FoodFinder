{"text":"Visiting a good friend in Solon and we zipped over for girls Friday night. Super happy! Sat in bar area- had great wine and a tasty meal. I would definitely recommend this place for a good social spot to grab some good food in a cool atmosphere BTW- salmon is excellent. And Guacamole is pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite part were the mojitos. It was Friday night so I tried 3 flavors! ;) vegan selection was reasonable! I really enjoyed the sweet potato tacos and hearts of palm salad, but I was more impressed by the mojitos. The ambience was very nice but felt a little too commercial upscale dining, whereas I prefer more unique, never-been before, but can still be accepted in my yoga pants."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for lunch. Wanted a hamburger, but didn't want to go to B spot, so headed to Paladar instead.    When here, you have to try the guacamole. We shared the traditional, but if you are with a large group, order the sampler of guac. Yum! The avocado is fresh. It's smooth with a nice kick of onion and tomato. It's served with assorted chips: tortilla, banana and taro?   I ordered my hamburger made with avocado and fried onions. Side of sweet potato fries. Nice combo. The ketchup also had a nice kick...maybe mixed with some sort of hot sauce?!  My friend tried the Tilapia, which was moist and fresh! Came with a side of green beans with a nice crunch. He finished his whole meal, which is always a good sign!   This was not my first visit here. I have probably been here more then a handful of times and most if not every time, I enjoyed my meal. The price is debatable, but the portions are large.   If the weather is nice, enjoy your meal out on their patio!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a work lunch. The MOJO pork was amazing.  My coworker said her soup and sandwhich was very good.   If I am in the area, I will definitely stop again"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times were good.  The salsa trio is tasty.  Menu features seasonal selections as well as mainstays.  Great tacos!  Some of the best in Cleveland. The Argentinian platter is a plethora of meaty goodness.  If you like meat and are famished go with this."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Hate that I always have to make a reservation to eat there, but other than that, great place."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding.  Food, drink, simply everything.  I am in a different city/state every week. Makes me wish I was in town more than just the week.  I could definitely make this a habit.  Even a second home.  Ask for Andrei - he'll walk you thru the menu and the rums.  Ask for the Ron Zacapa rum and you'll never leave.  Multiple thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. We keep coming back! The happy hour is really good, excellent drink specials and food specials. The tacos are delicious, really fresh and lively ingredients. I'm not one for cocktails (I love my bourbon) but I will make an exception for their mojitos!  Please try the guacamole and chips... Not your every day chips either! It's a mix with yucca, beets, sweet potatoes, etc... All crispy and with their own unique taste. Service has always been really quick and attentive as well! Haven't gotten an entree we didn't like either!"}
{"text":"Usually I will go in depth on a review but I was really underwhelmed with this place. The drinks were really good, but the food was just meh..... Had chorizo queso dip, portobello empanadas, rum glazed pork, churros & donuts with dipping sauces. I wanted to like it, but I didn't. The flavors of the food seemed to run together into one bland taste."}
{"text":"Times have changed.  My wife and I used to visit Paladar all the time, but then we moved out of Cleveland about a year ago.  We were back in town to visit family and were very excited to have lunch there while back in town.  Big disappointment.  I have really missed the Ropa Vieja but what I had today was not nearly as good as about a year ago.  It used to have so much flavor, but today it was pretty bland and uninteresting.  It also looks like their guacamole station is just for show now because the guac we ordered came from the kitchen and was brown on top, so it had clearly been sitting (we had a late lunch, so who knowns how long ago they made it).  Plus, it was ok, chipotle does have better though, and it is green there though probably not fresh.  The plantains were still delicious and the tacos were pretty good, but not what they used to be.  Lastly, we had not been there in a while but we had an old punch card for a free lunch.  Since we left they stopped using punch cards but the waiter let us use it anyway, we thought.  But first he brought the check without taking it off, then he brought it back with only the guac taken off, no explanation.  We looked through all the literature they include with the bill and figured out that now they don't give you a free lunch for being a regular, with a punched card, only a small order of guacamole. Oh well, we moved, but we definitely aren't going to rush back.  If you haven't been in a while listen to this post and the other posts on yelp that agree that things aren't as good as they used to be, and the customer service is a little spotty."}
{"text":"To start my hotel front desk recommended this place out of all these restaurants in the area. Upscale atmosphere and great food. Bartender Will is awesome. Really took great care of me especially when they were so busy. Took time to explain the menu and drinks.   They have a happy hour from 4-7 with good drink specials and discounted food. Only at the bar area.    Drinks- mojito was awesome. Really fresh tasting. The margaritas made in house so not going to get that heart burn from the pre-mix stuff.   Overall: really impressed. Would definitely come back. Wish they had a location in Atlanta."}
{"text":"I love Paladar! I've tried many things on their menu & have not been disappointed by any of them.  They also, of course, have delicious drinks as this is what they seem to be known for.  They have 3 types of guac and 3 types of salsas, and you can roder all 3 in a sampler appetizer which is nice, especially if you are new to the place and are not sure what to try.  They do happy hour pricing but PLEASE NOTE that this only applies if you are sitting AT the bar.  Thsi was not brought to my attention and one night when I dined during happy hour, I was nto given the happy hour pricing because I was at a table.  The bar is not very big so I imagine that you have to be there as soon as happy hour starts to get in on the action."}
{"text":"The best place in the city for food and atmosphere. Get the Guacamole and the fish tacos. Any mojito you get you will love."}
{"text":"Okay, I am not by an means an expert on latin foods or Latin Culture. In fact, I am as white bread as you can get. I love spicy foods, and enjoy many different flavors, but I had never had latin food before. So, this may be infact latin fusion, I don't know and frankly, I don't care either. What I can say is YUM. This food was delicious and I ment to write a review earlier (three months ago) but I guess I have still been fantisizing about my meal every sense.  Here I am, my wife, my father-in-law and I, on a very rainy day (Cleveland, go figure). We made reservations for 6:30 ( I think), which was definitley a good hour to go, if you want to be seated reasonably close to the time of your reservation and be able to have good conversation. As the night moved on the place became louder and louder with more customers clammering and raising their voice to be heard. The decore for me is hard to explain, I would not call it latin or even latin influence, but it was modern, and cool (or if you want hip) the seats were comfortable and there was plenty of space so that you did not have to crow around the tables fearing that you would be bummped my the wait staff or the table next to you. We started out with drinks both my wife and my father-in-law ordered, the mojiots (one orginial and the other pineapple) while I ordered a single barrel rum. Here, again, I am no expert, but I truely savored the warmth and flavor of my drink, I would order it again if I could just remember which one it was. I tried each of the mojitos and they were - predicable; not in a bad way, it's just that I knew what they would taste like before I even took a sip.  Next, we had ordered the chips with the spicy gaucamole and salsa there were not enough chips and the the poritions of gaucamole and dipping sauce were small for the price (which was probably my only complaint). The chips were a mixture of Plantain, Yucca, Malanga & Tortilla. Can you say delicious? They were good and I would order it again and again.  Then, the main event...my wife ordered (If I remember correctly) the rum smoked mahi mahi tiny tacos, my father-in-law orderd the same, I think. I was however, a little bit more adventurous, I ordered the roasted half chicken mole. The wait was a little long for my liking, but that was just because I was excited to be trying something new.  The food came, the presentaion was very well done and my first thought was to photograph it, however, my hunger got the better of me and I choose not to play with my food and just eat it. That was the best choice as it turns out. The flavors were unique and the sweet and the spicy bleneded beautiflully together which just made me take each bite one slowly and one carefully. I was truly please by my reward for being so adventurous. I have had lots of food in my life time, but I have to say this was one of the most memorable meals, not just because of the company or the location, but the total flavor experience. I did take a very short break from my own meal just to induldge in a taste of the tacos. Here again, I was pleasantly surprises, one becuase I really don't care for fish anything and two becuase the overall flavor was so different too me.  After a meal like that I did not want the fun to end so we ordered the dessert. *GRIN* I still remember my dessert. We ordered the Churros and cheese cake. Of course we ordered coffee to wash everything down. Of these two desserts I loved the churros. There were four or five sticks fried dough tossed in cinnamon & sugar which were accompanied by two dipping sauces dark mexican chocolate & marshmallow. I did not NEED the sauce, but I enjoyed them just the same. As for the cheesecake it was flavorful, dense and bit too moist for my liking. I am a lover of the classic cheesecake which in my opinion is not too dense and dry. So dry that your mouth makes the same kind of smacking sounds as when you eat peanutbutter all by itself. That being said,I would not turn it away, it was still a good choice.   Bottom line - from start to finish a very well executed meal, very flavorful and overall pleasing to the senses. I would do it again and again, if I had that kind of money. Paladar is not cheap, so save your money and come when you can truly have the freedoom of ordering whatever you want without worring about your wallet. (If you have the means, then please adopt my wife and me, so that we can enjoy more meals here and place like it, thanks). The ambiance was wonderful ( I especially with the wall that changes colors), the service was good, although a smidge slow, but that may have been due to the crowd that this place draws in.  No doubt in my mind, I would recommend this to everyone and anyone willing to listen. I hope this place does well for years and I hope they continue to update the menu options so I can try more stuff. This place deserves high ratings as long as it remains the way I expeirenced it.  Go! Now! this place is a dimond in the rough."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!  My family chose this place to celebrate my sister's birthday, and I was really impressed.  Every time I am in the area I try to go back there.  ***SERVICE/ATTITUDE = Good Staff:  ***DRINKS = Amazing! ***FOOD = I want to eat my way down the menu!:  I love the mixed corn, plantain and and yucca chips that are served with the fresh guacamole!  The spicy guac is not very spicy but, but it is very fresh.  I recommend the Jalapeno Lamb Stew.  Very savory and not too spicy.  The Hearts of Palm Salad is also good if you are going for something lighter. ***DECOR = Classy.  Great date spot: Ok, so this place's one saving grace was the décor. The interior has a very unique feel with a lucha libre X day of the dead theme. I really liked it. The bar was beautiful with a backlit wine rack and irregularly shaped hide light fixtures. One of the main art pieces involved several crosses carved into wood and some cut out and back lit. It was very interesting and visually appealing."}
{"text":"Luv the lunch specials. Great atmosphere and I had excellent service. The mojito was really good!"}
{"text":"Good For:   - Happy hour with friends for mojitos, guacamole & chips outside on the patio or inside.  The only issue is that if you want the special you have to sit in the bar area, which can get a bit crowded. - Lively dinner  Bad For:  - Quiet dinner, this place can get a little noisy and not a lot of privacy/space."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant. Great ambience and food. Gaucumole is very fresh and served with array of different chips. Entrees were also great-rum flavored pork over rice and black beans was very flavorful. Have to get the donut dessert to cap off the meal-served with a dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Paladar in almost 2 years but stopped in this past weekend with 2 others who hadn't been there before.  The food was even better than I remember (perhaps a new chef?) and our server was very friendly and attentive.  I asked her about the ropa vieja appetizer and she gave it a strong recommendation.  And she wasn't wrong.  It was amazing!  I'll definitely be back (I work in the neighborhood) and will order it again!  The only thing preventing this from being a 5-Star Review was my cocktail.  I asked if I could have a weak Cuba Libre (half the amount of rum) and our server looked confused.  When I told her it was because I was driving, she assured me that they don't make overly strong drinks and that a normal Cuba Libra would be fine, so that's what I ordered.  I'm not a lightweight when it comes to alcohol but this drink was WAY too strong.  If I wasn't driving I wouldn't have minded, but I specifically said I didn't want a strong drink, so I only drank half.  I should have insisted on my original order or stayed with water.  But the food was great, my companions LOVED their drinks and we all had a great afternoon."}
{"text":"Met Thanksgiving visitors at Paladar last evening. While we were originally just talking happy hour, one look at the menu and we grabbed a table in the dining room. Glad we did. Service was excellent and we weren't rushed at all. Even as the contemporary and well designed room grew more crowded.   My fish soft tacos were very good. Nice pieces of fried fish complimented by zesty slaw of some sort. A squeeze of fresh lime and I was set. Rice and black beans were so-so. A bit of fresh cilantro would have helped.   One of the diners raved about the skirt steak and it was voted dish of the table. Scallops got thumbs up. Only thing rated avg was the pulled pork. Two diners said it was \"ok\" but \"lacked flavor\".  We'll return when the patio's open...."}
{"text":"The food is so good! I have never gotten something I didn't love! Tacos, the best I've had in Cleveland. Dessert was so good too! Cool atmosphere. Best mojitos!"}
{"text":"If you call yourself a Latin restaurant and can't make good rice and beans are you really a Latin American restaurant?  The rice and beans are terrible. Everything else is just all right.   And Everytime you go there the wait says how it's the best gauc in town. Its not. Not even close. Not even that good."}
{"text":"We tried Paladar for the first time today. We went during brunch hours. Service was fast and friendly. I enjoyed the Mango Sangria and my husband liked the long Island iced tea as well. We started with the mushroom empanadas which were good though I definitely would have enjoyed them more had they been a little warmer (still good nonetheless, just personal preference.) I chose the chorizo and cheese pupusa platter but I asked for frijoles and rice instead of grits. It was very tasty! My husband had the rum glazed pork dish with coconut mango rice and loved it. I tried his and also loved the yummy pork. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"HI Scott,  I greatly appreciate that Paladar and you make the effort and care about the quality of your patrons experience. I am sure that sometimes things just end up less idea then anticipated and I will make sure that I come back to Paladar since it used to be my go to place. I am excited to try some of your new vegan options as well. I applaud you for having a very comprehensive and easy to read menu that includes vegan, veg and GF options. Definitely a step in the right direction. Thank you again for writing back."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for the first time as a recommendation of a friend. Im a vegetarian so it was nice to have options on things to eat. I ordered the guacamole trio and absolutely loved it. I got a good variety of flavor and left full. My server was Michael and he was supposedly in training but seemed like he was one of the crew and knew his stuff. kept us laughing and added to the good environment. Definitely a place to try out if you want fresh food, good service, and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Service and the make your own guac is the best!"}
{"text":"Came in with high expectations based on all the great reviews, and the fact that this place was on a lot of \"Cleveland musts\" lists. Had a good time and an ok meal, but not worthy the hype.  Service was fine, our waitress was very attentive and kept us updated on our order status.  We went during their \"Carnaval\" specials so we ordered one of the $5 dollar street food options, the cheesy bread bites, which were very, very delicious, but small and only getting 5 for $5 seemed a little ridiculous to us. The guacamole and chips we ordered were bland and the mango salsa tasted like canned mango chunks.  For main courses, I ordered the Mango chicken salad which was HUGE, it could have served like 4 people (not complaining about getting a lot of food!) but didn't wow me. The boyfriend loved his fish tacos though, I wish I had ordered them.  Overall a nice time but probably wouldn't pay that much for food that was just meh."}
{"text":"Paladar has a great selection for those with dietary restrictions (vegan, veg especially) - and not just the usual \"we have salad\".  The sweet potato tacos are fantastic! The mojitos are great too (and vegan as well) :-)"}
{"text":"Great service with your original server. Great food and portion size. Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic service was great had an excellent  time with our family and our server was very very friendly thank you so much for a great experience. Must try the bread pudding. !!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food was virtually tasteless. Our entire party found ourselves putting salt on everything. The ceviche was severely disappointing, no lime, no salt, and no cilantro- the basic elements of ceviche. The kid's food was by far better than ours. The empanadas were undercooked and understuffed and the guacamole- another huge let-down. Please take these complaints into consideration for future customers. Thank you."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a blast. The bartenders were fun, and gave us some great recommendations off the menu. We shared guac and a ceviche both of which were really good. Also had tacos and empanadas, both great. The drinks are worth a trip there on their own, if your just thirsty for some S. American style boozing."}
{"text":"Excellent Latin Food. The choices are many.  We come from S. Florida where we have an abundance of Latin Restaurants and this one was very good .  The service was outstanding. The weather was gorgeous and and people could enjoy sitting outside on the patio. You should have a reservation,  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing cuban sandwich. For $15, I'd expect the sandwich to have more than a few strands of pulled pork. Instead, I got a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. Atmosphere was good. and mojitos were good. Portions were very large for lunch, which I also found unnecessary."}
{"text":"I never would never even try guacamole until I tried it here. I love it with the yucca chips and plantain chips and also the tortilla chips."}
{"text":"We decided to try the fish tacos and the chorizo pupusa. It was just okay. The chorizo pupusa not quite sure how that was listed as a favorite. It was just bland, tough and spicy. The fish tacos were a little better but again nothing that you haven't tried elsewhere. This place has a beautiful outdoor patio and a nice looking seating area inside as long as you don't sit by the bar. It's rather odd that that area which is the first you walk in and see seems pretty dirty. And not sure why all the clutter in the hallway towards the bathroom."}
{"text":"Ok, I have eaten here many times and it's always been good. Went there recently with my wife. I'll make it short, great food, terrible service. We were greeted by our server Marisol, she took our drink order and left us to ponder the menu. She returned quickly with our drinks and we proceeded to order our appetizer and entrée. our appetizer came out quickly and was brought to us by a runner, but by this time we needed more drinks but Marisol was  no where to be found so we start eating our appetizer with no drinks and we are only about half way into it when another runner arrives with our entrees and puts them down on our tiny already overcrowded table. 15 minutes has gone by and still, no server. WTF Paladar?? Finally Marisol arrives and I let her know we are not happy, she half heartedly apologizes saying, \"yeah, I guess the entrée came out too soon\"  Oh you think?? She then copped an attitude for the rest of the meal. Food was great though, but still, don't hire incompetent servers."}
{"text":"Excellent Latin food, flavorful and great service. Best fresh tasting guacamole I have ever had in a restaurant. Great prices at happy hour 4-7, and $5 mojitos. They are made fresh with real fruit!"}
{"text":"A friend and I frequent here about once a month. I think we will find some other place in Chagrin to go after our last service experience.  The food in general, is very good. I received a coupon for an order of free guac, which let us try the chef's inspiration of the day and was very tasty. Our food was delicious. I received the mussels and my friend got the empanadas and mango iced tea.  However, our service was AWFUL! There was no greeting, no hello, no nothing. A waitress who started her sentence that was directed to us, at another table. By the time she reached our table ... the only word we heard from her was \"water.\" We both looked at each other and said yes. The server disappeared so fast there was no time to ask about specials, questions we had on the menu etc...  Unfortunately, this kept happening. Our waters were never refilled, our server never checked on us until she wanted to give us a dessert menu towards the end. Being that the mussels were spicy, I could have used more water.  The food runner who brought us our plates was much more pleasant to deal with. He smiled, greeted us, asked us if our food looked okay and graciously brought us water.  This is where I nearly lost it. Instead of asking if we would like separate checks or if we were even ready for the check she just plopped a check down in front of me and scampered off. I had to wait for her to come back and told her we needed these split and to put the guac on my bill. She paid no attention. She ran off once i said the word \"split\" and walked away so quickly I was still in the middle of my sentence when she was already by the computer.  We get the check back and the guac is split on both checks. Before we even get a chance to open them she was gone again. I had to then again, WAIT for her to come back and told her the check was not right and I wanted the guac on my bill.  No apology, no nothing. instead she said \"  I didn't hear you.\"  I even explained that if she didn't walk away so quickly, I would of been able to finish my sentence.\"    Third times a charm? I think not... we get our checks... the guac is gone completely off our checks and now I have a drink on my check that I didn't order.... Really? I drank water!  Again, the same process back and forth. To say the least, I was more than ready to leave and although it's my friends favorite spot in the area, due to the poor service and all the frustrations we will eat at Taza or Pacific East instead.  Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"Happened upon this restaurant after a long day. It had a cool but comfortable and inviting vibe so wandered in and gave it a try.  Started out with a Clementine Mojito (hold the mint) which was garnished with oranges and limes and a sugar cane stick. It was really good and it was great fun to chew on the sugar cane stick after. We ordered a small bowl of traditional guacamole which was delicious and fresh and enjoyed the unique mixture of root vegetable (as well as tortilla) chips. On the recommendation of our charming waiter, I think his name was Amin, I ordered the Slow Smoke Pulled Chicken. It was Excellent. It was moist tender pulled apart chicken over a yellow saffron rice (with small amounts of chopped white onion and thin jalapeño slices) and chubby slices of fried and caramelized plantains on the side. There was a slight drizzle of tangy sauce as decoration too, very nice. The combination of the chicken, plantains and rice with the decorative drizzle was fantastic! What a great meal after a challenging day."}
{"text":"Each visit we start out with an order of Traditional Guacamole.  Its made to order so you can choose between Traditional, Spicy or Mango. The dip was fresh as were the chips which were a blend of malanga, plantain, yucca and corn chips.  Outstanding.  My two favorites are the Paladar Blackened Fish Tacos (Wild Corvina, pickled onion and pineapple slaw, cilantro aioli)  the Slow Roasted Mojo Pork (Cilantro rice, black beans, corn salsa).    In general, this is a refreshing changed from the same old traditional menus.  Service is consistently good as is the quality of the food."}
{"text":"If you are Latin American and expect to find our authentic cuisine, well this is not it.  It peripherally touches our flavors but it really misses the point. Soggy tostones? Huancaína sauce without aji or queso fresco? Caipirinhas that taste like lemonade made with old limes? May be a hit with the locals, but not with the natives."}
{"text":"Just OK ... Chips & blue-cheese guacamole we're very good...fish tacos were also good ... Pork tacos were not so good. The pork was mushy and bland...rice & black beans were also bland. Service was OK, but water never got refilled. Server who delivered food could have been a robot given his limited interaction w/ customers. Not really anything that would draw us back to this restaurant, especially given the number of very good restaurants in this and nearby areas."}
{"text":"Sooo...yeah went there on Fathers Day with a reservation and could not enjoy the food.  It started with the table next to us which gave me an uh oh feeling as they were unhapppy with their order. It was something about pancakes being wrong and sauce being spoiled. However I pressed on even when sending two silverware and napkins back bc it had lipstick and food stuck on them.  We wait...server comes to tell us we were seated at a private table party and we had to move...but you will be compensated..she says. So we move...and wait..and wait..almost two hrs meanwhile the ppl around us were complaining about food, getting a check, service, etc.  I'm hungry!! And looking for other spots in the area!  Manager comes..aplogizes. Food...comes finally.  You ever been somewhere and you can' t even digest your food properly bc you mad and hungry at the same time? Me either.  It is a different experience.  At the end of the day we were comped and Dad was given a gift card.  Thanks Paladar but uhhhh..."}
{"text":"Wow!! I came here on a recommendation from a fellow hotel guest- the food and drinks were AMAZING!! I'm dieting, so my waiter recommended several lower calorie options and I chose the blackened tilapia tacos sans rice and beans- got kale instead. Delicious!! Got here just in time for happy hour and was se to enjoy a mojito and some spicy guacamole with the most amazing yuca a taro chips!! I'LL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and I am definitely a fan. They have a great happy hour at the bar, and the brunch is fantastic (hello, bottomless mimosas!). I have made meals out of their appetizers/small plates, and the rum glazed pork is phenom. The tacos are delicious as well, along with the made-to-order guac with its array of chip options. The service is always on point and the atmosphere is fun and energetic. I appreciate how diverse and large the menu is. There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Donuts. Enough said...  These things were like little balls of joy in my mouth. That sounded nastier than I intended. Let's just go with awesome shall we? I also didn't intend to start the review with dessert but they were so good I pretty much forgot everything else.   I had the pork soft tacos for dinner and they were fantastic as well. I paired them with a mojito, margarita, and bourbon on the rocks. Don't judge me. The margarita was a little sweet for my taste but I'll give them a pass on that considering how great everything else was.   I would definitely suggest a trip to this latin kitchen..."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great drinks!  Great atmosphere!  Love the chips and guacamole and salsa!  The appetizers and chips almost make a meal!  Great happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers.  Best happy hour around...upbeat, fun vibe in the bar area as well.   And if you want the $5 appetizers to go, they'll serve them at your table then box them for take out.  Awesome!  I recently boxed up several guacamoles for book club.... For $10!!!  It's one place you can get feijoada and although it doesn't taste real authentic to the Brazilina dish, it is really good...with a little bit of kick!  I will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Food was great, I ordered the fish tacos. On my ride home I started to feel nauseous - threw up for 2 hours."}
{"text":"Very good Cuban food. Guacamole was excellent. Service was good. Not overcrowded, no wait. I will go back."}
{"text":"Paladar is one of my favorite places to go.  Yes, it is very expensive but you also know that ahead of time if you look at the menu.  Even though it's one of my top places to go, I'm only giving it they 4 stars instead of 5 because they need to make the drinks a little bigger for how much you pay.  $10 drinks still come in the small scotch type glass even when you ask for a tall.  I like to get big margaritas and they come in the same glass, no matter what type you order.  That still doesn't sway my husband and I from loving this place!  Latin food that's so good, (like the various types of chips, salsa and guac) amazing decor and ambiance, and the churros at the end of the meal (also now the sweet potato doughnuts) make any expense worth it!  We come here 2-3 times a year and live about 30 minutes away."}
{"text":"Demond, our waiter, was in Demand on the patio at Paladar last night, so service was slow but since the weather was great, it wasn't as much of an issue.  At the table were: Dark & Stormy, a man drink that could put hair on a girl's chest; and a Banana Colada - both excellent.  The chips could have been more plentiful, and a spoon in each of the three salsas would have been helpful.  Nitpicking.  Soft tacos in both the pulled pork and fish variety were amazing, as was the tortilla soup.  The Cezar salad had blah dressing, but the lettuce was fresh.  Definitely a popular choice in The Cleve and a nice change."}
{"text":"I really hate to write this update, because I had such a good experience the first time, but my visit to Paladar on 2/16 was just terrible.  I know it was the Saturday after Valentine's Day so the wait was going to be extraordinary.  But my boyfriend wanted to eat here, so even though our buzzer for B Spot went off, we turned it back in and waited here because the Hostess told us we were \"next.\"  Well, apparently \"next\" means 12th to her, because there were seriously at least 8 tables sat before us.  We waited another 30 minutes after she told us we were next.  She even told my boyfriend again that we were next while I was in the bathroom and then sat 2 more tables.  We were standing right there, it's not like we weren't going to notice.  That girl needs to be fired.  Just be honest with people.  If you told me it was going to be a while, I wouldn't have been enraged.  Altogether we waited more than 2 hours.    Once we were finally sat, our waiter, Ben, was awesome.  He was friendly and quick with everything.  Our drinks and guacamole were good.  We had the regular guacamole.  I would recommend the spicy because the regular is bland.  I guess that is because they make it fresh.  Fresh is great, but it doesn't allow any of the flavors to soak into the avocado which is part of what makes guacamole great, in my opinion.  Our main dishes arrived very quickly.  Too quickly for my chicken to have been put on the grill after I ordered, so I have to assume our server stole someone else's food to make sure ours came out as fast as possible.  If the food had been great this might have actually made up for the rest of the experience.  However, the rice on my dish (cilantro) and the rice on my boyfriend's were both gross.  The first time I ate here, the rice was one of the best parts of my dish; well-cooked and flavorful.  This time, both types of rice were wet and not thoroughly cooked (almost crunchy).  I can only assume that because they were so busy that they were running out of rice and quickly cooked more.  Rather than cook it til it was done, they threw it together to serve it.  It was not edible.  My chicken was bland, though the salsa made it better.  I did not have the heart to complain about my meal to my server because I know he was trying so hard, and there was really nothing he could have done or brought me to make it better.  Ben brought us free dessert as well, which was very nice.  It was some kind of sweet potato doughnut.  I am not a big dessert person but my boyfriend liked it.  Not sure if I will come back here just because of the way the food was cooked. I don't know how you could serve something cooked that poorly and have the balls to charge money for it.  If you are so busy that you can't turn out quality food, then close for the night.  Yeah, you'll make a couple extra grand tonight, and then those people will never come back to your establishment.  If our server hadn't been so awesome I would not have paid for that meal, and I almost never complain at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  Started with filthy appetizer plate on table.  Ropa Vieja came out ice cold.  Sent it back  and was replaced with a burned tasteless plate of bland and flavorless food.  I asked for manager and he came over and just stood there without asking what was wrong until I had to start the conversation.  Service timing was terrible as it is every time we give them another try."}
{"text":"I loved this place, the food was excellent! Nice atmosphere Amanda our waitress was flawless."}
{"text":"Headed out for the Friday after Thanksgiving dinner with friends.  We all had a round of drinks.  Most drank margaritas, I had wine - fruitier than I had hoped but my fault not theirs.  We shared the guacamole sampler - regular, hot and the special -  caramelized onion and balsamic.   I enjoyed the homemade plantain, yucca, malanga & tortilla chips - a different twist. My husband had the Rum Glazed pork - actually about five people chose that.  Tasted pretty good.  The coconut mango rice was good to taste, but I wouldn't have wanted a whole dish of it.  I had the scallops with roasted cauliflower & fingerling potatoes and a Huancaina sauce (some kind of mild cheese sauce).  I loved it.  Only complaint, it only came with three scallops and while they were \"jumbo\", the third was more like a \"medium\".   The waiter was pretty good.  Although he was annoyed if everyone wasn't listening to him when he spoke.  Now, I get it, I've waited tables before, it can be frustrating to serve a table of ten and have to repeat the specials.  BUT, it was our dinner not his.   The only other piece of information I will share is that it felt like one of those nicer dinner spots that turns into a cheesy club after dinner.  I've worked in them, so I'm familiar with the signs.  Music gets louder, they close off sections of the restaurant with dramatic black drapes, guys unbutton their shirt to reveal more chest etc...  It doesn't mean that dinner can't be great, it just means that at a certain time at night it may get more like West 6th for 40-year-olds."}
{"text":"Decent food though it did not seem particularly authentic or exotic and felt very much like a chain. Expected a little more for the mid-tier pricing.   Service was good. Location in the busy Eton mall is another negative in my book."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the area.  The food, atmosphere, and service are all great.  The menu has something for everyone, and everything is delicious.   Definitely try the pulled pork on mango-coconut rice, and the smoked butternut squash soup (if it's on the menu)."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The food ranges from flavorful but not spicy to very zesty Latin fare.   And the chips, salsa, and fresh guacamole are something you have to experience!"}
{"text":"Main course was very good.  I had pulled pork which is their specialty.  Desert was a disappointment.  Tress Leeches was very dense.  But they did take off the item from my bill when they heard my complain.  The waitress as well as the floor manager were excellent.  They came by to check on the food.  Nice decor.  Good crowd.  Good selection of rum.  Parking is tough.  This mall has many good restaurants as well as upscale stores.  So be patient."}
{"text":"Both times I have been here the food has been terrible or mediocre at best. It seems like the only thing good at Paladar is the drinks.  The basket of chips is the best part about the whole meal, however, most of the chips in the basket are overfried or stale. Plantain chips gets extremely hard when they are too thick/overcooked in the fryer. The yuca chips are good, but once again, most of them in our basket were stale. Finally, the corn chips at the bottom of the basket are worse than any brand I have purchased at the supermarket (very stale, almost rubbery, and tasteless). They probably leave their already served baskets on a counter for way too long.  The fire-roasted salsa - tastes like red italian sauce that belongs over pasta rather than on chips. It is sweet, slightly smoky, and lacks any cilantro flavor. I had to drench it in hot sauce to make it edible with chips.  The guacamole - as everyone else has said, tastes like homemade, not restaurant quality.  The ceviches - I don't expect to each good ceviche anywhere in Cleveland, but this one is so far out of the basics that it feels like I'm eating canned fruit on top of random fancy seafood. There is no pungent lime taste, which is the base for all ceviches. The selection of seafood in ceviches should never be fancy fish, like salmon, etc. It should always be a simple white or common crustacean. A strong fishy taste is needed to balance the strong taste of lime in a basic ceviche. Paladar's fancy ceviches taste like a cup of dole fruit - the seafood in them is nearly tasteless, and the critical lime flavor is replaced by pineapple or some other sweet fruit.  The desserts - The churros are not something that you should order. Carts in american streets have been churros than the ones served in Paladar.  I think next time someone invites me to come along, I will have to politely decline or convince them to go somewhere else.  At least the service is nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a number of times throughout the years. I've gone for dinner and happy hour. The guacamole and drinks (margaritas and mojitos) are pretty good. The servers are attentive. The entrees are just okay."}
{"text":"The perfect, swanky joint at which to be seen keeping up with the Joneses.  Paladar surrounds and embraces you from the moment you enter, as the host stand is a few feet back from the door -- requiring one to \"enter the scene\" even before they truly enter the scene. The place is busy, but in an \"alive\" sort of way.  The bar seems like a cool, comfortable place to chat and mingle, though I wouldn't really know. While crowd surfing and jumping and raising my hand to get a bartender's attention were routine in college, this place screams \"adult\"; if I have to leave the hoodie at home, they can too. Not sure how to rectify this -- but considering the space isn't all that tiny, I'd like to see an expanded bar area.  As there was no room in the bar area, we migrated to the restaurant -- clean, upscale, lively. The lighting was bright, but pleasant and strategically designed, contributing to the overall lively vibe. High ceilings enabled a great deal of this lighting design, while also contributing to the spacious feel of the restaurant floor.  Our group only had drinks and an appetizer or two. I had a Cuban Manhatten -- excellent, but overpriced...at upwards of $11. The food was tasty -- high quality, but again, slightly overpriced, IMHO.  All in all, this place is definitely worth a try. I'll even probably go back for a meal, at which point I may bump up to four stars. If you find something on the menu you love, more power to you! When I go out, however, I'm mostly concerned only with the quality of what's on my plate and/or in my glass. My overall impression was that too much of the atmosphere's aesthetics comprise a significant portion of the check. If you're into \"being seen\" however, this familiar, albeit veiled line item shouldn't discourage you in the least."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience!   Some of the food was just average, other items were spectacular and makes me want to go back and try more.  Service was excellent!  We ordered and shared the following item (they may not be the exact name on the menu):  Table side guacamole- Guac was average but the yucca chips served with it, make it different and worth ordering. Hearts of Palm Salad- We ordered the dressing on the side. However, the salad is so delicious neither one of us wanted it, even though it was equally as yummy. Colombian Seafood Stew- LOVED IT!  Truly flavorful. Again, we had the item split and we each had a good size serving.  Carne Asada Churrasco- The steak was grilled medium (as requested)  and the chimicurri sauce was to be expected.  The item was good, but not spectacular.  It also came with pinto beans, but I didn't try any because I don't like the texture of beans like that. However, the hubs really enjoyed them. Dulce de Leche cheesecake- I'd take a pass on this. The cheesecake was dry, rather than the luscious deliciousness it should be.  When the manager asked us how we liked the meal, we were honest--It was great, but the cheesecake disappointed.  He didn't have to, but was kind enough to remove it from the bill.  We will most definitely be coming back to try more.  Our server was gracious, attentive and not overbearing.  One of the better restaurants I've tried in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Saturday night have been many times before and never had a problem.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and dinner.  One of the water glasses was cracked and the waiter replaced it right away.  Two other tables were brought water glasses that were cracked.  We ordered the gazpacho soup and there was something wrong with the taste and had to send it back.  Ordered two Caribbean Chicken Mango salads one had chicken and the second did not.  The manager came over to apologize and said he was going to comp us desert.  When our bill came the deserts were on there.  We had to have the server fix the bill.  The waiter was a little slow to check on us throughout the meal.  Hope this was a one time problem."}
{"text":"Decided to try again after a few years for lunch  Got some tacos. They we're excellent and the appropriate price for lunch.  Very happy. Would return to this place.   Frankly, it's a decent place with a different menu from most and takes a good spin on the semi casual lunch.  Wife got the jale wrap and loved it, in fact she wanted to go back to the place the next day"}
{"text":"Amazing!  If the menu says \"foodie bucket list\" - order it!  Shrimp and grits on the weekend brunch menu - taste explosion!"}
{"text":"I think I've reviewed this place before, but I cannot brag enough about them. SO yummy!!  They do an amazing job of accommodating every wish and their food, service, quality.... are fantastic!!!  I think I'm craving a kale wrap...."}
{"text":"Good guac and chips. Sat at a high bar table smack against a giant column so my view was limited. Short rib empanadas were a good idea but a little too doughy for my liking. Gazpacho was too garlicky.  Service was inattentive at best. When they brought backthe special guac with heirloom tomatoes after first bringing me the plain version, waiter tried to explain that many of the tomatoes were green and couldn't be seen easily... Really?  Standard mojito was good. Sugar cane swizzle was a nice and sweet chewy touch."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our favorite restaurants.  This is one of our regular haunts, so we've had many of the many of the menu items.   All have been delicious.  My wife loves the Ropa Vieja with a side of plantains.  I'd say their Blackened Tilapia Tacos are the best fish tacos of anywhere I've eaten because the fish is grilled, not breaded & fried like everywhere else.  We love the variety of guac's they have ... and we love the mix of chips.  Portions are generous.    We've eaten on the patio, inside in each of the \"rooms\", and at the bar.  The service has always been attentive without being overbearing.    Over the years we have taken several friends, co-workers, and relatives to Paladar, and they have all loved the food and come back.  Always a good idea to make a reservation, especially for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights when they are busiest.    Only drawback has been the parking at Eton which isn't under Paladar's control.  Sometimes it's hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"I must have drove past Paladar hundreds of times,when going across the street to The Original Pancake House and in the plaza to Trader Joe's. It wasn't until a fellow yelper suggested it that I decided to give the restaurant a try and i'm sure glad I did. This has become one of my favorite restaurants. Everything i've tried here has been really good and the service is always great.   I've had the Crab & hearts of palm empanadas, Slow roasted chicken empanadas, Plantain crusted crab empanadas, The spicy guacamole, and the Slow smoke pulled chicken. The aoli sauce with the plantains is delicious blended with the smoked chicken.....How many places can you get a latin meal with a spin in Cleveland.   There are always specials, and they are always worth considering. If you sign up on their website you can get a free order of guac and If you go for brunch you can order bottomless mimosas, but the only one I found I liked is the strawberry.  Paladar is really nice, but isn't trend-chasing. It's crowded and lively, but isn't painfully overly loud and it's comfortable, but it won't coddle you. All in all Paladar is definitely a pleaser."}
{"text":"Paladar is a wonderful restaurant with a great atmosphere and delicious food. The server was friendly and knew quite a bit about the menu, and all of our food arrived quickly. My advice-end your meal with the sweet potato doughnuts. They were absolutely delicious, and came piping hot and freshly prepared. I highly recommend Paladar as a casual restaurant to spend a night. Just come hungry, the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Update after initial bad review. Management graciously provided a give us a second chance gift card. Had a nice brunch with my wife. No complaints at all. So, Paladar - you're still in the occasional brunch and maybe lunch conversation but probably not the dinner conversation. Thank you for making it right."}
{"text":"Broken Tooth; Restaurant Denies Help  UPDATE 11/14/17:  I received the check today for the cost of the dental repair. Thank you. -------------------------------------------  UPDATE: I received a phone call from another adjuster today who states that the claim amount is being mailed by check today. I will further update when the check arrives.  -------------------------------------------  I am a licensed doctor who does not believe in playing games or duping people.  On September 12th, 2017, I was eating ceviche at this restaurant and chipped a tooth on a hard object in the food. Another licensed doctor was my witness. The manager witnessed the piece of chipped tooth (which I still have in my possession) and took the incident report. The hard object must have been swallowed in the uncertainty of what was happening, and was not recovered.  I went to a dentist shortly after, and was informed that to correctly restore the tooth, a crown was necessary. I provided that estimate to Paladar's insurance representative.  Throughout the following weeks, I have developed progressive pain and inability to use my right mandibular teeth for masticating.  Today, two months later, I finally received a letter from Liberty Mutual denying any responsibility due to, \"sufficient information.\" I have offered to release the radiographs and photographs to the representative, and they have never been requested; tell me what \"sufficient information\" has been used to make this decision?  As a medical professional, if I am ever in a position that has my action, lack of action, neglect, or accidental harm as the cause of any injury, I would be forthright and accept responsibility. I would not leave someone in a situation of pain and discomfort and inability to properly repair an injured body part.  Paladar ownership, Pete the manager, and all persons involved in this claim should be ashamed of themselves for not stepping up and handling what is really a very small financial investment in taking care of an injured patron, extending goodwill, and maintaining a positive standing in current and potential patrons.   I am in pain. I'm in pain due to fracturing a tooth on something mixed in my ceviche. For what would really be a small financial investment compared to even daily intake at this restaurant, Paladar could make the right decision to do the right thing. Instead, they have denied my ability to become pain-free and resume the ability to eat normally.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"Very very pleased with my experience at Paladar. Great food stole the show on this one, and a fun atmosphere outside of Cleveland.  Had a wonderful lunch special of zucchini tacos, with a side of fried sweet plantains, and a side order of yuka fries. By far the yuka fries stole the show. Lightly salted and creamy on the inside crunchy on the outside, these puppies are usually served with a side sauce, but it isn't vegan. Same with the plantains, that are exactly how you'd expect: sweet, juicy, and tenderly fried to golden brown. The tacos (2 in an order) were perfectly sized for lunch and very filling. With a mix of corn, zucchini, black beans, and cabbage, they are very light. A squeeze of lime juice and they hit the spot. I'm sure they could have avocado slices or some jalepeños or even some chopped up plantain inside, but they wouldn't be as light and delicious as they are as is.  Portion sizes were great, price was average. Only complaint was wait time. Normally during lunch hours a 30-45 minute turnover would be appreciated and maybe even a little pressured. Here, we're living in southern time where it takes a little over an hour. Good for a relaxing lunch with a friend, but not for one with a coworker or client on a schedule. I'm sure if asked they could speed things up, but servers were very relaxed and not rushing at all. Just something to keep in mind, but neither an upside nor downside.  Thanks again to the staff! Best to the company!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was just my order or the obnoxious woman I was seated next to the last time I was here, but I was wrong to rate Paladar 2 stars. I've been back a few times in the last 6 months for lunch and I really do enjoy the food.  Not to mention in terms of value, you'd be hard pressed to find a better lunch for $10 with service as fine as this place."}
{"text":"Loved Stanley, aka Matt. The manager Courtney was great and the drinks and guacamole was to die for. So stop by if you have the time for a good time!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner at Paladar last night.  The atmosphere was relaxed and service was very good.  I had blackened fish tacos, delicious!  My wife had a pulled pork dish, which was great and our other companion had the lamb stew, which she loved.  We had hot sweet potato donuts for desert and the were terrific."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I am giving this place an overall review of 5 stars because I have been here for brunch, lunch and happy hour! Every experience at this restaurant I have had a fabulous waiter or waitress, which in my opinion can make or ruin the decision to return.  Brunch is definitely the meal that exceeded expectations! It is a must try brunch location!  Bottomless mimosas ($10) are available during brunch as well! Happy Hour is M-F, 4-7pm with $5 food options, $5 mojitos, margaritas and sangria."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but nice ambiance and good Latin food"}
{"text":"I like Paladar's rum.They recently changed the rum menu. The food is good. Sometimes a bit greasy. Their service is usually good."}
{"text":"OK, so as I mentioned previously, Paladar does happy hour perfectly. They even offer happy hour deals on the weekend! Unbelievable.  My new discovery here: brunch.   Over the summer, a couple of friends and I (we refer to ourselves as the brunch crew) had a hungover brunch out on the patio and it was absolutely amazing. The bottomless mimosa deal is actually a really good one, as long as you have 2+ mimosas...which how could you know try all 3 of the flavors? Strawberry, ginger pomegranate, and orange--they're all amazing, but the strawberry was fantastic and the ginger pomegranate is fantastic if you swirl that fresh ginger around and don't let it settle to the bottom of your drink.   The second time the brunch crew came for some fun, we had guacamole (inhaled immediately) and I went for a bloody mary--also very delicious! Not my favorite in town, but I had just overdone it on mimosas the previous weekend, so I had to mix it up. The best food item I've had from the brunch menu, though, was the pupusa. GET THAT.   I still haven't come for a nice sit-down dinner, but I honestly don't care. Brunch and happy hour are more than enough!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the food is great... When it's hot. Don't sit in the bar area because you'll get bad service and your food will come out luke-warm. I sent my food back 2 times. All they did was put it under the warmer. The manager lady was VERY nice and apologetic. It's just unfortunate that time service is lousy but the food is great."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken empanadas to go - they were absolutely delicious! Fresh veggies, crispy shells, and tender meat. You also get a bag of plantain and tortilla chips with the order - highly recommend, as they were well worth the reasonable price! Fair warning though: don't expect authentic empanadas. These are more of a fusion, zesty take on the originals."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bomb. The guacamole is made to order, and everything I've eaten seems like they put a lot of time into it, plus tons of fresh herbs. If you can, ask for Michael T. (Another server told me his name for this purpose.) He was friendly, informative, efficient, without ever being overbearing or too friendly. He was just awesome. Definitely one of the best servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and really enjoyed the happy hour menu. The drinks and the tacos were good, and it's a solid place to grab a quick bite to eat.   The shrimp ceviche we ordered from the happy hour menu tasted pretty fishy and we ended up bo it. Service was also slow in the bar area because they had a single person covering all of the tables.   After I posted my review, the manager reached out to me directly to ask about the slow service. I was very impressed with the customer service and I'm excited to go back to have a sit down meal!"}
{"text":"Came here with family while visiting from the LA area. Wow, was I impressed.  I had the rum glazed Cuban pork (under \"comfort food\") with the coconut mango rice.  The meat was incredibly tender & flavorful. I also had the clementine mojito which was was quite delicious and refreshing.  We shared the special chips (plantains, etc.) as appetizer.  Wish we'd had room for dessert, as I'm sure it would've been just as amazing.  Wish there was another location closer to home.  Will definitely want to come back here next time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Latin food, this is probably the only place in Cleveland you can get it :-)  I love the guacamole and sangria.  It's not my favorite place in Beachwood, but definitely a good place to take friends for a fun meal.  It would be cool if they could make the bar area bigger to allow for comfortable hanging out/eating there."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for our anniversary dinner. We don't like really fancy places so this place was perfect. Not too fancy, but not too too casual either.  We liked most of our food. The guacamole wasn't the best guac I've tasted before but it was nice and fresh. The calamari was way too salty. I could not eat more than one bite of it. Jerk chicken skewers didn't taste anything like jerk chicken but it was still pleasant to eat.  By the time we finished our appetizers, we were pretty much full, but we still got our main entrees... :D I got the beef tacos and bf got the grilled chicken. He said it just tasted like something we could make at home. Nothing special. My tacos were fantastic though. The meat was so juicy and the balsamic sauce made the dish more flavorful than it already was. I would come back here to try all of their tacos. So good! Last, we got churros for dessert. If you're not looking for a very sweet dessert, then this isn't for you. Chocolate and marshmallow dipping sauce comes with it too. Phenomenal. Definitely satisfied my churro craving for a while.  Atmosphere was lively and loud. I very much enjoyed my dinner here ! :)"}
{"text":"Paladar's daily Happy Hour from 4-7pm rocks! Wish they were in Tremont!"}
{"text":"I personally loved the place!  When looking for a place to eat near where I was staying, the words \"Latin\" and \"Rum\" caught my eye and every other place I looked at on yelp, those words kept on flitting back into my mind.  Those words did not disappoint me...  *I had the mango, cilantro mojito because I'm in love with mojitos - didn't disappoint. *Had to try the guacamole because I'm an voracious avocado fiend -- didn't disappoint (which, they have a few special guacs as well, but I just got the original). *Then I went for the special, the rainbow trout on corn fritters with sauteed shrimp and corns and veggies on top.  Wasn't disappointed ut I wasn't in heave.  But, to be fair, I think it was because I had such a hard time deciding from the menu and there was a sandwich and a wrap that I was looking at as well - it had turkey and bacon and AVOCADO on it.... I really was yearning for that, but wasn't really wanting the \"bread\" factor so I wound up with the trout special.  I think that sandwich/wrap choice was still in my head so my taste buds were not willing to be completely happy.  Don't get me wrong, the trout was delicious, but when bacon and avocado is stuck in your head.... I'll have to try it next time.  I will say that the menu is absolutely overwhelming as, if you tend to like Latin foods, everything looks absolutely delicious and its sheer torment.  SO - bring a group and make sure to try a bunch of stuff and PLEASE post the things that were absolutely delicious so that you can pay it forward and help other people decide from this amazing menu.  Oh - one more comment... Great service and really cute and classy atmosphere!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland! The food is outstanding and the blend of spices always keeps you guessing. I have tried pretty much everything on their menu and love it all, including the outstanding drinks the bar provides. I usually go to Paladar every other week and I always find something new to love about it."}
{"text":"Rum Glazed Cuban Pork is delicious with tasty sides.  Grits, Coconut Mango Rice and other sides are flavorful and unique.  Pulled Chicken and Fish Tacos are also very good.  Great selection of bar drinks and very good Mojitos."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!! The ambiance and decor were so fun. The portion sizes were pretty large and the food was amazing - the best taco I have ever had. Our service was great too. There is absolutely nothing I would have changed about this experience.  I have worked in a few places and Latin America and this just brought me back to those times. Absolutely loved it and cannot wait to go back! They had great happy hour specials posted if you sit at the bar - may have to try that next time!!"}
{"text":"Latin American kitchen w/ a lot to choose from. Cool decor w/ a nice patio. Several different appetizers, entrees, seafood choices sandwiches & tacos. Vegan items are offered as well. Also a nice wine & cocktail menu. We ordered the made to order guacamole, chicken empanadas & guacamole deviled eggs for apps. The apps were good, especially the guacamole. For entrees we all got the braised beef tacos. They were good as well. Decent potion sizes. They were accompanied by frijoles (slightly dry). Over all the place was I recommend, clean & friendly staff. Prices are a bit high. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Paladar is an upscale Mexican restaurant with a large, diverse menu, and a huge drink selection.  It's huge inside, and they even have outdoor seating.  It was nice out, so we dined outdoors and man oh man did we dine.  Before I talk about the food I want to talk about the waiter, Andre.  Ask for him.  The company I was with always requests him and I completely understand why, he's great.  When it comes to these types of restaurants, you can never go wrong with a guac order.  But...what's great about Paladar's guac (aside from the fresh ingredients), is the chips it comes with.  Plantain chips, yuca trips, I can go on and on...AMAZING.  I enjoyed the mojo marinated Atlantic salmon and whatever that puree it was served with was incredible.  I also got to try the slow braised duck tacos which were delicious as well.  For dessert Andre brought us Paladar's chocolate flan.  Now...this isn't your ordinary flan.  It's basically chocolate mousse infused with Latin spices, in the shape of flan, and tastes like CRACK.  We downed it so fast and wanted more, more, and more.  Now, no Mexican dinner is complete without a drink so I will mention that I enjoyed the spiced sangria and what was even better was that they didn't skimp on the fruit!  Love me some alcohol-infused apples and oranges."}
{"text":"Yes.  If you like meat and latin flavors, without spending a ton of cash, yet getting an ENORMOUS plate of food, this is the place to eat.  Went with a large group and all of our dishes were meaty to the max, and all of us struggled to finish.  But! we did, because it was cold out, and this is some great comfort food.  I started with a ceviche, which was great with the plantain chips.  For my meal I had the lamb stew which actually had a decent amount of lamb in it.  Also got what I believe was the house margarita and oh my did that go down fast. One friend had the steak that came with the yuca fries.  While the steak was gone quickly, I was allowed to try a yuca fry and I've now got to find out where the @#$% I can get a yuca and make fries myself!  The most popular dish at the table was the pork cubano and I can see why -- the meat fell apart in your mouth (that doesn't look right now that I've typed it out.  In fact it looks creepy.  But it's true!  It was delicious!)  Oh, and if you're into rum, the drink menu looked good.  But as I said above, so were the margaritas... I'm more of a tequila girl myself.  ;)"}
{"text":"Went there for first time on Friday April 22. Not impressed ordered chips and salsa to start with.Plantains had no salt on them and some were stuck together other chips not cooked all the way. Constantly observed servers gathered near restroom area with mgr as well just standing around doing nothing. Felt like we were on display although mgr never even stopped by to ask how everything was. Meals came out wife's dish was awful... ordered smoked chicken ...server stopped by and asked how everything was before we really had chance to try the food. Not impressed with menu..overpriced and flavor very bland.service overall was ok but like stated no concern for wife not eating her dish...mgr seemed very disinterested in guests."}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour menu, but it's only in the bar area! Kind of stinks. Food and drinks were amazing as always - the watermelon basil margarita and the empanadas!"}
{"text":"Guacamole doesn't disappoint.  Peach white sangria, half carafe was enough for 4 glasses. I had the fish tacos which was satisfying. Others had the chicken sandwich and pork tacos. We all agreed this dinner was better than yesterday's at The Greenhouse Tavern at half the cost.  Worth the drive out and better service too! Oh the coconut flan was delicious.  Tab came out to $105 w. Tip for 4 peeps."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening with my bf and another couple. We had to wait about 45 min to be seated, so I would recommend making a reservation if you plan on coming on a weekend night.   Food/drink: -Mango sangria was very yummy and a carafe was enough for four people to have almost 2 drinks each. I would say this is a good deal on the menu. I loved the mango chunks that were floating around in this drink.  -Fish tacos were good; the fish was blackened tilapia, which was flavorful and cooked well. The dish came with black beans and rice which were super bland. I am from Miami, so I have had very good black beans and rice. Compared to that, this tasted like black beans out of a can poured over rice. Meh.  -Chips/guac were very good... I liked the guac a lot. It almost had a smoky / bacon flavor to it. The chips were good, especially the plantain and yuca chips.   Service: -Service was very slow (30 min to take our order, another 30 min after that to bring our food), but it was a Friday night so I understand. There was some confusion with our order, but I felt they handled it well. Basically, we ordered ceviche and they instead brought out chips with guac. When we asked about it, we were told the guac was complementary. Then our food came, and when we asked about the ceviche, our waiter told us that they mixed up our tables and we got guac instead. Since our food was already there, we held off on the ceviche. They didn't charge us for guac or ceviche, so no harm no foul I guess.   Overall, this place had a nice atmosphere and the food was good. I've had amazing Cuban/ South American food in Miami, so maybe I am a tough critic, but this place doesn't even compare to the food there. And the price of food here ($15-25 per plate) is pretty steep for the quality of food. I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First time there. Great patio ambiance. Food was great. \"Ben\", our Server was very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The beef taco was very delicious. But the dishes were served really slow. The duck salads were just so so."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, and good food.  The plantains,  ropa vieja, and jicama is delicious."}
{"text":"Great Latin food!  I was surprised to find such a gem in a mall/ shopping center. It is such a beautiful space.   I had the El Cubano sandwich (Roasted pulled pork, ham, and swiss cheese hot pressed in our Cuban bread and topped with dill pickles and honey dijon mustard.)  My wife had the Chimichurri Chicken sandwich (Marinated grilled chicken sliced and topped with thick cut bacon, melted Chihuahua cheese, pico de gallo, and housemade chimichurri sauce on a toasted brioche bun) and our daughter had the Cheese Quesadilla.  Our sandwiches came with sweet potato fries which were amazing and I'm assuming that my daughter enjoyed her Quesadilla since we didn't hear a peep out of her!    My favorite part of the meal was my Strawberry Mojito which was made perfectly. The service was impeccable also. I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the area who is looking for some delicious Latin food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a special occasion dinner at Paladar outside. The waiter was very personable and made some good wine suggestions. The guacamole was fresh, and my salmon was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I have went to Paladar many times and I have always been served qualify food. The service has always been great too. Sometimes the wait can be long, but that is why I try to go during non peak hours. I love their braised beef tacos and their flan. I also enjoy an occasional drink and I normally opt for one of their mojitos."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy guacamole, queso fundido, Al Pastor pork tacos and a special, Black Seal Rum Chicken entree. Like the two stars connote, \"Meh, I've had better.\" That phrase is spot on for Paladar. The guacamole was ok, but is not worth the price. The fundido was good, (I don't think I've had a fundido I didn't like) but the chorizo in the fundido didn't taste like chorizo, more like a spicey chicken sausage. Again, it wasn't bad, but, if you are looking for authenticity, not so much. The pork taco was ok but lacked any distinctive flavor of Al Pastor. My wife's chicken special was just ok as well. We were really hoping/expecting to be wowed and were not. While Paladar was ok, $13-15 for for our entrees was too much and we don't plan on returning. We are on a desperate hunt for a wow! meal in the Cleveland area and Paladar had been recommended. Coming from the New York city area, we will soon give up our quest."}
{"text":"Very cool Latin atmosphere. Service was great as our table wasn't ready righ away and they quickly offered us some complimentary Chips and Guac which was excellent. Our drinks were very good along with foo that was spicy, but not overbearing. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice date night spot. Very crowded, but not overly loud."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great Father's Day brunch.  The food was a good mix of authentic Latin food with some American-fusion takes.   The mix of plantain, malanga, yuca chips and guacamoles was a highlight."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We reserved a table over the weekday, good thing to do, as it was packed on weekdays which was surprising. Its always better to reserve a table prior to your visit:)  The ambience was good, we loved it:)  We ordered Guacamole, Slow smoked chicken, Tacos and a desert. They were right on time, there was NO delay in getting the food to the table, in spite the restaurant being completely packed. Food was delicious... Five stars for the taste, price and service.  We will definitely visit this place again. I strongly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"There is a reason I drive all the way from Westlake to get to Paladar. It is worth the drive!!  This latin kitchen is by far on the top of my list in the city!    I love the cuban braised tacos, there are 3 in the grouping and just enough to be full.  Finish that off with a couple of margaritas. ( I like the strawberry margarita).   And the night ends with being completely satisfied with Paladar. We had a new waitress here the last time we were here and she was great, she didn't admit to knowing everything, which we appreciated.  If you are in Woodmere, you have to go here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour and everything was fab. Service was great, margaritas were tasty and the tacos were well balanced and full of flavor  check it out!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch and they do have a separate menu you can order off of.  We both loved the guac which we had goat cheese as an \"add in\". They let you build it with whatever you want to add in and there are many choices.  I had the smoked salmon and my boyfriend had some sort of hash- both were good. I really did want to try tacos though so will have to come back for that. My order was huge btw!   Only complaint was the service was a little slow and it wasn't that packed. We weren't in a hurry but if someone was trying to get in and out they would have been frustrated ."}
{"text":"Paladar is our favorite Sunday Happy Hour. Every Sunday we close our store, and head there for apps and mojitos. Pete, the NEW GM is awesome! Paul, one of the managers is also one of the best bartenders and hospitable people my partner and I have met."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. We had the spicy guacamole for an appetizer. It was very fresh and quite delicious. We ordered from the lunch menu and had the chicken and beef soft taco, grits and sweet plantains. The beef taco was okay but the chicken taco was absolutely wonderful. The roasted corn grits is not like any grits I have ever had. I kept telling myself I would only eat a couple of spoonfuls but that didn't work. I would go back just to have the chicken tacos and grits. For dessert we shared the carrot cake. Thought it was delicious and disappointed to hear it would only be on the menu for 5 more days. Our server was Marisol. She as very knowledgeable about the menu and was quite helpful in narrowing our choices."}
{"text":"Food is the only reason it still got three stars... Service is fine, but there is always something go wrong. Asked for a Quinoa burger, asked the waitress about the name and her opinion, but got a juicy beef burger. Could be the worst thing for a vegetarian. Asked for separate checks for everyone, and as expected she messed up our bills not matching our orders with faces.   Second time there, we waited for 30 minutes for appetizers and another hour for our entree. We have a nine people group, but I don't think it can be the reason. It was during lunch time and not busy at all.  Will not come back unless I really have the time and patience for above average food."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour specials. Plenty of food and drink for decent price. The chicken tacos are more than enough for a meal. The staff was happy and super friendly and engaging. They were on top of it even with a full bar and bar area.  I will definitely go back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yum! We started with the plantain crusted crab croquetas. While they were delicious, you only get four small ones which are hard to justify at $12. I had the rum glazed Cuban pork and my husband had the Cuban sandwich with the spinach and hearts of palm salad. Service was okay but not great. We both liked our dishes and we will likely return. Oh, and bonus -- it's just down the strip from a Menchies!"}
{"text":"Did not blow me away.  Granted I live in Houston where we have great Latin food and I'm possibly spoiled but the food was not that great.   Chimmichurri sauce lacked a garlic punch and the Guacamole did not have tomatoes in it.   I got the lamb chops and didn't even taste the chimmichurri sauce that it was marinated and cooked in.  Several in my party got the churrasco skirt steak and said it was good.   I will try again on my next trip to Cleveland, maybe it was an off night."}
{"text":"I recently made my second visit to Paladar. Last year it wasn't a great experience as the jerk chicken app I ordered was undercooked, but the service was great and so was my cocktail. This recent visit was a great improvement. I ordered the fish tacos, which is served with a perfectly balanced slaw, pineapple and pickled red onion, and a side of rice and black beans. The fish was so good, I ate all 3 pieces. I also (over)indulged with 2 traditional mojitos - ya can't blame a gal, they were delicious! Maybe ever so slightly too sweet, but the fresh mint and lime were in point. So refreshing!  I can't give enough to compliments to the staff! Everyone was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Expensive and the drinks are sub-standard.  If you know anything about mojitos and like them - do not order them here.  They are not freshly made and are not authentic mojitos.    Food was average but way overpriced.  The only positive about this restaurant is the ambiance (outdoor patio) and the service.  Our server was excellent.    I don't think I will be going back here."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The atmosphere is beautiful and they have plenty of seating, which is great considering how busy it can get during dinner. They have an extensive selections of drinks, especially rum, including multiple tasting flights. Additional, they have a number of delicious and fun non alcohol beverages that are a definite step up from your run of the mill lemonade.   You absolutely must get their guacamole, it is the best I've ever had!  It is completely customizable and you can add a number of things, from mango to honey to fresh garlic. If you get the guacamole sampler it's easy to try a couple of interesting flavors, and so far all of mine have been delicious.   Their menu is extensive and you're sure to find something for everyone, especially is they're looking for something vegan or vegetarian. Additionally, they have an entire menu of gluten free option if you need it.   Definitely recommend for dinner any day of the week or for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"More fusion than Mexican, outstanding nevertheless!!!! The cheese appetizer was to die for, we had 2!!!! Huge portions and great food!!"}
{"text":"Score. Tacos crisped on the inside, soft on the outside. Salmon and chicken entrees good, good with unique tastes. Chips made from plantains and four other foods I can't remember - nice.  Fresh modern, smartly designed interior. This place works."}
{"text":"Freakin awesome. Fresh, authentic, creative menu, great atmosphere and good pricing.... In addition to the rum bar. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went back to Paladar to give it a second try, since they were so kind to give us a 25$ giftcard when we told them that the dinner was not as we expected. At our second visit, we didn't mention the giftcard at the beginning, so that the results would not be spoiled. We started again with tomato basil guacamole and chips, which were truly amazing again. This time we tried the Fiejoada stew, which includes rice, meat and beans. This came in a right sized portion, and I have to say it was tasty and original. The staff is always very kind. Probably it was too crowded the first time we checked it out, but this time the experience was completely improved."}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas and I have to have dinner at Paladar every time I'm in Cleveland.  This place is nothing but deliciousness. I have never had anything here that I didn't like. From fresh made guacamole, empanadas, to steak and churros.  The drinks are really good here.  Service is good but they can step up it up a bit."}
{"text":"Paladar really hit the spot for me big time. I visited before and it was years so I needed to refresh to try to write a good review for you.  I had avocado and tilapia ceviche and rum punch drinks. This was a perfect combination. Refreshing, delicious or whatever strong adjectives you may want to attach to my experience. I liked the bartender. He did not try to treat me like geriatric alcoholic because I wanted to indulge in few drinks alone and possibly strike up some conversation. I was all for it, I even was able to absorb some of their Latin American music with no frills. I favor Tropicalia personally but another topic altogether friends.  Only one thing restrains me from offering the elusive five star review. I found myself next to an older man and woman having the most inane and gross conversations I have heard. The man was some executive person for Keybank. You can gather my sentiments for Keybank in my scathing review posted previously. This guy wagered talking points from his affairs with women who worked for him, HR investigations, and couple million dollars of salary over past several years all within my sensitive earshot. He generally carried on with the aplomb that could make anyone want to vomit nachos. What a creep. I am still recovering from customer service experience that I wrote about previously.   I can't fault Paladar for serving these people who happened to be obese yet I left feeling depressed with my rum punch buzz."}
{"text":"With as many times as I've been here I can't believe I haven't written a review yet.  This place knows what they are doing.  Most recently I visited for their food rendition of Carnaval.  They had a $5 street food menu and half price traditional or flavored Mojitos and Margaritas.  All delicious! They also have a great happy hour in their bar area with cheap and tasty apps and discounted drinks.  Plus this is only of the few brilliant restaurants in the area that serves bottomless mimosas at brunch. And I have been here several times for work lunch meetings and the food and service has always been great.  They even have an outstanding burger on the menu for those who aren't into the Latin fare."}
{"text":"Paladar is consistency good. The only thing I ever order is a Cuban sandwich (because they are amazing). We usually order the guacamole too, because it's fresh and well made. You can pick ingredients for your own guac. The drinks are strong too, so it's a nice place for a meal. It can get a little loud, but really, it's good food"}
{"text":"Latin with a twist? This is not your regular Latin restaurant. It's based on Latin food but it has a gourmet touch to it. I love that they have a rum bar and brunch the weekends. You definitely should try this place.  Can't come? Order it on Uner Eats! Food travels well."}
{"text":"Great dinner with a good friend. The guacamole here is fantastic.  Mixed seafood ceviche super-fresh, but a little \"one note\" - might benefit from some cilantro or jalapeño.  Duck tacos were delicious.  And margaritas were perfect - creamy tart/sweet as opposed to that super-tart Puckett taste some margaritas can have.   The decor was very nice, upscale and modern.  We were there fairly early (5:45) and it looked mostly like business people after work.  I would definitely go here again and would feel comfortable doing a business dinner or drinks meeting here.   For my GF friends - they had GF cheesy bread!"}
{"text":"Oh my gooooddddd why didn't I come to this place sooner?   Okay so the service here was SO good. My server was Annie and she was really sweet and patient with me. Their menu is really big and everything sounds amazing, how can I choose? But she told me what her favorites were and when I narrowed it down to average choices she helped me pick one. And it was a GREAT recommendation. I had the fish tacos with their coconut mango rice--if you come between 11am-4pm you can get a taco and a side for $9.95 which is a great deal.   The rice was so good, the perfect blend of coconut and not too overpowering. The tacos were equally amazing though--that pineapple slaw! It just goes so well with the fish.   I didn't get any drinks, but with Rum in the name, I'm guessing that's their speciality."}
{"text":"My family & I ate lunch here after the Cleveland Got Sole convention this weekend.  It was fairly close to where we were. I really enjoyed this restaurant!  My husband ordered an El Cubano sandwich, I ordered a Chimichurri Chicken sandwich & my daughter ordered a Cheese Quesadilla.  Our sandwiches came with sweet potato fries which were amazing and I'm assuming that my daughter enjoyed her Quesadilla since I didn't hear a peep out of her!    The highlight of this place was my Strawberry Mojito which was made perfectly.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone who likes Latin flavor in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant! Located in Solon, Ohio the place is clean and the decor is colorful and cheery with paintings, masks, and banners! We ordered the sampler platter which includes chicken wings ( meaty, crunchy coating, tender, juicy and the perfect amount of sauce) chicken enchiladas (tender and flavorful with peppers) cheese enchilada, beef enchiladas. The beans are really flavorful (the best in town!) and the rice (also the best in town) has added bits of corn, peas and scallions.The chili rellenos are muy caliente, also flavorful and made to perfection. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"The deal at Paladar is simple, great atmosphere, clean and contemporary. The drinks are strong although not refined. The \"chips\" are a delicious mix of thin sliced plantains and yucca slices (malanga, tortilla, Plantain, Yucca) .  My first issue stems from the first time I ate at Paladar, the waiter told me the Black Bean soup was Vegetarian, it is not. As a Vegetarian, it is not cool to slip Ham into my food. If I am going to eat meat it is my decision. This kind of pissed me off, but still I blamed the waiter, although an easy solution is put it on the menu.  Why give this restaurant 3 stars? Because it is absolute Bullsh1t that they claim to have FRESH Guacamole \"Made To Order,\" that they serve with brown edges and scooped with an ice-cream scooper out of a vat of Guacamole. Puke!!! You are NOT allowed to make the Guacamole every 3 hours and call it Fresh Guacamole. You have a Guacamole Bar, well make it to order.  Until you fix the Guacamole process, it is impossible to give you more than 3 stars. Take pride in your Guac. Period.  ***I am giving Paladar another shot, mainly because I have heard thru the grapevine that the problems have been heard and are being addressed. Just knowing someone is listening is worth one star."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely certain how to classify this place; it's really somewhere between a gastro-pub and a restaurant.  There's quite a mingling scene, and rather pretty decor, but perhaps my experience is coloured by seat vultures.    There has definitely been a decline in courtesy in the US, and this night really highlighted it, when the server directed my brother and I to seats that were immediately snatched by an older couple that had been there far later than we.  Now, had they made eye contact, I would have been happy to cede the seat to them.  I mean, they are older, and hopefully having a good date together...  My brother and I could easily stand.    However, when the server apologized loudly for the seat snatching, these two blithely continued to enjoy their \"good find\" without acknowledging their breach of etiquette.  Most distasteful.  That said, they have an extensive rum list, and rather decent fare.  I can't vouch for authenticity, in that I haven't eaten enough Mexicana cuisine to have a strong idea as to what they should taste like.  That said, I've been to a lot of Tapas places around the nation, and mexican food in completely latin run and patronized restaurants... My sense is that the flavours are good, but off the mark.  Still, I enjoyed my short rib taquitos and carnitas tacos.  My brother seemed to like his meal.  I'd go back, but not aggressively."}
{"text":"After having a less than stellar entree on my previous visit, I decided to go with the requisite guacamole as an appetizer and the Caribbean Mango Chicken salad as my entree and both were quite delicious! I'm a huge fan of anything jerk (except people of course!) and I enjoyed their seasoning, the vinaigrette was fresh and flavorful too. I enjoyed one of their mixed drinks, the Dragonberry Daiquiri which was super tasty. And there was no way I was leaving without the famous churros as dessert and they were nothing less than exceptional!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Has a nice spice to it like Latin American food should. They have a wide variety of tacos, wraps, sandwiches and other entrees at a moderate price. I got the El Cubano which was a very filling sandwich. Instead of fries, I recommend getting a lighter side like a soup. The ambiance is nice and casual. However the service was very slow and it wasn't even crowded at all. I spent like 2 hours there and most of the time I was waiting for my food, water and check. But anyways, despite that, I would still go back because the food was very good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with some fam. Very nice atmosphere. Guacamole and chips very tasty! Had the stew it was ok but the rice was bland."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the drinks although a little pricey are very good. I have dined here probably 10 to12 times. I do this for my wife as the only thing consistent about the service is its terrible. If they offer a second drink you receive it when your meal is finished every time. They don't check to see if everything is acceptable or if I need something, like another drink or a little water. Great food bad service"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend to eat and the decor is beautiful. We loved the atmosphere! It looks very modern/chic with lots of colors. Seems like it would be a fun place to go on the weekends for drinks.  When we went though, the patrons were more on the suburban, older end. We did go on a Sunday evening, but it makes me wonder if the same crowd comes in on the weekends too.   On the whole, the food seemed average. I really enjoyed the appetizer, which was the pulled beef on plantains. The flavor was good (for me, I could always use more spice) and the beef was tender. The rum pulled pork was generally good - very tender, and I liked some of the flavoring, but the pineapple/rice tasted very so-so. (It was a little rice-a-roni...yikes.) I had a spiced rum that enhanced some of the flavors. Overall, I think the food could use more spice, but hey, it's located in an area with Midwestern palettes."}
{"text":"Paladar has a wonderful, warm ambiance... or, maybe it was just the rum.  ;o)  The guacamole is served up fresh with a delicious blend of tortilla, potato, and plantain chips.  The menu has a lot of choices and unique flavors.  If you are looking to try something new and palate pleasing, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this food was good (a little too hyped from the other reviews but good). Went with co workers on a Wednesday night and it was already busy! So get to location early if have reservations. Also finding a parking spot is a little difficult so showing up a little early will help. The food again was great and the service was nice and prompt. Would come back here but as other restaurants in the area will have to try others also."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents and a family friend tonight.  We met at Eton and figured out where to go once we got to Eton.  We started off with some drinks and since we were in the bar, we got happy hour specials.  3 sugar margaritas later, my mom was driving home, but that's besides the point!  The chips and guacamole were delicious (tortilla, plantane and one other type of chip) were pretty good and I'm normally not a guac person.  For dinner, I got the Braised Beef Ropa Vieja.  It was enough for 3 meals for me, but absolutely delicious!!!  The meat melted in your mouth, the rice and beans were so good.  My mom got the chicken tacos and sent her last one home with me.  My friend got the portobello dish and it was one of the best vegetarian dishes she's had.  Good place to go with good portion sizes.  Our waiter was awesome and we had a good 1.5 hours or so with him!  Note, would beware of prom and homecoming season!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, outstanding service and great environment!!! Loved every second of my first time in Paladar! Definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is very good!  There are lots of drink specials -- mojitos, beer, wine, sangria, margaritas and rum flights -- and deals on appetizers.  I had a mojito and my husband had a couple of beers.  We split the chips and guac and two other appetizers.  Everything was delicious and it was plenty of food for the two of us.  The specials are only available in the bar area and it gets very busy!  We arrived early (about 5 pm) and got a seat right away but noticed many people waiting for seats shortly after we arrived.  Certainly putting Paladar on our Happy Hour rotation!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu, very good vibe and atmosphere, a good choice for a first (or any) date. Very good mojitos. All food I have ordered here has been quite good, which is also to say that none has been truly exceptional. A solid four stars."}
{"text":"Delicious! In town for a business trip with some colleagues.  Got a great table on their outdoor patio.  Prices were pretty good- sangria for $8.95, beers in the 5.00 range.  Dinners varied on what you wanted-- I got the pork chop.  So good. It was $24.  We tried the speciality guacamole-I highly recommend getting the trio and sampling it.  We splurged on a few desserts.  My favorite was the coconut flan.  Relaxed atmosphere with great Latin flavors."}
{"text":"Awesome! Fun atmosphere with indoor seating, outdoor seating and \"in between\" with covered seating next to open doors. Meaning is great with delicious flavorful mojitos! I had pomegranate and it was affordable and delicious with fresh mint and a sugar cane. We had fresh made guacamole and chose candied pumpkin seeds. Delicious! Tasted extremely fresh and great combo of sweet and rich flavored. I really loved the plantains instead of traditional tortilla chips. Our excellent server Jed was very knowledgable about the menu and very attentive. We had only half finished the plantains and he brought us more along with fresh salsa. I had the kale sweet potato salad with chicken which was thinly sliced delicious chicken breast. Great flavor with nice light dressing. My husband had pork chops (cooked medium) with chorizo. Both of genuinely enjoyed our server, Jed, the atmosphere, drinks, and food. We aren't locals so will definitely miss not being able to be regulars. Definitely must go!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here because of the reviews. It was disappointing this place has  nothing to rave about. Which includes their service"}
{"text":"This place surpassed my expectations! The service staff members were some of the nicest people and the food was delicious and came out quickly. Their chips and guac were awesome and the salad I had was super flavorful and healthy. I am definitley going back when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Paladar is a favorite place for work dinners at Progressive when we have out of town guests, partly because of the location, but mostly because the food is diverse and fantastic!  There were about 15 of us on Wednesday evening, but they did a decent job of keeping drinks filled.  The waiter was very friendly, although possibly a bit frazzled, and even gave us what he called a \"tour of the menu.\"  He pointed out all the customer favorites and described the dishes in more detail than the menu.    His description changed my choice  and that of two others to the \"Rum Pork Glazed Cubano.\"  He was right too.  The pork was perfectly cooked and served over a fantastic coconut mango rice with black beans on the side.    We also all shared multiple guacamole's and salsa as appetizers.  The \"tortilla\" assortment that comes with these is awesome.  I highly recommend the banana chips -- YUM!  I actually liked the salsa more than than the guac, but I was spoiled on wonderful guac on our trips to  Tucson, so it's hard to compare.....  This place leans toward the pricey side, but they do have happy hour specials and sandwiches if you don't want to spend a ton of dough.  I also recall from a previous visit that their Mojitos are a must-have if you are in the mood for a drink!"}
{"text":"Very salty to begin with also found a piece of bone in the chicken.... Lost my appetite after finding a robbery skin in my chicken tacos....won't recommend it at all"}
{"text":"Absolutely. Ab-So-Lute-Ly!!!! Delicious, and I love that everything is always piping HOT!!  The smoky corn grits?!!  Amen! The rice and beans and plantains. Oh my gosh! Yummmmmyyyyy. This place is So good! I love  it and I will definitely be back next week."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for dinner and drinks on a Friday evening.  The bar was packed, it was Happy Hour, so we opted for a fairly empty dining room.  After we were seated we waited almost 10 minutes before we were brought our water.  We tried to order drinks, but the server who had brought our water told us she was not our waitress.  We waited almost 10 more minutes before we walked out.  While we were waiting we watched 3 to 4 servers talking among themselves, checking their phones, and apparently blatantly ignoring us.  There is more to a dining experience than the food....and I hope the food which we will NEVER taste is better than the service"}
{"text":"When I get really excited about reviewing a place, my mind goes a million miles a minute and my thoughts get totally jumbled. And that's exactly how I'm feeling about Paladar.   So let me try to get my shit together and write a decent review of one of the best dining experiences I've had in really long time...  After an exhausting day touring Cleveland, we were famished and looking for a great meal. The trusty Yelp iPhone app pointed me to Paladar, and once again - you guys were totally on the money. This was hands-down the best Latin food I've had outside of Central and South America. The hype around this place is completely on-point.  I think a list would be the easiest way to tell you all the things I loved about Paladar:  ^ Reservations on Open Table - easy, peasy! ^ Service - Our server, Kristy, was warm, bubbly, attentive, and full of personality. She especially won me over when she found out cilantro (that vile weed!) was in my dish, and she immediately came over to me to help choose a substitution.  ^ Food - Everybody at our table loved their meals, so I don't think you can go wrong with any choices. But I have to highly recommend: grits, papusa, plantains, and rum pulled pork w/ mango rice. (The Mister also loved his ceviche, but I can't attest to that - I don't eat seafood.) ^ Drinks - It seems like Paladar is always having some type of drink special, and I got my fill of deliciously-crafted caipirinhas...for $5 each! ^ Atmosphere - Paladar is upscale without trying, and the customers ranged from casual families to young people all dressed up - and everything in between.  I can't say enough amazing things about Paladar, and I can't wait to go back. It's probably a good thing that I'm in Columbus over two hours away!"}
{"text":"I actually don't have anything bad to say about Paladar, as the service was excellent and the food was pretty good. It's just that the food didn't wow me as much as I thought it would. The appetizer (corn and chipotle guacamole) and my appetizer (some sort of smoked/spicy chicken salad-stuffed poblano pepper) were both too sweet for my taste. I wasn't expecting either to taste sweet, but they both had sweetness as a strong flavor component. The rum selection, however, is great if you're into that!  Again, the service was great and the food was a-okay, but I've been wanting to try Paladar for so long after reading other reviews and I was a little bit disappointed that it didn't meet my expectations as far as the food went."}
{"text":"We first went here when we lived in the heights. Since we moved, it became inconvenient and we just stopped going. Went there last night and realized what a big mistake that was!  The food is amazing and the have a beer called \"Golden  Monkey\" from the Victory brewing company in PA. This has been the only restaurant in in the Cleveland area I have found with it.   The only drawback of the evening, (which I am considering an anomaly) was the service. We had a server name Jed that left me without water or other drink for the majority of the meal. As my wife pointed out, he spend most of his time at the bar talking to a group or women.   All in all, if you are in the area definitely check this place out, but be careful of your server."}
{"text":"Mad dope fish tacos.  Finally found some that remind me of Rubios in california, sups legit bro.  will be our new go-to"}
{"text":"I like Paladar. I like it. The caiprihana is something I'll order every time with my dinner as not many other spots in Cleveland area know how to make one, even though they are simply simple.   Whatever they do to the pork and beef when its roasted, braised and falls apart as you pick it up. Genius. Flavors are very much South American with a bit of Asian here and there.   I highly recommend the Ropa Viejo, a Brazilian Stew on the lunch entrees menu, guacamole apps are fresh and excellent, and the fish tacos are so fricken delicious. Now too bad they got rid of the Mini Mahi Taco app. That was really tasty. It was a bit briny and limey and tasted oh so good.   One of my office's favorite places to come for large lunches. They treat us like kings and queens. Service is almost always impeccable. Go there. You probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The chips and Caesar salad were pretty good. Those took me from a 2 star to a 3 star. I got the blackened fish tacos. $16 for 3 completely below par tacos. Expensive tacos for something that didn't taste fresh and just off. Really disappointed and wouldn't go back on my company cc. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The mojo is finally back with Charles in charge.  Food and service is now great again.  Thanks Charles"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place.  Service was great. Apps dinner were great. Sangria was very good. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Not a good night out other than watching the child captivate those around us with his insane cuteness.  Our waitress was borderline dumb and at one point rambled on for 5 minutes explaining a bunch of nonsense. Her suggestions on items the restaurant is known for were simply the highest priced items on the menu, same with drinks."}
{"text":"I hit up happy hour here with some buddies during a weeknight, so keep in mind my review is based on the happy hour experience and is not reflective of the restaurant as a whole.  During happy hour I ordered mushroom and queso empanadas as well as a black-bean flat bred.  The empanadas were absolutely delicious.  They were crisp and stuffed with nice seasoned mushrooms and topped with delicious queso that packed a little zing.  Pretty much perfect.  The flatbread also tasted good.  It was actually more like a Mexican pizza in that it was a gently baked thick tortilla topped with blackbeans, tomatoes and garnished with cilantro.  I felt as if they put a little too much cilantro, but otherwise, it tasted pretty solid.  The service was a bit on the slow side, but I'd attribute this to the fact that the bar was packed.  Everyone in my party felt as if the selection and pricing for happy hour was among the best we've seen in Cleveland area restaurants.  Overall we had a great experience and would like to try this place for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Ate here 11/5/11.  Food was better than I expected; had the slow roasted mojo pork and the spinach & bacon salad.  Good sized portions on the entree and salad.  Pork was flavorful, spinach very fresh.  Mojitos were great, and our server was efficient and knowledgeable.  Only disappointment was the appetizer, which was a daily special - marinated skirt steak skewers.  While tasty, it was only 3 skewers and each skewer only had 2 bite size pieces of steak, for $13."}
{"text":"Came here again, this time to try lunch, and it was awesome! We were promptly seated when we arrived, and we sat outside since it was a nice day. Their outdoor seating area is great! I ordered the pork chop and my boyfriend ordered the mixed grill. Both dishes had huge portions and were very tasty. We were very happy with the quality of the food! The particular dishes we ordered were a little on the pricier side, so I don't know what the portions are for the less expensive items, but we liked what we got. Overall, we had a great meal and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere. The service is not consistent - sometimes it is fabulous, and sometimes it is really horrible. The food is decent, but not as good as I'd expect it to be. The mohitos were fabulous though!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a incredible place. Everything on the menu sounds amazing. We started our meal with the queso fundido and it was delicious. Love the cheese pull. We also tried the Brazilian cheesy bread so light and airy. The sweet potato and duck hash potatoes were soft and the duck was perfectly crisp. For the main course we had the Chipotle honey pork chop with grits. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the grits were the best I have ever had. My wife tried the cilantro peanut chicken salad and it was amazing.   The service was excellent and our server knew everything on the menu and was able to explain all the flavor profiles. The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable. Overall a wonderful experience and will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give 3.5 stars.  The staff is attentive, and the restaurant is certainly beautiful to look at.  The guacamole of the day/season had mangoes and shallots in it and was delicious, as were the amazing chips made from dried (and fried?) fruit.  The basic guac is also very tasty.  The shrimp ceviche isn't bad although the portion is pretty small.   My first disappointment came when I asked about the horchata-tini and was told by the server that not only was there no horchata that evening but it's bad anyway.  Why have this $9 drink on the menu if it's not readily available and the servers are bad-mouthing it?  The Muddle Strawberry caipirinha I settled on was way strong and refreshing.  The Vegetable Relleno \"Picadillo Style\" completely failed to impress.  The chile is filled with quinoa and beans, neither of which have a ton of flavor on their own, so I was counting on Paladar to come up with an interesting way to season the dish.  But it just tasted like plain quinoa and beans, so it was quite bland.    The Slow Smoked Chicken is decent, with a spicy mustardy sauce and served atop sweet plantains.  Tons and tons of plantains.  And some arepas which were bland and a bit tough.    Come for the atmosphere, drinks, and appetizers.  The entrees seem a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Drinks were great. I had the Rum Glazed Pork, which was great.  The coconut mango rice tasted nothing like coconut nor mango it tasted like water, way over cooked. The pork made up in flavor that the rice lacked. I'd go back and try again to see if it can get better"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Great apps, very cool wine and rum selection.  The portobello empanadas are fantastic!  Bar staff are knowledgable and most helpful!   Highly recommend a stop.   The Zaya 12 year rum is exquisite."}
{"text":"Paul and Victor are amazing behind the bar!!! Always smiling and give you attention like you're the only person in there!!! Love this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Paladar, once or twice before, for dinner.   Yesterday, I visited Paladar for Happy Hour.  I arrived at approximately 5:00, there were only a few people sitting within the bar area.  Within 30 minutes, the area was standing-room-only.   The restaurants hosts Happy Hour 7 days a week from 4-7.   There were lots of choices on the Happy Hour drink and food menu.   I opted for the El Cubano sandwich and an order of Tostones @ $5 each.   The sandwich was huge, and included a generous portion of ham, roast pork and other condiments, served warm and gooey with a side of tortilla chips.  The tostones (twice fried plantains), were also very good and the perfect accompaniment to my sandwich.     I can't wait to go back in order to try other options!"}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options!  Really enjoyed the Caipirinha mixed drink!  Will be a return customer."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Tried the salsa trio.   Several good jar salsas have more to offer. Chips were less than average yet  veg chips good. We had the sweet potato taco. Was decent but nothing I would tell friends about. Service was nice but understaffed so be prepared for overwhelmed server."}
{"text":"The interior is getting a little worn around the edges, but the portobello empanadas, fish tacos and margarita donuts really hit the spot at one of the only restaurants we could find open after 10 pm on a Wednesday.  The real deal maker was absolutely superb service from Shalonda.  We will return mainly because of her welcoming, warm, fun, energetic, knowledgeable, efficient presence, despite our being the last customers in the bar.  I hope she's in charge of training all the staff!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Atmosphere, wonderful food. Our server was genuine snd took marvelous care of us. We went there for tapas and drinks, I had one of their mojitos with vodka instead of rum and it was simply divine. Totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to grabs drinks and light food. I will be back to explore more of their menu!!"}
{"text":"Love the Guac selection! I love spicy, so I always get that one every time I come here. This place is great when in the mood for spicy latin or not! They have some creative big high quality salads that are nice.  I wish they had a la carte tacos or mix and match tacos available."}
{"text":"Rum Glazed Pork Cubano: ridiculously amazing. Its not something I would probably order on my own but a friend did, I tried it and now I'm sold. Everything on the plate just works so well together. I really have liked everything I've tried on my visits and I love their chips that come with the guacamole.  IF they have the lemon basil guacamole try it, I'm a traditional girl and I love lime over lemon but wow.  Service is good but can sometimes be a little slow. I went last week and there were seven of us, the one to my right had extraordinary service and the one to my left was constantly waiting on something. Our server was just inconsistent however they have all seemed to be very professional and highly trained.  I'm low maintenance so for me the service was average, maybe slightly above."}
{"text":"While I am a fan of the restaurant overall, Paladar has a solid happy hour. They have a variety of food and drink specials. Their guacomole is served with tortilla, yuca and plantain chips - which is a nice change (my favorite are the plantain chips). They have classic guacamole, spicy and usually a featured flavor. The spicy is not very spicy IMO, but others I have dined with seem to disagree. The happy hour menu features tacos, yuca fries, Cuban sandwich, fundido and a couple other shareable items. My favorites are the blackened fish tacos and the braised beef tacos. They also make some pretty solid margaritas and mojitos. They offer some additional flavors besides the traditional. This is also one of the few places in town which offers their happy hour specials on Saturday."}
{"text":"I feel that this place deserves slightly more than three stars, in the 3.5 range.  Came here for dinner with friends on a week night. Overall, I have to say I really like the atmosphere of this place- elegant, yet just shy of upscale.  The food was done well, yet left a little something to be desired. I had the guacamole sampler and the lamb tacos, which were a special. I am a big fan of lamb, and I have to say that the tacos were cooked right, were pleasantly garnished, and had a great sauce flavor- slightly spicy and slightly tangy.  I feel as though there could have been more meat on the tacos and I was slightly disappointed with the guacamole, all three of which in the sampler ended up tasting rather the same.  Great drinks and great dessert options. The goat cheese cheesecake and sweet potato donuts are absolutely delicious. Another plus was the very friendly service that we received."}
{"text":"My wife don't really care fir this place but I love it.  Meet with friends there for drinks and food and they also like it"}
{"text":"The manager reached out to me following my first visit to Paladar in response to my review. I really appreciated it as many restaurants do not take the time to do this. He requested that my husband and I return and give it another try. He was eager to make our next experience a great one. We visited the restaurant again and we loved the food this time! My husband and I got the same dish, but something different than our initial visit. We were very pleased with all aspects of the restaurant and WILL be returning in the future. Thank you, Charles!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Will never go back. 75 minutes. Had to ask the bus boy for a second round of drinks. We cancelled our meal. Asked for the bill and he showed up 10 minutes later.  Finally apologized. Table that sat down 25 minutes after us got their food before us. And they complained to the manger also.  Witnesses 4 tables walk out. Watched manager and waiter laughing as we walked out. Place wasn't even half full. Go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since Andy closed Boulevard Blue and opened here at Eton Collection.    This hot spot has a constant stream of locals and visitors and it is always alive!!!  Happy hour trends and if you don't arrive early, no seat for you!  Will, my favorite bartender for years... is on point!  Food is traditional and although now a series of restaurants,  the quality has not waivered.   See you here soon!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. It was...good...but...I felt like I was eating at an expensive version of Chipotle. Only dined here once--but I tried everyone's food (4 dishes, we all shared). I will definitely return...at some point...however there are many places in my restaurant queue to visit first."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a late night snack. Great deals on food in the bar. A bit noisy, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm bummed to write a bad review for Paladar, because we started off really liking it, but have unfortunately had progressively worse experiences each visit.  The good: the menu is really promising, and we've really enjoyed a couple of entrees.  I had a seafood special once that was great, and liked the huevos rancheros (and mimosas) at brunch.  We also really enjoyed the empanadas appetizer.  I'm a fan of the plantain chips.  Service has always been pretty good.  The meh: while they have a fantastic rum menu, the drinks are never quite as exciting as I hope for.  The mojitos aren't really muddled properly, and my husband's jalapeño paloma on our last visit tasted off.  Drink prices are a little high all things considered, and it's a little ridiculous to ask $4.50 for a side of salsa.  The chicken tinga tacos were interesting, but I've had better tacos elsewhere.  The bad:  the last time we came for dinner, my husband ordered the Argentinian mixed grill, and the only redeeming quality was the chorizo-- the chicken was completely dry, the steak was burnt instead of medium rare, and the vegetables were overcooked as well.  Based on this experience, and having had better luck with brunch in the past, we gave them one more shot for brunch, and both ordered the chorizo and egg breakfast tacos.  Where was the chorizo?!  After dissecting our tacos we each found maybe one small slice of chorizo spread across three tacos-- which meant they were mostly cabbage-and-burnt-egg tacos.  To use the Yelp cliche, I really want to like Paladar, but after giving them a few chances, I just don't."}
{"text":"Needing a girls night that would include beverages, food, movie & some great fun some friends & I made reservations for this past Friday.  Work ran a little late and we were a little starving with quite thirst for something...  Paladar's daily 4-7 happy hour saved us.  As a matter of fact the bartenders tempted us away from taking our table when called and we spent all our time at the bar.    $5 mojitos...the pomegranate-ginger were delish Chicken empanadas, beef short rib tacos, blackened tilapia tacos, yucca frites...and the most heavenly s'mores churros!  A good time was had..and the movie 'Bridesmaids' was all that much funnier due to our food/drink coma.  Definitely saved on my list of favorites when I visit this area.  And the staff gave some of the best service in all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I've been here several times over the years and have never been disappointed. This is my first visit here since becoming a vegan 2 years ago and I'm very impressed with the selections! I had the sweet potato & hearts of palm tacos without the sauce (dairy) and the coconut mango rice on the side. Very good!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times in the last few months, each time for lunch.  The menu is a little fancier than I'd normally go for (I'm a pretty picky eater) but I usually go for the beef taco lunch special with fried plantains on the side.  Their puréed habanero sauce always hits the spot for me.  Still trying to make it here to try the dinner menu (and drinks that I can't have while working) at some point."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Came here back in September after completing our wedding registry at Sur La Table a few doors down. The Latin Fusion menu is fantastic and had so many choices! We started with fresh made to order mango guacamole with plantain and tortilla chips....YUM!!! For an entree I got the duck tacos and fiancé got the beef.....WE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE TACOS!!! So fresh and flavorful, we nearly licked the plates clean! We didn't try any rum, but I had a ginger beer which was refreshing and delicious. We plan on going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I usually bring the party to wherever I go, but boy, I didn't need to for Paladar. It was after hours and we walk in to find that the bar was hopping with energy. Filled with corporate types, the crowd was a bit more mature and didn't seem all that worried about this quarter's sales projections. All the ladies seemed to be sporting 4-inch heels that day... company memo? Anyhow...  We were seated in the non-bar area which was partitioned and well insulated from the bar noise. The meal was great, loved the guac, chips, ropa viejo, feijoada except for one. pet. peeve: damp rice. Damp rice pretty much tastes like wet towel, it was not spoiled but with a texture like this I could imagine it getting there, kinda gross, so I washed away my sorrows with the Mimosa which was delicious. The bottomless Mimosas are only available during brunch FYI.  I've been here more than once and I always get good service. Counting all visits, it has been A-Ok."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I saw the rum list and had to check it out.  The 4-7 happy hour menu is awesome. Had the fish tacos and guacamole with chips and veggies. It was simply amazing. $5 mojitos with no mixes, real ingredients you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I had the chance to stop in for dinner at Paladar! I had the pomegranate margarita with the sugar rim and that was much needed after a long day at work. We decided to start off with their chip and guac and that was a fantastic decision! Their housemade chips are not regular chips (plantains, yucca, tostones) which makes it that much more fantastic and the guac is really fresh. Definitely worth it!   Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm AND 9-11 pm, however, you must be seated at the bar or at the high tops near the bar in order to get the Happy Hour prices.   Aside from the food, the atmosphere is gorgeous here! Classy feel to the whole place with high ceilings and modern decor!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Eaton place on east side of Cleveland, Paladar kitchen & rum bar is a sophisticated Caribbean  food heaven. Every dish starting with appetizers to entree to dessert are true celebrations of the taste. Paladar definitely has a weak spot for plantains - fries thin cut as chips for dipping in guacamole, to caramelized accompaniment with entree to sweet fried with dessert.   Their currently special appetizer - Prosciutto  wrapped beef skewers with spicy peanut sauce leave you craving more almost wishing it could be made into an entree. The meat is tender and burst with jerk flavor that's just right.   Their 3 different flavored Civiche (Shrimp, Tuna, or Salmon) are sweet & tangy explosion of diced fish, Plantains, Pickled Red Onions, Basil & Pineapple, & citrus flavor that is a flavor explosion in with every bite.  Even a simple sounding entree like 'SLOW SMOKED CHICKEN' keeps you wanting more even if you feel stuffed.  This particular dish is tender shredded slow cooked chicken tossed in a \"Guajillo Marinade atop Columbian Arepas and Sweet Plantains finished with our Spicy Aji Pepper Sauce\". This is a genius amalgamation of Caribbean flavors  The 'Rum bar' part of the name of Paladar truly holds up given the extensive light & dark rum.  My most favorite is their 'Dark & Stormy' a combination of dark rum with ginger beer.  They have mojito & margaritas with various flavors.  Although most flavors are well the classic flavor is the best.  I did find the pomegranite-ginger flavored mojito to be a terrible mix of flavor and their mint leaves are not mashed like a true mojito deserves.  Paladar is not a cheap place, however their $9 - $17 price range, in my opinion is worth the creative and tasteful cuisine they serve up.  Paladar truly razzles and dazzles you with their latin influenced flavors, the wait staff deliver mixed service - some are very attentive and know their game, some seem to not know how to serve at a sophisticated place like this.  They are always accommodating, so just ask for a server change if you happen to get one who does not suit you.  Oh don't forget to check out the secret about Paladar in the announcement section of their business listing here on Yelp."}
{"text":"This is another decent option in eton. The food is fresh and tasty, and they have a pretty extensive menu. Lunch specials are cheaper and come with your choice of salad or side, Guac is made fresh to order. Tip: if you do takeout, you get a free bag of their chips, which is not just tortilla but also interesting ones like plaintain and taro. The portions were a bit skimpy the last time I ordered takeout, which was a bit aggravating. It looked like they forgot to put meat in the taco bc there was only a half bite of meat. Because of this, we've taken a break from paladar for a while now but may give it another shot sometime"}
{"text":"Food was great! The guac & chips was almost as good as what I make at home! Highly recommend it!!  Def a spot worth visiting 1-2-3+ times!! had the rum pork and vieja."}
{"text":"Maybe it isn't my kind of place but I just didn't get it...  The waitress had no idea about a drink but pretended that she did and just suggested the most expensive on the menu.   the fish tacos were ok but nothing memorable.  The scallops were like licking salt and eating breakfast potatoes....Sad"}
{"text":"Paladar is my guilty pleasure when i have a little extra cash. Was recently here for Fat Tuesday. It was a really fun Mardi Gras themed event.  They had festive drinks and food specials. I ordered $5 caipirinhas that were very tasty. They also had a live Latin band called Justo Saborot that had everyone on their feet dancing and having a good time. It was very crowded but they managed to seat us and we had prompt service.  On another note, they have one of the best Saturday and Sunday brunch specials in Cleveland. They serve Bottomless mimosas! I was sold from that point on."}
{"text":"ZOMG!  I love this place!  Walking in there made me feel like the high-powered fashionable career gal I always dreamed of being...except I was pushing a stroller with my husband. LOL.  Although the place was full of slick, beautiful, 20-something year olds just off from work and having their appletinis and cosmos, the server didn't bat an eye at our (equally fashionable and slick Brita red) stroller.  I had the lamb soup and it was absolutely scrumptious!  The term \"soup\" is misleading, it really was much thicker, more like a stew and the lamb was cooked all tender and melted like butter in my mouth. Om nom nom nom!  My husband had the cuban sandwich and he found it also very good. I love their chips too, and the dip it came with was tasty!  We didn't get the guac (watching that waist-line) so I can't rate it but I saw them making it fresh in the kitchen in these little mortar and pestles and I think this means it must be really good!  I had a guanabana drink and that was really yummy too!  Made me reminiscence of our time in Costa Rica.  Someday Cuba, we shall meet!  In short, I think this would be a great place for a girl's (or boys) night out.  The one star off is because it was VERY noisy in the restaurant so I could barely have a quiet conversation with the hubby.  But if you are with your group of girls, then this would be perfect; especially since you know y'all are gonna get real loud after that second mojito! )  P.S.:  And what a great location!  Right in the mall with the Trader Joe's, etc."}
{"text":"I really like their tacos and sangria. Never had a bad experience! Sometimes very loud and crowded."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are outstanding.  Used to stop at Dukes every time I was on the West Coast to get my fill, now I can drive 15 minutes!  Spicy Guac is very good with chips and the service is always good."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you eat, but as for me, it's usually the skirt steak or the rum-infused pork.  The Caipirinha's are damn good here too and as far as I'm concerned, go eat in the bar so you can people watch that much better.  Ask for Mike.  The food is awesome and the prices are more than fair for the quality.  It's a regular for me when I visit Cleveland.  Wow!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible in the annoying ways.  For instance it took close to 30 minutes for us to get our drinks and guacamole with chips.  Contrary to the posts the gauc was fine but nothing special and the plantine chips were also good but they were cold. By the time they arrived we were all so hungry it didn't matter.   Two of us ordered Capriahana which were terrible.  The small glasses were only three-quarters filled and the drinks tasted like someone had dumped in a half cup of white sugar.   Our entrees were ok but very greasy and heavy - even the vegitarian meals felt incredably heavy.  The menu actually had cool stuff on it but the execution was miserable.  Lastly, we never got any water unless we ask for it.  One of the folks at our table didn't drink so we were constantly stopping an employee for water.  The prices were ok.  Overall, I'd say if you want a kind of upscale Olive Garden - a  not very good chain restaurant with a Latin and Brazilian theme."}
{"text":"This was a really good restaurant.  The server was polite and the food was timely.  I got the fish tacos, guac, and margarita.  I would say that the value simply isn't there for the cost.  I won't be going back, it's just to expensive."}
{"text":"I'm really torn about my rating for Paladar. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but when I came for lunch in about May, my experience wasn't the greatest. The food was nowhere near as good as it had been in all my visits before, starting with gummy calamari and cold tacos. However, my most recent happy hour visit was great, so hopefully that afternoon was just a fluke.   I'm a huge fan of Paladar's happy hour - delicious mojitos and perfect little appetizers for a good price! I typically order the pomegranate-ginger mojito, but I recently tried the mango mojito and it was just as good."}
{"text":"Came here for pre-dinner drinks and apps with my mom, my best friend from high school, and her mom for our annual-ish Thanksgiving time get together.  I ordered a caiparainha (yes i know it's spelled wrong), and there were rum drinks, margaritas, and a porter scattered around the table.  And we got guac and salsa.  Our waitress was attentive at first then once she realized we weren't ordering entrees and more drinks, sorta abandoned us for the table of party girls next to us.  That's okay.  We were headed to Bravo afterward anyway.  The guac was all right - not anything special - but the plaintain chips were delish,  Would I return?  Doubtful, seeing as I'm home rarely and there are many other restaurants to try.  But I'm glad I gave it a shot - my drink wasn't too sweet, per request, and the guac tasted like what I make at home.  But with a bigger price tag."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a meeting in the area, enjoyed the happy hour deals.  I wouldn't consider this a full review, since I didn't have a genuine \"meal\"...  $5 mojitoes (among other choices) and $5 apps.  The mojito was excellent; crisp & refreshing.  We shared 3 apps, chips and guac (regular), cuban sandwich, and blackened fish tacos.  Guac was very good, but the chips were a real treat - corn, taro & plantain  chips make for a great random mix of flavor & texture.  The fish taco was delicious, a generous portion for $5.  I'd maybe remove just a bit of the slaw & veggies so the filing ratio was a little heavier on the fish, but that's a nitpick.  Really good cuban sandwich; makes me wonder why you don't see this on more menus.  I'm looking forward to a return visit, but the happy hour bar deal was so good, it's almost hard to imagine coming here for a full dinner."}
{"text":"Been to Paladar several times for lunch and never been disappointed - food and service is consistently great.   Fish tacos are excellent, definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Awful...Drinks were weak...server average...food not all that tasty...go to Taza or Pacific East in the same plaza instead...   I do not know why people love it here so much.  Trying again Wednesday...I am told I ordered the wrong thing..."}
{"text":"Met a friend for happy hour, which is daily from 4-7. They have a decent happy hour menu.. $5 mojito, sangria. $2 off wine and beer. $6 for 2 tacos, $4 for chips and guac, plantains, chips and salsa sampler. Just to name a few.   Started off with a traditional mojito which was a little too sweet for me. My friend and I ordered the braised beef and fish tacos and split one each. They were both pretty good.   It was packed. Being happy hour and only serving happy hour specials in the bar area we had to wait for two seats to open but we didn't mind much. The atmosphere was really buzzing. But in the bar area that was ok too! Service was great, didn't have to wait, they were prompt. Good order came out very fast.   I would definitely like to go back and explore the menu! I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour either! Since I totally forgot to snap a few pics I will make up for it when I return!"}
{"text":"Great experience and fun for the entire family as we ate there the night after Valentines. Great drinks and food. We will be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"It was great. Coming from Miami and picked up a meal here in Cleveland. The pao de queijo (cheesy bread) was delicious. I ordered the Argentinian Grill, the chimichurri was perfection. All of the servers were excellent. It was a great team. I'll be back later for some Cuban coffee."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu similar to the Inn on Coventry but different presentation and stature. My group enjoyed and indulged in the bottomless mimosas. I ordered the crispy duck confit and fried egg (over medium) hash. Delish! We'll be returning again."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my boss on a Monday night. It was crowded, but we were still able to be seated immediately. I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't very hungry, but I still ended up finishing most of my meal. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but they had roasted pork (mojo pork) on the menu, so I had to try. There were crunchy bits, and very tender bits, just the way I like. It was delicious."}
{"text":"If your into happy hour you may want to try this place.   The first important thing to know is that they have two happy hours from 4 to 7 and then again from 9 to 11, awesome I know.  Their chips are a mix of plantains, yucca, and tortilla. Also the sangria and margarita are well worth their happy hour price of $5"}
{"text":"Two of my friends are getting married this weekend in Cleveland and they picked Paladar as the site of their rehearsal dinner. I was really surprised to see some of the other reviews b/c everything was spectacular!   To accommodate the 45 guest, Paladar set up a pre-fixe menu starting with a chips with housemade guacamole and a mista salad. The guac was really fresh tasting and the variety of chips were a welcomed change from the standard Tostitos offerings of other restaurants. There was one chip that had flecks of chocolate baked into it - absolutely delicious! The salad was really light and quite refreshing.   Guests were able to choose either the Slow Roasted Pork \"Cubano\", the Grilled Skirt Steak Churrasco, and the Slow Smoked Chicken as their main dish. Rather than be limited to only one dish, two friends and I split the three offerings and we weren't disappointed. My favorite by far was the Cubano, which was rum glazed, tender and melted in your mouth. The meat was paired with some slightly spiced black beans and a delicious coconut mango rice dish. I was also really pleased that the flavors of my meal mixed really well with the mojito I ordered - maybe a little too much mint leaves in the drink, but that is honestly the only thing I could think of that was less than ideal.  Then, to cap off the meal, we had a choice between the Chocolate Cake or the Coconut and Caramel Flan. Not much a fan of Flan, I opted for the cake. I do love chocolate, but tend to avoid cakes b/c outside of specialty dessert places, I haven't found a cake that wasn't too dry or too heavy. However, if this was available anywhere else, I would order it in a heartbeat because it was just the right blend of moistness without being too heavy.   The servers were also really attentive to our tables and kept the drinks flowing. Granted, it was a giant party, so they had to have a lot of people to attend to us, but still, I was impressed.   Don't be fooled by this place being in a strip mall. If you find yourself in the Cleveland area, definitely check out this place. You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Here visiting in Ohio and was told to make sure I go to this spot.  Wow what a find.  The food was amazing!  The menu was full of things I had never tried before but was certainly intrigued to.  I did not try the rum but my dish along with that of my 2 friends was just simply divine.  I would absolutely make sure to try this spot when you're in town.  I did not have room for dessert but I am going to definitely try to go back just for the dessert."}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch combo here today, chicken tortilla soup and a half of a cubano sandwich.  My wife had the chimicirri chicken sandwich which she said was delicious!  The atmosphere was very nice too, and parking was not a problem at the time we were there, though it looks like it might be at other times."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to frequent. The main dishes blow us out of the water every single time! They come with the root vegetable chips which are so good, and the flavor of everything is so good. We tried the tacos which are supposed to be a favorite, but would skip next time in order to have the main dish experience. Too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice and the food was not impressive either time.  The atmosphere was the most pleasant aspect of the experience.  The food was very disappointing.  Update!!!  This company has completely turned it around. I have visited Palador three times in the past two weeks, and all times were great. The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and attitudes were excellent. My wife and I look forward to visiting Palador in the future. They have jumped from two stars to five stars."}
{"text":"Ate here last week with the work crew. Super hip, sexy, and trendy. Service was super duper for our 7+ group. Cool nifty diverse and and authentic menu. We had some killer apps, guacamole and ceviche. My meal was tasty and the rest of the group liked their food. Nice monitor and a great experience."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, service, and atmosphere! Guacamole trio, blueberry vanilla mojito, jerk chicken entree, and sweet potato donuts were all delicious, and I can't wait to go back and try more! The fish tacos were also a fav at the table."}
{"text":"I'm still a newbie to Paladar (only have been there a couple times) but absolutely adored it. Food was delicious, service super friendly and we had a great time. I have all positive things to say.  I ordered the glazed pork cubano on this visit based on previous Yelp recommendations (oh imagine that). It was very good and I'm glad I tried something new since I seem to have the bad habit of finding something I like and ordering it EVERY time.   With the guacamole appetizer and side of fried plantains I was more than full by the end of the meal and couldn't finish everything.   I had a mojito and that was delicious as well. I need to plan another trip to try some of the different rums on their menu.   Definitely recommend. I went with my family and everyone enjoyed their dinner. YUM."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the bar a couple nights ago. The restaurant is located inside of a mall. They have a late happy hour menu, so that allowed me to try three dishes at an affordable price. I had the mussels, regular crispy tostones, lamb meatballs, and a regular mojito. I am a huge sucker for mojitos, so I was really excited to see yelpers rave about that. With that said, the mojito tanked. Not even remotely good...   All dishes tasted like typical bar food. Not terrible, but nothing memorable. I think it's got a nice atmosphere for hanging out with friends, but I definitely wouldn't make a trip here just for the food. Since I'm on business travel alone, I'd avoid coming back here for the rest of my trip. My total bill was under $30, so at least I have that going for me! I'd recommend coming here for an affordable night out with the buddies, but that's about it."}
{"text":"First time at Paladar! I took a friend from out of town and we had a great time. Our server was a little absent, but we didn't care too much. It was a beautiful day and we sat outside on their patio (which is super nice).  We had the Wild Corniva & Avocado Ceviche and it was really tasty! Very citrus-y and had a small kick.  Slow Roasted Chicken Empanadas were probably my least favorite item we tried. They were \"meh.\" Hardly anything inside of them. Mostly just the dough-y shell.  Chorizo & Cheese pupusa's were decent. The sauce and slaw are tasty, but the texture of the chorizo was a bit grainy.  We also got the traditional guac and the mango salsa. Both were good! I will probably get a few add-ins for the guac next time. The mango salsa was nice and cold and sweet. It was kind of like dessert, so we saved it for last. The accompanying chips were (strangely) a highlight! They're a mix of corn chips, plantain, zucca, and another root vegetable (starts with an \"M\" and I can't recall the exact name). They were a good step up from normal bread or plain chips from somewhere else.  But for dessert, we also got the bread pudding! We didn't realize there were raisins in it (we both hate raisins) but we didn't even notice because it was so tasty! The dessert itself was dense and rich. The caramel sauce is a decadent addition.  The happy hour looks awesome. I wish I were closer to try it out!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite happy hours. The food on the menu is very tasty and affordable. They do not skimp on the portion sizes.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The pork chop is great and the short rib dish is also a winner in my book. Im.not sure how they get it so tender. However, the second tinge I ordered the short rib it was dry and stringy. After returning it I ordered the cocunut shrimp dish was suprisingly tasty. The beef plantain appetizer is so good. I think I've tried pretty much every flavors mojito  I didn't care for the half mango chicken because it was so dryand the guacamole was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting a lot more bold flavors than what we got. Black bean soup was just smashed black beans not much flavor. The chicken taco & duck were just ok. The blackened fish tacos were good. Guacamole trio was very good. The roasted pulled pork was moist and had a good flavor. The best part was the extra aged trio of rum. I don't know that I would drive 45 minutes again just to eat here.  We did have a great server, she took very good care of us."}
{"text":"Few recommendations I must add to the list:   1) Guac - either the special of the day, or their HOT one - with the root vegetable and plantain chips - amazing!   2) Blackened Tilapia Tacos - YUM!   3) Butternut Squash Soup - perfect thing to help you warm up on a cold day!"}
{"text":"You know how you travel out of town and try new restaurants and after you're done with your epicly delicious meal there's a slight moment of mourning? Mourning because you know once you go back home you'll crave something you can't have? Well yeah...that's what Paladar did to me-and I'm still grieving.  GAH their food is soo good! And so are their drinks! I had about 4 different cocktails,  but you can't judge me b/c I wasn't driving. I think one of the reasons I love Paladar so much is b/c of their super bold flavors.  I absolutely adore Latin food, and Paladar gave me the chance to try some really amazing dishes.  What did I order?-Chorizo and cheese pupusas, chimichurri grilled lamb chops, and boy oh boy was it amazing. The pupusas were definitely different that the pupusas I've tried at other places, but different in a GOOD way.  The chimichurri grilled lamb chops were served atop of spaghetti squash which I also love! Those lamb chops were some of the best I'd ever eaten.  If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   I would say the majority of things I have tasted here were pretty awesome. Love the guac with different kinds of chips. The Rum Glazed Cuban Pork and Braised Beef Ropa Vieja are excellent, also need to try the mojitos which are great and definitely affordable during Happy Hour. Only downside was that I thought the desserts were on the small side.   Ahhh I almost forgot they had these delicious jalapeno ball things covered in honey for their special Mardi Gras menu. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Went for appetizers and drinks at the bar (which we have done before, too).  Bartenders were attentive and personable.  Had some happy hour drinks and appetizers.  Guacamole and chips were solid as usual, and tried the chorizo and cheese pupusa for the first time - very nice.  Paladar will normally set you back a few bucks, but the happy hour specials helped to keep the bill reasonable."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE - not sure if they were having a rough day but we were extremely disappointed with our food and experience. The restaurant was not that busy but we waited almost an hour for our food, which was very bland. My Mom and sister got the Americano breakfast and said the yucca tasted like pan cleaner and the coffee creamer was spoiled. The service was just as terrible... server was no where to be found most of the lunch. Used to be one of our favorite places but can't see us returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Food is great!! The waiter was horrible. Victor was the waiter and it was like pulling teeth to get him to come over. When he did come his attitude was like that of a snail.   Like I said though the food was terrific. Will go back for the food, but not the same server."}
{"text":"Generally tasty food at a reasonable price. They offer a nice happy hour menu and have a large selection of rums. The servers and bartenders are always friendly, and the kitchen is quick."}
{"text":"Very bland food. No seasonings on anything. The beef tacos were putrid we had to send them back. The mango coconut rice had no flavor to it. The only tasty thing on the menu were the fish tacos. also we had the rudest most uninterested waitress. Return, Me thinks not!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting here a couple months ago. The guacamole apps were good and the jerk chicken was fantastic."}
{"text":"Have been to Paladar many times.  The food is terrific, something for everyone.  I loved the sweet potato tacos but they've since been taken off the menu.  Guacamole is yummy!  The service is not always that great, lots of long wait times, inattention to requests.  I'd still say give it a try!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times, never really enjoyed the food, never had good service, never left and said \"well that was worth it\". Good atmosphere because it's usually busy, but many times too busy."}
{"text":"After avoiding Paladar for years because it's a place I associate with my entire high school meeting there for unofficial night before Thanksgiving reunions, I went for lunch last week and was super impressed. Who knew after all of that avoidance I had been missing out. Opps...  I really enjoyed the mojitos. My friends and I sampled a few different kinds and the watermelon basil was my fave. It was slightly sweet and the basil lent a very fresh taste.  Our table started out with the traditional guacamole, which was delicious and simple, however no different than a guac I would make at home. The homemade chip blend was really special and a whole lot more exciting than the guac.  Highlights from my table included the blacked fish tacos (could have used some more spice), hearts of palm salad, and the skirt steak salad. I look forward to heading back for another go at the menu."}
{"text":"We were heading to Mitchel's Fish Market for dinner at the Eton Collection and we saw this place full of people. We changed courses and sat outside for some magaritas and mojitos.  It was Cinco de Mayo!  Our waiter was awesome. Jed was his name.  He recommended the mini tacos for some appetizers, so we tried one of each kind of meat, pork, chicken, beef and fish.  Fish was the best.  Loved the fact that they didn't use the traditional corn taco shells. They used Taro root!  The usual basket of chips had taro root, yucca and plantains on top of the corn chips.  I had the slow cooked chicken for dinner and it was good and there was a lot of it.  I think I barely finished half the plate as it came with plantains and some corn cake.   Atmosphere was good. Looks like a happening place for singles.  Sitting outside wasn't so great because of the wind. It kept blowing the water from the water fountain on us.  Everything was great except for some bad advice from the busboy. We had a flight at the Cleveland airport later that night and we asked the busboy how long it took to get to the airport from the restaurant.  He said 10 minutes.  We trusted him and didn't check google maps on the phone. Turns out, we are 30 minutes from the airport. So I drove all fast and furious to the airport, while my coworker checked us in online using a blackberry and had the boarding passes emailed to us.  That plus no wait at the security line, we made it with 5 minutes to spare."}
{"text":"Paladar has all the elements I enjoy in a restaurant: good food, good drinks, good service and swanky decor.  My partner and I went with another couple late last Saturday night and had a great time.    We started with a round of drinks and a couple of shared appetizers.  My pomegranate caipiroska (think caipirinha with vodka instead of cachaça) was perfectly balanced and refreshing.  The chorizo and chihuahua cheese papusa (say that five time fast) and Cuban black bean soup had excellent flavor.  With the waiter's assurance, I also tried the Havana Side Car martini made with rum instead of cognac.  Very, very nice - it went down really smooth.  For dinner, I ordered the \"Ocho Hora\" Braised Short Rib and my partner had the Braised Beef \"Ropa Vieja\".  The short rib was fall-off-the-bone tender and accompanied with yummy sides.  The braised beef was incredibly satisfying and came with traditional Latin sides like black beans and plantains.  Mmm...  I didn't personally try my friends' slow-smoked chicken or salmon, but they both vouch for their dishes.  The space at Paladar is very cool.  The bar area is well-lit and playful with ample seating for those after work, before dinner cocktails.  The main dining area is very comfortable with a combo of chairs and banquettes overlooked by a color-shifting wall.  Another seating area is lit by a sparkling galaxy of Moravian star latterns.  It's an eccletic, upbeat space that feels special and accents the vibe from the crowd.  I look forward to visiting Paladar again on our next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We went her for Valentine's Day and I am glad we did! It is a great place. The atmosphere was amazing. Our waiter was great. He made wonderful recommendations. The Jerk chick and plantains were great for the appetizer. It was grilled to perfection. My herb chicken with garlic kale and yuca fries were excellent. He had the chops and loved it. The deserts looks good but we decided on mocha coffee and as the remainder of the meal was good. The drinks were good. Pomegranate margaritas are fabulous. If you want a good meal and nice atmosphere go here!!! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"OKay so if you don't have reservations don't worry. It was a friday night and we waited about 15 minutes for a table for four. The bar area was definitely busy, but also doable in about 15 mins. I had the pomegranate-ginger mojito.. DELISH! the ginger is very subtle and its not too sweet. The fresh sugarcane is a great touch!  We ordered the trio guacamole.., black bean and goat cheese, spicy and regular. I wasn;t a big fan of the former, it was tooo sweet. But the latter too were very good and I loved the chips they were served with.  Next I had the chicken empanadas. They were okay. I've definitely had better.  Didnt have dessert but did have a second mojito! I would def come back, as there were so many other entres that looked good on the menu! all in a great atmosphere, with very good drinks, great guac and average entres."}
{"text":"This is the newest member to my best of NE Ohio list!  Very diverse flavors.  Interesting entrees, appetizers and desserts.  I admit that I haven't done a rum flight yet, but it's only because I can't get past their excellent margaritas.  Happy Hour is worth checking out - discount drinks and appetizers that could easily make a meal.  Their queso fundido is among the best that I have tried.  Fish tacos are very fresh and flavorful.  The chips that you receive are made from a variety of non-gluten items.  Worth a trip (or more) just to explore the complex flavors on the menu."}
{"text":"This should be 3 and 1/2, but, well, you know the drill.  Trendy looking spot.  a nice date night location.  Started with the cirvice.  I'm torn on this.  Citrus was spot on, presentation was very nice, and quantity was generous.  I guess the let down was all the seafood variety in there was pretty bland.  For the meal I had the rum glazer pulled pork.  It was very good and the rice they paired was spot on.  Better half had the skirt steak with chimichuri sauce.  No complaints from her at all.  Finished with bread pudding and pineapple upside down cake.  Both were fine, but not memorable.  I would recommend this for date night."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time giving this place a rating. The food is good, but it's not worth the price I'm paying for it. Because of that, I never really feel the need to come here although many of my friends love this place.  With that said, i wanted to give it a high grade because of their mojito. Paladar makes the BEST mojito in town!"}
{"text":"We came in 14 strong with a reservation, and they had our table ready on time and everything. Our server handled our big party respectably. Wait time for service and food wasn't long given how busy it was on a nice Saturday evening.  I didn't know what to order because nothing jumped off the menu to me. That's when our waiter came to the rescue and recommended the \"Ropa Vieja\" appetizer (Cuban braised beef served over plantains and topped with red onion, jicama slaw, and spicy aji pepper sauce) and the Jamaican Curried Shrimp entrée (shrimp and chorizo with red beans, brown rice, and plantains in a coconut curry sauce). Both were wonderfully presented and tasting amazing as well. The ropa vieja was braised to perfection. A lot of restaurants prepare plantains poorly but Paladar does it right, at least in the ropa vieja. The red onions were not overpowering and meshed well with everything else. The dish was, dare I say, perfect? The Jamaican curried shrimp did not disappoint either. Way more shrimp than most restaurants will give you, and they were succulent and tasty. The curry sauce was on point as well.  The price is kind of steep at this place for both the drinks and the food. I guess that's to be expected, but I had to dock a star for that. Also, all beer is bottled, no draft. People come here for the cocktails/liquor though, and those looked impressive and were reportedly strong. Overall, I did love the place and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst dining experiences of my life. In addition to taking an hour for our entrees, they cancelled my open table reservation giving me no points. The food was cold and practically inedible. My moms margarita was full of salt. Why people come here is beyond me."}
{"text":"Great place to find unique to Caribbean flavor as well a great Rum tasting menu. We are a big fan of getting three or five of their happy hour appetizers along with one of their rum flight s and sharing. Everything was excellent except queso fundido was so so. As an added bonus I believe that part of Yelp dining program!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Paladar and was disappointed with their happy hour after a very nice first experience. I expressed my feelings on yelp, and their manager reached out to me asking that I give them another chance, and offering me a gift card to try them again. I wrote back and said it wasn't necessary, but if he wanted to send me one, I would be happy to return, and I provided my address. I never heard another thing from him. If you are going to the trouble of trying to improve customer satisfaction, please follow through. Now I would never go back, and I'll relate this story to all that ask."}
{"text":"Expensive, loud, and bad service.  2 of the 4 entrees at my table came out wrong. It took 15 more minutes to get the correct food. Service was inattentive. Food runner had no idea about the special dietary needs at my table (we had stressed them to the server). No communication seemingly between front and back of house.  Ugly decor. Loud music (made my head pound).  You could not pay me to go back to Paladar."}
{"text":"The sangria gets a lot of love here, but if you're inclined I would also try the rum punch. I really enjoy the ambiance here as well as the service. It's a nice \"go-to\" spot if you're from the area."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks and great service! Came here with a group for a birthday celebration and they were very accommodating. The dragonberry mojito (their current special) was my favorite of the drinks we all ordered. I got the mango cilantro mojito but I didn't really taste any mango or cilantro, it was all sugar. The blackened fish tacos were pretty good, not the best I've had but definitely scrumptious. I will go back to try their ropa vieja because it looks mouth-watering."}
{"text":"Paladar is okay. Good drinks and decent food but it's rather overpriced given that everything really is just okay. The service has always been mediocre. The happy hour is decent but it's only available in the bar, which is seriously unfortunate since during happy hour it's tough to get a seat there given the limited seating. Despite the downsides it is very conveniently located and has a nice environment and lovely patio. The place is always packed but I wouldn't recommend seeking Paladar out. If you're on Chagrin Blvd. and need a place to grab a drink check it out, but don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"Fair food, indifferently prepared.  This used to be a place which served creative, delicious food-but no more.  Save you money and time."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour!!!  Drinks and food are solo good.  Strayed with a monitor and blackened fish tacos.  Next course, sangria with some queso fundido and roasted chicken empanadas. I will come back for sure the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had another great dinner last night at Paladar. The food is always good and there are items on the menu that you just don't see at other places. I had the Fejuada (sp) stew and it was really good. It isn't cheap but it isn't way out of line either. The service can be a little spotty (strictly depending on who you get) but otherwise this is always an enjoyable night out. One thing - they need to explain to their servers the difference between Habanero and Chipotle."}
{"text":"Paladar used to be without question one of my top restaurants to visit when we really wanted a special night.  Although the food still remains very good, the service and housekeeping seems to have slipped.  Our server was not an experienced server and neglected the table while plates from other courses built up.  Salads served with meal.  Also, had a strange fruit fly nuisance throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  We love the different flavored Mojitos.  Last night I had the mussels for my dinner with the house salad and my hubby had the salmon with spatzal.  I don't like salmon as its just too fishy for me but I do try it every time he orders it and I have to say it was not fishy at all.  I would actually order it from here.   The guac with chips is also a must!  Delish!"}
{"text":"The tone of the visit was set when the waiter could only recommend the most expensive drinks on the menu.  First he started by recommending the $18 Rum flights, then suggested, if the flights weren't for me, I should get the most expensive individual glass of Rum.  Even if they happened to be the most awesome and flavorful drinks they had, his insistence put me off completely.  I don't think he appreciated my whipping out the phone to look up reviews of the Rums, then finding that the best from their list, in fact, wasn't the most expensive (it was the Zaya Gran Reserve 12 y Trinidad).  During entree ordering, he pushed salads and soups on us in addition to our entrees.  This was fine by me, if it wasn't for the fact that the soup gave me instant runs and kept on the John through most of the entree.  In their defense, my coworker didn't have problems with the same soup.  I was visiting from out of town, so the yelp one star \"Eek! Methinks not\" accurately describes my inclination to go again ..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I didn't get a chance to sit in and enjoy the delightful settling as I had my food to go since I was on my lunch break. I had ordered the lunch special for the blackened fish wild cobia, pickled onion & pineapple slaw, cilantro aioli with my choice of side as the chipotle bean soup. The tacos were very refreshing and tasty! The soup was tasty as well. It seems as if this restaurant finds very filling but healthy options which is very good! Also, 7% cash back is always a plus!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered some food to be delivered to my home because we're moving and don't have time to sit and eat.  I ordered thr lamb burger. First, the bread was so mushy, I had to peel the mish off. After the first bite, the lamb completely fell apart, so I needed to get one of our buns. Put three pieces of lamb on a plainbun. Not exactly what I wanted for lunch. The fries? There was legitimately 14 fries in the container 14! I will not be ordering from here again. Too many issues."}
{"text":"Whenever we want a sure thing, we go to paladar. Great food, with new items added and the classics, lovely staff, and a fun vibe. I've had friends say the mojitos here are better than the ones in keywest! Great place to enjoy your night,  can't beat it."}
{"text":"I love paladar!  I do not live in Cleveland anymore but I come here every time I visit, even if it is just for a weekend! The food here is so delicious and the servers are always really friendly.   My favorites:  - guacamole - They have a guacamole trio that you can get and try 3 kinds! The chips that come with the huac are also really good.   - fried plantains - These are so tasty and you should for sure get a side of these or substitute one of your side for these!   -   The chicken tacos- These are so good! They come with brown rice but I like to substitute for the mango coconut rice! It is so much tastier and fun!   They also have good drinks and a nice little bar area. The mojitos are all delicious, and the traditional mojito is actually really good!   I"}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my birthday at Paladar and have to say I wish I had looked elsewhere.   To start, I was really taken aback at how rude the hostess was, even when she knew we were there for a special occasion. She let someone outside of our reservation party waive our table on the inside,  misquoted the time to get reseated by double (I know this is not always straightforward but we would've went elsewhere had we known how long it would actually take), and continued to act borderline hostile with us for the rest of the night.   Luckily our waiter was much friendlier, albeit a little absentminded. The food is alright, but not for the prices considering what you can get in Cleveland for the same investment. I personally had a margarita, a quinoa burger, and flan. The latter was excellent, however the burger wasn't proportioned well (way too much quinoa for the rest of the stuff on there) and the margarita was very average, especially for the price.   The ambiance in Paladar is decent: you can get a good amount of energy for a weekday night in the suburbs, but that energy is mostly bougie old people (think orange moms meeting their high school friends for a drink and lots of middle age guys in expensive but ugly button downs). All in all, wouldn't avoid this place if a friend was set on coming, but not coming back on my own volition any time soon."}
{"text":"Brunch on Saturdays is the absolute best! My new favorite dish is their chicken and cornbread. Great take on chicken and waffles. Also, BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here with a coworker and her husband. It was pretty busy, but not overly noisy. The decor was fairly trendy and not particularly \"Latin,\" but nice enough.   We had the traditional guacamole, which was very good. I really liked the combination of different chips they provide. Next time I visit hopefully it will be with a larger group allowing me to order and try other types of guacamole and appetizers.   I had the Brazilian stew for my entree. It was great. It was a little spicy, but not overpowering. I wish I had more right now.   The prices aren't cheap, but certainly are fair for what Paladar serves. I'll definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great guacamole!  Good tacos but there's so much more. I suggest trying either of the stews, or anything with the braised beef which is fantastic.  Also - rum.  Great runs you can't find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here for happy hour and it was packed. There were a few groups of people waiting for a table and two opened up.... so the restaurant took them out of the bar area??? We left.... too much chaos trying to find a table and get a drink."}
{"text":"Had our company function and as usual the service and the food were amazing! Prices are set very well. I would highly recommend Paladar's!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Paladar numerous times since they opened and in recent years the service has gone downhill.  The wait staff are all pleasant but slow and the food service is equally as slow too.  On several occasions we've witnessed staff standing around chatting with each other by the drink station when we were waiting to be waited on or for a particular need.   We were there last weekend and tonight and it was no different. Our waiter disappeared several times while we were waiting for him to bring us things. We asked for a regular milk and a chocolate milk for our kids and got 2 chocolate milks. We asked for ketchup for the kid's food and he disappeared and then never brought any ketchup. Maybe take out is the solution? The food is usually good. My fish tacos were fine but largely bland. I expected a little more robust flavor for Cuban cuisine. It didn't seem to be seasoned. At home we eat mostly ethnic food ranging from southwestern and Latin to Indian, so we're not the average bland Midwesterners (if that makes any difference).  Will we go back? Sure, but probably just to pick up and take away."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! Definitely 5 stars- the ambiance is great! Real packed which is proof that it is a great place.  I had the plantain crusted tilapia with mushroom grits and garlic roasted spinach on the side.  My date had the chicken breast with salsa (amazing) on the side.  Desert was the BEST part- do not miss out on the tres chocolate layered cake!  Great Great place-service was great!"}
{"text":"Ceviche and black bean soup are super good!  Service is great, too!"}
{"text":"The manager was gracious enough to send us a gift card to try out their famous guac trio and we finally got around to hitting up Paladar again last month to celebrate some very good news.   The trio was incredible and the plantain chips were a uniquely superb way to enjoy the flavorful guacamole sampler. I got the tacos again and they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Paladar is one of my new go-tos in Cleveland.  I've been 3-4 times, now, and each experience has been 4-star.  Really great, but just short of perfect.  Nothing in particular to keep it from 5-star territory, it's just not THAT good.  The atmosphere is great - \"clean and contemporary\" as Jamie said, but certainly not overly trendy.  A place you feel good to be inside.   Service has always been top notch.  The servers seem to know the menu well, and even if they're faking it, they seem to have favorites they're passionate about.  I've yet to have a bad recommendation.  I've had the 8-hour short rib on corn grits, the skirt steak, and one of the chicken dishes (and bites of plenty of others from generous friends).  Everything is very tasty.   Some of the food is predictable and somewhat unimaginative.  But, the spices that are used are so flavorful, that the food is predictably GOOD.  I'm not complaining about the food... you're just not going to say, \"I never would have imagined these flavors together.\"    The short rib on corn grits may be my favorite... it is just incredibly rich and comforting.  But the skirt steak is right up there - it has a sharper flavor that is well-complemented by the delicious beans.  On this dish, the rice falls flat but is a good filler.   The mojitos and margaritas are both very good.  I'm usually a \"spring for the premium version\" kind of guy, but there's no need unless you're trying to impress someone or your palate is just that sophisticated.  Both drinks are refreshing and delicious in \"base model\" form.  All in all, Paladar is an easy choice for entertaining friends, or just a fun date night out.  I'd love to see some turnover on the menu and for the executive chef to challenge his patrons to enjoy some more inventive flavor combinations, but I'm nit picking.  It's always an above-average, very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant.  I love the decor. You like guac?  They have a Guac of the Day and other flavors to choose from.  The Chips that come with the guac are an array of bananas, tortillas and root veggies thinly sliced and fried to perfection.  The dinners are what I come for.  They have a great Jalapeño Spiced Lamb Stew, that is spicy, tender and delicious.  The Braised Beef Ropa Vieja is another favorite of mine. It comes with rice and black bean and sweet bananas, which balance the flavors nicely.  Dessert is a must - sweet potato donuts with caramel dipping sauce.  If you are drinking, they have the Caipirinha -Brazil's national cocktail: Cuca Fresca Cachaça with muddled lime and sugar, served on the rocks.  Its a strong drink and not for everyone but I love them."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Nice outdoor seating as well for the summer. While waiting I walked around the nearby mall with my group and received a call on my cell when it was time to return which was super convenient.   The waitress Sholonde was outstanding. Super helpful, polite and attentive. We had to skip dessert to visit grandma so she joked that we'd bring her dessert next time from grandma.   The beef tacos were great, lots of flavor. Chicken tacos were meh though and I wouldn't recommend it.   Only bad part of the meal was a bird pooped on me :/. Thankfully it wiped off easily and I changed my seat. Otherwise everything was great!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have been there twice and both times were great.  The drinks are great too and they have an amazing selection of rum.  I think I have a new favorite restaurant for when I visit CLE."}
{"text":"Went yesterday sat on the patio to enjoy the sunshine. Service was very slow and seemed uninformed as to what was on the menu. We decided on the special guac that month which is chipotle corn. As always super fresh and the chipotle honey was a nice added sweetness. Next we ordered the chicken empanadas because we had made empanadas from scratch but the flour she used was 2 years old and didn't taste very good outside of the filling. The empanadas were golden brown and tasted good not great it lacked in the amount of filling. For drinks we ordered bottomless mimosas but while the name stated bottomless the servers slowness indicated that it was whenever she finally noticed our glasses were empty which seemed like she was racing with a snail. We ordered the salmon mango which was delicious with the right balance of acid to sweetness but the cuts of salmon seemed very uneven. Finally we ordered my favorite dish at here the rum glazed pull pork. It came out but with the wrong rice instead of the mango coconut rice it should have it had the cilantro which slightly changed the flavor profile I brought it the servers attention she had no idea that that was the rice that was supposed to come with it but she then ordered it for us and it set the whole dish off. Overall I highly recommend this place but for such a slow Sunday morning I do wish the service could have been better. The food was delicious as always and the beautiful girl that was with me really made the whole moment a very good memory"}
{"text":"We waited at least 10 minutes to be greeted by a server.  We placed our order and didn't get drinks for about another 10 minutes.  This was a late lunch, so the place was pretty dead and we only ordered water, no cocktails.  The food then took quite some time as well.  My burger came out cold and on a stale bun.  My son's burger was burnt to a crisp.  We sat so long we didn't feel like sending anything back.    Would definitely not go again."}
{"text":"I held my company Christmas luncheon at Paladar on 12/20/15. Our group consists of vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, and carnivours.  So, Palardar was the perfect place.  I am so happy that they were able to accommodate our group!  It was wonderful!  14 Adults and 7 children.  Paladar seated our group in a private section of the restaurant.    Chris was our server, and he is absolutely one of the best ever!  He was attentive, courteous, patient, and  knowledgeable.  With four little people running around, I don't know how he served us with such grace!   Michael helped us plan the event.  It was a joy to work with him.   Thanks to all of the Paladar associates that had a hand in providing us with a great dining experience.   If you ever have the opportunity to host an event, or just looking for a great place to eat, definitely give Paladar a try!"}
{"text":"Food was cold!!! Food was soggy!!   Service was good but food taste like it was from chain restaurant!!! Won't be back here again!!"}
{"text":"Off the charts food and service. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Happy hour, even on the weekend...awesome fish tacos, and cuban sandwich.  the drinks are great too.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Paladar about a half dozen times.  The food is usually good (my husband loves the Ropa Vieja), and although I've had issues with my meals being lukewarm at best most times; most menu items are pretty decent.    I cannot, however, say the same in regard to the happy hour bar menu.  On this particular visit, we just happened to be in the area and stopped in for a quick bit.  The mojito's were off and the margaritas were down right terrible (bright yellow?).  Not sure what was going on behind the bar.  Usually Omar is back there and the drinks are great!  This time I recognized some faces, but I wasn't familiar with any of them.  My guess is they were too busy laughing and carrying on, and couldn't be bothered to make a decent drink.  Now for the food....I will give it up for the fish tacos and salsa trio, they were delicious.  However, that was about it.  My husbands braised beef tacos were so sloppy and wet; he could have wrung them out.  The Cuban sandwich just shouldn't even be an option on the menu; it looks like something you'd be served at a local dinner.  I mean get why it's on there, a Cuban ham and cheese sandwich is a staple in Cuba, but it needs to be jazzed up somehow.  Finally the worst, the Tostones.  They were so greasy and disgusting I couldn't even eat them.  I cut into one and saw the grease poor off and that was the end of that.  I fully expected our waiter to ask if the Tostones were okay, since they hadn't been touched; but he said nothing.  He didn't even ask if we were done, just took the full plate away; it was almost as if he was use to people not eating them.  Just really weird.  We will be back, because of my husband's love for the Ropa Vieja, this is the only reason for 3 stars rating.  My advice is to avoid the bar menu and order off the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I am hooked on their guacamole!!! Love to eat here!!"}
{"text":"From the ambiance to the food, this place is unique and delicious. Unique in the sense that you don't find many upscale Latin American restaurants that don't specialize in Mexican cuisine.  This place brings together the foods from all over South America and merged them into a delicious blend.  Guacamole is pretty good, but I I got the lamb stew for the main course. It was quite good also, but I would say slightly over salted."}
{"text":"So, pro tip: this Paladar is no longer on Open Table. If you pull up the Open Table app and search for Paladar near you, you'll think you're pulling up this location, but really, its the one in Maryland. Be careful! They're now on Reso, which i've never heard of...  I want to give a huge shoutout to the manager here, Pete. Tonight, we were seated at a high-top table near the bar. My guest and I both were very uncomfortable in these seats. I have an injury and the high-top was irritating it. Even with a supposed 1 hour wait for a new table, Pete got us a regular table in the dining room so we were more comfortable. I love how he remembers his customers and is always willing to make your experience better.  Paladar continues to nail it every time with our meal. There's something so comforting about knowing that you can always count on any meal here to be super satisfying. I just adore Latin comfort food. Get me a strawberry margarita and the skirt steak or rum glazed Cuban pork, and i'll be your BFF. Everyone can easily love Paladar."}
{"text":"First off, I do have to say that I did not pay for my meal/drinks/coffee/anything else here I had when I was inebriated. My office's holiday party was here, so they picked up the tab. First off, service -- really, really good, even though they had to deal with about a dozen people/hypochodriacs whose dietary restrictions go from \"eat nothing with a soul\" to \"eat nothing with a shadow.\" Appetizers and entrees were delicious. They specialize in American-ized versions of Cuban favorites, and you gotta be crazy not to like anything from our fine Communist culinary artists to the south. I got the blackened fish tacos, which were the finest thing to hit my mouth during my entire holiday season, and that includes my mom's famous chicken gyros. I honestly wasn't paying attention to the prices, so this place might not be right for a twice-weekly jaunt, but if I want to treat myself, I will head back here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this establishment. We visited on a Tuesday night. The ambiance was great. I liked the space and the fact that there was a good number of people there. No one wants to walk into an almost empty or empty restaurant, especially during peak dinner hours.   I ordered the Paladar Burger with fries. I know - who orders a hamburger at a Latin restaurant? Me! That's who!! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The burger was moist and flavorful. My coworker had one of the other sandwiches, the Chimichurri Chicken sandwich with fries. Both of us really enjoyed our food. My hamburger was well seasoned and cooked just like I like, well done.   We will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I stop by to get my guacamole and Cuban rum glazed pull pork every time I am in town from CA. Great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"I have been back here a few times now and although the food is good, I can't see where I would call it great anymore. Maybe the first time or two I was just taken in by the place and large portions and the different kind of food. Don't get me wrong they have really good food and a great atmosphere but I can't keep it a 5 star level.   On our most recent trip I got the ropa vieja, which was very large and very good, and my husband got the pork chop with grits. You are never short on food here, it really is 2 meals in one so for the price, it's really not bad. I have to give credit, the pork chop was cooked very well and the sauce with the grits was really tasty.  The ropa vieja was good...but maybe not as fantastic as I thought it was? I would order it again for sure but there was something off?   Also, our service was not very good. We sat for a good 15 min before anyone came to take drinks or anything. They did make up for it by giving us free guac, which was a corn and something...and I would opt for the spicy one over that."}
{"text":"This restaurant's food is amazing. On my lunch hour I got the Chefs Special which was The CHORIZO & GOAT CHEESE BURGER. The entree had the following: Caramelized onions, pickled jalapeños, arugula, habanero crema, adobo fries. This sandwich was succulent and juicy and very satisfying for me. The goat cheese combined with the Chorizo gave this sandwich so many flavors that complimented one another. I wish this entree was on the menu permanently, but unfortunately it will be finished on June 18th."}
{"text":"Paladar is seriously one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland!  I don't even know where to begin.  The food is on point, the service friendly, quick, and professional.  The ambience of the place is perfect.    I've been multiple times, and have two different meals.  The first time I got the Feijoada Stew.  It was delicious and would definitely recommend it.  The second time I decided to try something different and got the Caribbean Rum Pork with sweet plantains, and I am glad I did! Possibly one of my favorite meals I've had at any restaurant.  It was an upscale spin on a classic Spanish dish, and it worked out perfectly.    I also tried one of their mojitos.  It was a mango cilantro mojito, and it was so good! I wish it was just a bit stronger, but maybe that's because I like my drinks strong.    Definitely recommend it, even if you don't like Latin food, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Paladar sucks.  Just like Chipotle they serve rice and beans with your choice of protein on top.  Everything tasted the same.  Never again would I go back."}
{"text":"Paladar is a decent Latin American restaurant in the Woodmere area. The flavors seem somewhat modified to appeal to an American palate, and I feel that there are some sauces that seem to overpower the natural flavors of some of the dishes. I got the duck confit, which was pretty good, but the green sauce seemed to really overpower the flavor of the duck and the eggs. We also had the mojo pork, and the pork was pretty good but the beans and rice did not seem to go well with the pork. The service was excellent, but ultimately for me, the most important part of the restaurant experience is the food. The food is tasty, but ultimately I feel there are better places in Cleveland to have similar Latin American food that also tastes better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Incredible high quality food, fantastic service and great value! I recommend going for happy hour or lunch time. The fish and/or chicken tacos with wedge salad and/or the pineapple rice is delicious! Don't forget to ask your server for lime hot sauce. They make it themselves. It's nice to sit outside with great people watching or inside at the bar area. First come, first serve, but the staff is usually good about watching out for an open seat if they know you want one and will even get you a drink while you wait. This quickly became our staple place to start or end a night out. Paul always has a smile and leads by example with excellent service, anticipating customer needs at the bar. You can't go wrong here. A sure thing."}
{"text":"Out here for a work trip and this California girl is going to miss this place!! I got the Argentinian Mix Grill. Amazing!! I will definitely be back as soon as I can get back out here!!  The Mojitos were a bit on the weak side though. Having a Rum Bar I expected better.   Food = Amazing Drinks = Meh"}
{"text":"Delicious pork chops and even better corn grits.  The quacamole  was tasty and fresh. Everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"I would dare to say that this is one of the best happy hours around the Beachwood area. There are plenty of drink specials, a wide variety of discounted food, and...a million and 5 people jammed into the bar area every time I stop by for happy hour. Siiigh.  Paladar gets extra points in my book for clearly labeling food on their menus. It makes it easy for vegans like me or people with food sensitivities to make good choices.   I'm deducting a star because happy hour is always so busy and service isn't the quickest. I've also been to Paladar for lunch and have had a couple painfully slow experiences, so...I'll just stick to happy hour. When I'm not on my work lunch break, I can afford to be more patient."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular! Filled with flavors and spices your mouth isn't accustomed to, which is why it's soo delicious! Try the pork and plantains, you will love it and the ceviche."}
{"text":"Great beans and rice. Mojitos were a good mix of flavors, just weak and pricey for my taste. My service in the bar was mixed with a confirmation of what I ordered had to seek additional help. I guess I was just another plate and ticket instead of a customer.  I might go back for a happy hour, but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous! I had the roasted pork that was magnificent w/ mango rice. It was basically rice with little chunks of mango. Odd combo but tasted great there wasn't a real strong mango taste to it just enough. Friend had the chicken and it came with plantains with a bit of spice to it. The lamb stew was good, it wasn't really gamey like most lamb is and it had a familiar but different taste, I couldn't put my finger on it. The service was great, our server was so polite she never wanted to interrupt us in our conversations. Bussers were really polite too. The interior design is lovely they have a wall that changes color from time to time, it is a wonderful atmosphere I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that likes to eat something different or needs a change of pace of what they been eating.  It was a good change of pace from eating steak, fish, and American/Asian foods. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Another good meal at lunch today.   The menu has been changed-for the better and the crowd noise at lunch is much more manageable.  Service was wonderful.  Every member of my group was pleased."}
{"text":"We were in town for Easter and a couple of friends took us here for dinner. We unfortunately didn't have a reservation so we had to wait a bit - but only 35 minutes, which wasn't too bad on a Saturday evening. One of the best parts of our dinner was the service. Our server Andre made all the right suggestions, brought dishes out at the right time, was attentive but not overbearing - really was just perfect.   We decided to start with the guacamole trio and a few drinks. The husbands tried the mojitos and the ladies wanted the red sangria. Andre suggested that we spring for a half carafe of sangria instead of separate glasses, which was cheaper than the 2 separate glasses and we got more. What a great suggestion! The guacamole was good - not the best I've had but good. I like my guacamole to have more cilantro and this had very little. The chips were really interesting - nothing like what I'm used to.   I ordered the chorizo, potato and goat cheese tacos and substituted the quinoa instead of frijoles because I'm not much of a bean person. The tacos were amazing, although I would have liked more goat cheese and should have ordered 100% corn tortillas (the half corn-half flour just tasted like flour tortillas to me). The quinoa was equally amazing, although extremely salty. It's a good thing I like salty foods!  At the end of the night our server was very persuasive about ordering their special dessert which was a plantain french toast. So we ordered one dessert with 4 forks. The french toast itself was good but not great, but the sauce we dipped/poured was to die for!   In the end it was a delicious meal that was slightly overpriced, but a great night to enjoy dinner  and a few drinks with close friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service! A party of 7 came here for a \"Welcome Home\" dinner for my sister. Everything from the drinks (Jalapeño Paloma was excellent), to the made to order guacamole sampler, to our entrees all exceeded our expectations. The waiting staff was professional and courteous, without seeming pushy or overwhelming. I'll definitely be making a second -- and a third -- trip back to Paladar"}
{"text":"5/26/18 Fantastic dinning experience! Great atmosphere. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They even brought out free sangria for everyone. The pomegranate, ginger and pineapple mojitos were all outstanding. Could easily have made a meal out of the delicious goat cheese guacamole. The Caribbean mango chicken was bursting with flavor. Definitely a salad worthy of making your entree. Adobo wild-caught shrimp & grits were amazing...a bit soupy, but had a great flavor. I typically have the rum-glazed Cuban pork, which is their signature dish. It hadn't been as good the last couple of times I went there, so I tried something new. Back up to a five star rating after this evening!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Mango Mojito's, guacamole, blackened fish tacos and sweet potato donuts.  All were incredible!"}
{"text":"great place for drinks and apps as well as happy hour! there decor is cool and trendy too. I have tried almost all their appetizers, but there chicken empanadas, and calamari are great. I have yet to find an entree there that i love tho. There drinks tho are very good, margaritas by the flavor as well as mojitos and other fruity concoctions are there by the dozens. Definitely a place to try for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Great mojito and some very interesting chips. The chicken in my salad was a bitter, but other than that the food was good. Great ambience too."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Paladar, and have been here several times. The only downside I've found to Paladar is that it gets strangely busy. Sometimes you can go in and get a table immediately, other times I've waited 20 minutes on Wednesday for a table.  The staff has always been very attentive (Alex was great last time) and good to recommend new things. I've had the skirt steak several times and it never disappoints. A great option if you are looking for delicious food, good service, and a convenient location."}
{"text":"The food here is good! There are a fair sure of vegan and vegetarian options, but be sure to clarify with your server and confirm your order. After a long wait time, my family ended up getting all the incorrect food, including chicken skewers instead of vegetarian ones.  Also--ASK for chips for the table! They're free but they don't set them out automatically. The chips are to die for!! Yucca, plantain, and tortilla all mixed in a cute basket.  The hearts of palm salad is good and so is the coconut mango rice. You can get made to order guac (a little pricey if you ask me, but not bad in taste), as well as variations of rice and beans. As a vegan, I always get the coconut curry veggies and never regret it!"}
{"text":"All I want to say is.... LATE NIGHT HAPPY HOUR. It's food only but that doesn't deter me. I mean their early happy hour is so good too."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit in less than 2 weeks.  Tim is exceptional; his drink and food recommendations for me are spot on!  Yesterday I asked him to 'surprise me' and he excelled  We were even able to enjoy the patio, but then we are hardy Clevelanders."}
{"text":"My wife and I always enjoy lunch at Paladar. Great drinks. Good food. Great service.  The watermelon basil Mojito, fresh guacamole as an appetizer, along with the chicken tacos finished up by the Cuban bread pudding was a delightful lunch.  I think I'll skip dinner."}
{"text":"A great place to find unique food in a sea of the usual American or Italian chain restaurants.  The quality of food was top notch and tasty.  So many of their menu items appealed to me and I look forward to future visits when I can try more of their creative dishes."}
{"text":"He food was good for happy hour. Definitely will return for dinner. The guacamole is a must."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, this part of town is a culinary wasteland replete with boring chains. So, when planning a work dinner for a party of 10, largely from out of town, this seemed to be the least of the evils. Yeah, it's a chain, but it doesn't pop up like weeds in every town on earth. The boss was buying, so I had to be respectful of his budget, too. I was assigned to pick out appetizers since I have a reputation as a food snob (go figure). We demolished the guacamole trio, the salsa trio, shrimp corn cakes, chicken empanadas, and calamari. All of those were solid. Entrees ranged from the giant pork chop to my vegetarian sweet potato soft tacos. The only hiccup was that the pork chops were a little pink in the middle, and those two people sent theirs back for a re-fire. Perhaps just a miscommunication, as the server did tell us that those were done medium with a pink center. My rice and beans were pretty standard, but I loved my sweet potato tacos. They were full of perfectly done veggies and a zesty crema. Service was really great, especially for a table of 10. Bottom line, I look like a rock star for picking out a place my coworkers were still talking about the next day, and this crotchety West Side food snob might even go back."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food I had in Cleveland.. Great ambience n great food.. I will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I love Latin food, and Paladar never disappoints. From the ever changing guacamole specials, to the delicious empanadas, to the large selection of entrees, I know I'll always enjoy eating there!   One of my very favorite entrees is the slow roasted mojo pork. A little bit spicy, incredibly juicy, and with enough just acidity. I end up getting it the majority of the time, even if I'd planned on trying something new! It's just too good! I know I'll end up leaving Paladar with a very full and satisfied stomach!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun interior atmosphere and a nice outdoor patio area too.  The food is a little adventurous for my typical comfort-zone ways, but I loved the mini cuban sandwich and guacamole dips that my friends and I sampled.  Service was a little spotty, but I suppose that could be blamed on the fact that it was pretty hopping when we were there, during Friday happy hour - which is not surprising, because their happy hour prices are incredible!"}
{"text":"Husband and I had a hot date (haha!) planned to donate blood at the Beachwood Community Center after work;  midday I received an email notification that he had made a reservation via Open Table for dinner at Paladar -- we were going to need to refuel and rehydrate after donating, and it's just minutes away, so cool by me.  The Eton shopping center parking lot is typically quite full, and it was again this evening, so I was dropped off at the door so as not to be late for our reservation time, and he parked the car.  I was seated right away, he joined me within a few minutes, and our server greeted us promptly.  She took our beverage orders, and kept my mango iced tea and his diet cola filled throughout our meal time.  The slaw that accompanied the blackened fish in my tacos was bright and flavorful, and I enjoyed the side dish of rice and black beans.  He ordered the ropa vieja (having had this on a previous visit, I can attest that this is a delicious, filling meal), mentioning that he does not care for beans or rice - our server immediately suggested that he could substitute a salad (another point for our server!).  The salad was gorgeous (and I assume it was tasty, because he ate all of it), but his ropa vieja still came with the beans and rice (most of which he was able to push to the side of the plate).  If you want a quiet, intimate, romantic-schmoozy dinner, this place is a bit loud for that;  we were able to hear each other as we talked over dinner, but we were also able to hear the folks at the tables around us - and able to ask the couple seated next to us what they had ordered, because it looked so good."}
{"text":"Good mojitos, and lots of different types of rum to choose from.  I had my first caipirinha here, and it was strong, and a little tart.  I had Leblon cachaca in it since it was supposed to be better than the cachaca 51, and though it was good, I think I like the refreshing minty taste of the mojitos better.  The happy hour here is a good deal- from 3-7 pm $5 mojitos and margaritas, and discounted appetizers.  I only tried one of the appetizers, the crab and mango cakes, and they were delicious.    For dinner, I tried some of the cuban pork and had the slow smoked chicken.  Both tasted great, lots of flavor and cooked till tender.  The corn cake that came with the meal was very salty and lukewarm though.  I tried some horchata at dinner as well, and I really have to say this is the worst horchata I've ever had, and the most expensive.  $4 for VERY watery, tasteless, milky colored liquid.    So would I go here again?  Sure, for happy hour and for the great rum drinks."}
{"text":"Have you ever anticipated an intriguingly named place only to be disappointed? Paladar was just such a place.  \"Rum Bar.\"  Doesn't it sound dark, mysterious?  Don't you envision an exotic tropical bar with stands of palm trees, cronies crowded around swapping stories of adventures long remembered? Wellllllll...not so much.  It's actually glass-walled, gleaming, high ceilinged and quite short of anything exotic.  Maybe they threw in the \"Rum BAR\" simply to rhyme with PalaDAR.  We planned a brunch run for our first ever Paladar Rum Bar experience. Having perused the menu online and finding gluten-free items, I was excited to see they had pupusas. I knew that would be part of my order, for sure.    What are they, you say?  Delightful pillows of masa harina dough flattened into almost English muffin size discs and grilled on both sides until crisp outside, tender inside.  Usually they're stuffed with cheese or meat or other fillings.  Fantastic!  And they have them at Paladar!  Except, for some reason they deep fry them. In a fryer with gluten items. What?! Why? Pass.  So what to order?  Hmmmm.  We started with the guac and chips of plaintains, yucca and malanga.  Okay, good start.  The chips especially were crisp and interesting.  The guac was good, was nothing extraordinary.  (Get extraordinary at Momocho!)  For the my brunch entree I decided to order traditional Brazilian feijoada.  I couldn't wait to try the roasted pork, spicy chorizo and black bean dish!  How could you go wrong?  But it was bland.  Even the \"spicy\" chorizo wasn't what a good chorizo should be.  And to think the waiter had bragged to us that the chorizo was one of the foods they got in that WASN'T FROZEN!  Wow.    My daughter ordered the Ropa Viejo.  She was similarly underwhelmed.  Maybe the frozen food issue is part of the problem, maybe they need better recipes.  Actually, I think I know the real answer.  We had both ordered the Paladar Bloody Mary which is described as \"Ron Atlantico Reserva Rum, tomato juice, chipotle peppers, adobo seasoning, lime juice and cilantro salt. It's got a 'lil kick.\"  At least that's what the brunch menu said.    When it arrived, it looked fantastic.  The cilantro salt rim was delightful.  But, where was that kick?  The drink was watery and there was no heat whatsoever.  They may want to consider rewriting THAT description.  A very sweet bartender came to the table and offered to remake the drinks explaining that they had to tone down the heat for the locals. There it is...that explains the food, too.  Instead of being authentic, it's been dumbed down for cautious palates.  And then there's that frozen food issue.  Gah.  Would I go back? Not on your life.  Cleveland is blessed with numerous AUTHENTIC Latin restaurants.  If you want Latin food, seek one out.  In fact, I highly recommend Barroco in Lakewood where you can get AUTHENTIC Latin delights.    I wasn't aware that Paladar is a chain until I noticed numerous locations across the country while writing this review.  So maybe that's another part of the problem.  If you're looking for bland, cafeteria quality \"Latin\" food...sure, hit up Paladar.  Otherwise, don't bother. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"sweet potato tacos are great. The menu is diverse with plenty of meat and non meat items that all can enjoy"}
{"text":"Paladar has a great happy hour menu! Their drinks (sangria, mojitos, and margaritas) are $5 each and they also have an assortment of appetizers that are all quite affordable!   My friend and I got the yucca fries and portobello empanadas to share. The portions aren't too big, so they're great for splitting with others to try multiple dishes! We also tried the mojitos (I personally tried the strawberry mojito and the regular mojito), which were very tasty! Finally, we got the sweet potato donuts off the dessert menu. I thought all the dishes were flavorful and unique in their taste. Our server was nice, offering recommendations for my friend and I (since we're both incredibly indecisive) and checked in with us throughout our time there to ask us if we wanted more drinks, dessert, etc.   Overall, I had a great experience at Paladar and I would love to come back to try other foods/drinks on their menu. If you're looking for a new place to check out during happy hour, I definitely recommend checking this place out! They're happy hour is 4-7 pm daily :)"}
{"text":"I recently visited Paladar with a group of friends. It was the first time I had been there in almost a decade and it did not disappoint! I started my meal with a traditional mojito and a trio of mango, roasted garlic, and traditional guacamole. For my meal, I had the Cuban rum glazed pork. Everything I ate was fantastic and the service was quick considering we had a party of 10 people."}
{"text":"Good food, but not the best service I've ever had here or even close to average.  I came for brunch and got the duck hash.  My salsa came out the same time has my hash.  My eggs were not cooked to order.  And it took 7 minutes to get hot water with lemon.  My server simply forgot about it.  Unless you are trying to watch tv, I would not sit in the bar area on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place deserves the full 4 stars...so it may be in the 3.5 range.    Service - Our waitress was nice and was not shy to talk about the menu, drinks or anything else for that matter.  Overall it was good service.   Appetizers - we tried the guacamole flight and the queso fundito. The guacamole was quite good, very fresh and and good consistency. My favorite was the goat cheese and black bean.  The fundito was good, not great. It was a bit different than ones I've had...this was basically just cheese and chorizo chunks, rather than a cheese sauce and ground chorizo.   Dinner - I was able to try a few dinners. The duck tacos were pretty good - very tender meat and the cabbage was a good complement in the taco.  I got the Feijoada stew and it was certainly complex and deep with flavor - especially the broth.  Again I liked the cabbage addition to give it texture and the pork was nicely done. But the chorizo was just ok - but I still enjoyed the dish as a whole.  Lastly I tried the spicy lamb stew. This was my least favorite of all of them.  It wasn't bad, but the lamb was average and the broth was very acidic and there was too much mint. But again was not lacking flavor that's for sure.   I want to add I had the clementine mojito and it was delicious - maybe the best thing I had here. This place has to go through mint like no other restaurant.  They put copious amounts of it in everything.  I had a good meal here no doubt, but it's missing something to make it special."}
{"text":"Empanadas! Horray! I was looking for a place that serves as close to authentic as you can get in Cleveland! I had the chicken empanadas with the Salvadorian coleslaw. Delish!! The traditional Margarita was EXCELLENT! They have a superb \"RUM\" selection. ( I was driving so didn't get a chance to sample, but they carry Don Q rum which is very good and a rarity.) The shrimp and calamari po' boy was very good! The dipping sauce for the fries were the icing on the cake! :-) Jeff the waiter was very thorough! He explained all the dishes and he knew his Rum!  They have happy hour on drinks and apps in the bar area Mon. - Sat. 4-7. The prices were a bit pricey for Latin food, but well worth it! (Always say you get what you pay for) I will definitely return soon to try the rum!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this restaurant while on biz trip to Cleveland.  Down the street from my hotel.  Went at 5:30 with my work colleague for happy hour--and was not disappointed!  $5.00 for all types of appetizers and latan drinks--what a bargain!  Had the spicy guac with house made chips which were plantain and yucca, plus one other I could not ID but was very good, along with a few normal corn chips.  Had the yucca fries with three dipping sauces and the blackened fish tacos--all were 5.00 each!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Paladar! I always seem to come here more often because they have an awesome happy hour with their fish tacos (which are delicious) and mojitos(traditional or pomegranate). You can't go wrong with their happy hour menu!   Their menu changes for months at a time, but that always excites me when I come back every-time to see what they have next! My favorite thing now on their menu is their variety of toppings for their one of a kind guacamole! My favorite combination so far was bacon(who could not love bacon), pickled red onions, and pumpkin seeds! Crazy, inventive, but delicious!   I always come here and have a great time! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Average.  Service staff pleasant, but food is like a glorified Chevy's, but more over priced.  First off, do not order the chips and over priced salsa because that's exactly what it is.  Nothing special about the salsa and to charge $4.50 for a basic tomato based salsa is simply not worth it.  The mango and green chili salsa also not so great (and again $4.50 each or 3 for $10).  We had the ceviche to start which tasted fine, but it was odd.  Had kind of a curry, powdery flavor.  Also had the pork chop which was meh, average, but had a pleasant sweet chipotle jelly and a decadent creamy corn, buttery mash which also tasted fine.  The above in of itself would have been acceptable.  What brought down the meal was the shredded beef (repas).  A salt shaker must have been spilled in the dish.  Was drinking water all night and into the morning.  Lastly, the other issue I had was each of the dishes brought to the table had the service staff's fingers making contact with the food on the plate.  It literally was with every dish.   A huge NO NO.  Like I said, however, average food though service staff pleasant, but can be a little more careful serving the food."}
{"text":"Very good food that is well prepared and well described on menu. Service was excellent, moved right along even though we were a party of 12.  Only disappointment was no beer taps. But highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, the HH quality went down. The fish  tacos (fish) was small and the tacos were dry. Drinks are still good."}
{"text":"Wow - really surprised to see the low ratings at this place. I thought Paladar was a refreshingly trendy restaurant with really good quality food to back up the setting. Of the whole strip here on Chagrin, I would pick Paladar over all the other restaurants anytime, including Taza.  I went to Paladar for dinner recently and the ceviche was quite fresh and tasty. The entrees also are well executed. The churros with chocolate dipping sauce are some of the best I've ever had - they were so freshly fried that they literally melted in my mouth. I've had a similar dessert at Adobo Grill in Chicago but it didn't nearly compare with Paladar's. Will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch. The service was speedy & friendly - perfect for a work weekday lunch. The staff was knowledgable about the menu.  I had the appetizer on special, which was Duck Confit Tostones. The portion size was good enough for a person to have a filling lunch. The duck was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful. The plantain tostones were crispy yet sturdy enough to hold the duck & toppings, but were kind of bland tasting. Slightly sweet but, I couldn't tell they were plantains. I still found them delicious and would go back for more.  Also try the sweet potato donuts! They were delicious! Shaped more like a donut hole and with the density of a \"cake\" donut. They were very dense, moist, and yummy! The dip was some kind of coffee/caramel confection with the consistency of yogurt. I could eat it by the spoonfuls!  If your shopping at Eaton and need a food fix, I'd definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Very, very nice restaurant, and the food is always fabulous--I have never had a bad meal here.  It's not crazy expensive, especially when you think about the area you are in, which is what I thought it was going to be when I walked in and saw how nice it was.  They even have a super nice, small but nice, patio for when it's weather appropriate.  When I first started going here I thought it was a place I would only go to for special occasions, but it really can be an anytime place (especially when you want a really, amazingly delicious food!).   I have to be honest, my first time here I was a skeptic because I am such a picky eater; however, that was several years ago, and since then I have done a pretty good job of expanding my horizons. That being said, I have tried so many things here that I have never been disappointed with. Most recently, we did a couple apps and split them between us--the spicy chorizo queso fundido--oh so good and cheesy.  We also did the mojo puled pork tostones. I am not a fan of pork at all.  You will never see me eat a pork chop. But these little babies....I couldn't get enough of them.  On my most recent trip there, I sat at the bar and got there maybe a couple minutes before 7:15.  As soon as I sat down, the bartender immediately came over and asked for my drink order, letting me know if he put it in within the next thirty seconds I would get the happy hour price still (I think happy hour \"ended\" at 7). It was awesome, the bartender was totally looking out for me haha.  I did get the mojito, and it was a little strong.  I still drank it, of course.  There were two bartenders working there that night, and they both had great customer interaction with everyone they served the entire time I was there.  You could tell they were having fun, which definitely makes the job easier, I'm sure. But it made my experience a ton more enjoyable too.  Now that I think about it, every time I have been there, the staff has always been nice. Oddly enough, when I would be leaving, there was always a manager near the hostess stand that would say bye and that he hoped we enjoyed ourselves. I would go here any change I get...happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"Love this chain, food is awesome and I've always experienced good service."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Paladar.  While I'm not sure this is typical Latin fare, I'd describe it as artsy Mexican cuisine with a healthier ingredient lens.    Food: Yummy!  I've been for brunch and for dinner.  Nice vegetarian options on each and love that the menu is well marked to clearly articulate it.  Highlights included guacamole with goat cheese and mango, the Brazilian cheesy bread (these fried cheese ball bites that are somehow gluten free) and of course sweet plantains.  Also ordered the sweet potato doughnut dessert - includes a delicious sweet dip - mmmm!  Prices: not a value priced meal, you're definitely paying more of a premium here but would not describe as overpriced.    Staff: our waitress when we last went, who is usually a bartender, was the most amazing, friendly, knowledgeable, and expert saleswoman I've ever had serve me.    Ambiance: it's a nicely decorated restaurant, not particularly cozy or comfortable.  Does have a summer patio option for those few warm Cleveland months.  Parking is a pain, for Cleveland suburb standards, but that's the shopping center to blame."}
{"text":"Since I have a job site in Beachwood that I have to attend meetings for, I made it a point to come and explore the restaurants in the area. This is the third time and the third disappointment. I hate to be negative, but the area just gives off the \"trying too hard\" feel. It's supposed to be upscale, it's supposed to be better, but it's not really it. Enough with that though, on to the restaurant review.  As I drove around looking for place to eat, I stumbled upon this place looking for a Lebanese restaurant that appeared on the Yelp search. When I pulled up, I realized that it's not a Lebanese place but a Lebanese place did indeed used to be here I believe. How do I know? I came here years ago and ate there but it looks like that place has gone under and this establishment has moved in. I don't know how long it's been here because I don't live here so I can't speak on that. Regardless, I was excited to try it out.  My visit was during lunch hours and I arrived around noon exactly. I was sat with no wait and the place already had a few customers. Service was good and my server seemed to be very knowledgeable. Looking over the menu, I was super excited and wanted to get just about everything. I really wanted to get tacos but I knew that I couldn't just get tacos when there were so many other things to get, plus I didn't know if I was going to come back here again. I decided on their mixed Ceviche and the Rum Glazed Pork with Mango Coconut rice. That's a pretty big lunch but I like to splurge.  A variety of chips are served complimentary and although it's a nice touch, it didn't really do anything for me. My ceviche arrived pretty fast and I was pretty excited to dig into it. Now I'll admit that I'm not a ceviche pro, but I do know the basics behind it and I was pretty disappointed on this one. The ceviche was sour with a bitter after taste and I knew exactly why it had that bitter taste. I don't know if that's their goal, but it's from the lime and being made too early in advance. If I was to guess, I'd say it's been a day or refrigerated for a while. How do I know or think I know? Well, a dish that I love to eat is papaya salad (som tum) and some people like to throw in a whole slice of lime when they make it. If and when they do and I can't finish it and it's taken home to be eat later or the next day, the white from the lime makes it bitter. There's the lime zest, the lime juice/pulp, and then the white lining under the zest that makes things bitter. Maybe I'm completely wrong on it, but it's the very same bitter taste to me. I would avoid this app or ask if it's made fresh that day.  When my main course came, it was plated beautifully, but that was about it. Taste? It was ehhhh. The coconut Mango rice tasted like it was covered in condensed milk. It was super sweet and a bit too much to eat. I'm not sure why the obsession with such plates in America in general. Everything was edible but the rice just too sweet for my liking. Perhaps if the mango was used when not fully ripe and still had some tart, it would compliment it well. I eat mangos in their various stages and appreciate them all. The pork was good and my server offered me hot sauce and to my surprise, they actually had a house hot sauce. Although it was pretty cool, disappointment again. Catering to the general public again so it's understandable yet disappointing. Mild sauce called hot and sweet everything sells. Their hot sauce isn't bad though.  If you're a major foodie, this place probably wouldn't please you but you never know! Don't take my word for it. To me, this place parallels with PF Chang's. I didn't complain about my ceviche because I never do. The food is edible and the place is fancy but I wouldn't make the drive from where I'm at or make a must stop spot if I'm the area again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had a great experience each time. Service is attentive and knowledgeable to start. Food is ridiculously tasty. Desserts are really off the charts decadent and really need to be shared. Of all of the things I've tried or ordered I can't say enough good things about the portobello empanadas. Super delicious! Also, check out the specialty drink list. Tons of yummy rum drinks. I had the aged flight of rum as well. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I live in Tampa, so when my co-workers suggested that we go to a Latin restaurant in Cleveland I was a bit skeptical.  I am a bit spoiled by the Latin food options in Tampa so I wasn't really expecting big things.  This place really surprised me!  We started at the bar and had some margaritas and mango salsa and mango guacamole.  The salsa and guac were both so fresh and so good!  The margaritas were quite tasty and the happy hour special was good.  Onto the table.  I went for the ropa vieja and it was absolutely delicious.  It was topped in a mustard sauce and came with a heaping portion of plantains.  It was honestly the tastiest ropa vieja I have had in a long time.  Really really good.  Co-workers got pork dishes and steak dishes and all was enjoyed.  This spot has an upscale atmosphere and is definitely a nice spot for a quality dinner out.  I hope to come back on a future trip to CLE!"}
{"text":"I was visiting the Cleveland area for work and decided to try this place out based on the love it seems to be getting from Yelp. The problem with travelling for work is that you usually end up having a lot of dinners by yourself so I am always on the hunt for a good place with a good bar area. That way you can at least meet new people.  Paladar met and exceeded my expectations in both the food and atmosphere. I'll start off with the food: I got the chicken tacos as my main and the carrot cake for dessert.   The tacos were really well done and were topped with unique things like peanuts. They also serve this amazing habanero hot sauce that is scorching hot. I barely scratched the surface of the cup it came in but it really added to the taste of the tacos.  The carrot cake dessert was also really good, and much bigger than I thought it would be. I'm not usually a fan of carrot cake but here the flavour was a bit more subtle, and it made it more enjoyable.  One area where Paladar exceeded is its customer service. Nathan really took the time to answer my questions about some of the menu items and made really good recommendations for me based on my dietary restrictions. Unfortunately he had to leave before I Was finished my meal but he took the time to recommend me a list of other great restaurants nearby for me to try out during my stay. It is obvious that the employees here at Paladar are really committed to their job, and I've never seen a happier group of servers/hosts anywhere else.  All in all I definitely plan on coming back, and would recommend Paladar to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Food is decent here, recommend the tacos, which are tasty.  Ambiance and staff are nice.  As usual, you'll encounter some clueless patrons as with any place in Eton Collection.  Parking is a nightmare. Place is pricey for what you get, especially drinks. If you want to try this place, do so at happy hour.  Also, their salads are not very good, and their steak is not very high quality; it's \"chewy\".  Staff was attentive, hostess was good, bartenders were awesome, waiter was good.  Their sangria was not very impressive; I don't think they make it properly.  It tasted like red wine poured over fruit, with fruit floating on the top.  I don't think they marinate it overnight.  It did not possess a fruity flavor in the least.  My old roommate, who was from Mexico, would make red wine sangria, and this could be why I don't like it; because I am used to this recipe.   Guacamole is good with the chips they serve. Too loud for a date; too trendy for my taste.  Not a place to go to talk during happy hour.  They crank the music and you feel like you're in a pseudo-club. I only come here if others want to try it.  What I have noticed is this: they usually don't want to come back once they've experienced this place."}
{"text":"This was my and my husband's first time eating here and it won't be our last.  I had reservations for 2 and there seemed to be some confusion with the hosts.  We were asked if we were \"fast eaters\" and could please make sure to \"finish by 7:15 because another party with a reservation needs that table.\"  I found the hosts fairly rude asking us that, but honestly, the service and food made up for it. Our waiter, Jeff, was prompt to our table and made great suggestions for drinks and appetizers.  The mojito and caipihrinas we ordered were authentic and super tasty.  We got 3 apps because we couldn't decide on just 1.  Guacamole gets a C.  I thought it was pretty bland (even listed as spicy).  The tilapia and avocado ceviche was a solid B+.  The chips they serve with those two apps are so good.  The pupusa cheese dish was an A+.  Nice flavor profile.  Main entrees were perfect.  Hubby got the Brazilian stew and I had the skirt steak with chimichurri.  I ordinarily wouldn't rave about the side that come with an entree, but the pinto beans were the best I have ever had.  We thought we would stop there, but Jeff mentioned how \"life changing\" the sweet potato donuts were so we had to try.  These things are so good, life changing good!!  We wanted to do a rum sampler with dessert and let Jeff pick them to compliment our dessert.  He explained each rum in detail and those were fantastic!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had an awful experience with a To Go order tonight.  Placed the order and was told ten minutes.  Drove to the restaurant, paid for my order, and was informed by one of multiple hosts that it would be out in a few minutes.  Waited for THIRTY minutes before one of the hosts went over to a bag sitting off to the side and asked me if I was waiting for a To Go order.  Guess they didn't see me standing directly in front of their stand for the past half hour.  The hostess handed me the bag, and I told her that I saw that bag get put over there twenty minutes ago, which meant that everything in there was cold, to which she replied \"sorry\" in the most unapologetic way possible and then said that the food was \"still kinda warm\".  I didn't bother complaining to the manager because he walked by me several times without ever acknowledging me.  To top it all off, I get in the car and see that the container of guacamole was only a third full.  My biggest regret was that I left over a 20% tip beforehand - I was so tempted to ask for it back.  Having been a waitress, I am very understanding towards restaurant staff, but this was all inexcusable.  And the food WAS cold and soggy.  Maybe dining in yields a better experience, but I highly doubt I will come back to find out."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the rum bar service but my family and I ate lunch here and we were all disappointed in our food and service. We initially ordered the guacamole, which sounded very good from its description. Unfortunately, it had little flavor and the avocados appeared to be going bad (there was significant black/brown pieces of avocado in the guacamole). I ordered the spicy cauliflower tacos for my entree. They were definitely spicy but had absolutely no flavor. The chili cream sauce did nothing for it - it tasted like I was eating soggy, under-cooked cauliflower inside a wrap. My wife had the coconut curry stew, which she thought was fine although nothing to write home about. My daughter ordered soft tacos but the shredded beef was not tasty, plus our waiter forgot the sour cream for her dish.  That was the other disappointing aspect of this meal, our waiter was not very attentive. After we initially sat down, we waited well over 10 minutes for him to come back around to get our drink order. After that, once we had our meals I had to ask him as he was walking by to refill my water glass, which had stood empty for basically my entire meal.  Overall, I was not impressed with Paladar considering the premium you pay for the meals and drinks. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The BEST mojito on the entire east coast! The biggest reason is the bartender, Paul!! He delivers the highest quality drinks EVERYTIME"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service. Great food. We had the spicy guac, tilapia ceviche, amazing stew dish, fish tacos, coffees and chocolate flan. Loved every second of it. Also, Charles is an amazing manager with stunning good looks. Ladies, get ready!"}
{"text":"Loved this food - I think the salsa and chips was my favorite...the waitress was very nice and helped me pick something yummie on the menu that wasn't too spicy and I ended up really loving it!! I'll definitely go back :) I got the chicken wrap :)"}
{"text":"Delish! I'm used to Latin food & Colombian food made in Houston Texas, and I have to admit this was pretty dang close!  The skirt steak Churrasco - or just \"Churrasco\" steak  as we call it was amazing (a Brazilian style dish)!  Things they need to change - never serve pinto beans and Mexican rice with this dish- it needs to be white cilantro rice and sweet plantains!  I wasn't going to hassle them about the rice but did order no beans and a side of the plantains and I was in heaven. I was so impressed by the sweet plantains - they tasted just like the ones in my uncle's Colombian restaurant ( Abuelita's recipe of course)- and there were plenty!  The mango salsa was all mango so I didn't care for it much.  Anyway, my new favorite spot in Cleveland, OH - Mayfield Heights area.  Oh and the rum punch (Caribbean style) was great too!  The bartender was friendly and made great looking cocktails.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and my first experience was great, but every other time has been disappointing. I have had issues with food not being warm when brought to the table and with very slow service regardless of how busy it is. The Coke did not taste right either. Sometimes the food is pretty good but I don't think I will be going back because I don't have the patience. I recommend the plantains and only going if you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I sent a question through a contact on the website, and she replied in about ten minutes, pretty impressive. We took mom for Mother's day brunch and it was great. I appreciated they had their regular brunch menu, I wasn't looking for a buffet or limited menu. Mom and I both ate the smoked salmon avocado toast with crispy capers and hard boiled egg. Fantastic, loved the bread and how it was served on fresh greens. I was worried it wouldn't be enough so we filled up on plantain chips and fresh guacamole. But my concerns abated when I saw the portion size was more than sufficient and we both ended up taking half home. My sister loved her juicy beef brisket tacos. And step-dad cleaned his plate of huevos rancheros with a side of chorizo. Service great, we were seated quickly. Only negative and it was minor: we had to send a couple utensils back as they still had food on them from the night before. Whoever rolled the place settings must have been in a hurry to get home. But overall, great meal and I'm sure we'll be back as my mom has a Paladar card she is always bragging about."}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you are in the mood for Latin food and drinks.  As a vegetarian, I usually order the sweet potato tacos or the portobello grill.  Both dishes are satisfying and delicious.  The majority of the time the service is good but on a couple occasions it has been a tad slow."}
{"text":"Fabulous service from a very knowledgeable server. The cod baked in banana leaves was great ! I never miss the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Nothing more I can write up that hasn't been said - just will add another 4 start review as this place was great!  Been here a few times now as well so I'm comfortable saying its 4 Star."}
{"text":"After hearing all my pals talk very highly of this place, I finally was able to see what the fuss was all about. And they were right, Paladar is very good! The rum menu is, as expected, very strong! Lots of options for you fans of the sweetness! Started off with some goat cheese guac.  Bonus because of the plantain chips! That did not last long, at all. So good. I got the roast pork al pastor tacos. Fairly sized portions, the pineapple slaw was the memorable ingredient there. A good spot for date night, Paladar was indeed good as advertised."}
{"text":"Went to Paladar with my wife on a Saturday night on recommendation from a friend. 45 min wait (to be expected, especially when we came after leaving B-Spot's 1.5hr wait).  Guac ($5) was good, but not great (Momocho was better), but decent app when we were starving.   We shared 3 appetizers instead of entrees. I'd pass on the Chicken Emenadas (ca. $10) as they lacked kick, but really enjoyed the Mussels (ca. $12), a 1/2 lb portion in a spicy broth served with corn bread. The Braised Short Rib Mini Tacos were great as well ($10), a generous portion of tender, savory meat served with a sweet asian slaw (fresh and crisp) and several mini tortillas. (My only beef there was that we could have used more tortillas since there was so much meat).   While we skipped drinks, we did splurge on dessert, but should have chosen something other than the Churros. We paid about $40 or so with tax for the two of us.  Overall the service was great, atmosphere was nice, food was good and portions were great for the price. The entrees we saw at tables near us seemed really well put together and very large for the price. Next time we may split an entree ($15-20) and get drinks, and it would be even less expensive.   We've been hearing great things about their Happy Hour too, which is a great deal - $5 select appetizers and $5 drinks (bar only, every day 4-7p).  We're excited to return!"}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for work and saw this restaurant and thought it looked good, and boy is that an understatement! For starters the service was great. I sat in the bar and Paul took great care of me. When my dinner was brought out, the \"Braised Beef Ropa\" there was a mix up and I received the appetizer portion. It was so big that I didn't even notice. That is until Paul brings me the dinner version and a mojito for free apologizing for the mistake. I told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted and offered to box up what I didn't eat. The mgr came by as well to apologize and I told him I was amazed as really no harm was done. On top of that the food really was excellent. The meat was tender and flavorful without being too salty. The drinks were strong and for a $5 HH you can't go wrong. I would definitely recommend for the great service, food, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Paladar is a great place with a great atmosphere. They have a very diverse menu that will please any foodie. The portion sizes are decent and very filling. The samples of rum are pleasing.  I personally recommend the tortilla soup with sour cream and an extra side of chips."}
{"text":"This place had me at \"Latin Kitchen,\" but RUM BAR?  I knew I had to come.  There is a ton of space inside, and it was pretty full.  I had just missed happy hour, and I'm a little sad because a lot of people showed up for it, so it must be good.  I'm also bummed that I wasn't there on a weekend because that brunch menu looked heavenly.  You can't go wrong with bottomless mimosas.  I had the salmon mango ceviche, a side of sweet plantains, and a pomegranate ginger mojito.  The ceviche had salmon, mango, cilantro, red onion, and a cream sauce.  The flavors really let the salmon shine.  The plantains were deliciously sweet, and provided a good balance of flavor from the ceviche.  I was a little underwhelmed by the mojito because I wanted to taste more ginger, it was a good pomegranate mojito though.  The table chips are pretty cool. They're a mix of malanga, yucca, plantain, and tortilla chips, but they don't come with any salsa or anything.  I enjoyed them with my ceviche.   My only negative takeaways are that I had to ask for the complimentary chips, and that there was no formal introduction from my waiter. He was helpful and friendly, but I never got his name."}
{"text":"went to paladar for the first time with two friends last night. FANTASTIC mojitos! we got the guacamole for the table and it wasn't the best i'd ever had but the mixed tortilla, plantain and yuca chips were great and made up for it.   one friend ordered the salmon and it was pretty tasty. another friend ordered the short ribs and though they were good they weren't all that exciting. mine was by far the best - the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. delicious!! cooked perfectly. it came with pinto beans and rice which were pretty good but the steak was killer.   i thought it was a pretty cool place too. really, really good drinks. a great place for three girlfriends after a shopping trip."}
{"text":"This is a tough one the food is awesome the service sort of sucks especially if your not drinking. I also had a dirty napkin than dirty silverware. I've been here several times bust mostly in the bar or at lunch in the restaurant. I'll definitely go back perhaps not on a Friday night or do takeout."}
{"text":"Paladar has a great thing going. They is so much atmosphere and ambiance. Every time I have been there it's been packed and service has been great.   The last time I was there I was with two co-workers on a busy Saturday night. There were no tables available and it was about a 30 minute wait so we stood by the bar which was sardine packed! But, we were able to get to the bar and get drinks relatively quickly - that being said - the Mojitos are AMAZING. Between my coworker and I, I think we tried the entire mojito list. There was one with Basil - that was my favorite.   After getting our drinks from the bar it was only a few minutes until someone got up from the tables in the bar area (which are self seating) so we grabbed one of those. I so wish I could remember our servers name - maybe david? - he was so funny and so awesome that I think all of us would go back just to see him! We ordered the guacamole, which didn't last very long on the table. It was FAB! We decided not to order anymore food and just kept drinking. It was a truly fantastic night highlighted by great atmosphere, great drinks, and great service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, once for happy hour, but both on the weekend. The happy hour specials can't be beat. $5 sangria, margaritas and mojitos from 4-7 daily, even on the weekend. There are additional discounts on certain food items.   We sat at the bar both times. The service has been great, the bartenders are awesome (ask for Paul), the menu is diverse and everything we have had so far as been impeccable. We have been raving to everyone we know, and would definitely recommend you stop to enjoy!"}
{"text":"The General Manager, Charles, contacted me.  He was very professional, and I shared my concerns.  I have since been back for lunch, and it was very good.  The service was great this time, and the food was even better."}
{"text":"I've only been here once for lunch while I was in the neighborhood, but it was great.  Loved the atmosphere and decorations.  The beef tacos were delicious, as well as the shrimp guacamole (which was a special that day).  My mom got the chicken empenadas, which were pretty bland, so I wouldn't recommend those.  The peach basil and pomegranate ginger mojitos were to DIE for--they alone were enough reason to come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place!! Menu looked  right up my alley- I wanted to order it all!! We had a reservation but arrived a few minutes early and sat at the bar to have a drink while we waited.. And waited. We were there 5 min early and after 20 min decided to order a snack at the bar. It was good we did so we were able to leave before blowing a lot of money on what appeared to be mediocre food and terrible service.  We ordered wine. Easy.  Came quickly and we chatted with the bartender about the apps. He told us chefs choice was a mango/roasted garlic guacamole and we were excited to try it.  Liked that it came with different types of chips but I have had so many plaintain chips in my life that I know stale/bad ones- these were bad! And missing salt!  The guac was terrible- must have been mixed with mayo and other fillers to make it more 'moussy' rather than made with lots of avocados  Mango equaled appx four fruity pieces that I could have sworn were pineapple.  Roasted garlic non-existent. The consistency almost made me sick.  But around that time I saw one of the bar servers stick their hand in their mouth to pick their teeth and then go back to 'prepping' mojito glasses. That was the last straw.  We got up and paid for our disgusting guac and wine and promptly told the server to remove our reservation.  I know it's bad to judge a restaurant on one dish- but come on!  You can't make good guac- you are off my Latino list. Even chipotle has better guac!!! And it is way less expensive!"}
{"text":"Paladar has improved their service and food. I love their steak and fries, empanadas and shredded beef."}
{"text":"My wife read the menu for Paladar as we walked by the restaurant today and she immediately insisted that we eat there!  So eat we did.  We waited 45 minutes to be seated, but hey, it was Father's Day.  In the mean time, we played chess down the block and scoped out some of the stores, including Trader Joe's.  This is a nice shopping plaza.  Once we were seated, we ordered some drinks and water.  They serve two kinds of Great Lakes Brewery beer and so I ordered a Dortmunder, which was pretty yummy.  All of us were in the mood for steak, so we all ordered the churrasco with rice and beans.  It's not the churrasco that I'm used to, but it was pretty tasty.  It will give Ohioans an idea of what a real churrasco is, but it is not the same as an authentic meal, which I've had many times out of the country.  The steak was the closest thing to authentic in the meal.  How can you get that part wrong?  The rice was nothing like the rice I've had in Puerto Rico and neither were the beans.  They were very Americanized.  We had hoped that we would get top notch rice and beans, but they just weren't.  The chimicurri left a lot to be desired too.  I'll continue making churrasco, rice, and beans at home until I find a restaurant that does it right.  Nonetheless, the food was of good quality and tasted good.  The portions were a little on the small side.  I can't wait to try some of the other menu items.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on national taco day so got to try three different tacos and they didn't disappoint! The steak, beef, and chicken tacos were all bursting with flavor. I ordered the yucca fries and they were underwhelming, but still ok. The waiter was pretty non chelant but decent. Unlike most Mexican style places chips and salsa aren't free. Overall the experience was pretty average with above average food!"}
{"text":"Called in for reservation or call ahead seating. Was told to hold. 5 minutes later told they didnt take call ahead or reservation. Walked in to a 35 minute wait with 10 empty tables. 15 minutes in to the wait and still 10 empty tables. Inefficient. Good thing the food is good.  Update: 50 minutes in and still 5 empty tables. Told we were next on the list and they were waiting for people to get up. Then sat people in front of us."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome.  I want to stop there, because honestly I've been there dozens of times now, and never had anything to complain about. Not one thing.  For a while I was stuck on the feijoada stew which is insanely good , recently I branched out and had other things. But every time, I leave there feeling full and content.  This is one of those places where, as the cook of the house, I can honestly say that I could not duplicate many of their dishes without considerable cost or trial and error. I appreciate that.  Consistently delicious, reasonably priced, good atmosphere and good service. Home run every time."}
{"text":"Amazing! They even catered a lunch for my office and it was out of this world. Customer service was phenomenal and they will recognize you after your 2nd visit.   Step out of your comfort zone and try something new from their fantastic menu!"}
{"text":"A tad disappointed tonight after my stop into Paladar.  I think when I first went to Paladar a few years ago, it was brand new. Now.. Things are different.  Asked for the guac tonight.. It was just okay. Then I order the mixed seafood ceviche-oh it was bad. Way too much lime juice-I felt like they dumped the whole bottle in my ceviche. I just couldn't eat it.   Everything else I tried (chicken tinga tacos and pork), was just ok, nothing great. And for that, Ill have to knock down my review to three stars."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Never had anything less than a very good meal here.  Paladar is, dare I say, a great restaurant with delicious mojitos, gaucamole, and other nuevo latino fare.  Try the ceviches, ropa vieja (braised beef served on top of fried plantains...holy shit!) and the tuna.  Stay for the great coffee and desserts.  Come back and try new things, it'll most likely be great again.  Buen provecho."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! Mojitos are so fresh with mint, lemon, and sugar cane --- best I've had in the area.  Try out the Cuban sandwich and eggplant dip"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. They have so many authentic Cuban foods that I had trouble deciding which one to try. I can say that almost every dish I have tried I have sincerely enjoyed. I especially love their plantains."}
{"text":"From start to finish it was a nice time.  I had the Rum glazed Cuban pork it was great.  Made to order  guacamole with their chips was great. Spinach heart of Palm salad was good as well.  Finished with Cuban coffee."}
{"text":"Very good food and ambiance. We had four different entrees and each was delicious. The only complaint is their weak coffee."}
{"text":"Great location at Eton Collection with a beautiful patio, open dining room and friendly staff. My Mom had been raving about this place and it lived up to the high expectations I had set.  There is an extensive (and fun) drink menu. My horchata run drink was sweet and I easily could have had two. Appetizers are meant to be shared and there are a plethora of great Cuban inspired options. The quacamole was good (not the best I've had but good -- plus they had options to make it spicer or with some more exotic add-ins), mahi mahi tacos were an excellent choice (the fish was almost a pate mix and anything that is mini seems that much better) and the ceviche did not disappoint.  Entree portions were huge and though I easily could have opted to take mine home I insisted on finishing it all there. Our waiter recommended the cubano (I thought it was going to be a traditional sandwich but it was a cubano deconstructed). There was a mound of subtly sweet pork, rice with bits of mango and black beans. Other highlights at our table included the chile rellenos (quite possibly the largest chile I'd seen) and the plantains.  Overall this was a very good dining experience and I'd definitely enjoy coming back to soak up the lively bar scene, enjoy a ladies lunch or a relaxed dinner on the patio."}
{"text":"In need of a decent restaurant for lunch that could accommodate my gluten allergy, I did a quick Yelp search and found Paladar Latin Kitchen. As an added bonus, it was less than a mile from my hotel and close to I-271.  Paladar has a separate gluten free menu, and will provide it on request. Our stellar server, Andre, expertly steered us through the various menu offerings, and our table opted for the fish tacos and the ropa vieja. Both dishes were delicious, but the ropa vieja exceeded our expectations and was large enough to provide ample leftovers for another day. (They also offer an appetizer portion of the ropa vieja.)   The restaurant is open and airy, with a beautiful bar area, and the cocktail list looked great. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Just okay. Has selections for gluten free diners but the chips aren't completely gluten free. It's so easy to make gluten free corn chips - so a disappointment. The salsas were not good - more bland than anything. Just okay"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to Paladar for her birthday. The atmosphere is odd and seems completely inappropriate for a Latin restaurant. We had decent service, good food and great drinks. It was a little pricey but the food was a nice change of pace from most of the restaurants in Cleveland. We definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner and drinks on a weeknight. The mojitos were awesome. The best I have had outside Miami, not too sweet. The chips and fresh guacamole that they make is so worth the trip. My dinner was good, I had the fish tacos. Service was a bit slow but overall a great night and I would go again !"}
{"text":"Lunched at Paladar last week. The food is great as always, Sarah our server was delightful, pleasant, always smiling and patient with us as it was a business lunch and we took quite a while for us to look at the menu and make up our minds as to what we would order.  My salad was great."}
{"text":"Went there today at 11:30 a.m. The restaurant was nearly empty because it had just opened. Our server was indifferent at best. It was obvious she detests her job as well as her customers. We didn't even wait for our entrees to come out because it was obvious we were inconveniencing our waitress just by being there. It was a horrible experience and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from this spot and absolutely loved the outside patio and the decor even when grabbing my order! It's really hard to find a great Latin-influenced restaurant in the area and this hit all the marks.   I ordered the Jalepeno Shrimp Ceviche (had a nice bit and good chunks of shrimp) and Rio-Style Chicken Tacos. Both absolutely hit the spot. The tacos had the perfect mix of meat with a sweet aioli, and a side of beans and rice. It also came with some free plantain chips.   Personally, this is a great spot for east take-out, or even better, a patio happy hour with tacos and margs with friends. I definitely will be visiting again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Quacamole is the best!  Everything else is great as well!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Obviously everyone loves it, and so I! New addition to their brunch menu- avocado toast with smoked salmon. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Victor was an awesome server, ask for him! Dynamite rum selection: Premium Aged, Super Aged, and Presidential Flights. The Argentinian Mixed Grill and Mojo Marinated Sockeye Salmon were delicious. Finished everything off with churros for an excellent meal - such a good change of pace. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to join our fav couple (Steve and Carol Lageson) for a Saturday night dinner. Carol, who by the way is the Mom of Cara Lageson, Cleveland and now Seattle's Yelp! CD, took care of getting the reservations and was able to get one at our desired time. Considering it was a Winter/Fall/Back to Winter/Back to fall day figured everyone would be dining in. Yes they were, and so did we.  Always start our meal of an order of Guac! Fresh, and a good size portion starts the evening off. Mojito's for the table and the evening starts off just right.   Malcolm (no not the one in the middle - he's heard that before, but our server) showed the new way the menu was set up and let us drink and talk before asking for our orders! THIS was very rewarding. Yes, I know servers like to get things in, but at times, diners like to enjoy conversation at diner w/o a rush. Malcolm did that and always kept an eye out to get to us when we were ready.  Easy choosing for all of us; various taco dishes. Do love the Cubano Sandwich but their variety of soft tacos are the best around.  One had the pulled pork; chicken; beef and I had the blackened fish.  Let me tell you, if you love fish or don't like fish, you should have these at least once. No \"fishy\" taste but a seasoned mouthful! Tender tasty pieces smothered in a variety of veggies and a lime sauce that is spot on.  All dishes were consumed, except one that planned on having Sunday lunch!  Normally we are so full we by-pass desert, but tonight we splurged. Two orders of Fried donuts and a serving of Mitchel's rum cake ice cream. Great endings to a great night.  One suggestion, if possible get Malcolm's area, he will compliment your evening perfectly!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time dining here. I would gladly come back! The service, food, and drinks were stellar beginning to end. We walked in with an 8 top and were immediately seated. Our server was very friendly and informative when we had questions about drinks. The same goes for the bartender, who came to our table at one point. When the manager learned I had an allergy to an ingredient in the dish I ordered, she helped me swap out for something that wouldn't make me sick: some kind of salad with shrimp. Very tasty! Everybody at our table enjoyed their food and drinks and had a great time!"}
{"text":"For the past 3 years I've lived in the Cleveland area I've been wanting to try out Paladar and finally it happened! It was definitely worth the wait! Everything on the menu looks so good that I wish they had a sampler platter. On the other hand this just means I'll have to keep coming back and trying other dishes. The guacamole is a must! For main course I had their staple dish - the rum glazed pork. Absolutely delicious! Do also try their sparkling strawberry sangria. Smooth and refreshing and you get tipsy before you know it. Nice thing about the location - after the meal and the sangria you can stroll over the Eton mall or Barnes n Noble and walk off the tipsiness before getting behind the wheel."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to mention this the first time, but the Tiny Tacos, the appetizer, is an excellent choice if you like fish tacos.  They have a very nice smokey flavor and while they have shrunk in size considerably since Paladar first opened I would still highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Bland food... I ordered the Argentinian mixed Grill  Was Very bland.. I actually left a note on their feedback survey.. My husband ordered the pulled pork with beans and coconut rice. He said his was ok; Beans had no seasoning either. I was anticipating a better menu but most of what we ordered lacked seasoning or flavor.. Very disappointing.."}
{"text":"I'm visiting fam from Los Angeles. I woke up with a mean taste for breakfast tacos, but I don't know the Cleveland restaurant scene that well. I took to Facebook to ask my Cleveland friends and they basically had no recommendation. Then I took to Yelp and found Paladar has breakfast tacos on their brunch menu. Awesome! I hop in my rental car and drive over from Bedford, OH (less than 20 min), get here, get seated, order breakfast tacos and am told that's only weekends. #devastated  I was going to leave and continue my search but my hungry stomach decided to stay and order from the regular lunch menu. I ordered the Chipotle Honey Vegetable Quesadilla w/Shrimp added and a sdie of Coconut Mango Rice. Good choice. Soooo good. Add a sangria (blackberry lemon)...it's so good."}
{"text":"Great food and i've never had a problem with service. I went on a whim for a girl's night out and the following week we brought our boyfriends for them to try out the restaurant since we liked it so much.  If you like guacamole, get either the spicy (not that spicy) or the chef's special. The regular I found to be a little bland. Everything i've ordered off the regular menu has been great.   Lately i've been going for latin bbq sunday nights with a set entree (rotates every week between three dishes) and a choice of sides, which equals up to a lot of food. I've been back three times for it if that tells you anything how good it is."}
{"text":"I really like it here! The food is always great and the guac options are amazing. For brunch, I strongly suggest the Chorizo & Cheese Pupusa with Fried Eggs. For lunch, I love the Chipotle Honey Vegetable Quesadilla and for dinner, I love the Rum Glazed Cuban Pork. Every meal I have ever had there was delicious!! And the sangria is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the food, hate the seating. Shared the ropa vieja and smoked chicken dinners on the most recent visit. Food was excellent, and made a good lunch the next day too. However, I hate that diners have to share bench seating with other parties. It feels like you're almost on top of the next table. I'd like a little more arm space while eating! I'll still eat here now and then, but would likely increase my visits if the seating arrangement was updated."}
{"text":"Decent food. Great decor. They make great tacos. Check out their sister store Bomba."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great service, and atmosphere. I left with a full stomach and a broken heart, growing up eating Latin food, I was very disappointed. There was no soul put into making this food, let alone flavor, the whole table had to put salt on everything. The kids chicken nuggets tasted better than the majority of the food at our table. All the chips served with the bland guacamole was burnt. The empanadas were doughy and lacked filling. And the ceviche lacked all of the necessary flavor elements. I definitely preferred my Puerto Rican mother's cooking... I suggest the owners to go to an authentic Dominican or Latin restaurant to get a taste of what real Hispanic food should taste like. And I don't recall coconut curry to be Latin soul food..."}
{"text":"Went to brunch here yet again and was I not disappointed!!! They have half off margaritas mojitos and sangria through Valentine's Day! Tried something new and was not disappointed. My date and I both ordered the Duck confit we were impressed. My only regret is I didn't get some of the amazing guacamole . Go here for a casual brunch date and you'll love the excuse to drink in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Traveling into town for an event and stopped by this place for something different...and it was awesome! Environment was great with indoor and outdoor seating. Plenty of room for a group of 6. Food and service were tops - try the ceviche and guac. Mango and cilantro margarita was one of the best margaritas I've had before! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great environment. Everything is super clean, the staff is super professional. They make guac fresh to order too. The chips are yucca, and plaintain. Which with guac, is the perfect combination. I typically go here every year on my birthday, and will not be changing that anytime soon, unless something drastic happens. Big portions too, and I have never left feeling any bit hungry. 5 stars FO SHO!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was good!   I give it three stars because after we were seated. Y the lovely & friendly hostess, we sat at the table unacknowledged for about 10 minutes give or take. No waters, nothing. When our server came over he asked if we wanted water instead of just bringing us water right away. And after he brought water he immediately started to walk away and I had to stop him so we could ask questions about the menu. Those were really the only flaws I have about the evening.   After that, our server was great and had great recommendations. Food was wonderful. Huge portions. I had the steak stir fry under chef special. It was good. Spicy on its own but not too spicy. My date had the mojo pork which was a tad salty but I think I liked his better! Both really good.   We each had a margarita. One watermelon basil and one blueberry cucumber. Both were great but I couldn't taste basil nor cucumber in either.   Overall it was good. I'd return!   Update: someone from the restaurant reached out to be regarding my review and said they'd send me a gift card. Never has been received. I thought that was a nice gesture but don't offer it if you're not going to do such. I wouldn't even want them to send it to me now because I most likely won't return after my experience at the restaurant and then this.."}
{"text":"The food is okay but nothing to be impressed. It's a totally average quality food. Not a lot of flavour, just food.   Pao de quijo is not real Brazilian cheese bread is plain flour with water in the oven. It's horrible. Just go to Costco and you can find better cheese bread.   My Cuban pulled pork was without any salt and so was the mango and coconut rice , I guess they cook generally without salt .   Service is good as well, I would recommend something else if you are looking for Latin food."}
{"text":"I really like the food and the ambiance at Paladar.  Their Saturday and Sunday brunch are amazing and they have bottomless mimosas!  During the warm months it's so fun to sit outside and enjoy!   They also have the most amazing plantain chips that pair well with guac.  I highly recommend a meal here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and can't really recall being disappointed. This was another of those times.  Went with a girlfriend for Happy Hour which means: $5 Mojitos!   We got there around 4:30p and there was plenty of room in the bar area.  By the time we left around 6, it was packed and we had people waiting for our chairs when we got up. So get there early if you can. We each ordered the Yuca fries (so good!) and the garlic dipping sauce is my favorite! She ordered the Roasted Chicken Empanadas.  Again, tasty!  I ordered one of the specials: Roasted Duck and Fig Salad.  It's not the prettiest of salads, but I enjoyed it.  The Happy Hour seasonal donuts are sweet potato and you NEED to get them!  We also each had a Pomegranate Ginger mojito and a Charred Pineapple.  I preferred the pineapple.  They've upped the size of the glassware since my last visit.  I actually prefer short drinks, but the Mojitos are still quite good. Overall, a solid visit. The bartender was pretty easy to get a hold of and friendly.  Other guests were lively and everyone seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"Wow the food was really great and the server Jed was beyond five stars so accommodating and welcoming and informative on the dishes, I had the pork tacos they were so delicious it was very flavorful and I also Tryed the mango guac very tasty with the cook yucca plantain chips can't wait to come again !!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours in CLE (4-7pm daily and a reverse happy hour 9-11pm sun-thurs). Phenomenonal food but getting a seat/table in the bar area for happy hour is every man for himself so best come early. Wait staff was superb...attentive, friendly, knew the menu and had great suggestions to offer. It's a rum bar with over 70 to choose from. Not sure which one to try? Order a rum flight (or 2 or 3 then order an uber home). Mojitos on the HH menu are $5 each. I get the traditional kind but ask for less sugar . Lots of muddled mint really gets those taste buds teased. I went adventurous and got a charred pineapple mojito but send it back. When they say charred, it's literally like an ashy pineapple sweet drink. They could tell I wasn't fond of it and gladly gave me a traditional one. For HH food, went with a waiter's suggestion with El cubano and chicken empanadas. The Cuban sandwhich was good sized for what you pay for and not salty. You get 3 empanadas and a choice of meat. An excellent snack which is why I went with the sandwich also. Overall an excellent balance of flavors on both. Truly an exquisite experience of both service and food. High five Paladar"}
