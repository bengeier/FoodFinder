{"text":"This Isaly's is now nothing more than a corner bodega.  I went there as a tourist looking for chipped ham; they didn't have it. I give it three stars only because I'm sure it's perfectly fine as a place to buy soda and cigarettes."}
{"text":"New owners about a year or so ago. I've been working in West view for almost 20 years and haven't eaten in there for the last six years. It's too pricey. You can't beat young house Chinese restaurant across the street. They have a six dollar lunch special and you can't even eat it all. If I owned this place I would offer a daily six dollar lunch special and advertise outside on a sandwich  board. How about offering a nice grilled chicken salad lunch for all the women that work in the bank? (something healthy ) This place is very poor on promoting their business. If it was me I would have that place packed lunch time. 2 stars for poor management."}
{"text":"Classic Isalys!!   So charming, affordable and an unforgettable visit!!   I ordered a chipped ham sandwich - which came with chips - well under $10.00! Oh yea.   The little booths are cozy enough for two people. I cant wait to go back. I believe there are only a few in the pgh area. One in West View, Washington and on the North Side.   This particular location I like to visit because theres usually parking right in front.      I remember my mother taking me to the one location that was in kenmar plaza in the rocks.. (which is where Bobby D's is now I believe)  it was always so much fun getting a sandwich and ice cream too.    I love Isalys!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, after living in the area for a few years. I found this as typical \"yinzer\" joint with plain simple menu. My food (eggs, bacon, and home fries) was cooked as ordered. The food was rather plain. There was a noticeable lack of seasoning on the eggs and home fries, not even salt and pepper. Nothing was special about it, you know, something that would call me back for a 2nd visit.  My wife's meal (blueberry pancakes) was a similar experience. They didn't even have maple syrup.  We came to the conclusion that we could cook a better breakfast at home.  If you're looking for a solid, simple, diner breakfast look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'll start with the two positives. If you grew up with Isaly's, there are pics on the walls that will give you your nostalgia fix. The crinkle cut French fries were good. That's where it ends.  The waitress was one of the most unfriendly people I ever met. Why work with people if you hate people? She gave us a dirty look as soon as she came to the table and acted as if we were a burden. She came to take our drink order, took our food order and brought the food.  My hot dog looked like the hot dogs you see at a movie theater that have been there 10 years. My husband's roast beef sandwich with gravy was microwaved and nasty.  Skip the nostalgia and find a place with edible food and employees who give a crap."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have more reviews! There is something so satisfying about buying an Isaly's chipped chopped ham sandwich right from the source. The sandwiches I bought here were so good and wow I can't believe I'm raving about something as simple as a ham sandwich but man it was memorable. This is seriously one of the last remaining Isaly's locations so it really should draw more attention than it does. Unfortunately no Klondike bars (they were invented by Isaly's) because apparently Isaly's lost the naming rights to Klondike bars or so I heard. Get the chipped chopped ham!"}
{"text":"Probably pretty good, but don't be late. Pittsburgh traffic was horrible and got us there about 5 minutes before closing (instead of an hour) and the grill was closed. Cured me of ever wanting a \"slammer\". Might be more concerned about getting the the grill closed out than serving customers. Just my opinion tho, and you know what they say about those. ;-)"}
{"text":"I read that when visiting Western PA to make sure to try the chipped chopped ham sandwiches, and why not do it at a Pittsburgh staple. This place has been around forever - started in Ohio and now has a few locations still in Ohio, western PA, and West Virginia. I got the chipped chopped ham breakfast sandwich with egg and cheese on a bagel. It was so good and loaded with that delicious thinly sliced ham that I was full until dinner time. Next time I will have to go later in the day and try a milkshake."}
{"text":"Let me just say first off, I don't think I will be able to say enough good things about Isaly's in my review.    Once I verified their hours (7am-2pm but closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays) I planned a visit with some friends after an overnight shift.  Isaly's has a classic diner feel and the staff is very welcoming.  One of my friends was looking over a list of breakfast places I had created. (i.e. a spreadsheet that included the names of places, their location and any helpful hints or recommendations.  This spreadsheet was created as part of my New Year's resolution to try different locally owned breakfast spots.)  Our waitress/one of the owners told us she and her husband (our cook/the other owner) do the same thing, but she was impressed with my list because they \"just write things down.\"  She also complimented me on my shirt and asked me where I bought it (online at LOL Mart).  It has a drawing of a sunny side up egg and a strip of bacon holding hands and underneath it says \"BFF\" - and it has become my designated breakfast shirt.  The owners were very friendly and accomodating, engaging us in conversation during our meal about other breakfast spots in the the Pittsburgh area.  They joked about how we would rate them and our waitress paid special attention to us, perhaps nervous of what we might tell others.  A few other patrons came in, but only for take out orders or to pick up some chipped ham.    They bragged about using real butter - one of the few places to do so.  When I got my meal, it was beautiful - the real butter from my bread was dripping onto my bacon.  I think I shed a tear.  I asked how many eggs are in their omelettes because they were pretty big.  The answer I received was, \" We don't know, we just crack and pour!\"  They pride themselves on not measuring anything.  I have no complaints because my food was delicious.  After eating our meals the three of us decided to order the chocolate chip pancakes to share since we had heard so much about them. When the owner brought them over, she had individual plates for each of us with one pancake each.  And the best part?  She told us they were on the house.    I think we spent close to 2 hours there, which really says something about a place.  Especially when you consider that we had just worked a 12-hour overnight shift and exhaustion was setting in.  It was comfortable and a good time, perhaps the best breakfast experience ever.  We left telling the owners we would pass the word along and that we would definitely return.   They were happy to hear it, but told us not to expect more free panckakes."}
{"text":"It's a museum, a holy relic, a monument in time, a last standing, honest to goodness Isaly's. This place is one of the last 3 remaining diners from the iconic chain of restaurants. It was the focus of the PBS special, Sandwiches You Will Love.   If you are not a Pittsburgher, you may not understand or appreciate this place. The reason it does not change or innovative is because it is a genuine piece of nostalgia and a rather meaningful part of the lives of people who grew up here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from pittsburgh and he took me to breakfast to one of his favorite places: Isalys! He knows the staff and we were treated so well. The food was amazing, i had a the pecan pancakes, huge and delicious! Try their shakes, amazing.  The staff here is super friendly and kind. Wish i could transport them all to California."}
{"text":"This is one of the last of a Pittsburgh classic. In case you were aware, Isalys is an acronym for \"I Shall Always Love You Sweetie\".  In any event, they have solid breakfast game in Westview. It's really inexpensive, and the portions are more than generous.  Parking isn't too difficult to find on a weekend, but they're only open until 2pm - since the bulk of their business is breakfast and lunch diners.  A Pittsburgh original, creator of the Klondike. Check out Isalys if you haven't yet.  You never know when you'll wake up and it's gone like the rest of the 100+ Isalys in the Greater Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"This place is not going to wow you but also will not disappoint.  Their famous ham sandwich was too huge for us and bit salty. Their french fries are alright."}
{"text":"This is the worst breakfast I have ever had.  My eggs were overdone.  My potatoes weren't cooked with raw peppers and onions.  My sausage links were cold in the middle.  I sent them back.  The Italian toast was really good.  If you go there, just get toast."}
{"text":"My friend lives near here so I came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving. The inside is super dingy deli/convenience store, so I was excited for a real, down and dirty deli sandwich. They have a lot of weird items in their grocery section which can be kind of fun to look through.  I got an Italian \"hoagie\" as I feel is the appropriate term for this ultra-Pittsburgh spot. It was bad. Totally skimpy on the meat, and it had American cheese and mayo, which don't go well with Italian meats at all...provolone and oil & vinegar would have made way more sense. The bread was a squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it. It made me kind of sad. It was just a sad, floppy excuse for a sandwich. At least it was cheap?  Maybe I should have gotten the chipped ham instead, since that's what they are famous for. I also suspect the location in the North Hills has to be at least marginally better...this Isaly's is clearly past its prime."}
{"text":"HOLY. SANDWICH. BATMAN.  I feel like Joey Tribiani- \"Joey's favorite food?\" \"Sandwiches.\"  When TBone and I travel I really enjoy hitting up places that make the city what it is- things that mold and shape the history, if you will.   Did yous know where the chipped ham sandwich came from? How about the Klondike bar? ISALYS!!!   They didn't have Klondike bars when we went but we had the ham sammy. It was SO GOOD- just a regular old sammy on your bread of choice with shaved lettuce, onions and tomatoes- $3.99.  This is a really old deli- they sell an assortment of items- probably a little pricier than needed but the variety is part of the charm- where else can you get a pineapple pie in a Chinese noodle wrapper?! There are a few booths in the back for seating but the owner(?) was smoking a ciggy so we opted to eat in the car because Maks HATES getting ciggy with it.   If you're looking for fine dining, you won't get it here. It's a deli- it's a little grimy- but they make a FINE ham sammy."}
{"text":"Everytime, I come back home to Pgh to visit, I almays make it to Isaly's for the best breakfast in the burgh!  You think Primanti's is good, well you havn't had the \"Riser\" or the Isaly's chipped ham sandwiches.  You want to experience authentic Pittsburgh, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here with a dining companion this past Saturday.  Upon entering the restaurant it is easy to see that it is set up like the classic diner including the counter.  Around the restaurant are classic photos from when the area used to be West View Park that my dining companion and I enjoyed looking at.  Having been here once before to get a hand-spun milkshake many years ago, I once again ordered one even though it was breakfast time.  It was as good as I remembered it and was generously portioned since I was able to twice fill up my drinking cup from the metal cup that was placed at my table.  For my entree I ordered an omelette that was filled with swiss cheese and kielbasa.  Once again the portion was generous and it came with two pieces of toast and a side of hash browns.  All of it tasted good and by the end I was forcing it down in order to clean my plate.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back to Isaly's in the future.  The amount of food that you get for the cost is tremendous and even though I am too young to have even been to West View Park, the pictures were great."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, we weren't exactly sure what to expect because everyone inside just kinda swiveled their heads to stare at us. (Maybe we just reallyyy looked like we weren't from around there? Which we weren't. har har. :x ) But we were seated quickly and our server brought us our menus.  All of us were in the mood for burgers, but we were informed that the burgers couldn't happen that day, and that she'd understand if we wanted to leave. Since we were all ravenous to the point of being hangry, we decided to stay, and all of us were able to find something we wanted on the menu.   Aside from burgers, they also have sandwiches, salads, soups, and traditional breakfast items (e.g. pancakes, toast, eggs, omelets, etc.). Our server came back looking kinda like she wanted to crawl under our table, and informed our friend that they didn't have regular shrimp either, but that they did have popcorn shrimp. (From how distressed she looked, we kinda thought she'd come back to tell us that all they had was bread and cheese for the day.)  I got a chicken salad sandwich on toasted wheat bread and homefries on the side with green peppers + onions, and was very happy with my order (~$7). They don't skimp on the chicken, and it isn't super mayo-heavy, which I really appreciated. (Our server came back to tell us that the toaster had blown up, and that she couldn't toast our bread, but she's a terrible liar and was trying really hard not to crack up, so none of us believed her.) I also got to sample the onion rings that my friend ordered, which were super delicious!  Soooo, all in all, the food is great, especially for the prices they're offered at, and the staff is super friendly with a great sense of humor. They have ice cream on either a sugar or waffle cone, or milkshakes (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and the flavor of the month in March was Thin Mint), so we decided to each order dessert, and they actually gave it to us on the house to apologize for not having some of the things we'd wanted to order! :O  If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely come back here for inexpensive comfort food!  (They close at 3 p.m.!)"}
{"text":"Food is good and it's a neat throwback kind of place. Unfortunately the deli dude who has been there for years is a complete jerk. He should not be in a customer service role anywhere."}
{"text":"I was raised in the Youngstown, OH area and grew up getting Isaly's Chipped Ham BBQ at the store then cooking it all day in the crockpot. It is something I always loved and in my adult live still make it from time to time especially during football season. Having recently moved to Pittsburgh, one of the first things I made was Isaly's Chipped Ham BBQ Sandwiches for myself and a friend who moved here from New York who had never had it before. She loved it by the way!    So how surprised was I when I made a routine trip to the Dollar Store and looked across the street to see an Isaly's Diner!?  Unfortunately on that day it was closed because it was after 2pm. Take note of that, the hours are 7a-2p daily.  Now I only knew them for their ham but the diner front seemed to really push their breakfast so I decided that Sunday to head down and see what it was all about. Turns out that was one of the best decisions I've made recently!  As soon as you walk in you are sort of transported to a simpler time. There are some booths along the wall and then an actually counter to sit at. I picked the counter and was promptly greeted by the waitress. I told her I had just moved and was out exploring so she gave me a bit of history and as it turns out this is one of only three locations still in operation. They had a daily special and the waitress suggested the pancakes and to come back for a milkshake sometime. I wanted to do a traditional breakfast so I went with the Everyday Special which has 2 eggs any style, Sausage or Bacon, Home Fries and Toast for $6.49.  I went for over easy with sausage and Texas Toast. My food was prepared just down the counter where I could see and took only a few minutes. It was cooked to perfection! The eggs whites were cooked but the yolks remained \"dippy\" for my toast. The Home Fries had a nice crispy outside but soft inside. A little bit of Frank's really pushed them over the edge. The sausage links and Texas Toast with butter topped it all off.  Simple is sometimes better.  I will definitely come back to try the pancakes but it will be hard to pass this again.  The diner itself has pictures of yesteryear from the old West View Park along with some other local flare. There was a Newspaper on the counter to read if I wanted and they had the local news on the TV. My waitress was great. Very attentive and friendly. Plus she took the time to talk with me about the history surrounding Isaly's. She really made you feel welcome. I was there around 8:30a and left at about 9. When I arrived it was myself and maybe 2 other tables but as I was leaving it was starting to get busier. Another waitress had come in and I imagine the Church crowd was arriving.  Also as I was leaving I realized that they have a deli up front where you can get the famous ham along with various other cold cuts and the BBQ sauce. There is a cooler with a few beverages to go and a small gift shop area with shirts and small knickknacks.  I need to make it back to try lunch and grab a milk shake! If they are anything like the breakfast, this will be a regular backyard stop for me!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow!  There's still an Isaly's left in the North Boroughs?!  That in itself is amazing!  This is a nice place to grab breakfast or lunch if you're in West View.  The food was good and well priced.  Sides are extra with sandwiches, but the sandwiches are typically on the inexpensive side.  The best deal is probably the hot dog; it's a huge dog. The hot dog and beer battered onion rings run about $5.  Also, the milkshakes are also pretty tasty and inexpensive.    The atmosphere is meh, but definitely has that \"old school\" vibe.  The seating isn't very comfortable.  Overall, it was good and I'll go again."}
{"text":"This place has such the old school classic diner feel to it. The waitress are so laid back, funny, and friendly. They cook on the grill right out in the open which is also nice. The menu had plenty of options and at a very affordable price. I had a strong craving for breakfast food, so I tried the Steak and Eggs meal. It also comes with home fries and toast.  The food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. The meat was very rare, and the waitress didn't ask me how I wanted it. Luckily, I was okay with it being rare this time...which is quite unusual for me. It wasn't extremely flavorful, but when I added a little salt and pepper that did the trick. I definitely plan to visit again and will try out the Chicken Salad sandwich."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE Isaly's!!!!!!! Finally decided to try their signature \"Barnyard\" sandwich - described as the entire barnyard on one mancini's hoagie bun!!!!!! It doesn't come with any condiments on it, so I asked the server to bring me some Italian dressing on the side just in case, but I didn't even touch the dressing! The cheese melts to the egg and chicken tenders and chipped ham and bacon, and the lettuce and tomato give it a hint of coolness on an otherwise warm sandwich!!! This is for sure my go-to menu item from here on out!"}
{"text":"I will admit the chipped ham sandwich was good. It was tender and salty and soft on the wheat bread. But this is just a deli. More like a bodega than anything actually. The signage is classic and the neighborhood, especially Ohio Street, is a delight. Isaly's is a Pittsburgh legend, but more sentiment for yesteryear than anything."}
{"text":"The diner itself is nice and quaint. The waitress was overzealous and approaching me and my boyfriend several times to try to take our order. I had to inform her it was our first time there and we just wanted to get a good look at the menu. However, that did not stop her. Needless to say he ordered a sandwich and I ordered a chicken sandwich. The food is ok mediocre at its best I would not go out my way to get it."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for a sandwich and soup. We rolled in a little b4 closing but there were other folks in the joint. Didnt seem like the two employees were digging us being there but whatev. Choc Chip pancakes - average at best. Soup was good - Oriental beef but cold. Good milkshake - Chipped ham sandwich tastes better at home and a lot less expensive. That could be the coolest diner in the North Hills if they wanted it to be. Check out the ceiling tiles and the memorable pics from West View Park."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Delicious food, fun atmosphere, and great staff. My husband and I eat here a few times a month and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Add event for you my eggs benedict look nice but we're very chilly. He server in training never came back to ask if everything was okay."}
{"text":"Love this little gem in west view.  I've always been here for breakfast,  need to try lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Old school awesome!  If you like chipped ham, very good chipped ham omelet!  Reminds me of being a kid."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish there were a \"zero star\" option. This joint is a bodega style market without the charm. Not the Isaly's deli/market experience that once was. Shopkeeper is grumpy and he made me feel that being a customer was bothersome.  The store is small with basic convenience foods such as soda, candy, snacks, bread, etc. There's a deli with limited meat and cheese selections. I popped in at lunch wanting to grab some cheese to take back to the office. However, I was very sternly advised that I couldn't order a quarter pound of pepper jack; the minimum is half pound. What on earth? I've never heard of such a thing! The attitude and imposed minimum caused me to promptly walk out leaving other items on the counter I wanted to purchase. Sorry my $10 sale wasn't important enough for business."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Pittsburgh!  Our favorite is the eggs over easy with thick strips of bacon, home fries with onions and Italian white toast.  Great milk shakes and coffee too.  Their French toast is made with Mancini's bread and is delicious."}
