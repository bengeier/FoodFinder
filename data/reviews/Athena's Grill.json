{"text":"Hubby and I came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast. We needed something greasy and filling.  The menu was big, hard to decide on one thing, but I ended up getting an omelette and hubby had bacon, eggs, toast.   Our waitress was great, always bringing us fresh coffee and taking/bringing our orders promptly.  The meals were good, but nothing spectacular. Just on par with what we were expecting.  Prices were decent as well.   The place is in need of a little updating, however."}
{"text":"My husband and I keep going back, even though it seems like a Greek it does Italian food very well. It might need some help on the service side we still go back for the food."}
{"text":"Work once again brought me to Airdrie, and I vowed not to go to a chain. I found this place down the block from where I was working and it seemed like it could be good. The name, Athena's, made me assume it was Greek. I think it's marketed as a Greek restaurant, but once I took a look at the menu, it as so far from Greek.  This place reminds me of one of those sad little local shops from those restaurant renovation shows on the Food Network for HGTV where they have good potential, but don't have a distinct identity. Since they get stuck in this rut, they end up putting things like club sandwiches and chicken fingers on the menu because that's what the locals like to eat. That's exactly the impression I got.  I ended up trying to order something semi-greek, and that was the Calamari platter which came with rice and greek salad. All of it was pretty bad except for the calamari. It was battered and cooked perfectly. I get the impression that this place serves up a good breakfast, but unfortunately I wasn't able to try it.  My server was super cute though... yeah. I guess that's all I have to say.  29/30"}
{"text":"Menu has too much Italian food on it, for my taste in a Greek restaurant. But the food is good, I liked the atmosphere, and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"We were here in September. The staff and owner clearly recognised us however we were no longer treated well.  It was like they were mad at us. Have no desire to go back due to the lack of service. Food was still great but meh I can't have good food and poor service anywhere."}
