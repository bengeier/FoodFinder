{"text":"Yummy, non-greasy curry dishes, lots of vegetarian options, friendly, fast service.  Simple, good, and cheap.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"A few years back, when Curry in a Hurry first opened, my husband and I bought a couple of the entrees. Meat with rice and veggies. I didn't go back until recently, when I ordered two rotis: lamb and butter chicken. I thought I'd give Curry in a Hurry another chance and I'm sorry that I did.

The main reason is not flavour. I do find their food very flavourful. The reason why I'm not a repeat customer is that their food lacks value for the prices they charge.

Years ago when I ordered the entrees, the meat and veggie ratio to rice was miniscule. Rice is cheap, I get it, but come on!! White basmati isn't very filling compared to the price of nearly $10.00 per entree. 

Same thing goes for their rotis. It was the roti wrap and lots of potatoes, no vegetables and barely there meat. Two rotis, cost me just over $19.00. Island Foods and Vena's Restaurant have comparable prices for rotis but for better value."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!



This is not very good at all. There's a reason why someone would include \"in a hurry\" in the name of their restaurant. The food has the flavouring and appearance of a forgotten cafeteria. There's nothing special about this place at all. Stay home and heat up your frozen \"Indian Curry\" meal from President's Choice; it's very similar.
Plus, why would someone open up a place that serves roti this close to Vena's?

{"text":"I recently moved out to Welland (not a lifestyle choice, my boyfriend is attending school here), so when we had the opportunity to get back out to the cultural mosaic known as Toronto, we were very excited to get something to eat!

Unfortunately we arrived a bit later than planned. My boyfriend had a craving for butter chicken, so we went to this place because it was right off the subway. Our final destination was Holy Oak Cafe, and boy did I regret not checking their menu first!

Noting the lack of cleanliness of the place, we figured we couldn't really go wrong with basic butter chicken. He got cabbage on the side and I got the eggplant as well as the roti. Well, it turns out that we were very wrong! The chicken barely had any sauce on it, and it was very fatty.The little bit of sauce that was on it lacked any desirable flavor. The rice was ok, but cold. The eggplant was just a mush of tasteless slimy texture, with the occasional hint of spice, and I don't even know how to describe the roti - it was soggy and greasy, yet still very undercooked. My boyfriend had the same opinion as I did for everything, but insisted that the cabbage was decent. Needless to say, we had about three bites before I couldn't stomach it anymore.

I certainly am not by any means a connoisseur of Indian food, but at one point I did live in North Etobicoke, where family-run Indian restaurants and buffets were abundant so I had many opportunities to try an array of veg and non-veg dishes and Curry in a Hurry just didn't compare.

So on we went to Holy Oak Cafe, where thankfully I still had a bit of an appetite.."}
{"text":"The special thing about this place is that they make their own paratha roti, in a style that is very difficult to find even sort-of-ok-done anywhere else I've been downtown. Note: I don't mean roti as in a shell in which curry is wrapped, which they also have here. I mean roti as in the smaller round bread you eat with your curry from a dish.

I must admit, the first time I went, I was like, meh, this chana isn't so tasty, and the meat is sort of chewy, nothing special. But then I went back again. And again. And again! The fact is, this place really grows on you and reveals over time that it is totally delicious. I particularly recommend lamb or beef curry, with squash or eggplant. Or leeks, if they have them. And roti, of course!

It's been a few years since I lived in the neighbourhood, and I still make a special trip."}
{"text":"Everyone on Yelp seems to love Curry in a Hurry - but not quite enough to give it that fifth star.  Will I am taking the plunge and willing to back it up. With prose. Oh yeah, CIAH is that good - FOR THE STATED PURPOSE - Curry. In a hurry.

I'll admit it.  I walked right by the place initially.  4 Times!  Not by accident either - I've been burned by fast-ish food from the Indian sub-continent here in Toronto and elsewhere.  Hell, I've actually been burned by places called \"Curry in a Hurry\" before.  No, not burned in a good way.  In a \"Oh god, why did I eat that after the third bite?\" kind of way.  

The stars aligned last week to cause me to take the plunge - late meeting in Blandsdowne, no breakfast, meager lunch, nothing at home in the fridge - so I unsheathed my trusty Yelp-phone (what? you're still using an iPhone? That's sooooo January...) and looked at what everyone else had to say.  They were universally positive, so I walked in and gave the visual/olfactory scan (e.g. is the place clean and does it smell good?) Check and double check.  

There is a limited menu with an emphasis on snackier type foods for cheap as well as a decent selection of curries and a surprisingly rich suite of veggie options.  For a non-fried, lower fat option try the Idy - the CIAH version is 6 little pressed and steamed puffs of lentil/rice flour served with a couple of awesome chutneys.  The roti are all quite decent and represent a value relative to other similar establishments in the hood.  Of special note: The coconut chutney.  Lately, I've noticed a sad trend that a lot of places have begun to phone-in their traditional condiments / accompaniments; canned, bottled and jarred versions of the classics.  All of the condiments that I had at CIAH were house made and mighty fine.  The coconut chutney was so good I went back the next to purchase some just to have it around - in order to class up some of the lesser foods that might come my way.  

So, if you're in the hood, definitely stop by and check them out.  If you find yourself passing by Landsdowne on the TTC it is definitely worth a quick stop.  After all, you WILL get your curry in a hurry."}
{"text":"Right near the subway, tasty curried vegetables and meat. Tender roti. Great when you want to pick something up on the way home."}
{"text":"This area needs more palatable fast food/take out options. Curry in a hurry fits the bill. For those nights when you are too tired to cook, but don't want to fuss with a dine in restaurant, you will be glad you stopped off here. Veggie friendly, with interesting dessert selection, and right beside the Lansdowne subway station."}
{"text":"Oh Curry in A Hurry.  I am so sorry to say that it should have been named dirty curry in a hurry.  I would probably never eat here and would not go in if it were not for the shop owners that are so dang pleasant.  And the food is very affordable.   It is totally just a place of convenience for me as well.    Yes, I am aware that there is no reason that the universe should be designed for my convenience.....It is always right there as I get off the subway.  I try to walk by and not look in but the shop owners call out to me, asking about my wellbeing and thus luring me in. Alright, alright. I will have the butter chicken. In my mind's eye I have a déjà vu flash of the future; me sitting alone with my Styrofoam container consuming the meal, spitting out grisly chicken bits (trying to decipher what connective tissue it is), complaining about the quality of the meat and how I have just committed carbicide from all the naan/rice I have ingested.  I am never satisfied with my choice yet I go back time and time again.  My roommate always asks me \"why did you get curry in a hurry again?! what is wrong with you?!\"  I know that I am not addicted to curry in a hurry because I do not appear to have a physiological dependence on it and have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms.  However, it is a physical and perhaps more a psychological phenomenon as to why I still get take out from this establishment. Perhaps I need to develop my strength of character and just say no and walk on. 

menu: fairly diverse Indian dishes
quality: questionable/dirty
price: affordable
ambiance: teenie tiny take out joint with a few stools at the bar and friendly restaurant owners
location: freakin convenient, steps outside of landsdowne station at bloor"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna knock a star off just yet, but the roti at CinaH have gone a bit down hill recently... their thali dishes are still excellent, but I'm a bit disappointed.

They're so conveniently located I'm sure to return, but I'm less psyched (especially now that I've experienced the glories of Mother India).  

I will say this:  the man who runs this place is an incredibly nice, affable guy.  Maybe that's partly why I'm still \"a fan\"!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!

I've lived in Bloordale for a few years and have never been in enough of a hurry to try this place. However, there are very few takeout options in the neighbourhood so I figured why not! The first time I ate there it wasn't great but it the spot so I ate my meal. I didn't think much beyond acknowledging it was a mediocre place and to actively avoid eating there. 

A few months later I was craving Indian food so I went in and got one of the daily specials, I figured that it would have to be good seeing as it's what was the special of the day. I ate my meal and a few hours later was vomiting violently. This turned into a 4 day bout with food poisoning. I have an iron stomach so it was definitely out of the ordinary for me. 

I'm pretty sure the food is never fresh and every time I walk past the place I shudder to think that people are patrons of such a poor quality establishment.


Please do yourself a favour, when walking past it just keep walking. 

 I'm all about supporting businesses in my neighbourhood but when it comes to places that could potentially make other people sick too I will always err on the side of warning people to avoid certain places."}
{"text":"Come here often to get vegetable thali. 6 veg options + meat options (several), samosas, desserts, and the friendliest people you'll meet. Seating for 2 or 3 to watch the Lansdowne foot traffic, otherwise take out. I love this place for a good, inexpensive, delicious dinner."}
{"text":"After I was lured in by the promisingly blurry photo on the sandwich board outside, I was pretty surprised to see nothing on the hot trays but samosas and fritters when I entered the small shop. Though I suspiciously wondered where all of the curries were and what they might look like, I decided to blindly order the palak paneer. 

Slowly peeling himself away from the big flat screen that was playing a football match, the man behind the counter chitchatted with a couple of friends (I assumed as they seemed to just be hanging out), before disappearing to the back. A couple industrial sized Tupperware lid snaps, a few determined *thacks* of the serving spoon, and a series of microwave timer beeps later, I was handed a boxful of pockmarked, minisculely cubed paneer that resembled dried tofu in watery green globs that looked like straight up frozen spinach that's been thawing in the sink all day. The spicy channa side was the only saving grace. 

I absolutely hate to waste food, so this was one of the first times in my life where I had to throw my dinner away only half way through."}
{"text":"If only I didn't hear so much hype about this place before going.  I heard the place was outstanding, by a source who identified herself as 'picky'.  She said that she stopped going to Dosa Mahal after experiencing Curry in a Hurry.

I was invited to have lunch elsewhere today, but was obsessed with trying Curry... out.
I ordered exactly what my other (picky) friend raved about; she's a professional cook so I figured her standards were high and limited to what was tasteful.

Verdict: The price was right, my veg thali to go was also ready in a few minutes, service was nice enough.
Taste was... okay.  Not bad, but not outstanding.  Imo, flavours were subtle at best.

I'd go again... to try their paneer.  I did not see any dosas, so I'd like to revisit Dosa Mahal sometime or even elsewhere for a dosa.

Would I recommend them?  If you're in the neighbourhood, yes.
Otherwise, keep scouting elsewhere, maybe in Little India, for a veg thali deserving of the adjective \"awesome\", and then make better friends w/ me by personally letting me in on your latest scoop.

p.s. so many Indian sweets, also available!  $1.00 each piece, cheaper if you buy more."}
