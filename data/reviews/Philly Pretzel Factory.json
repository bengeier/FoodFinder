{"text":"Love this place!  Really great prices on soft pretzels!  Lots of dipping \"sauce\" options to enhance your pretzel eating experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service. We stopped here after a terrible $70 meal we didn't eat. The girl at the front counter and the manager were so nice and recommended their favorite menu items, which we got along with a few other items. Everything was delicious and soft. The pretzels are the best I've ever had and very reasonably priced. We will definitely be returning here often."}
{"text":"PPF is one of my favorite places to stop to get a quick bite. Each and every time I come here, I'm greeted with nothing but smiling faces. There's always so much to choose from- regular pretzels, cinnamon, rivets, trays, pretzel dogs, etc.  The list goes on an on!! I love that you can always see someone in the back making fresh pretzels. This ensures that the pretzels aren't sitting out all day long and are made frequently. 

My personal favorite is the pretzel dog. It's always cooked to perfection and warmed just right. You can never go wrong with the classic pretzel though. And the cinnamon one.... actually who am I kidding they're all fantastic. Each pretzel has a unique dip that pairs perfectly with it. They even sell big containers of the dips if you're really feeling it. 

Oh! I forgot to mention they have coffee in this location as well!! They offer French vanilla flavored or a breakfast blend. The coffee is always fresh as well and is amazing. You definitely have to try a cup! 

Lastly, this establishment is always so clean. For how much they're cooking in the back, I would think there would be salt everywhere and little pretzels hiding everywhere. That's certainly not the case here. It's kept so nice and clean which is very important in the food industry. 

Did I mention they can bless your party/ gathering with the most delicious trays of pretzels? I've gotten a full size tray of rivets so many times and I feel like they never go bad for the whole time of the event. You even get 3 big dips when you get this tray! Seriously the perfect addition to whatever you're catering. 

I am seriously so obsessed with this place. I stop each time I'm out this way!"}
{"text":"I have been getting pretzels here for every tailgate or party I have! They are always delicious! My guests absolutely love them and there are never any left. I was having a 30th bday party and was running around picking up beer and other food and ended up arriving an hour late than the time I scheduled to pick up my pretzel tray. The girl at the counter offered to remake them for me so they were hot and fresh for my guests! Awesome customer service and amazing snacks! I will continue to order here for every party."}
{"text":"I love this place! They offer catering tray options, which I have used for work and family functions. They are always a hit! 

The service is fast, the pretzels are great! The cheese sauce dip never disappoints! I just recently tried the icing dip, and my office devoured it! So good! What I find most convenient is that they only need 10-15 minutes notice for a catering tray! 

Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place!
The pretzels are excellent and the prices are incredible!
We now have our \"go-to\" snack to bring to parties and picnics. The 1/2 tray of rivits comes with two dips for $22.00!
There are over a hundred of these little bite sized pretzels and they are made fresh while you wait in less than ten minutes.
Can't miss for any function, it pittsburgh, everyone loves pretzels!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.
Great party \"gift\"
Took a tray to deep creek and it was a big hit and everyone loved it.
Several people were from the D.C. Area and wanted to know if there were any close to them.
Love the variety of dips for them, not a mustard fan so the other option are great."}
{"text":"Apparently it was national pretzel day on Saturday.  Who knew?  In honor of the \"holiday\" they were giving away free pretzels, so we stopped in.  

The pretzels are usually around $2 each and were very tasty.  Perfectly soft dough, just the right amount of salt and fresh and hot out of the oven.  Perfection.  They also had a variety of sauces to dip your pretzel. They ranged from several flavors of mustard, chocolate and cream cheese.  

In addition to their plain pretzels, they had pretzel dogs, pretzel pizzas and even a cheese steak pretzel.  We did not try any of them on this visit, but with as tasty as our pretzels were, we will on a future visit.  

There are two coolers worth of beverage options in bottles and cans all priced between $1 and $2.  

The downside is that there is no customer seating area.  There is quite a bit of space to the right of the counter that seems to be a work area of some sort, but there was nothing going on there.  It would be nice to have a small seating area in case you didn't want to eat your pretzel in the car.  This would be especially handy if you did purchase any of the dips as they can be quite messy.

Bonus:  If you check in on Yelp, you get five free when you purchase five."}
{"text":"Members in my office occasionally bring in soft pretzels from Philly Pretzel Factory, and they did again this morning. Now, I am a FIEND for soft pretzels and what I have sampled from here ROCKS!!!! Always warm and oh so soft I am reminded of my bed. And they don't over use the salt like most concession stands you may run into at a sporting event. They have plain and cinnamon flavors as well as a wonderful variety of dips! 

They have: minis, rivets (they are like bite sized nuggets), pretzel dogs and sausage, and stuffed pretzels (think buffalo chicken or cheese steak!!!). 

What really makes this place stand out are customized shaped pretzels, in addition to their already unique shape that looks more like a chain link than the typical twist! I haven't seen any of these in person, but the pic on the website shows a collection of sea creatures, such as lobsters and crabs. They look really awesome! I bet customized pretzels would really be neat at a bridal or baby shower! I WILL visit in person and have a cheese steak! I WILL!!!

Also look for their office deal: 50 pretzels for 15$ before 9am!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband drives past on his way home from work. He makes a point of stopping at least once a week. The pretzels are always soft and warm. They have some stuffed with hot dogs, pizza topped,  nuggets or just pretzels. They also have dipping sauces and party platters. The pretzels are delicious and I would recomend them."}
{"text":"No! No way! I never thought I'd be saying this, but I found a pretzel that exceeds The Pretzel Shop on the South Side. 

Ever since my first visit to Philly when I was eight years old, I fell in love with those pretzel street vendors selling those amazing crunchy, chewy, salty treats. Each vender seemed to have a different mustard. Didn't matter, I wanted soft pretzels. I remember my older cousin Frankie taking me to a place near Betsy Ross' house. A portly man, quick witted, W.C. Fields nose, white hair, reminded you of someone's grandfather. Frankie ordered two pretzels and the man squeezed the most amazing mustard on them. We sat on a stoop (Philly speak for steps) and shared a conversation about baseball and we downed those pretzels like they were the last meal we were ever going to eat. Sorry I got off the subject....

After working out at LA Fitness I needed some carbs, I saw the Philly Soft Pretzel Factory and pulled in. My mind was transported back to Philly for just a moment. These looked like the ones W.C. Field's sold out of his cart. I ordered one and went outside on the stoop and took a bite.

Cue the harp and fade out like a dream sequence from the 60's TV shows.

I was eight years old, Frankie was 17 again, still the same cheesy teen boy mustache, I was wearing P F Flyers,  I had on a horrible striped shirt like I was on the TV show Zoom, and a mustard gold Pirates cap on my head. Frankie was showing me on a map where Shibe Park used to be, and how close we were to the Liberty Bell.  We'd go there after we finished our pretzels. He wiped the mustard off my face, straightened my hat, told me he'd buy me a Phillie's cap and we walked to the car.

Back to the present. It's amazing how a food, or a smell can take you back to simpler times, when all you had to do in life was pass your classes and do homework. The pretzels they sell here remind me of the one they sell on the carts in Philly.

They also have Pretzel sandwiches and Pretzel wrapped hot dogs The real hot dogs with the natural casings. If there's no parking on the South Side, head over to Collier and hit this place up. If you've ever had one in Philly, be prepared to take a trip there in your mind.

PS I still have that Phillie's cap. I need to call Frankie."}
{"text":"Normally love the place and while knowing it was busier than normal on NYE like normal I called to place an order, was told when I called no need to order there will be a \"steady stream \" of pretzels coming we out should be able to grab and go. No problem. Get to the location in bridgeville and see a line to get in the store again understanding go through the drive thru again a wait no worries. After about 30 minutes get to the window place my order was told I would have to wait another 20-25 minutes I asked why was told that they were busy which was understood but I was told that a \"steady stream\" and would be on and out. The young lady who waited on me said to her manager she was ignoring me cause I questioned the additional wait. Finally another young lady came in a huff to assist and handled my order I tried to pay but she wouldn't accept that was not my intention as I do purchase these for nearly all our parties however I may have to rethink being in the customer service industry for a good deal of my life it was odd how these group dealt with pressure and very off putting"}
{"text":"Living very close to this place stinks! ;) Only because I want to visit more often than I should.  The pretzels are always fresh, decently priced, and the employees are so pleasant!  We regularly visit and order trays for occasions.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband brought these home the other day and they are out of this world delicious!  I am sending him back for more on his way home from work today. Addictively good!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review after being contacted by the business owner Scott K. shortly after posting my original review. With that said, Scott was very responsive and I truly feel he wanted to make things right.  And while We both agree that without him present, similar situation may happen, Scott assured me that he would be talking to his staff so they understand how their behavior and interactions can affect a new business.  It is inevitable that there will be bad apples here and there, I do think Scott has taken measures to not only do right by me, but for future customers.

I was provided with a large party tray that I took to work for coworkers to make up their own minds on quality. I am happy to say, this tray was great. Like night and day compared to the stale rivets I received on my previous visit. Everyone enjoyed the tray which included a large tub of cheese, one of honey mustard and one of cinnamon butter.  I liked them all.  I'd still suggest that at least one dipping sauce of choice should come with each order.  

As for the service, this experience was far superior. The employees were both friendly and welcoming and helped me quickly get my order and be on my way. Everything looked sanitary and the display case was in good order.  

Between Scott's communication and willingness to right a wrong, demonstrated improvement in staff appearance and professionalism, along with a superior product, I am happy to update my review to reflect a proper experience the way it should be. I am hopeful that this level of execution will continue at Philly Pretzel Factory!"}
{"text":"If you are gluten free or afraid of yeast, this isn't your place. If you love carbs, especially the warm fluffy ones that make a soft pretzel, this is your place. 

There's a drive through for pretzels. The folks are nice and don't rush you to order. There are sauces you can get to accompany your pretzel that start at 50 cents (i.e. Mustard). If you check in, there's a good deal you can redeem for a bunch of pretzels. 

Cinnamon sugar pretzel is not overly sweet and is enjoyable. The plain salted pretzel is everything I imagined a fresh pretzel could and would be. 

I'm glad I don't live near this place because I'd be stopping by everyday to stuff my face."}
{"text":"If you love pretzels you'll love this place.   

They have pretzel dogs, cheese steak pretzels, cheese pretzels.  Custom pretzels.  We had some rivets and some cinnamon pretzels.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh!! Friendly service, extremely fast as well. They can have any party tray ready in under 15 minutes. You can just walk in and order a tray even at 7:00AM when they open. They even serve craft coffee. Keep up the great work PPF!!!"}
{"text":"First time to one of these pretzel places and they didn't disappoint. The pretzels came right of the oven and were delicious!  We paired our pretzel with the cheese and it was the right choice second only to mustard.  The staff was very friendly and they even threw in a free pretzel dog for Hot Dog appreciation day.  I'd go back but we live a couple hundred miles away."}
