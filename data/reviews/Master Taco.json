{"text":"Amazing breakfast burrito packed full of meat. We were looking for a quick breakfast and this place was fantastic. It was very clean inside and the food was delicious. The best burrito I've had in a very long time. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Love love this new place , have been going 2 times a week. Food is great and very authentic, everything is fresh. Prices and service is great as well. Hope they stay for a long time, we need a great fast food Mexican restaurant on this side of town."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada Fries are so good and HUGE. That also have great customer service. Great for after drinking food."}
{"text":"Place is super clean, even the air smelled fresh. Got two tacos, rice and beans. Wish I had gotten one taco plus sides, two is too much food! Taco shells fried fresh, no cold hard shells here. Good tasting beef, rice looked fresh. Beans okay, would eat them again but can't imagine craving them. Chips are made every two hours per owner, fresh but need salt. Hot sauce good amount of garlic, better than many I've had in Surprise, but nothing compares to El Norteno at 7th Ave and Roosevelt! Homemade flan people! Will definitely be going back to try something new. Lady who waited on me was very nice."}
{"text":"Worth trying, Master Taco. It was very authentic, great food. Glad I stopped by, wont be the last."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a quick, good to go Mexican meal.  Restaurant isn't much, but who cares if the food is good!  Quick service and the salsa bar is yummy. Needs bigger bowls for the salsa, the little containers don't hold enough, needed three to go with my taco plate . We'll be back"}
{"text":"Discovered, this new Mexican taco place literally around the corner from my home.  Went in and gave it a try last Saturday morning for breakfast ( yes they have a breakfast section ) bought the chilaquiles rojos  a bacon breakfast burrito ( bacon, eggs, cheese hash browns and Pico de Gallo ) a chorizo burrito ( spicy Mexican sausage egg and cheese )  the portions were nice . And the taste was amazing.  Simply delicious the staff friendly and courteous. Prices are not bad either. A must if you're craving a traditional Mexican breakfast or a huge breakfast burrito. Today I returned to try out the Carne asada burrito and a green Chile burrito. Again these are giant burritos the asada was very good perfect texture and taste. The chow Verde was also just the right amount of heat just enough for that perfect balance not to over powering. I will go out on a limb and say this little gem is probably the best here in Surprise AZ. I totally recommend this place you won't regret it . I will definitely be returning to try the other items on the menu. Keep up the good work  Master Taco folks ."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast.  The food was amazing with HUGE proportions so take a friend or two.   Very clean, service was great.  Only warning, they do not serve coffee so pick that up on your way."}
{"text":"Terrible can't imagine anyone going here twice.  Zero flavor.  It all tasted the same"}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Mexican restaurant in Surprise! Been here several times and haven't had a bad meal yet!!!"}
{"text":"New taco place in surprise!!! Pretty damn good!! I had a fish taco and that was really good Rice and beans was also good it was our first visit will be back again..."}
{"text":"Been here 4 or 5 times now. Absolutely love there Chile verde. The sauce has great flavor and just the right heat. Not an ounce of fat on the meat. Chile relleno  was a good size and loaded with cheese"}
{"text":"Trout adults went in 1 Saturdays ago.   Family owned an operated. My son and I had A Carne Asada burrito--best we have eaten and a very large burrito with pico de  Gallo and guacamole al  3taquitos and guacamole- and a Carnita Burrito thAt was wonderful. We give them  FIVE STARS.   Sauces were very authentic too. Very large portions."}

{"text":"This place is our new go to fast food Mexican restaurant. Way better then any of the \"bertos\" on the west side. Friendly staff, great food and super clean."}
{"text":"The Good: clean, spacious, friendly staff, breakfast all day, biggest and heaviest breakfast burrito I have ever seen. I ordered 1 chicken and 1 beef enchilada. The chicken was alittle pink and rubbery. Tortillas were good. Son said the breakfast burrito had average flavor. Chips were bland. Average and clean."}
{"text":"I have tried several of the menu items here and so far everything is just awesome.  Nothing is bland or to spicy, the employees are all super nice. This has to be the best Mexican restaurant in Surprise. Try the rolled tacos, you will love them"}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't been disappointed yet. Chili verde is amazing, just the right amount of heat. It's literally the only Mexican place I'll eat at here."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this New Mexican restaurant in Surprise and I had to come check it out for myself . When I walked in there were already quite a few people eating and a few in line. That's a good sign right? The menu was pretty extensive and it was hard to decide because everything sounded yummy. Good thing I came with a friend so we could both order multiple items and share them all.  I settled on the #2 combo which was two tacos rice and beans. They have a choice between carne asada, carnitas, grilled chicken or shrimp. I ordered a carne asada and carnitas. I also ordered a side of chips and salsa. My friend ordered carne asada fries. They had a good size salsa bar and the salsa was amazing. My favorite was the green sauce, but the red was good with the chips. The girl taking our order was great. Very friendly and my friends baby could not stop smiling at her and watching her every where she went. She interacting with him well. Our food came out so fast and the portions were huge! The tacos were filled so full with meat and the meat was juicy. A lot of the places around here the meat is always dry. When I picked up the taco it was actually heavy and  I almost couldn't bite it because it was so big. I love that! This place is not stingy. The rice and beans were good as well. The. Carne Asada fries were also huge and could easily feed four people. They could probably feed four people. Free drink refills as well. The decor is pretty basic. Good amount of seating, salsa bar, tv, but no real decoration or anything like that. It's not a huge chain restaurant style , but with the food portions and plate sizes you'll feel like you are and leave with a full and satisfied belly."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in to try their tacos for the first time. Was ok I guess nothing really special about them. I ordered the carne asada which were pretty dry. Almost tasted pre cooked or something. My husband asked for shrimp tacos and was very disappointed in them as well said they tasted like mayo. Not sure how so many people rated this location 5 stars. Am I missing something here? Either way we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm originally from California, and we had a lot of Mexican eatery's there, been looking since we moved here 6 years ago. Master Taco is great, my husband and I have been there at least 5 times in the last month, best Mexican food around, highly recommend it,"}
{"text":"Just recently visited and really liked the food, good lil joint to have close to home"}
{"text":"Really good quick Mexican food...ground beef wasn't greasy at all...my husband got the carna asada and it was really good too...love the fact that it's family owned I love supporting small businesses. They have a great little salsa bar as well.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good. The staff is friendly and they work fast. It is convenient to me so that is a major plus. The horchata had a bit too much cinnamon for my taste, but might be perfect for someone else. One other small preference thing, I would prefer the meat a bit more charred rather than have that boiled texture."}
{"text":"I heard about this New Mexican restaurant in Surprise from one of my coworkers!!  It's great finally having a really good restaurant like this!  The portions are huge!!   The food was great !!  There were tables for eat in service and  it's awesome take out location too!!   We will definitely be back soon!!   Great friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"Three of us went to this recently opened place for lunch and were amazed at how good the food is.  I had the Enchilada Combo - 2 enchiladas, rice, beans - which is a nice size portion; I ate half and took the other half home.  I got 1 cheese & 1 chicken enchilada and I must say both the enchiladas were pretty fat!  The chicken was tasty and nicely seasoned.  The salsa bar is a nice feature; it would have been nice if the salsa's were labeled.  The restaurant is not fancy, you place your order at the counter and it is brought out to you.  The restaurant is clean, the service is efficient, the food is fresh, the young lady who took our order was friendly and welcoming, the prices are reasonable for the amount of food.  Thank you Master Taco, we finally have a very casual Mexican restaurant in Surprise that serves yummy food.  We will be back. =)"}
