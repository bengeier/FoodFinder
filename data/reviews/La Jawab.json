{"text":"This is an equivalent of the average, run of the mill corner restaurant/cafe in India. In short, it is nothing special, but being in Canada, it is a novel thing. Anyways, I have been there a couple of times, the food is good and the sweet/snack shop has things like eggless pastries and other Indian style bakery items. The food is great value for the quantity and taste is strictly good. PS: Naan is horrible. I'd order take out for curries and buy the frozen naan from the Indian grocery stores next door."}
{"text":"Bad customer service with don't  care attitude! Will never visit again!"}
{"text":"La Jawab food indeed is 'La Jawab', as the restaurant name promises. I love their Manchurian Hakka Chicken and Noodles, the taste is extraordinary.I am also a fan of every veg and meat  dish on the menu.   They carry Milk badam and damn is too dieeeeeee for! They also have a sweet shop just right next door. Tasty and high quality Mitai(Indian Sweets),and  I must say, I love the pastries also, they are like pastries from back home. Everything light including sugar. Chocolate, Strawberry and (Mango I think.) They have it all really!! A little bit of everything.  Even the restaurant  caters , if that is an option your looking for, and you know what, the owners are 100% professional. They are doing a good job running their business, tasty food, and great customer service. On point 5/5! I highly recommend this to everyone. Always have good words for this place."}
{"text":"La Jawab also spelt, Lajawab, serves indian and Hakka Chinese cuisine.  What impressed me about this place was the service. The owner or manager always made sure we had enough water and never made us wait when we needed more naan :)  They have equal amounts of dishes for vegetarians and meat lovers :) Actually, if you include the appetizers, there's actually more vegetarian dishes.  We came here with a group of friends and ordered two kinds of Daal (yellow and black lentils), plain naan, garlic naan and butter naan, vegetarian pakoras with chick peas, another appetizer I can't remember the name of, butter chicken lol, garlic chili prawns, and a couple of other dishes I can't remember either hahaha *sigh* :( But, I will tell you this; the food is good here and worth a visit.  The thing is, I love indian food, pakistani food, punjabi food like anything from that part of the world and I've been to many \"indian\" restaurants and its never the same... like noway nohow; everyone has their own little twist on the same dishes, its so hard to benchmark anything. Its pretty much about the handful of dishes or maybe theres just 2 that you really like at one restaurant that will make you come back for more. Maybe its the service and maybe its just that they have amazing Chai :) So, from my experience and comparing it with the many, many, many indian restaurants I've dined at in my life, La Jawab deserves 4 stars.   All I can say is that you can expect to have a consistent experience here, their naan was very good, and their dishes had the right amount of quantity.  Great service and delicious food, even though we had to wait a while for the chai, it didnt matter too much to me; more talking and catching up with old friends.  oh yeah! and their Gulab Jamin and Rasmalai were really good. If you get their gulab jamin, make sure you let it sit for a bit to cool down; mine was served really hot."}
{"text":"Sooo good. We had butter chicken along with a very good tandoori chicken. Both were amazing. Decided to accompany the chicken dishes with some veggie byriani and a paneer dish and they were pretty awesome. The service was for the most part very friendly but would like some of the staff to at least pretend they are happy. But if you want some Indian food in a different location try this place out."}
{"text":"It is an amazing restaurant. My co-workers introduced this place to me and I had crash on its flavour!!! Yummmmmm. Will for sure go again"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. Whenever we are in Calgary or passing through, we always stop here. Chilli Chicken at this location is so flavourful and delicious. I have also tried their tandoori chicken n fish, and they are also good. I live in Toronto, and sometimes miss this place and crave for their chilli chicken."}
{"text":"Although there are many Indian restaurants in northeast Calgary, to many people this one stands out among them. Three times we've been here, two times with friends. Most of the food was very good each time, and most flavours right up there. Chicken tikka is very good, as are their curries, garlic naan bread, but flavours don't quite peak with the best of them. But on one occasion we ordered a stew-type dish that was apparently Hakka / Manchurian chinese, and it was really bad. Not only was it strange in name (to the best of my knowledge, the old Manchurian province is far from where the Hakka people originated), but it jarred in two more ways: if I can trust the flavours and presentation of Hakka foods in northern Taiwan, this stuff is not authentic at all; it didn't taste at all good, but was reminiscent of someone dreaming up a discordant recipe item on the fly.  Ah, La Jawab, stick to your strengths, good Indian food, and leave this strange fake Manchurian thing behind. Oh yes, they are not alone in this  habit, as other restaurants in the same strip-mall area do it also. But dropping in on them, I discovered the same anomaly... Eat your fill of Indian at La Jawab when in the northeast of the city. Can't miss for their Indian flavours."}
{"text":"Very good food, service was pleasant, and food came quickly. Check out the bakery next door!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was an great experience dinning in La Jawab. Service was really good,Food came quickly. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The food was really tasty we love the food..... One of the best India restaurant in Calgary. Will be back....."}
{"text":"So happy with this place. We had troubles finding it - it's kind of nestled in behind another mall - but worth the search.  We had the lamb kebobs to start and then shared the coconut chicken and a goat curry with coconut rice and butter naan. All were hot, delicious and in huge portions. The staff was friendly and gave suggestions on what to try. And the masala tea was lovely.  We didn't have dessert because we were so full, but they have an attached sweet shop which tempted us.  Will go again!"}
{"text":"Called in advance to tell them I want to eat \"apna\" style, home/our style. And they met that through and through. All the vegetarian dishes were distinct, flavorful and great portioned. Asked for onion kulcha (off menu) and it was SUPERB!  Definitely one of the better Indian places I have been to in Calgary. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality and authentic taste on both my visits. My parents have been raving about this place for years now. We ordered the Tandoori Fish Pakora, Goat Roganjosh, Manchurian Chicken with Hakka Noodles, Lamb stuffed Naan, Garlic Naan. I normally don't order so many battered items at once and I'm sure your server would be more than happy to recommend something, but it was all delicious!  After lunch we popped into the sweet shop, and picked out a couple pretty little treats to take home."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The service makes the restaurant absolutely a pleasure to visit. The food is delicious and portion sizes are also good. Prices are fair. My only comment is that they charge for yogurt- this should be no different than the free chutney accompaniments and should be included especially since some guests may find the food spicy."}
{"text":"Too much quantity is served per item so prepare for that and order. We ordered tandoori fish( dint like it) , chicken tikka( was okay), kadai chicken with naan -ok and chinese chicken fried rice (dint like it)."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Value! Well worth the drive to the NE! Perfect sized portions and wide range of menu options. Very friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian food! My husband and I came here Sunday afternoon as he was craving Indian food,  one of his friends recommended this place. Glad we came in and tried it. The waiter was very helpful and we ordered a chicken curry dish that was not on the menu but he recommended with garlic naan. Everything was delicious. My husband cannot wait to return next time we are in Calgary!"}
{"text":"We love the food, environment, excellent customer service. Coconut chicken curry is my favorite here. Kudos"}
