{"text":"I am giving this restaurant five stars because really, there is nothing negative I can say.  I'm pretty particular about fried chicken and I must say that this establishment really does it right.

Dixie Lee is a concept that is mostly familiar to inhabitants of small towns where there is room for only one chicken establishment.  This is a shame because based on my two recent experiences, based on taste, texture and quality, they can really compete with larger chains.

My most recent visit was a 3-piece meal with potato wedges, macaroni salad and a soft drink.  Their prices are similar to KFC and Popeyes although the are advertising a 2-piece combo at present for a special price.  The salad and potatoes (generous portion) were standard.  The chicken was golden brown, moist and really quite delicious.  You can detect a subtle hint of sage in the seasoning.  Given the texture of the chicken, I wouldn't be surprised if they brine or marinate their chicken like Popeyes and Mary Browns do.  Again, it was very yummy.

My other recent visit was in December 2014 and I had a half rotisserie chicken meal with all the fixings.  They smear and briefly grill the chicken with your choice of sauce prior to serving.  I think this is optional.  I had the rustic barbecue.  It was quite good but again, I was impressed by the texture of the chicken.  It's a bit more expensive than the fried chicken, but I think it's worth it if you're in the mood for rotisserie.

Service has been consistently very polite and friendly.  Overall, this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the fourth fried chicken business to occupy this exact same spot.  Popeyes was replaced by Dave's, then Max's, and now Dixie Lee's!

They have both roast and fried chicken as well as fish and shrimp options.  We had the two piece snack and 3 piece fried chicken dinner.

Service was friendly, fries crispy (seasoned variety) and the chicken was crispy moist pieces of finger licking goodness.  Coleslaw was standard fare for a chicken joint.  Give it a try.  I would say it's on par with Mary Browns and KFC but I still prefer Popeyes spicy chicken and that biscuit...."}
{"text":"It is my third or fourth Dixie Lee I have tried in Ontario since I moved here from the maritimes , the Acadian peninsula in new Brunswick and let me tell you Dixie Lee down home is the place to go for a great fried chicken , and i must say after my many attempts here it is simply not the same level of quality or commitment that is driven here with the franchisee, I had a brief chat with I believe the manager of the new store here on Hampshire gate in Mississauga, I told him my concern and he was very attentive to my comments and told me that the franchisee from Ontario do use different spices vs the maritimes which make sense on why the chicken taste different and according to him more salt to be precise vs pepper for the east coast,  I m not sure how this got decided but I gotta say any of the readers if you ever go visit new Brunswick or some rural area of Quebec , do take the time to go and enjoy a Dixie Lee fried chicken, you  will be hooked for life , sincerely renald power Oakville on , but born and raise in new brunswick"}
