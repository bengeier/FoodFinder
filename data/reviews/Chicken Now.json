{"text":"they are not consistent with their serving , evry crew has its own way of making menu.. not going here anymore! the service is good but the quality of food is horrible!"}
{"text":"It's like a bootleg version of Canes or Chik Fil A. They're chicken is pretty good. They're fries are only good when they are fresh, if not they're hard as rocks. Never, I repeat NEVER get their coleslaw. When I tried it I thought I was getting poisoned, has a really nasty sour taste to it."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken amongst the best.  Nachos could have more chicken and condoments. Monster fries also great but the original chicken is hands down the winner!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken is fresh and juicy to order. Good sauce and nice flavor,very pleased with my visit . I recommend you yelpers to try it out . Thumps up!!"}
{"text":"Now that's some good chicken! But just get the chicken strips. Not that the wrap or the nachos were bad, but they seemed to take away from the deliciousness of the simple chicken.
Another note: holy hell, it took a long time to get our meal. Not my definition of fast food."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Partly because they use local ingredients whenever they can and partly because their mashed potatoes and french fries are delish. 

Also, you must try the taco salad. I get mine without chicken, but I'm sure it tastes good both ways."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great, but the service was amazing also. We just stopped to get our daughter a snack and got the chicken tender meal. Two tenders, a ton of fries, and a drink for $5. The food and the sauces were awesome. Hungry? Stop here!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty gooood! It's like, the ghetto version of Raising Cane's! Hahaha but it's still good. I swear... Their chicken is the same, the fries are good and crispy, and the Texas Toast is buttery. To be honest though, Raising Cane's is better when it comes to the toast ;p
They also have their special sauces! Almost like Cane's sauce! It's crazy! They have a spicy and a non-spicy. I prefer the spicy sauce because it enhances the flavor of the chicken, fries & most especially the toast. I paid $9.72 for a 4 piece tender box. It came with 4 pieces of chicken and two sides. I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great chicken...closest thing to Chick Fil-A you can get in Las Vegas!  A little annoying with the cashiers screaming out \"welcome Chicken Now want sample!?!\"  I was in the middle of ordering and I guess some people walked by behind me and she stopped to scream this at them with a toothpick of chicken pieces.  BUT, every other restaurant in this food court was doing the same thing so I didn't hate on it too much.  The sauce is great, breading is great, French fries are seasoned and crispy, and Plantains sides is delightful.  Last good thing is the new Coca-Cola machine with the 1000+ flavor combos...always a good finisher for a restaurant in my eyes!"}
{"text":"The lady who made my juice didn't seal it well and didn't check it so when I took the juice it spilt everywhere. I took half hour to clean my white shirt and lamb skin handbag and it still had juice stain on it now. So bad experience!!!!"}
{"text":"i would've given this place a higher rating...
but how come a chicken sandwich that would cost $3.99 elsewhere, cost $6.49 at this place?"}
{"text":"Definitely the best option at the foot court in this mall hands down. The chicken tenders tastes like real chicken unlike other chicken tenders offered at other fast food places. It doesn't have the mass produced taste to it. Plus they have an awesome soda machine where you can get any flavor combo with Coke Zero, for example. I settled for a Vanille Coke Zero (I could've gotten raspberry, but that doesn't sound like it would taste good) which tasted great."}
{"text":"very tasty??the price was a deal compared to other places on the strip, i thought it would lack in the flavor department but decided to try because it looked clean. 

Boy was i wrong the food here is amazing and id much rather eat here then raising canes."}
{"text":"Chicken Now is ok. WIth such an expensive food court, you really can't complain about the sort of food/price Chicken Now sells at.

Their tenders are pretty good and crispy but they don't give you a lot of it with any meal.
My suggestion is just to purchase only the tenders since nothing else is really THAT good there."}
{"text":"We typically go to Canes for our chicken tenders, and there's one outside the mall, but after hearing a coworker rave about how good this place is we had to try it! The fries were, to quote my boyfriend, \"like really good bar fries\", coated with an extra layer of something to give it that extra crunch! Their fries are awesome! The fry sauce has a lot more pepper than Canes and is a bit thinner, or was during our visit. I don't know if they make the sauce on site or not, so I don't know if that varies. The chicken was good, hot and fresh, but not especially noteworthy for any outstanding reason. The coleslaw was a bit meh. The fries were my favorite part, without a doubt. Not a terrible option, especially if you're already in the mall and have a hankering for chicken!"}
{"text":"there is  a freakin nail in their bread. i also heard that they had so much complaint in their food quality. never eat in this place ever!!!! especially the one in meadows mall."}
{"text":"Saw this place in the food court and had to give it a go since it was the most legit place in the food court. Well, Chicken Now was like a rip off of Raising Canes! They even have a special sauce, that looks and tastes just like Canes. I ordered the chicken finger combo. It came with fries and a piece of texas toast on the side-- just like Canes! I was not impressed, I would much rather have Raising Canes any day over Chicken Now.

A few things make Chicken Now kind of cool (but not cool enough) is the loud hip hop music that they bump in the food court, they have kool-aid on the menu and they even have chicken and waffles! -- but still. it does not compare. Sorry Chicken Now, I wouldnt want you \"now\" or \"ever again\". oooh burn, see what i did there?"}
{"text":"the only reason why i came here was because there wasnt really that many choice of what to eat inside the LV premium outlet. anyways, i got their original chicken burger with fries for about $5.41 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chicken-now-las-vegas?select=TqjALenSZhFPbI_CXk-uYA#TqjALenSZhFPbI_CXk-uYA). their chicken was okay, taste like a regular fried chicken and nothing special. i only ate one bite and let my brother finished the rest.. the fries was pretty good and crispy.. it taste more like homemade fries than fastfood fries.. they also have some sauces selection for you to choose from.. you can dip ur fries into these sauces to make it taste better. but its definitely not a memorable meal.."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here , the place is usually packed.  At first I was a bit hesitant; thinking it was just like Cane's, but it actually can stand its own!  I've came here on numerous occasions for lunch and they are always on-point with their service.  On top of that, they have never messed up my order or change.  I know it may sound simple, but seriously fast food joints always seem to mess up my order/change some how or another.  No complaints here.. I definitely would recommend!

Pros:
 * Located conveniently inside South Premium Outlets (formerly Belz)
 * awesome soda machine with over 100 flavor combinations!
 * Excellent customer service.
 * huge portions
 * Grandma's Sauce is bomb!

Cons:
 * the wait is a bit longer than your typical fast food, but its made to order
 
Tips:
 * Try Peach flavor Sprite... Yum !
 * Don't forget Grandma's sauce.  It's a must!
 * They have specials all the time just look out for the sign on the counter.

Verdict:
  The idea is similar to Cane's, but all together has a different taste.  I can't decide which one I like better.  Chicken Now has Chicken tenders, Chicken Taco Salad, Wings, and even a Chicken/Mash potato bowl.  Everything I've tried here is really good.  I love their fries and the service is far better than your typical fast food place.  To me that's a 5 stars.  I don't really have any complaints.  It's a little pricey, but in comparison to Cane's, it's pretty much the same."}
{"text":"On our way back from Vegas we stopped by at the outlet to do some holiday shopping and needless to say got hungry. We found this place at the cafeteria and unfortunately didn't look at any reviews and just thought to wing it.

The wait for the food was rather long, and they missed some items from our order so I was glad to have kept my receipt since I had to show it to them to get the rest of my order. This was rather unsettling since half of our party already ate and the other half was still waiting.

Food wise, this place was mediocre at best if not worse; I didn't touch the mashed potato, it looked alien. The chicken sandwich was so so, I thought the pairing of pickles with the fried chicken tenders didn't really go. The bread was gummy and soggy.

We also got the chicken wraps which were better than the rest of the food we got. The lettuce was dipped in some sauce which made the sandwich slippery and too wet. I think it can be improved. 

I would avoid this place if possible. It's most likely going to be a negative experience and even worse, make you feel sick on the road. The prices weren't fair for the quality."}
{"text":"Always one of our favorite places to eat a quick meal in Vegas.  If course it helps being in a place where I shop all the time.  Love the crispy outside with the moist and tender inside and also love the sauce that comes with it!"}
{"text":"chicken was great! a little pricy for a combo with fries coleslaw and drink but you get really good food for the money. the chicken tasted fresh and was perfectly fried. it also tasted very healthy. it wasnt dripping in oil. will go back just for some strips next time im in vegas."}
{"text":"Chicken Now was a shocker... they are definitely quality chicken! Chick fil A and Popeyes does not even compare to how good Chicken Now is. Customer Service at this location was quick and professional. I definitely recommend this restaurant!

Had the Spicy Chicken sandwich and got 2 large pieces of chicken with jalapenos. It was really an amazing sandwich.. Not dry not oily and not too salty. Just great flavor. 

My Favorite item were the fries some people like fat fries some people like skinny fries BUT HERE has the in between... Most importantly the fries are crispy! Nothing worst then soggy fries.. 


Compared to other places on the strip I appreciate the  price of food at Chicken Now...was well worth the meal."}
{"text":"I ordered three burgers and 3 drinks. I did not want the combo. But she put down the combo anyways. Also, my spicy chicken sandwitch was a little disappointing. It was the same thing as the regualr sandwitch except it has jalapeños and hot sauce in it. I was expecting the chicken peice itself  to be spicy like chickfila. It was just a normal peice of chicken..."}
{"text":"This place know how to make some damn good food!! Good quality juicy chicken. Fries r nice and crispy."}
{"text":"It's a national chain with locations all over the US. This location is in the food court at the south premium outlets. It's nowhere near the same level as Raising Cane's. The breading on the chicken tenders was thick and the meat was dry and not tender. The Texas toast wasn't very good either. To top it off, a 4 piece tender box was just shy of $10, making it more expensive than Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"I got the 3 piece combo with 2 sides (Fries) = $8.29 

Pros:
* Fries tasted like half regular fries & half curly fries (it was really yummy)
* Serving size for the fries was really generous
* Spicy mama sauce was soo good! It wasn't too spicy, but it was good enough
 
Cons:
* I received my meal 10mins after ordering. Not sure if that's fast for fast food.. And they weren't busy!
* The chicken was decent. The bredding wasn't too thick, but it was way too thin

Overall, their food was good.. but average. However, it's a good chicken fix after shopping at the outlet."}
{"text":"Got the munchies while checking out the shopping mall. Counter attendant lured me in with a free sample. Seeing as I didn't feel like fast food Asian or Mexican, I decided to give it a shot. 
The fries are very crispy and the chicken very tasty and not greasy at all! I would probably go to this franchise ( if it is one ) at other locations if I see it. 
Food was served quite fast. I had my order in less than 5 minutes. 
The Coke fountain machine was empty on half the choices of drinks.
There was no individual order items. You had to get a combo. 
Prices on the high end for fast food given portion sizes."}
{"text":"Nice weather today and walk by the plaza saw this place ,I enjoyed my lunch time here. Good mood."}
{"text":"nice fast food place. very good wings. spicy. meaty. and tender. my friend had a burger and pronounced it as good as it gets. we both liked the fries. crisp and thick, so soft in the middle, something like steak fries.  i've eaten at another chicken now location at the outlet mall on the southside and this one is better. different ownership i think.  prices pretty reasonable, especially for on the Strip. located in the hawaiian marketplace with plenty of (shared) seating. two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very nice. Prices are a little high. And also a little slow but overall pretty good place"}
{"text":"The chicken was delicious! Very friendly staff but unfortunately the mashed potatoes taste like cardboard"}
{"text":"The people who work here are really nice, the new guy got my order wrong but it was fixed asap. My favorite thing to order here is the spicy chicken sandwich, but I'm sure everything is great.   Awesome will return for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I eat here almost every time I come to Meadows Mall and I love it. My food is never stale or bad, it they typically give me more than they are suppose to...even the first time I ate here they did. 

The only problem I can think of is some of the younger kids that work here. They don't pay attention and are a little rude....Kool-aid is super sweet sometimes too. Otherwise, I've never had problems and neither have all the friends I recommend this place to."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying they deserve no stars at all!!! 

Boyfriend and I waited a few minutes for anyone to even take our order. 

I ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla a la carte for $5.44 and an order of monster fries to share for $3.99. Boyfriend ordered the 5 piece buffalo tenders a la carte as well for $6.44. 

My quesadilla was a single soft taco sized tortilla folded in half. Could not even see the cheese from the side. Came with some lettuce and chopped tomatoes with about 6 stale tortilla chips and a blob of sour cream. Chicken was very blah.

Monster fries looked like French fries that had previously been fried then refried to our order. (working in the food industry I am very aware many places will blanch the fries but this was not the case) crunchy oil soaked fries topped in what I believe was chili, 3 jalapeño slices, about 5 pieces of diced tomato butts and some cheese. Oh almost forgot about the almost non existent bacon bits. 

My boyfriends chicken was drenched in the buffalo sauce and just wasn't very appetizing. He came home and was sick for an hour! 

This was the worst $20 I have ever spent on food!!! We will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"I found myself at Meadows mall shopping early for Christmas gifts. Shopping can sure work up an appetite! I personally love Great Steak because I love their Philly Cheese sandwiches! My husband doesn't so we had to compromise. We decided to go to Chicken Now to get basic chicken tenders. I found out  later it's cheaper just to get a meal. The sauce that they serve with the chicken tastes really similar to Canes except Chicken Now's sauce is a bit on the salty side. The menu is a little more extensive then Canes they have things like chili cheese fries if you like that kind of stuff. They also serve the Texas toast with their meals like Canes."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 71/100

3.7, let's put it at that 

Setting the math aside, why don't I give you two reasons to try chicken now. 1) The sauces 2) The sides. 

My parents took me to the outlet mall on Memorial Day to eye some good deals. For some reason, I wasn't too keen on rummaging through the much-ballyhooed sales that day and felt my legs giving in early. So I patiently waited for them at the food court. Mommy came finally came out of one of the shops and told me about how she and Papa liked Chicken Now for their plantains and chicken strips. Knowing me, I had no qualms about trying something new so we got the 4 piece chicken tenders with two sides - french fries and plantains. 

They were ready in just about 5 minutes and served with honey mustard sauce (it might've been the 'Grandma Sauce' everyone's been talking about, not entirely sure) and another spicier one (chipotle, perhaps?) They all complimented each other well and the plantains were cooked just right - no dripping oil, not bland either. Staff were friendly and cool too. Great pick and thanks to my parents."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been coming here forever. It's funny because people say they waited a long time.  I waited about 7 minutes, and when I got my chicken tenders, they were smoking hot with steam coming out of it. Other fast food joints are fast because they just have their food on warmers or warm it up. At chicken now they make the chicken fresh and it's perfectly cooked. 

Only downside is it is kind of pricey and you can only get the tenders in box meals and the meal doesn't even come with a drink. They should make it where you get a drink of it's that high of a price for 4 pieces of chicken. Or consider having tenders separately instead of a combo."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, it has been a VERY, long time since I have visited a chicken now. I remember when they first opened in Pasadena California. My husband now but boyfriend at the time made a long trip up there just to try it out. Now that I have tried raising canes, I wonder which place came first.

It is located in the food court area so it is definitely busy during meal times. The cashier chick did not seem to like her job much and did not have a smile with service. *one star docked.

I noticed the pricing has gone up since I last visited but had confidence in the quality of fried strips I would be receiving. I opted for the strip box with fries and toast. When I received it, my chicken strips did not come in a box and the toast was so bland and un-appetizing. I definitely regretted getting the toast as french fries probably would have been a safer choice.

The chicken quality was good. Breading was perfect in proportions and the dipping sauce was just as good as I last remember. Again, it reminds me a lot of raising canes but their toast tastes a lot better.

They have a coke freestyle machine for drinks and luckily the provide free water which did not taste like toilet water. See you again next time chicken now!"}
{"text":"First off. Probably a horrible location. Hard to find, unless you are out to find it. Thats bad for them, because Cain's would be in serious trouble. There Chicken strips are quite amazing, and make Cain's look and taste like a crappy sports bar. We are locals, always looking for interesting things.

My fiancé, our 3 year old, and myself have been talking about it since we left. The logo looks like a shop that would have been in clerks, or any mall movie from the 80's.

I had the Texas toast, chicken strip, sandwich. Great. The sauce rivals that of Chick-fil-a but they have a regular and spicy version called \"Grandmas\". I back it. THE FRIES WERE SEASONED, AND CRISP!!!! Better that normal fast food seasoned fries.

The 3 year old, picky, McDonalds lover, had the Original chicken sandwich...she almost ate it all. She loved the sauce as well, and made us all taste it on her fries.

The main lady had the original, ate most of it, while we cleaning up...she finished the rest.

Any advice, go. As a family of small children who are forced to have parents eat sub par chicken strips, this place rules. We will be back, we will refer friends."}
{"text":"Not a fan... Chicken seemed undercooked and the food was just bland. The sample was good on its own but over all this isn't good food,"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had...also chicken tenders are really good. Tender and moist."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good for being in the food court of the outlet mall. it reminded me of canes chicken fingers. They had Texas toast that was not as good as canes because canes puts garlic on the toast.Fingers were good,coleslaw was good, and there mashed potato bowls were great too.They had the coolest soda machine with as many drink options as sonic!!"}
{"text":"I could not believe this location was closed. They seemed to have really good food.
We were walking the mall and wanted something different.

We ordered a Chicken Bowl.
It was really pretty good!
It was fresh tasting and it was good. 
We both commented on how it was better than most food court food. There is just so much Chinese food and pizza you want to eat so it was nice having a place like this. We had never heard of before.
I did notice there was a couple of other locations. If I see this place again it is a place I would get something at again that's how good the bowl was."}
{"text":"Even though raising canes seems to have the hearts of most people in Vegas. I actually prefer chicken now over canes any day of the week. For one, the chicken is juicier here. I feel Canes' chicken is too dry, secondly. They have a sauce similar to canes, but then they also have a honey mustard type sauce that's the business. The fries are also more along my taste buds. These are thick cut and canes has crinkle cut shoestring, which are passable. The last factor that gives them the advantage is that they have menu options. At canes it's either sandwich or a chicken with bread and Cole slaw. At chicken now you have corn, mashed potatoes and they have different things you can do with the chicken, from wraps, sandwiches, salads, mashed potato bowls and my personal favorite loaded fries. Their monster fries alone are worth three stars. Loaded up fries with cheese, chicken jalapeños that's slap yo mama good. If nothing else, at least try the monster fries and then you'll understand why I'm feeling the love for this place"}
{"text":"Surprising fresh and flavorful food.  We ordered the Ceasar Chicken Wrap, Chicken Nachos and Chicken Strips.  Portions were generous and we enjoyed them very much.  Recommend this place highly.  Will return if in the area again."}
