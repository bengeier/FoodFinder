Cons: had to wait 10 minutes for window seating, staff can be little friendlier specially at reception."}
{"text":"My friend, husband and I had the worst customer service there. The food was okay like any other places; however, when we finished our meal and pressed the button some times for getting our bill, no one came to us. There were three servers chatted in front of cash machines, so all of us waved and called them. They saw us, but they just ignored. We went to them and asked our bill, then one of the server said \"You have to press the button, that's not my seat\". We told her that we pressed some times, then she just left inside a minute and came back without saying anything. My husband got mad and said \"Seriously?\" Then she looked at us so madly and said \"What?! I got a card and doing it now, your server is in the washroom!!!\" Honestly, we don't care about their system. If she said \"Sorry for waiting, your server is in the washroom\", then we understood what's going on. BUT she never said \"sorry/thank you.\" When I asked her \"You should say sorry\", she looked and said to me \"If you are yelling to me, I won't say sorry!!!\" Our voice was probably louder than normal but the same volume as hers. I felt so sorry for my friend who came from far away and had to leave at that day. She loves Toronto, but we felt shame it happened at our main airport. I will never ever come back there."}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service in the dining room.  The waitress I had (Lee) was very courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"The manager needs a full customer service class again.  He did not show interest in the new customers.   The table and chairs where I sat were greasy.  I asked the manager if I could change the chair he said \"sure yes,  do whatever you feel like.\"  I told him the chair has greasy on it.  I left it on the side for him to clean it,  but he pushed back to the table behind me.  I ordered quarter chicken, half baby back ribs.  My food was cold and hard.  We didn't even finish our food.  The waitress didn't even ask if there was something wrong with the food.  I used to work as waitress if my customers had lots of leftover but did not want to take home,  I would ask for feedbacks.  I guess they're used to this so they don't care.  The waitress cleaned my table,  she picked up my plate and saw a piece of bone.  I didn't even know I drop the bone under the napkin.  She said \"bone\" and looked at me.  I looked at her and she stared at me for awhile and said \"bone\" again.  She asked me to pick up the bone for her.  I used the napkin to pick up and put it on the plate for her because I thought she couldn't reach.  After that I realized she didn't want to clean that up.  I was so shocked.  I didn't drop the bone on purpose,  but your part of customer services is to clean the table.  You don't ask the customer to pick up garbage for you. During my 2 years of working as a waitress,  regardless how messy my customers were,  I cleaned up everything and this is how you earn good tips. I didn't give her a penny.  In conclusion,  it was my first time eating there and my last time."}
{"text":"BEWARE! STAFF STEALS GIFT CARDS!!! 
On my most recent visit to this specific location, the cashier took my order and excused herself to \"check the balance of my gift card in the back office\". Forgive me if I am mistaken but can't the machines up front do that for you? I realized this and was about to speak but she was gone before I knew it, my gift card in her hand. Upon her return, she attempted to swipe \"my\" card & what do you know,  there's a $0.00 balance when there should have been $50.00! I cancelled my order and spoke to the manager about it who tried to help but couldn't really do much. We exchanged numbers and she apologized and told us to call her.  I investigated with the \"new\" card and traced it's history.  Lo and behold, there were multiple transactions on the same day at this particular restaurant. I don't know about you guys but I sure don't buy Swiss chalet that much in one day.  Needless to say I will never come back.  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I actually visited this location when they first opened and man did it suck. 

I went with my parents on a weekday and we were not greeted for more than 5 minutes. We stood at the door waiting for someone to seat us but there was nobody there. The restaurant probably had 9 tables at most. The supervisor on duty was sitting around just hanging out on the seats with people and on his cellphone. He eventually saw us and sat us down at a table. The interaction between him and us was good but nothing out of the standard. 

We ordered our food and when it got to our table it looked really bland. My half rack of ribs were actually 2 pieces of 1/3 pieced together. Wtf? I didn't end up finishing my food because it honestly tasted disgusting.

Probably one of the worst experienced I've had with Swiss Chalet as a whole and I will never consider going back to this location even though it's the closest to my house."}
{"text":"I have ordered the quarter chicken dinner with Caesar salad, the chicken is cooked perfect, but the portion of the Caesar salad was so little and tasteless even though there was dressing, but taste like water.  The waiter didn't ask if everything was ok, I guessed he was way too busy, I can tell this restaurant is way under staff"}
{"text":"This used to be Outback Steakhouse, which should have stayed because Swiss Chalet didn't bring anything new. I like eating chickens because they are healthy and good for diet and all but Swiss Chalet isn't the ideal place to eat them as they are either hit or miss. Foods are average at best but they are cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online.  They called me after the store was closed, to tel me the were OUT OF CHICKEN!!!   Didn't offer me anything, told me too bad. Cara customer support (fuck!ng usless)
 could only offer me the phone number of the closed store, to find some sort of restitution myself.  Great Job !!"}
{"text":"Business travel is hard enough, and finding healthy options at the airport are almost impossible. Decided to get Swiss Chalet, but very disappointed with the service. These people are definitely not happy with their job. The women behind the counter had attitude and were too busy gossiping about their personal lives.  I tried to be polite and courteous but not even a smile. Will never be going back to a Swiss Chalet period!"}
{"text":"Our family has been coming to this location for the past 2 years. We always have an amazing experience at this location. Great food, great staff who are always attentive. Highly recommend for the right price. There is a Harvey's also at the same location.. We go there when we are in a hurry for a great tasting burger."}
{"text":"Came here after work on a weekday night. Swiss chalet is doing a $12.99 special that includes a quarter chicken + side plus an appetizer / dessert of your choice. It's a pretty good deal considering the amount of food you get for $12.99. 


So we ordered the quarter chicken ( white meat ) + 4 cheese dip + ice cream in the end. The chicken tastes okay, pretty standard. However, the fries were fried in really old oil. As a result, they had a very odd taste to them. The 4 cheese dip was okay, on the oily side. 

However, the most disappointing part of our meal was the service. Our main waiter was incredibly rude. Will not be returning for mediocre food + poor service."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the familiarity and great consistency of Swiss Chalet - and having it everywhere in Canada is convenient and comfort food goodness.  There is no exception to that thought here at the Toronto Pearson airport where the restaurant is located on the departures level of terminal 1.

 The Modern urban decor overlooking the newly renovated terminal facilities has a nice atmosphere; the back is actually nicer, yes go all the way to the back where you will see a hidden urban bar with 4 large tv screens to watch the hockey game and it is usually quieter.

Now for the food, they always have the best \"golden orange brown\" rotisserie chicken with a side of vegetables and their signature centennial chicken noodle soup which tastes the same from Halifax to Vancouver and from when I was a little kid to now.  Certainly, they have tons of variety on their menu but this is what I have been ordering since I ate their the first time when I was in middle school hehe

Amongst all the junk and grease of the airport eateries, this is a necessary healthy and comfort nostalgia stop when in the Toronto Airport; ah - a taste of home."}
{"text":"I meet a friend for lunch at Swiss Chalet every few weeks, and the last dozen times or so, this is the location we've chosen. I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here.  There is nothing revolutionary on Swiss Chalet's menu, but there's lots to choose from, and as far as I'm concerned you can never go wrong with a quarter chicken dinner. My chicken was nicely cooked, and I've always loved the fries here, and today was no exception. 
I also enjoy that they have deals if you have a CAA membership. Even though they've gotten rid of their two quarter chicken dinners for $15.99 deal, they now offer a free appetizer or dessert if you buy two entrees. So we got the chicken spring rolls. They were nice and hot and tasty, especially if you ask for the sweet chilli Thai sauce instead of the plum. 
As far as this particular location goes, I feel the staff are quick and efficient, and it never seems to be very busy at lunch, so it's always easy to get a booth, and take your time with your meal without chaos going on around you. A big plus for me!"}
{"text":"such good service the people are really nice and its such a nice place to eat for celabrations"}
{"text":"Worse ribs ever! 

It safe to get the double leg chicken. But I felt adventurous this time and tried the ribs. NONONO! 

Also the way the door is set up it gets pretty cold in here. I don't like this location. Something about it makes it feel very old. Maybe the lighting?

{"text":"Pleasantly surprised especially for an airport restaurant.
They have a nice area for sitting down with table service.  The service was pleasant and very efficient; however, forgot to ask if I wanted a whole wheat roll and I forgot to mention it.
The chicken was very tasty and a good size portion of fries.  The sauce always seems to disappear too fast :-)  Can't figure that one out.
The chickens though seem to be getting smaller and smaller and you no longer get a side of coleslaw."}
{"text":"Came on sunday for lunch. It wasn't that busy, but it's also -20 outside so maybe no one wants to come for swiss chalet, especially since it's located separate from the mall.

Service was good.

We used coupons for quarter chicken dinners with apps and dessert.
Ordered the chicken spring rolls for the app. It was pretty nice: while it wasn't crispy, the chicken had good flavor.

Quarter chicken seems a bit small, but then again nowadays all the chickens seem kind of small anyways. I got fries on the side, and they offered a generous amount of fries, so maybe that's meant to make up for the chicken.

For dessert, I got a lemon pie. It tasted alright.

I don't usually dine-in at swiss chalet but it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Visited Fri May 19 for dinner. 
A restaurant shouldn't be empty on a Fri night, and this one was empty. 

Pros
Swiss Chalet just started a brand new FRIED chicken dinner, I ordered the half-chicken it comes with 4 pieces (2 white and 2 dark), coleslaw and 2 sides! It tasted even better than KFC in my opinion.
Ample parking
New side jalepeno mashed potato, was ok. 

Cons
The 1/4 rotisserie chicken dinner did not look impressive compared to the 1/2 chicken, it comes with 1 piece of meat. Loaded baked potato didn't have enough toppings, it looked like it was kept warm for the past few hours. 
Server didn't ask us if we wanted a white or wheat roll, we were stuck with a white roll. 
Butter and sour cream come pre-packed, pre-packed items indicate manufactured to me. 
We asked for our leftovers to go, so we saved the sauces and put it onto the plate. The server dumped all the sauces, so we ended up offering a new gravy and new swiss chalet sauce. 

Protip - Try the fried chicken before it's removed from the menu on June 11. 

Damage - $32 after tax before tip."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such poor ratings. Sure it's not an fancy location but the service is good, the wait for food was short and the food was really good. Sure the restaurant looks a little aged..  could use a renovation. 

Still a good place to eat and I'll be back for sure! Happy with the price we paid."}
{"text":"After several deliveries from here, I have finally visited inside this Swiss Chalet location after sooo long. We arrived about 6PM and it was so packed, quite a number of people were waiting for seats. But everyone was seated quickly, and this was within 10 minutes when we arrived.

We got a booth and was greeted fast by our waitress. Wasn't expecting to be that fast paced within Swiss Chalet, but then again... we came during peak hours.

We ordered quite a bit, to say the least. M ordered the Honey Garlic combo on the cover of the menu, D ordered the double leg dinner, half chicken dinner for me and also ordered an appetizer and 20 wings to share within all of us but was more dedicated towards J & B.

While repeating all the orders to the waitress, I was interrupted by another server who wanted to collected the menus - but I was clearly ordering and pointing to items on the menu so I was confused/slightly annoyed when he tried to take the menu from me. I was too busy ordering to notice him before until he tried to take mine. My waitress politely told him I was ordering and then he waited.

After ordering and giving in my menu, not sure if the waitress was going to repeat the orders back to me so I asked her to repeat it as soon as I was done ordering because she put her order pad away. For the record, it was loud + guy interrupted my ordering session + we did order a lot and I just wanted to be sure she got it all down.


Cream of Chicken soup from the combination came first. It was a creamy chicken type of soup. It wasn't too bad, pretty good. The soup also came with crackers.

Next was a stuffed garlic cheese loaf. It was alright, but wasn't worth it imo. For some reason, I thought they had stuffed it with some vegetables or meat, instead of just cheese.

M's order of Honey Garlic combo - Surprisingly, the chicken was smaller than we thought. So was the coleslaw. The gravy for the mashed potatoes was really strong and sweet. I barely sampled the gravy off my fork and could already taste the sweetness.

Also while ordering, I didn't managed to find an option of available sides to switch to, instead of fries. But because of having experience ordering Swiss Chalet online, I was able to notify the others of available sides/breads.

Wings of 20 came, and we ordered with Honey Garlic sauce. We didn't count how much there were, LOL... But it was a lot and filled us up. I ate like 2-3 pieces and it was yummy! Came with like 2 pieces of carrot and celery each, which I thought was a pretty cheap move.

This was D's double leg dinner, as it is, with fries and a bread roll. & My half leg dinner, but apparently the half leg dinner consisted of 1 dark meat and 1 white meat, which I was okay with. I prefer dark meat over white meat though.. Also, why is white meat more expensive than dark meat?

My half leg dinner is more than enough for me... was way too big of a portion for a person like me. And my coleslaw was given a lot too! They gave me a regular roll instead of garlic bread so I mentioned that to them. They gave me a garlic bread on another plate but it barely look like it had any garlic or olive oil/butter on it...

Either way, I had a great time at Swiss Chalet with the company I was with. As a family casual restaurant, their service is really fast and quick. We were basically in and out within a hour. We also managed to see a birthday celebration going on, where all the workers had to sing the birthday song and stuff. Some other places like Boston Pizza does that too.

If you want something fast and casual for the family, swiss chalet is probably your best bet. This location is also pretty busy, and there is one by Victoria Park and Sheppard too - which I'm assuming will be less busy."}
{"text":"I have been to several Swiss Chalet's and have to say this one is the worst.
The staff is slow and disinterested, and the food is tiny and does not taste good.
It was the only time I have ever left uneaten food on my plate (and the server said nothing).
This is a chain, restaurants are supposed to be the same, but the servings where rally small, and whoever runs the kitchen has no idea how to prepare chicken the Swiss Chalet way.
I wont be back."}
{"text":"Just had a horrible lunch at this location. The service was the worst I've had in a while. The server was not informative and did not smile at all. He was lucky I barley even gave him a tip. Food was standard. Server definitely had attitude, will not be back any time soon"}
{"text":"Came here for the kids eat free deal (free kids meal on Wed with a purchase of an adult entree). Started out strong but the service slowly fizzled. Or should I say the service just disappeared. For a period of time, there was not a single employee visible in the dining room and all the tables were clearly waiting for food, service or the bill. How long can it possibly take to bring out 4 sundaes? Apparently a very very long time. I'm undecided if the deal is worth the time wasted. Oh, and the sundaes turned out to be 4 bowls of ice cream."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm in the delivery area of this Swiss Chalet. It seems the kitchen staff doesn't understand the difference between white meat and dark meat; of the dozen or so orders I've made requesting dark meat, without fail every time they've given me light meat. This makes for an incredibly dry, sawdusty wrap. 

Repeatedly these guys forget basic things, like that poutine is made from fries, gravy and cheese curd - and not just fries (yes, they send me a bag of fries and called it poutine.) 

Some of the delivery people also seem to get confused by buzzcode numbers. My buzzcode is the same as my apartment number, which I write into the buzzcode field on their order form. Some of the delivery people have simply not bothered to deliver because they couldn't figure out to buzz my apartment number. 

So why do I order from them if they're so bad? Well, when you live at Don Mills and Sheppard, your delivery options are limited to either this dreadful place, or the low end Spring Rolls in the mall. Fortunately I'm moving and will never order from these guys again. Hooray!"}
{"text":"They don't have a host/hostess here, and no one attends to the front door. Be prepared to stand there waiting for a good 5-10 minutes before anyone comes to greet you.

The table we were sat at, had crumbs all over it. She just say us down and left without saying anything.

She came back pretty quickly to ask us for or our drink order, I got an Orange Crush, and my friend ordered an Iced Tea. The drinks came really quickly. Both our drinks tasted very watered down. Our server was quick with our refills too, and had brought us fresh drinks before we finished our round.

I ordered a double leg dinner with corn as my side, and my friend ordered the 1/3 rack with wings and fries as his side. 10 minutes into ordering, she comes back and tells me they don't have 2 pieces of dark meat, and asked if I wanted to switch one to a chicken breast. I really don't like chicken breast, so I told her no. Then she says, well you're going to have to wait 45 minutes for your meal then. So she pretty much forced me to choose the chicken breast, not cool. When our food finally arrives, my meal came with fries, so did my friends. I immediately told her, I ordered corn. She just apologized and told me she'll go and bring the corn. It took another 10 minutes before the corn arrived. I mean how long does it take to heat up frozen or canned corn? My friend didn't like his wings, said they barely had any sauce on them. And this is the first time ever dining at Swiss Chalet and not getting a finger bowl. Not like the finger bowl makes much of a difference, but that is really what sets Swiss Chalet apart from other restaurants, and they even denied me that one bit of nostalgia. 

Our server seemed to be having a very bad day, she even dropped cutlery on the floor when bussing another tables empty plates. Our dining experience was completely horrible, but I'm sure she was having a worse day. We will go back and let her redeem herself, and hopefully update this review to a better rating."}
{"text":"I always like coming to this place because it's close to home and it's not as packed. 
However the only thing packed is the parking lot since it's in a plaza filled with other restaurants,  grocery store, etc.
Coming here on a Sunday Afternoon after taking an early trip up to Midland, Swiss Chalet was the perfect choice on a Sunday. 
This location is conveniently close to home, and there's plenty of seating.  For drinks I had their Austriailian Merlot, and my Gramps had their pint of beer.
For apps, we shared their spinach cheese dip, which was pretty good, about a 3.5/5, but nothing compares to Marlowes, or Baton Rouge's spinach dip..
For the mains, I ordered their two piece chicken thigh dinner with fries.  One thing about Swiss Chalet, their fries are always delish and not over salted nor oily like many fast food chains out there. This dish was an overall 4/5
Portions were sufficient, and presentation was to my standards...but nothing to be head-over-heels about. Great place, and always a neighborhood fav!"}
{"text":"I always get excellent service from both Andrea and Anna at this location. They are always welcoming, cheerful, and always on top of our orders. 
They are both a joy to deal with, and share stories with. 
I've been going to this location since it opened, and find it to be the best. 
Will most definitely be back at this location on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Not a big Swiss Chalet fan and haven't been here in a while since there are much better places to hit up than Swiss Chalet. When you go here, you know exactly what you're getting into so you're not surprised by something different. The food is consistent. I think I went about 10 years between eating at Swiss Chalet and it still tastes the same which isn't a bad thing because the food was still good."}
{"text":"The only reason why I dread this pressure out really low as for the skimpy portions of chicken that they give you. I went for dinner couple days ago and got the two can dine quarter chicken dinner with side salad and coleslaw. Service was kind of on the bad side servers came and took their order and forgot to ask about type of roll that I wanted.

Flavors were definitely Swiss Chalet but portions were small and could not feed a grown adult. This location definitely does not have any customers on a normal basis.

In the end when the server cleared our tables and asked if there was anything else we needed she did not bother to even give us a bill I made us sit for 10 minutes and the restaurant were no service could be found at all.

I can rather go to Costco and buy a whole chicken and it will be better and tastier. Would definitely not eat Swiss Chalet at all! The last time I did come to this location was when it was opened couple years ago and definitely didn't know changes and actually service and food got worse."}
{"text":"Average food, average experience. I used to work at a Swiss Chalet 12 years ago, and I don't recall the food being this average. The chicken also seemed to be a lot smaller than before, and the rice was hard. Food wasn't warm either. I won't be back in a long time...."}
{"text":"My chicken leg was overcooked and completely unseasoned. The only seasoning offered (besides the salt on the table) was a flower pot of gelatinous slime which the server brought, and then told me it had flour in it after I told him I was gluten intolerant. The vegetables were cooked properly, but also completely unseasoned. My husband ordered the chicken Caesar salad which he couldn't finish because the chicken was so dry and the dressing was mostly mayonnaise, and there was too much of it. He ordered ice tea and nearly spat it out when he took the first sip because it sweetened to the point of gagging, and no unsweetened was available. We had to ask for our check 3 times from the dim server who kept asking if everything was okay despite our very clear displeasure. Give it up and leave us alone."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet was pretty decent given that it's airport food. Contrary to most of the reviews, we actually experienced pretty good service. 

We landed around 11 PM and there wasn't much open - but luckily there was a nice lady still working here. 

They have sandwiches, salads, BBQ ribs/chicken and rotisserie chicken - Quarter Dark, Quarter White, Double Leg, Half Chicken. For a late dinner, it wasn't as bad as we expected. You can get the fries replaced by rice or veggies."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Swiss Chalet. Efficient service. Went on a late afternoon and was satisfied. My usual is the half chicken and 1/3 ribs combo."}
{"text":"I've never been to this location before, so on my home from visiting Edwards Gardens...we decided to give it a go (we were heading to the Don Valley).
Went in on Labour Day at around 3 and the place was very quiet.
We were seated immediately (by a cook) and then our waiter was by shortly thereafter..took our drink order and off he went. When he came back, we ordered two of their summer specials....quarter chicken, fries, quarter of a corn on the cob, coleslaw, bun and dessert...all for $12.99/person.
Food came out fairly quickly (under 10 minutes). Disappointed in the corn on the cob...it was way overcooked and flavourless. Too bad. Rest of the meal was good. 
Since the offer came with dessert...you get the option of a sundae or pie. Person I was with had the sundae (said the ice cream was \"old) and I had the pecan pie (which was ok...not great).
It's what I expected from a Swiss Chalet so there were no surprises.
Male server was very good."}
{"text":"Stay away! If you want sub-par food, Scarborough Town Centre is the place to dine. I have yet to order food at this location that is exemplary of Swiss Chalet Standards. Their chicken is usual lukewarm-dry, sinewy and tough. They 'refry' the french fries thinking customers can't tell the difference. The sauce is never hot and their roles are usually cold. Can we say unsatisfactory! The manager, Dawn, is a boorish, impertinent piece of work; bereft of grace and void of interpersonal skills - has NO business working in the service industry. The woman had the audacity to imply that I was after a free meal because I had complained twice within 1 1/2 years about the unpalatable food I was served. Sad truth is, I could have complianed every-time save once, but just sucked it up. What this Swiss Chalet franchise doesn't comprehend is their system is in need of an overhaul and that when customers complain, they are giving you a 'second change' to make it right. Most customers don't complain, they just never come back. I for one will NEVER go back. You've been warned..."}
{"text":"I hate eating at the airport.  You don't get what you pay for.  Instead, what you get is a bunch of attitude from people that seem so unhappy to do their job.  

I was in terminal 1 to see someone off and it happened to be early so we decided to have breakfast there.  What an experience.  Let me tell you, that is not the way you want to start your day.  

3 of us ordered 2 omelettes and a BLT and it took the kitchen 20 minutes (with no one else in line to cook for) to produce the food.  When it came, we asked for some jam and the lady behind the counter gave us 1 package.  ONE!  Not one package per person but one total for three of us.  When we asked for more, she grudgingly produced 2 extra.  Seriously?  

The worst part was the food.  The omelettes were bland and under-cooked, the home fries were, well, just french fries and my BLT was definitely put together by someone who's clearly never eaten a BLT in their lives.  There was one leaf of lettuce for the whole sandwich?  Enough said.  

All this for $50+ is ridiculous.  Even for the airport.  Swiss Chalet, shame on you."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for over a year now and it's always great.  As per usual I always get the half chicken meal and my fiancée the quarter chicken.  The chicken comes out great every time and ridiculously fast! Our server that evening was particularly great.  Came with refills for our bevvies without us having to ask and was overall pleasant and friendly.  My only issue was the french fries.  I'm not sure if they had recently changed the oil but they were pale in comparison to what we are usually served; deep-brown and golden delicious.   Other than that, for the price-point, this place is hard to beat. Seriously cheap and delicious eats!"}
{"text":"Okay so I would of never of guesses I would be complaining about a Swiss chalet but I am . Not about the food as it is I think a regular family dining place. Since I was my son's age three I remember my parents taking me to Swiss chalet.
But it was a lunch time I just picked my sister up form her office where she is a manager . I myself am on  leave from work taking care of  my son .
Well since this is close to her office and we were limited in time we came here. It happened that the debit machine went down . Their were a few people  who were planning to pay on debit . I did not even realize it had gone down because we had the longest wait for the bill till my sister asked me to go up and ask so she can finally get to work and not be late .
Well I was paying for lunch that day since I asked her out ,and she also just had her debit on her . Sorry majority of people I know now choose to carry debit above anything else. The Asian lady said the manager had her day of and she was acting manager . I advised her I only had my debit card. It was the way she acting ...a loud voice telling everyone in the store that I don't have money ,she screeched out does not the bank want to give you one !
LOL what a ^*&^(&! I myself do management support ,for a large corporate company and I am sorry but I consider this far from appropriate . I am also a landlord ! ANd yes I have money and probably unlike her the reason I have money is I choose to keep my credit cards at home(unlike some people who seem to live off of them )as I just keep them  as an emergency .Which I also have a large credit limit that I have never used form my bank to have some waitress acting as a manager for a day tell me that I am poor and have chosen to eaten at her establishment ,with intentions not to pay .Lady if you get me a working debit you would be paid now ...why do you think I came up here to pay when no one was handing me a bill ??!t I did state I would go to the bank and get her the money but she made it I was going to scam her !
Well at that point after degrading me , for the fact the Swiss chalet banking system went down . I left a message for the manager to call me back the next day when she was at work .
Seems like it is a regular practice to have someone not qualified to manage when she is away . She did apologize for her employee obnoxious behaviors and I did advise her great all I needed was that apology ...and I wanted to make sure that employee gets thought some appropriate procedures and manners before she continues as acting as a manger. 
She told me to not to worry about the bill , which I would of been more then happy to pay because I wanted to see the rude obnoxious witress and bring my credit cards to shove in her face , if she thinks that is what makes you rich...my belief is if you have to depend on credit cards your far from rich .
Anyways the manager apologized and said she hopes we would still come and have lunch their . Hmmm forget it ....because my sister thought also does not believe in giving this place another chance.We now have been going to canyon creek regularly , when I take her out for lunch ."}
{"text":"I want to give this location a 3.5 stars.

Place is clean, staff is friendly, the young manager walks around and asks if everything is ok with customers meals (which is nice). Food is good, portions are good.  Kid friendly.
Very accommodating, we had a group of 15+ and they moved tables around so we can all sit together.

The only thing is... sometimes the staff disappears for awhile.  Not sure, if its break time or if they are understaff and they are in the back catching up on other duties.  This has happened to my about 3 times here.  I have to wait and flag someone else down to get the bill.
Hence the 3.5stars.

Other than that, nice location, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch today at Swiss Chalet.

I ordered what I have been ordering lately at Swiss Chalet ... a half chicken dinner with corn.  It's Weight Watcher friendly (just seven points!).  It was good.  The corn was previously frozen but hot.  The chicken was hot and tender.  The roll was warm and the sauce was thick and had a nice bite.

 Amy was my server.  She was pleasant and took good care of me."}

I ordered what I have been ordering lately at Swiss Chalet ... a half chicken dinner with corn.  It's Weight Watcher friendly (just seven points!).  It was okay.  The corn was previously frozen and kind of cold.  The chicken was overcooked, seemed to be sitting around for a while and the wing was burnt and inedible.  The roll was warm and the sauce had a nice bite ... they were the best part of the meal.

Ivy was my server and she was efficient."}
{"text":"The woman who ordered food for me is just stupid. It's an airport restaurant so she should be quick to order food but she just walk around instead of ordering food for me. After like 5 minutes she started to do my order. And no asking about the how I want the eggs done. Never come again. Make me soooo angry."}
{"text":"been here a few times, I love the swiss chalet chicken pot pie as well as... pretty much all their chicken. They don't really go out of their way to make you feel at home. Pehaps it was just my group and the timing of the staff. We were in a bit of a rush for a movie and they took forever. They came to ask if we needed anything when we didn't but when we did, they were nowhere to be found. I'll chalk this up to bad luck and try again another time."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Swiss Chalet since I moved to the US in 2007.  

And like all things Canadian, I miss it.

Yet for some reason, every time I visit Canada on business, there never seems to be a good time or opportunity to eat it. Try taking a client to Swiss Chalet.....its not exactly what they consider adequate hospitality.

So when I went to Toronto last week and had a night free and dinner with a pal of mine - I saw one across from my hotel. Like some crackhead who was jonesing for a fix - I literally ran there from my hotel, arriving no more than 15 minutes before closing, begging a poor old asian lady to let us in.

I wasn't let down and my memory served me right. The sauce and chicken, piping hot, moist and just as they do it. Soft, warm buns for chip in chicken sandwich to dunk in the sauce.....all washed down with a coke.

I missed this little Swiss piece of Canada."}
{"text":"Service: Fast and friendly. If you tell them your chicken is too dry they will happily bring out a new fresh one for you.

Food: 8 out of 10 times it's pretty fresh and the chicken isn't too dry.

Ambience: Typical, but more quiet compared to other locations.

Cleanliness: This location is fairly new and very clean.

 

Their sweet potato fries + whatever dipping sauce it is they give is amazing. Every time we come we always upgrade our side to sweet potato fries. Their quarter chicken and chalet sauce is pretty typical, nothing different from other Swiss Chalet locations. 

Overall, it was a good meal with a good price."}
{"text":"Food was overcooked, and service was poor.  
Server did not bring out correct order.   
Spinach dip had a cm layer of oil on top.

Better Swiss chalet's elsewhere"}
{"text":"POUTINE is not good enough, fries are too soft and they add too many water in gravy , bad service.
The cashier even wants me to purchase one more fries (which I only need poutine) without notice, if I didn't double check and ask she will add one more fries for me.

Before she ( I think she is called \"Juliet\" ) serves me, she just keep chatting with another guy (not customer) and ignoring me. So I have to wait there until they finish chatting."}
{"text":"Tonight I went out for dinner with mum and dad. Now i've been in Australia for 2 years prior to arriving back and I was shocked at the service we received. I just remember this place being filled with better staff. As soon as we sat down we decided on what we were going to get. We started with the spinach dip and I decided to get the festive special. It is the quarter chicken dinner with stuffing and cranberry sauce. My parents both ordered a double leg.. While the guy was taking out order he tried to push the white meat on both me and my parents.. I don't mind so I agreed. After my parents completed their order he went away and brought us the drinks. Shortly after he brought us the appetiser he then told my parents they couldn't get the double leg because there wasn't enough as all and let me quote \"asian people ordered it\" I was appalled at his statement. My dad agreed to accept the half chicken and I firmly stated that mum doesn't not eat white meat so she would like to have what she ordered which was the double leg dinner. When My meal came out it was just the quarter chicken dinner with no festive extras.. before I could let him know he took off and I had to try and get his attention. He then brought it out on a separate plate. The fries were over cooked and so was the chicken. It didn't seem fresh at all. 

I felt the server we received tonight had no customer service at all. This was a place I remember going to when I lived here and today it was not the same. 

Also I don't know if the food chain stopped giving the washing dishes at the end of the meal but we also didn't receive that either.

All in all.. extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"I came here on what I think was a Wednesday evening. It wasn't too busy. My friend and I still had to wait for seating even though I could literally see at least four free tables. After we were seated and about to order, we were told they had run out of dark meat and offered white meat with no extra cost instead. While for most people this would have been nice, I said that I would wait for the dark meat (I just find white meat really dry). 

The only semi enjoyable thing on the plate was the chicken. The fries seemed like they had been sitting there for a while + were very overdone. Felt more like chips than fries - that's how crunchy they were. I wasn't a big fan of their gravy either, so I gave it to my friend. 

My waitress was okay. She didn't really go out of her way to make us feel comfortable, but she reminded me of my manager at work, so I gave her a bigger tip than what I would've normally given. 

I don't really want to come back, but I might if my friend wants to."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Food is terrible, service is worse, management is a joke. Considering that they want more and more money for their product, at least they could do is give you value for your money, which they fail miserably to do."}
{"text":"Going to Swiss Chalet brings back childhood memories. The red toolbox with a selection of toys for the choosing after the meal was the biggest reason for going. Now, it's only when someone suggests going. Went for someone's birthday and the all you can eat fries deal was on. The server was nice but seemed a little forgetful.

The appetizer spring rolls tasted like cheap food court spring roll with bottled sauce. The prices of all the appetizers were decent, under $10. Definitely avoid the spring rolls, not worth it. Got a full rack of ribs and it was kind of dry but the BBQ sauce was good. The first plate of fries seemed like it was old and fried again, tasted like oil. Asked for a second plate after and that took a while to come but it was fresh this time. The Swiss Chalet special sauce tasted the same as years ago but not a fan, never was, not exactly gravy so it tastes weird.

Overall, visit once every few years when someone suggests it."}
{"text":"Speedy service with my exact order that tastes the same all the time hot & ready! It's that easy for a fair price! I do appreciate when they have their feature to get two side instead of one! Never an issue!"}
