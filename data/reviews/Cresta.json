{"text":"What a great meal!  
We started with the Crispy balsamic Brussels sprouts and the shiitake mushroom salad. Both were seasoned to perfection. The shiitake mushroom salad with root veg and maple thyme vinaigrette might be the best salad I've ever had. 
My husband had the lamb sirloin with spatetzle sauted watercress and pistachio salsa. The lamb was so tender, cooked to perfection and the sides were well thought out to enhance the overall experience. 
I had the sirloin with potato rounds cherry ptomatoes and rsted garlic. The sirloin was sous vide.....soooo good!
The service was relaxed and attentive. 
Best meal we had in recent memory

{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our first year wedding anniversary at Cresta and it was amazing! The food and service were top notch and we had an unforgettable night. We came for dinner and splurged by ordering the caesar salad, salmon tartare, pork belly pasta, prosciutto pizza, and rapini (we had plenty of leftovers). The pork belly pasta and pizza really stand out, but everything was awesome. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant twice. The first time was a trial test as one of the organizers of a social banquet for my workplace, and the second time was the actual social banquet itself. Everything was excellent in terms of food and service was both attentive and accommodating.

Our banquet went off without a hitch. Dmitri, the manager, is a delight to work with; as were all the event planning staff and wait staff (especially Jaret)! Our group of 60 was originally to be seated in the upstairs event space, but they moved us downstairs onto the main floor because they wanted to give us more mingling room for our event, which was incredibly thoughtful. 

For food, the first time, our table shared the beet risotto, skate with torchietti, and rabbit pasta. The beet risotto is a perfect extra side dish for the table; simple in composition, but bold in both flavour and presentation. The skate was cooked to perfection, which is no simple feat. The rabbit pasta was extremely flavourful with great balance between gameness of the rabbit and the sweetness of its accompanying ingredients.

The second time, we ordered from a prix fixe menu. I started with the warm mushroom salad: the truffle vinaigrette pairs exquisitely with the grilled shiitake. My main was the steak with roasted vegetables, beautifully plated and tenderly cooked. For dessert, I opted for the strawberry crumble. From listening to my colleagues, everything else on the prix fixe menu was equally, if not even more, scrumptious. I heard a lot of praise about the saffron poached sea bass and sticky toffee pudding especially.

I was also very impressed with the bar. The bar staff were knowledgeable in pairing our food with wine. The cocktail and beer variety is also noteworthy.

P.S.: Their patio is also awesome, with hanging Edison bulbs and beautiful flowers in their planters!

Overall, I highly recommend Cresta for you to try! They are also your ideal location for your next group event, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had a nice Sunday Brunch.  We tried the frittata and uovo pizza.  It was fresh and delicious.   Anyone craving a big brunch  without the grease this is a great place.  I also had a nice tea and they had a special brown sugar or maple tasting sweetener."}
{"text":"Wow! My wife says '6 stars' if she could. Her mushroom/green salad was one of the best tasting salads she has ever had. My Margerita pizza was among the best I've ever had. The crust! The tomatoes! The cheese! And my wife's cucumber spaghetti was likewise 'to die for'. Our waiter was so down to earth and also very knowledgeable about ingredients and flavors. Thank you for a fabulous meal, Cresta!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing!! The staff is so friendly, the food is just perfect. I went for the first time with a friend & we were both very impressed with everything to be honest. I would honestly recommend this place to anyone! We were surprised too that they offer you a muffin to take home as you exit the restaurant. Lol"}
{"text":"Really good food, lots of options and the servers are pretty friendly. The prices are a little high since they reopened and rebranded, but it's a food spot if you're looking for higher scale pizza."}
{"text":"The Balsamic Brussels Sprouts are the best EVER!!
Great selection of wines, staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Guys, you can't beat this place. One of the $12.00 brunch options includes two eggs, two pieces of multigrain toast, two fruit compotes, housemade ketchup, maple bacon, and a pile of roasted potato slices. Move over, Fran's!

Terrific service, perfect downtown ambiance, a coat check, and a location across from the St. Lawrence Market? Yes people, you really can have it all.

Tip: Go on a Sunday if you want to catch the St. Lawrence flea market that's just across the street!"}
{"text":"Cresta used to be called Pastizza. Ordered the 'carne' and 'funghi' pizzas. Both were great with the funghi pizza taking the crown.  The funghi pizza had a good balance between the mushrooms, cheese, truffle oil and raw arugula. It was not very salty and was perfect for the palette. It complemented the carne pizza which was a little on the salty side. The only reason for this is because the carne pizza came with such a large portion of cured meats resulting in a higher amount of salt. It's a direct relationship between the saltiness and the amount of meat on the pizza. Overall, it was a great restaurant with very nice decor and good service."}
{"text":"These best date night spot I've been in a while. 

My boyfriend and I decided to have a dress up night mid week, and Cresta seemed like the perfect option. I read that it was pricey, but not at all unexpected for a high end restaurant. We weren't disappointed. Romantic atmosphere and an intimate feel for two, but the space could equally fit a party.

Menu was so tempting we decided to do a full spread. Seafood pizza, brussel sprouts , the charcuterie plate, and the risotto. Everyone was perfect. Beautifully cooked, rustic but elegant, and the portions were quite generous. Perfect for sharing. 

Too hard to pick a highlight. We also finished the night with a sticky toffee pudding that we thought would be shared, but it was too good not to devour.

The other thing that made the night was the service. We had one incredible server who took care of us throughout  the night, with serval others ghosting in and out with plates during service. Their staff seem incredibly well educated and thorough when it comes to their menu and wine. Also, the wine! Was provided with a tasting palate and the Merlot blew me away. 

The staff also sent us home with complimentary salted caramel muffins at the door! Nothing but compliments to the chefs and staff."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here a few Fridays ago! Walked in at prime dinner time without reservations but were happily accommodated. We sat at a small table behind the bar and were served by the bartender who seemed to have a lot going on but still provided great service! While things were a bit slow, we were celebrating so we did not mind sitting, drinking and chatting until our food came out and was it ever worth the wait! 

To start, we shared an order of the fried calamari which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Not the type covered in a ton of generic batter that over powers but just enough batter to give it a nice texture and really delicious flavour. For entrées, I had the funghi pizza because anytime there's a mushroom pizza with truffle oil on a menu I HAVE to try it. This one was seriously, phenomenal. Unlike other funghi pizzas I've had in the city this one was unique because it was topped with a good helping of arugula which added a nice bitter green taste to the earthy mushrooms. So so good! My boyfriend had the sea bass which he was also super impressed with. 

To top it all off, on the way out the hostess gave us each a full sized muffin (baked on site? I think she said!) which we were able to enjoy the next morning for breakfast. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice, quality sit down meal. Will definitely be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Tonight I tried Cresta which was recommending by a friend. My group and I started with a few appetizers to share. Heirloom tomato pizza, Octopus(Spicy), Scallop crudo, Beets, and the Brussels sprouts. They were all fantastic the brussels sprouts were the best brussels sprouts I've ever had. The pizza stood out as well. Very noticeably fresh dough, great crunch, just the right amount of chew and fresh toppings. My main the Lamb Sirloin came with a side of spaetzle which had great taste and texture. The lamb itself (Medium Rare) was done to perfection, correctly seasoned, velvety rich sauce topped with pistachios. The Lamb was very tender and the dish came together very well. Now comes the best part dessert. My group and I also shared Desserts we had the poached apple crumble, Truffles with Iced cream, and the toffee pudding with icecream. If I had to describe them with one word it would be wow. Most restaurants desserts always taste store bought. Cresta's desserts tasted fantastic when we asked if they were done in house they said yes even the ice cream! The toffee pudding was the best I ever had, it was sweet and had great texture. Poached apple was done perfectly not too soft not too hard. The ice cream was very fresh, it did not taste like it was bought, like in most restaurants. Overall this restaurant seems to do everything from scratch and even creates their own espresso infused sugar mixture to prevent diluting your lattes or cappuccinos when added. So many little detail like that were made to create the perfect dinning experience.

Service was fast and friendly they evolved everyone and made everyone feel welcomed. The decor was delightful lighting was warm and the interior was modern and sophisticated. Great place to host and impress out of town guest, cranky family members, and dates etc. This is one of Toronto's hidden gems and if the quality and standards remain the same its surely to become one of Toronto's best restaurants."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant all around. Fantastic food, great wine selection, and top notch service. All of the servers are more than helpful. 

This was my first time at this restaurant and its difficult selecting a menu item because of how amazing they all sound. Went there for a date and it we split the calamari, zucchini pasta, and the carne pizza. Make sure to ask for the oils with the pizza. All of it was just amazing. 

Tip: ask them for wine-food pairing advice! All of the servers are very knowledgable, and their food is only placed on the menu if it goes well with their wine selection. I didn't know this until the end of the meal so it's really not necessary to do this, but definitely a fun added option if your into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. 
Good was okay. Fine for the price point. 
But the service can get flustered easily. The place wasn't that busy and there was a lot of staff who were still coaching each other and reminding each other how to behave and what to do but they were doing it in front of the customers in kind of an off putting way- as in people disciplining each other in front of customers.  

And then when it came to our order we tried to point out that the order was slightly wrong but the servers were just not getting it. I guess I could have just told them they got it wrong point blank. But instead I just asked if what I had ordered was there and he was like no and then walked away. And never came back to check if what I was actually asking for was what I should have. 

Whatever."}
{"text":"What a yummy brunch! Amazing scents coming from the open kitchen made this dining experience just that much better.

I ordered the BYOB (build your own breakfast) and was very pleased with what I got. It was the perfect amount of food: 2 eggs your way (sunny side up for me), a mountain of delicious roasted  potatoes (seasoned with rosemary), a few incredible strips of maple bacon (wow!! I want more!), and a plate of homemade toasted bread (came with a berry compote and an apple compote, also yummy!!!!). I finished my plate with a smile on my face and a full tummy.

It also seemed like a lot of the patrons are regulars, and I can see why."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and wine.  Would highly recommend strawberry gazpacho and scallops.  Poached apple crumble was delicious"}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant from some friends of mine that said they had eaten here. I researched the menu online because my husband and I can be pretty picky considering we are vegetarian/ pescetarian. Everything sounded very good so we decided to try it. 
Our waitress was extremely helpful with discussing the menu and wine. I decided to try the scallop ceviche, shiitake mushroom salad and the lobster infused spaghetti. I've eaten ceviche several times and this was by far the best! I'm not even sure how they even begin to make this incredible spaghetti and I've been dying to go back to have this again. 
As far as the price is concerned, I don't mind paying for a wonderful meal with a great experience. We will definitely be going back again very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome quaint date spot. Service was excellent and ambiance warm and cozy. We shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza which was close to one of the best pizzas I've had in the city. Decent wine and cocktail list. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We started going to Cresta when it opened as Pastizza.  We loved Pastizza and were disappointed when it first switched to Cresta, finding the menu too expensive and limited.  However they've changed the menu again and we are thrilled.  The pizzas we loved are back!  We stopped by on a Thursday and it was packed.  We shared a pizza to start then had the rabbit pasta and sea bass.  Everything was absolutely delicious and service was great."}
{"text":"Amazing place, wonderful staff and great food. Upon eating I found a hair in my food and the manager was gracious enough to give us the entire meal for free. Unexpected and so nice, we will be returning."}
{"text":"We recently hosted an event at Cresta for a group of 60 people. Setting up the event was great - their events coordinator, Michelle, was very responsive. We had no trouble customising the menu to our budget. The venue itself is quite large, with two floors and two patios. Their main bar has a beautiful chandelier that extends up to the second floor, and gives Cresta a bit of a classy airport lounge vibe.

While we had initially booked the upstairs for a private party, there was a last minute change made by the general manager, Dimitri, and the staff. Our plan for the event was to have space to mingle before and after dinner, and after they had set up the upstairs for a seated dinner of 60, they realized there wouldn't be enough space to comfortably walk around and chat. We were a bit surprised at the change when we arrived, but it was clear throughout the evening that it was the right choice, and there was much more space on the first floor. As a result, they had to shut down the restaurant and cancel some existing reservations to accommodate us.

We had a $55 prix fixe menu including three courses:

Appetizer: Warm Mushroom Salad or Romaine Salad
Entree: Sea Bass, Steak, Roasted Half Chicken or Zucchini with Spaghetti
Dessert: Strawberry Crumble or Sticky Toffee Pudding

The warm mushroom salad was fantastic, with the lightly charred mushrooms meshing well with the balsamic dressing on the leafy greens. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and came with a tomato-pepper sauce that was sweet and a bit unexpected, but very good nonetheless. The steak was done medium, and while I personally prefer my steaks closer to medium-rare, I was happy with how tender it was. To finish, both desserts were warm and came with a dollop of ice cream. The strawberry crumble was lighter and not too sweet, but the toffee pudding was the definite winner for desserts.

From planning to execution, the entire experience was excellent. Michelle and Dimitri were a pleasure to work with, and all of the staff on hand that evening were attentive, friendly, and approachable. We were especially appreciative of the additional effort they took to accommodate us at the last minute. It's clear that the staff cared about ensuring everyone had a great time. It was a wonderful evening and I would wholeheartedly recommend Cresta for anyone planning to host a large group dinner in the future."}
{"text":"The prices are very high, I can't justify spending $30 on a personal pizza here. The restaurant itself is quite nice, though it seems they are struggling to get people in there. Preferred this place when it was Pastizza, the cost of eating here will drive away business unfortunately. The food was tasty, just overpriced."}
{"text":"Perfect on so many levels. I haven't been this impressed with a restaurant in awhile. Excellent food (the sea bass was absolutely lovely and I really don't like cooked fish), great waitstaff and effective kitchen. The bathrooms are wheelchair accessible (and quite nice), and there is a large patio on the side of the street. Fantastic place to hold an event! I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much. The waitstaff was friendly, quick, and knowledgeable. We sat outside enjoying the beautiful patio and it was a lovely day. The food presentation was very artistic. However, I tried the soft polenta and I had food poising afterwards. My fiancé's buttermilk pancakes were fine but I wouldn't go back after that experience."}
{"text":"Best brunch place we have been to in awhile! There was a good mix of breakfast options and some lunch options. My funghi pizza was perfectly done, lots of mushroom flavor, the poached eggs worked so well and the arugula lightened it up! Son ate every last bite of the waffles which came with a couple of dipping options - maple syrup, and fresh jams. Daughter enjoyed the byob-eggs, potato, and sausage. Husband loved the hazelnut French toast."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now, and both times the food has been incredible.  The mushroom pizza is amazing and the balsamic Brussels sprouts are totally addictive!  Fries are ok, not much to screw up there.  The warm mushroom salad is great as well.   Our server (once she came over) was bubbly and sweet, and conscientious of our time limit before the Blue Jay's game and made sure we got out on time and that our food was prompt.  

Service isn't really on par with the prices to be honest.  The wine selection is also overpriced and the cheap option is disgusting.  The garnache is the only passable red in the $50 range.   

Great addition to the neighbourhood regardless."}
{"text":"Loved their Sunday brunch! Such a classy place. Ordered the mimosas :) then I had the salmon Benedict (delicious) and my boyfriend got the steak and eggs. Both were 10/10, amazinggggg. Great service and a great environment for a classy fun Sunday brunch. I would definitely go back for their lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Was once Pastizza ... this establishment is a great alternative when you want a more fancier resturant or when St Lawrence market is closed.  The crowd though, seems to be mid to older.  Nevertheless, at 6pm on a regular Saturday it seems like most of the tables are secured for \"later\" reservations.  Since we didn't have one of those, our party of 3 had to wait at the bar for them to creatively setup something.  Between us 3, we focused on the famous thin crust pizza (hoping its made just like when it was Pastizza), a calamari and a duck/liver pasta dish. The food came out quickly and we were promptly served. The pasta was very well cooked and the calamari was unexpectedly much more spicier than it read on the menu *Caution*. I'd say the pizza was slightly better back in the day, however the service was exceptional. It's one of the best services we have gotten in Toronto.  In addition, as we were leaving they offered us gourmet muffins (no the house). No complaints there :) we'll definitely back back again, but will try other items (except for the pizzas) on the menu."}

Would come back? Yes

This restaurant is up on my favourites list. The food was delicious and cocktails were incredible. 

FOOD:
1. Brussel sprouts (5/5) - savory, sweet and tangy at the same time. The brussel sprouts were highly addicting and were perfectly grilled

3. Veal liver pasta (4/5) - a generous portion of liver and pasta tossed in a delicious blend of olive oil, cheese and herbs
4. Reuben pizza (4/5) - a meaty pizza with sauerkraut tossed on top - tasted more like flatbread than pizza

2. Hazelnut bread pudding (3.5/5) 
3. Peach crumble (3.5/5) 

DRINKS:
1. Basil cucumber pitcher (5/5) - so refreshing and a lot stronger than it tastes!
2. Mojito pitcher (4/5) - sweeter and more syrupy if this is your preference"}
{"text":"My husband and I were taking his grandfather out for brunch and we were walking by and saw this place. We are very happy that we decided to stop in.

We ordered various coffees and brunch menu items and thought that they were reasonably priced and the quality of the ingredients used was great. The flavour palates were so well put together and all of the sauces are made in house and they were delicious.

We spent $65 before tip and we had between us 4 specialty coffees, 3 full meals and 2 sides. We were happy to pay that considering how many low end diners charge the same for brunch menus and are no where near as great as this place.

Also service was impeccable. Some one greeted us and took our coats, they came by promptly to take our orders and we were never left wondering where our waiter was. And they even wiped the table after we were finished eating and continued filling our water glasses after we had paid and were finishing up conversations before venturing out into the cold again.

Decor and the space in between other tables was also quite nice. It was a very modern and trendy spot.

We would recommend going for brunch and we will be likely to return!"}
{"text":"Good place for a nice Italian dinner. Dishes are all prepared well and were flavorful without being generic creamy Italian dishes.
Staff is nice and polite. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but if you get to try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When this place was Pastizza it was reasonably priced with reasonably good food. They seem to have rebranded from being your run of the mill upscale Italian restaurant to an attempt at fine dining while making no changes to the interior or decor. 

The only thing that has changed is the name, and the menu- which brings me to the biggest problem,  the prices. 

There is no justification for charging $27 for bruschetta, and personal pizzas for $34 with basic non-gourmet toppings. Pastas and salads also start in the $30 range. It just makes no sense... even our waiter agreed that the prices were ludicrous. 

The servers are friendly and try their best to go the extra mile  (ie coat check etc) but the prices are unsustainable with all the competing restaurants in the area. 

I will happily pay top dollar at a top restaurant, this just doesn't fit the bill."}
{"text":"I went there last night for Valentine's Day. It was a perfect experience. Our service was impeccable. I loved the food and ambiance is California cool. 

Nice selection of wines from California, we had the 2012 Zinfandel from George Thomas Estates. Excerpt from the winery website:  \"the 2012 Russian River Zinfandel was made from blending St. Peter's Church clone from Landy Vineyard with 100 plus year old vines from our Estate Sons and Daughters Ranch. The clusters were hand-picked, double sorted and fermented whole berry for 18 days. The wine was aged for 16 months on a mix of French and American oak barrels.\"

Loved this wine, 4 stars. 

For Valentine's Day, we were given a complementary appetizer of beet ravioli shaped like hearts with the most lovely presentation and flavor. Amazing.

We ordered two salads, the warm mushroom and the grilled hearts of romaine. The mushrooms were perfect and the dressing on point, excellent use of radicchio.

As entrees we ordered the ricotta & chestnut ravioli and the duck and liver. The ravioli is perfectly cooked and I loved the pomegranate seeds. My boyfriend had the duck and liver and it was amazing. As sides we got the frittes and the Brussels Sprouts. The homemade ketchup for the frittes was tasty. The Brussel sprouts were delicious, not traditional and my boyfriend hates Brussel sprouts but he likes these! 

Dessert we had the chocolate truffles and the homemade gelato.! Just perfection and delicious. 

Upon leaving we were given great homemade muffins to take home. We ate them on our plane back to NYC. 
An exceptional Valentine's Day for us! Thank you Cresta!"}
