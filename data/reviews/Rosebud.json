{"text":"I must have walked by this place more than a dozen times but I never saw it.  Some things are kept secret from you by the universe until you are ready for them.  I must be ready for Rosebud. I love the decor:  oldy-worldy wood, stained glass etc.  But what about the food?  Well, the menu changes all the time so what I review today probably won't be there when you go.  There were no mussels, no gnocchi and no rhubarb cobbler.  In fact, the menu was not Italian at all but Brit inspired (complete with minted peas and creamed corn...I recommend both).  There were deviled eggs (perfect with all gin drinks) and salmon cakes for starters. And my main was a bacon wrapped Halibut with a fried egg.  My friends had Lamb Faggots with Deviled Kidneys which may not be everyones cup of tea but if you are a fan of offal then you would be in heaven.   Our server was top shelf, kept on top of our drinks, knew the menu very well and the chef came out to make sure everyone was enjoying their food.  This is what I like in a resto. Oh, and the desserts were divine:  Potted lemon curd, burnt cream and chocolate pate...I'm drooling again thinking about it all."}
{"text":"I work steps away from Rosebud and after 5 years decided to finally step inside.  Have been there twice in less than a month, my new fav local restaurant!  They are offering a $20 price fix 3 course meal, everyone I have gone with has had minimal complaints (the first time my friend said his duck was dry and last time someone didn't love the creme caramel).   The service isn't super fast but it's a small place and I can't see how they could possibly squeeze another staff member in there, just 2 working the front of the house works and they are very attentive.  It's been busy both times I have been there (once with no reservation and once with) and last time Neve Campbell was sitting at the table next to us."}
{"text":"Ass ass ass. I can't believe they feel justified charging $35 (on a summerlicious menu no less) for such boring food. I had the mussel appetizer. Mussels were bloated/exploded in some kind of boring tomato sauce. Main course was some boring salmon sitting on top of an equally boring vegetable medley. There was no flavour to be had ANYWHERE. I wanted to stab a fork into my eye. The creme brule was pretty good but I'm not sure I've ever had a creme brule I didn't like. My date's rhubarb cobbler was pretty delicious.  The atmosphere in the place was equally uninspired. I liked the painting of the dog with the cone collar though."}
{"text":"After a failed experience at another restaurant down the road, we walked into Rosebud at 8:15 with no reservation.  There were two servers, and the female waitress set us up even though it was practically full.  Call ahead for reservations Fri and Sat nights!  The menu is always changing. Both the servers were way too busy, but apparently it one the guy's first day on the job!  So, it took a while, but we finally ordered drinks and food.  Highlights:  Mussels in a cream sauce. This is the creamiest sauce I've ever seen, and the other part is the grilled bread served on the side that soaks up said cream sauce like a sponge! So good.  Fries that come with the lobster.  Areas for improvement:  Lobster was slightly soft, ?overcooked? The vegetarian risotto was made with pearl-like buds of rice/barley. It was too dark to tell, but I think it could have used something else. Lots of hazelnuts, celeriac, and pear, but still it didn't quite come together.  We needed to head out before dessert, but they looked delicious on the menu.  I totally didn't mind the slow service, but I think it was just that night, too.  I'll be back for the dark candle-lit environment, and grilled bread in mussel juice."}
{"text":"First of all, Happy New Year. sorry for the MIA but I was scouring Spain and have returned to Toronto in search of some delicious eats as good as the ones I had there.  Enough with the pleasantries.. I finally had the opportunity for a ladies dinner at The Rosebud. I had heard so many amazing things about this place that I was really pumped to go. Although it was a quiet wednesday night I still had high hopes for the service / food.  Service -Remarkable. The man who served us, (I believe was the manager) was very sweet. Very open and helpful and really took an interest in us as patrons and as people. He could very well be the only reason I would return to this restaurant.  Atmosphere -quaint. I love that amidst the chaos of Queen street, this intimate restaurant exists. With only a handful of tables, it really brings back the feel that I have missed since La Palette closed down in Kensington  Food. This is where this review goes off the rails. I tried their prix fixe and I think that was a mistake. The mussels were bad (no flavour and I actually got a BAD one), The steak was nothing to write home about and the wine selection was a bit sparse. One thing that I can say that I enjoyed thoroughly was the dessert. Our server allowed us to try all three that were on the the menu this evening. My favourite was the Creme Caramel. Delish.  I will give this restaurant a second shot however as it's my hope that the poor food service was due to a slow night. (perhaps on a busier evening it will wow me a bit more). Maybe I just really want to like this place... maybe I'm just a sucker for a cozy environment."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place after landing at Queen and Broadview and, having to wait for a bit for my friends to arrive, popped into a drink at the Citizen (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-citizen-toronto), a very cool retro-50s style restaurant.  In talking with the bar staff they told me about their sister restaurant, Rosebud.  It wasn't until the next day that I walked by Rosebud in the heart of Queen West and then smacked my head as to why they called it that (It's a \"Citizen Kane\" reference and you too should be ashamed for not seeing it).  When I tried Rosebud, we showed up unannounced and unreserved and took the last table in the place.  A nice wine list and a breadth of great-looking Italian dishes are the fare.  For starters, we took the warmed black olives.  It sounds simple and they are simply delicious.  The secondi and pastas that we split were, well, great.  Gnocchi, which I don't typically go for, tasted spectacular and the steak was tender, tasty, and bloody the way a rare steak should be.  The fact that both Citizen and Rosebud share the same chef tells you that you're probably assured the same quality dishes from either kitchen.  You'd think that the chef'd get tired from running between the two."}
{"text":"We came to Rosebud last night after an unsuccessful attempt to get a table at Czehoski jwhich was packed (just before 7 pm) and the few vacant tables were reserved..... Note to self, make a reservation for Czehoski for a Saturday night.  We walked into Rosebud which was completely EMPTY!!!  First clue!  Supposedly the restaurant was completely reserved in the next half hour or so.  But the waitress was able to find a table for 2, so down we sat.  She explained the specials (food and wine) and the menu itself looked good.  Then we looked at the wine list.  Quite extensive white wine selection in a variety of price ranges.  The red however was quite short and VERY expensive with the majority of wines in the $100 range.  NOT!  We got the scoop from the waitress..... seems the owner is busy with other projects and his wife is pregnant.  And there's no manager at the restaurant.... so no one's ordering wine.  OR as we contemplated later.... is it that cash flow is so bad, they can't purchase wine???  The waitress offered us a bottle of wine at a discount, but at this point we were wondering if the owner/manager was ignoring the wine, were they also ignoring the food?  And the waitress also mentioned she'd only been there 2 weeks.... so are they also ignoring the restaurant and the staff are clueing in they may be working on a sinking ship?  So, we decided to cut our losses and leave.  Too bad really, as this was supposed to be a great restaurant at one time."}
