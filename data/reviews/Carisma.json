{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and wanted to try something new.  Encouraged by the reviews, we decided to give the place a try, despite some skepticism about the rave reviews for what often turns out as merely adequate.    The place was fairly busy at 7:00p on a Saturday, but ended up absolutely packed an hour later.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and owner Michele, once I started speaking Italian, changed our seating to a better spot.  After getting to know each other a little, he told us to relax and that he would take care of us with a selection of their best, no need to agonize over menu choices.  We were happy to oblige him, and were left with choosing the wine from a good list:  a half liter of Brunello, which was followed by a fabulous Tignanello.    Antipasto came, with sampling a of grilled shrimp and calamari, a Caprese salad, a warm fungi salad, and prosciutto and Parmesan.  All excellent, especially the shrimp.  Main course was a sampling of the tenderest, most delicate Gnocchi with a fabulous white sauce;  and a sampling of wild boar ragu pappardelle, a dish typical of Tuscany and one which I've had there many times.  This one was as good or better, not to miss as your pasta main.  Second was a sampling of a grilled spigola, a delicate Mediterranean white fish.  This for me was the highlight, it was done to perfection, which a slight char and absolutely fine seasoning that brought the best to the dish.  The other main sampling was a nicely rare beef tenderloin with mash potatoes, asparagus, and brocoletti.  Finally, we were treated to dessert on the house, a chocolate ganache and cheese cake.    Service was friendly, unpretentious, and attentive, most or all waiters were fluent in Italian and well versed in their wines and food.  The place was buzzing by 8:00p, and the only disappointment was a rather hefty bill, even accounting for the wine choices.  If you can look past the price, this is probably one of the best Italian meals I had in a long while, and the restaurant would be at home with fine choices in the center or south of Italy.  Bravo Michele e grazie!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my co-workers here last night. Great food. Impeccable service. Impressive wine list."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The service is always fantastic, the food is great...the bread is REALLY great :) Every visit has been top-notch until a couple of weeks ago when I dined here for a special occasion. The beef tenderloin I ordered was on the dry side (despite requesting medium rare colouring). We ordered the carpaccio to start, and my boyfriend ordered the grilled sea bass, both which were done well and delicious. All other parts of the evening were fantastic - next time I will ask for it to be more on the \"rare\" side of medium rare, and hope to avoid this."}
{"text":"We were trying to pick an Italian place and Bf eventually settled with Carisma after seeing the pics and reviews.   Lovely atmosphere. A little more adult and quieter which was great for us (romantic dinner). Decor is nice and the dim lighting is great.   The wait staff was top notch and made our experience even better. They didn't rush to take our plates away and always arrived at perfect movements to clean the table and bring food.  They food recommendations were also spot on.   We ordered two cocktails, the Pear Te and the Cafe martini.  They were delicious and we ordered another round. But it could use more alcohol. We've had much stronger martinis for less than the price charged here.   The food was superb.  We had calamari for appetizer. Good portion for two. I ordered the Osso Buco and Bf ordered the Spaghettini al Camberi (recommended by the waiter). Both were cooked perfectly. The risotto with the Osso Buco was delicious. We liked the pasta better. I was eating off my BFs plate.   Got the walnut tart and pear strudel which were decent. Nothing special in my option.   Overall great main course and service."}
{"text":"What a terrific restaurant.  The owners have been in the business for decades and it shows - the chef puts out dishes that are top notch, and the servers deliver these delights to you with charm and grace.  I had fish, my date had meat, and both dishes were superb.  The desert was to die for, and I almost did.  The decor is muted, you won't go blind looking at garish walls, and the noise level is low enough so you don't have to yell at your dinner companions.  The bar looks pretty cool too, I'm going to sit there next time.  The wine list is heavily Italian, which is to be expected - there are some very reasonable half-bottles, and our server was very helpful in helping us pick a wine that would suit both the fish and meat dishes.  The prices are reasonable given the quality of the food.  You will not be disappointed and your guests are going to be very impressed."}
{"text":"This is a great little Italian restaurant.   Ask for the Burrata - it is to die for. This is a cute family owned restaurant and you will want to keep coming back to try all their dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Toronto restaurants. It's a quaint and intimate family owned spot with delicious food. From the rosemary And olive oil Italian bread to the lovely second and main course dishes, we are always pleased. We typically have the lamb chops and the grilled branzino with either molten chocolate cake and ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"First of all, the service here is really attentive and they treated us very nicely from start to finish. The food was on point! Burrata with tomatoes, basil, evoo, and balsamic reduction was so good! The duck feature also hit the spot although just a touch on the chewy side. All in all great flavors and a good experience for a date. I will be back the next time I'm in the six."}
{"text":"\"It wasn't great\" Dinner service by our waiter was loud and a fast, definitely not what you would expect from an upscale restaurant like this. The noise level in this restaurant makes it very difficult to have a discussion with your guest across the table. It is highly recommended that you bring as a means of communication a note pad and a pen! The food was served cold and it was uninspired with a mediocre presentation. Everyone at the table complained about the lack of flavor in their meal. This restaurant is overrated and does not measure in overall quality to other Italian restaurants in Toronto.  Overpriced for tasteless food!!!!   V"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have dined here in the past. The food was excellent. Decor is amazing. No issues with either. The one-star review stems from a recent experience with their staff and management.   To say I'm disappointed with this restaurant would be an understatement. To think I have told many of my friends to come - and to then experience what would account to a simple lack of decency - well, I feel duped. So here I am, venting (and hopefully saving you all a lot of grief).  We were considering holding our wedding at Carisma. This was, until we met with their staff this morning. First off - nobody was smiling. I mean, NOBODY. I'm a business instructor, and one of my favourite courses is Business Communication. I know a thing or two about this stuff - and the lack of smiles, the disgruntled looks, the attitude...WOW! It was just too much to swallow.   Back to the wedding. So my partner and I walk in at 11:30am, on a Tuesday to see if there's someone we can talk to. The waiter we met shot us a look of sheer disgrace - as if we were a couple of cockroaches entering the premises. We go in, all smiles. I figure if you smile enough times, they will return a smile. Nope. Not happening. We ask if we can speak to someone about holding a wedding. The waiter responds, \"No, we don't have time. The owner's busy.\" And sure enough, there's the owner looking busy on the phone. Okay - we'll leave. But before we go, we say, \"Is there a time we can book an appointment, maybe in the new year?\". The response: \"We're not open on new year's\". YES, WE KNOW. We said 'in the new year'. Anyway, somewhere between his attitude, the lack of smiling (there was none), and the look of annoyance, we decided to head out. Perhaps we shouldn't have come back.   But we did. 10 minutes later. Figured it was just a bad start, and we'd give everyone a second chance to rectify things. We're not uptight. We just think business can be done differently. Perhaps they were having a bad moment. So we go back.   This time, we make it to the bar - where another waiter yells out, \"CAN I HELP YOU?\". We smile (notice, we keep smiling!) and ask for the owner. He's right there, we see him, and he sees us. He gets us and points to a lady sitting beside him. She's the event person. And while this is happening, I'm noticing that - you guessed it - NOBODY IS SMILING! No welcoming gestures, no warmth. Nothing. Just the look of pure annoyance.   We strike up a conversation with the lady. When we politely let her know that nobody is smiling, nor is anyone being warm, or forthcoming with information, she replies, \"Well, what do you expect, you're coming in here at 11:30am looking suspicious....\". I must have stopped listening to anything after that. 'Looking suspicious'? A couple of guys walk in at 11:30am (by the way, their hours are listed on the website. Coincidentally, lunch opens at 11:30), and we get deemed \"suspicious\"?  We say nothing. Just dumbfounded. But we press forward. I say, \"We're just walking in, asking for some help - why isn't the guy at the door smiling when he sees people?\" The owner comes out, barking, \"It's a week before Christmas! We're busy!\"   I mean, this place just keeps saying the wrong things.   We are furious. Nobody is apologizing. Nobody is offering to help. NOBODY cares one bit about making the sale, extending a hand, giving information, anything!   We leave, angry, and so disappointed. What could have been our wedding spot, will not only no longer be, but we will NEVER dine at Carisma again. What's that worth to the owners... hundreds? Thousands? The cumulative effect of this disgraceful behaviour will amount to a decent amount of coin. And the negative word of mouth in telling my friends (and you, the readers) about this experience may entice them to change. Or it won't. Who knows.   It just baffles me that businesses can take such a stupid jab at their clientele, and turn business away - and with such demeaning, pompous attitude! Business, that quite literally, is at their doors, just waiting to get handed over.   So with that, I end my rant. If you cannot speak to people in a way that is inviting, that expresses gratitude, that is inclusive, you will suffer as a business. Not just in business - but in life. Such is the way karma works.   And sorry to say this, Carisma, but karma's a bitch. And your risotto really wasn't that good, anyway."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service.  I found the sea bass a bit more charred than I'd like. Without any question, our server took my dish back. The chef created a whole new dish for me, pan seared the filler for me instead.   Looking forward to going back already."}
{"text":"Mine was a disappointing experience and unfortunately it was just the experience that ruined the night because the food was great and our server Andrew was fantastic. I made a reservation for 20 people a few weeks in advance and had spoken to the restaurant two other times to confirm number and not once did they mention their policy in splitting bills for large parties. I actually still don't know what the policy is because the rude and angry manager told me two different versions when he was yelling at my party and I. It was a very embarrassing experience and I have never been treated so badly. The only time he stopped yelling at us was to go have a sip of his drink at the bar. Even the lady he was with joined him a couple of times in yelling at us. We were a groups of 30-something professionals out for a birthday enjoying the evening and simply expected to be treated with respect. We couldn't be more disappointed. I wish I had read some of the \"not recommended\" reviews on Yelp beforehand as it seems that I am not the first to experience this man's belligerence."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Italian restaurants in Toronto. Food is consistently excellent. The table bread is possibly the best in the city!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with fabulous service and quality food. Not to mention, the bread was to die for! I highly recommend this cozy place."}
{"text":"Truly a great experience! Upscale Italian restaurant with  some of the best Italian food I have tasted. We were visiting from New Jersey and our hotel concierge from the trump tower introduced us to this restaurant and we couldn't be happier. The bread dipped in olive oil that they bring you in the beginning was truly one of the best I've had. The pasta was on point, and couldn't have tasted any better. The next time we come back to Toronto, this will be the our first stop!"}
{"text":"Our waiter went above and beyond for my uncle and I on vacation. We wanted to try two different dishes each, so he split the plate so we could each try 2 things instead of one plate of one thing. He recommended absolutely fantastic wine also. He was funny, sweet and recommended other places to eat and things to do on vacation. Such an excellent place - definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Recommended by hotel staff. We were going to go to little Italy for Italian but he talked us into the closer alternative. We were very happy.  Great service, nice wine list selections.  Food was very good, had ravioli And two types of veal dishes. Everything awesome. The bread and oil brought out at the start was fantastic, we ate every crumb and sopped up the oil.  Absolutely a must visit if you love Italian food in an intimate cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very nice evening with friends for dinner. Our waiter was great. Highly recommend fillet of beef with fois gras and  lemon veal. Mushrooms salad and burratta great."}
{"text":"Carisma a true food affair . Osso Buco Silky meat gently laid on a soft bed of rizzotto . Each bite melted in my mouth, as I eat slowly  the taste of love awakens my memory of bliss.  An elegant delight a night I did not want to end. I wanted it to last till sun rise and then do it all over again. Carisma"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very good service. Plates are bueatiful. Wine perhaps a bit pricey but food more than makes up for it. Good vegi options and the bread is amazing."}
{"text":"The overall experience of the restaurant was positive. Friendly staff with great customer skills!  I ordered the Wild Boar Ragu Pasta and it was very delicious.  The wild boar tasted more like grounded beef.  The flavours were light and fresh, better than your average pasta dish but I kind of expected the portion to be bigger.  The Pomegrante & Peach cocktail was very good, though I found the vodka to be a little overwhelming, otherwise it was very fruitful and tasty."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Italian food in a cozy setting with fantastic service, Carisma is definitely worth a try.   The restaurant is not overly large and the tables are somewhat close together which has the effect of making the restaurant a little noisy. However, with that being said, our table of 4 was still able to hold a conversation without having to strain our ears.   The service was \"top-notch\" as I found the servers to be very attentive and helpful. They were also quite friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Interestingly, I think they were also all Italian with heavy Italian accents which added to the atmosphere of this Italian restaurant.   Now, the real reason to come to Carisma is the food which was just delicious. The bread provided at the table is like a small baguette which comes with some olive oil, salt and herbs on top. For starters, I had a chance to eat the tuna tartare and pan-seared scallops. Both were delicious!  The portion of tuna tartare was quite generous and the accompanying taro chips added an interesting texture and flavour. The scallops were cooked perfectly which was nice as it's easy to overcook scallops.   For main entrees, I was able to try the Tagliolini pasta which comes with clams, cherry tomato and white wine. It was also quite good with the flavours working well together and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I also had the special \"pasta of the day\" which was a simple dish of noodle pasta with brown butter and truffles. It was absolutely delicious!!!  Once again, the pasta was well cooked and while the dish was simple in composition, the flavour and texture was so good (disclaimer - I am a big fan of truffle).  For dessert, we attempted to have the creme brûlée, but unfortunately they had run out. Therefore, we ended up having the Strudel which was okay - nothing great. The vanilla ice cream that came with it however was quite good. I am often called \"boring\" by friends and family as my favorite flavour of ice cream is vanilla, however, as a result, I think I know my vanilla ice cream and the one they serve at Carisma is good.   The only thing which kept this review from getting 5 stars is the price. While the prices aren't outrageously high for the quality of the food you get, it is a little pricey.  In the end, I suppose \"value\" when it comes to food is a little subjective and others might find the prices perfectly reasonable.  Overall, I would rate Carisma 4.5/5, and I will definitely be returning to try some of their other dishes.   Apologies there aren't any pictures, but I just got absorbed in our dinner conversation that night and I completely forgot to take pictures - next time."}
{"text":"Everything about Carisma was top notch. Food, service ambiance. We were a group of three and all of our meals were exceptional. The calamari was as good as I have ever had. The bread is awesome."}
{"text":"The bread here is so far my favorite in town. The raw beef tenderloin is also very good.."}
{"text":"What can I say but holy crap this place is awesome! Nondescript on the outside, super amazingness on the inside! Our group of 6 was greeted with smiles all around and efficient coat checking ensued. We were seated at a comfortable table and attended to immediately.   Water and wine was refilled automatically without anyone ever having to ask. The waiter was well experienced and rhymed off the specials as if he had memorized them from childhood. Half of us tried the grouper special with potatoes and vegetables, one colleague had the veal scallopini, someone else had the gnocchi and the last guy had a salad. Everyone was super impressed and I almost forgot... THE BREAD IS TO DIE FOR. Salt, olive oil, herbs and crostini and you're good to go.   Molten chocolate cake, walnut tart and lychee creme brulee for dessert. Everything was perfect. A bottle of chianti quickly disappeared.   In and out in 1.5 hours, decor was beautiful. Definitely a romantic spot for you lovers out there. Bathroom in the basement was ridiculously clean. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We chose this one after looking through the menu. From the outside it's pretty nice and then you walk in ... ahhh ambiance. Very pretty inside. Once inside the service is excellent. I had veal and my gf had pasta. The veal (porcini mushroom sauce) was probably one of the most tender pieces of veal I've had in a very long time. Yummy, Marinated in wine. My gf's pasta was also very good. The wine list is pretty good but expensive. Food was reasonably priced and well prepared. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We popped in here this past Friday for dinner. Atmosphere is intimate - the resto is black inside, lit by candles. Very nice and calming. For appetizers, we ordered the calamari and carpaccio - both were delicious. For dinner I had the half chicken and my boyfriend ordered the tuna pasta (forgot name, sorry). Both again, delicious. Service was excellent. Speed of receiving food - impressive. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Carisma never disappoints with there menu. I think I have had everything on there menu and it's all delicious. Great place for a dinner with the husband or just your girlfriends.  Staff and owners are so nice from the minute u enter till you leave."}
{"text":"What food should be, great taste and presentation!! Service was very efficient and polite. Nice to see a place that delivers on a promise."}
{"text":"My first dinner at Carisma. All the service was welcoming, professional and wonderful.  The décor is comfortable and sophisticated. The restaurant filled up quickly on the Thursday night (before Christmas week) and the clientele were on their way to the theatre, staying at the King Eddie, having a romantic dinner, celebrating Christmas with friends, on dates, or friends getting together - a really nice mix.  The menu was obviously prepared with great care and a Mediterranean flare. The wine list was also very well edited. Our server was charming and offered subtle and great advice. Our meals were delicious and presented beautifully. Servings were generous by my standards.  The warm just-out-of-the-oven herbed loaf was a great start to dinner on a winter's night. We sampled the squid salad appetizer. The squid was grilled to perfection. Our mains were: 1. the 'daily special' swordfish, which was grilled and served with sauteed asparagus, red peppers and fingerling potatoes; and 2. the spaghetti with shrimp in a creamed tomato sauce. I spent 2 weeks in Tuscany last October and none of the pasta I ate there compared to Carisma's pasta!  We shared an apple-pear strudel with vanilla ice cream as our server recommended and it was served with a perfect cup of coffee.  Thanks to everyone at Carisma for a perfect dinner. I'll be back - again and again - very soon!"}
{"text":"I made the decision to work a bit later so that the Jays playoff game would be close to done before leaving the office so that I would not have to battle the crowds. I ended up joining 3 of my colleagues for dinner at Carisma. I had been a couple of times previously and really enjoyed it.  Tonight was much like the last time I went - the food and the service was excellent. While deciding on orders and enjoying a Negroni (of course - and it was good), our waiter presented us with \"the best bread in the city\". I would put it up there. It was a crostini with rosemary, sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil.   I ordered the Bufala to start. It was a perfect texture and the tomatoes and basil were very fresh. The portion size was just right.  I have been to some restaurants where the portion is overdone and takes away from the main course, but not here.  For my main I went with one of the specials, which was the veal ribeye, done medium rare. It was served with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables and topped with a wild mushroom sauce.  The veal was cooked to perfection, and again, I found the serving size to be just right.  I ended off with an espresso, and shared some biscotti. A great way to wrap up a very enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the \"family-owned\" Italian restaurant you would find in Italy.  Food was amazing-- salad, pastas, main dishes were as beautiful to look at as to devour!  Service impeccable and family touched each table with their genuine warmth and love of what they are doing!  One of the BEST meals I have had in a very long time!"}
{"text":"Very good place. Was recommended to me by a concierge in the Fairmont Royal York. The waiters are quick, energetic, and interesting individuals. The food was great, from the antipasti to the dessert. Everything was top notch. Only thing is the lighting is kind of dark so it's hard to see the menu if you don't really have good eyesight, but otherwise the restaurant has a very cozy and warm feel. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Italian meal with authentic dish selection.  Solid wine list.  Friendly staff and very good service.      I started with a Burrata cypress salad. Presentation of food was thoughtful.  Sea Bass melted like butter.  Tagliatelle with black truffles was exquisite. Cutlery to match each course. I would go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Overall, slightly disappointed.  We had reservations at our favourite restaurant, but they had to unexpectedly close for the night, so we decided to give Carisma a try.    The restaurant is quite dark and loud, but that's not really a huge bother to us.  Ambience was nice.  We ordered the Scallop appetizer to split - this was quite good, the scallop was perfectly cooked and we both enjoyed it.  We each had a glass of the house red, which was quite nice and at a good price (9.99) which was welcome here.  For the second course I had the veal stuffed raviolini with pistachios and my fiancee had the mushroom risotto.  My raviolini was quite good, even though the veal portion was almost undetectable.  The risotto was however quite bland.  For the main course my fiancee had the rack of lamb and I had the osso bucco.  The lamb was very good - perfectly cooked, well seasoned, everything you would expect.  The osso bucco was however probably the least tender osso bucco I've ever had, and also there was basically no flavour to it whatsoever - it basically tasted like un-seasoned stewing meat, and the bed of risotto it was on had the same flavour as the risotto from the second course.  I had to salt the dish, and only ended up eating less than half of it.  We decided against dessert.  I asked for the bill, and then we didn't see the waiter for another 20 minutes, when he came over and asked again if we wanted the bill.  Overall, the place was very hit and miss.  Although some dishes were excellent, when spending over $200.00 on a dinner, you don't expect two fifths of the meal to be bland, tasteless and uninspired.   We won't be coming back, there are much better Italian restaurants in Toronto at a much better price point."}
{"text":"As an Italian restaurant, one thing I really care about is the tradition to serve food with the best ingredients so that you can taste the freshness and remind you of the beautiful Italian little town. okay, that was a bit too much.   The first time I visited this place was about one year ago and I rushed to find a suitable lunch place for a catchup meeting with my coworker. Honestly, I love this place. It is definitely old fashion in a way that your server shows you full respect, take away your coat and greet you every time you have eye contacts. The thing made me coming back, except the mouth-watering Italian pasta, is the magical mushroom soup. The secret is truffle. I don't know about you;  I have zero resistance to things that smell or taste like truffles. I did not expect a regular mushroom soup can taste so luxurious and unforgettable. The only downside is that they don't make it every day. I believe it was only one or two days a week. The thing is that I keep on coming back so I can find my pleasant surprise.   In addition, I honestly find anything else also pleasing, which makes this place easily a great spot for an important lunch or dinner. The only downside is the price, definitely not as affordable as I would like it to be as my common lunch spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! We stopped in and the tables were full, so we sat at the bar to eat. The bartender was fantastic! Even though she was busy with drink orders, she was very attentive and gave us great recommendations. We started with the mushroom salad and it was phenomenal, as was the house bread.  The summer truffle pasta that was one of the nightly specials was amazing, as was the fish with tomatoes and capers. This is a must visit restaurant, and it's super convenient if you are staying at the Omni Kind Edward."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Carisma - I get my haircut and color from Paolo next door and he is always raving about this place.  The food really is very good and I am definitely going to take my parents here.  I decided to take my fiancé out, just to say thanks, and we started out with my favorite cheese, Burrata (they were willing to split it for us), as well as for appetizers, their Risotto Porcini (which again, they split for us).  My main was the Vitello Porcini which was very flavourful, and my SOs Beef Tenderloin, although tasty, was nothing special.  Service was very nice and our glasses never went empty.   I would highly recommend this place for a date night, parents outing, or special occasion. The food will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at Carisma tonight. Fungi salad and the 4 cheese gnocchi were outstanding. Cheesecake was the literal cherry on top. Service was very attentive and entertaining, treated my girlfriend and I like family. Ambiance was intimate and romantic - will be going back!"}
{"text":"Carisma, I had such high expectations for you and you let me down!   Trying to book a good restaurant on a Saturday in downtown Toronto ended up being a hard challenge for me. I was left with only a few available options and Carisma was one.  After reading reviews and knowing that the man loves Italian I decided to pick this place as our fancy dinner location for the weekend.  When we showed up we were promptly sat, and our server came right over. It was darkly lit with a romantic feel but it was loud, busy and if there was mood music, you couldn't hear it. The server was over the top and had an arrogant presence, he seemed to be like this to some tables but not to others... kind of ruined the experience from the start.  We ordered some drinks, I had a glass of white and he ordered an old fashioned... however what he got tasted like a shot of bourbon in a full glass of water. It was terrible.  To start we got the carpaccio, it was good, but there was A LOT of oil on top, it was to the point where when you picked up a slice of beef and arugula you had to tap it off a few times so it wouldn't drip when you brought it to your mouth.  For mains I ordered the paccheri, which did actually have a nice flavour and was a good sized portion. The main squeeze orderd the ravioli and it was pretty bad. When his arrived it was SWIMMING in truffle oil, he actually had to tap each piece of pasta the side of his plate and it was still dripping oil....I don't know how he ate it, because even when I was eating mine there was a couple times where I tasted truffle oil because the smell of his was soooo strong from across the table.  We did have a dessert which was a dark chocolate lava cake with some gelato I think, it was good but really it's a lava cake. So, not much skill goes into that.  I would not come here again, I was just so disappointed in the meals and especially the service."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner while visiting. I did a ton of research on restaurants and obviously carisma has great reviews. It's very nice inside and service was good. The wine was also good but the pasta was not that great!  We ordered pasta since it is what they are known for but it definitely did not stand out. I would order something different if I ever went back."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and this is one of the best restaurants we have ever ate at. The homemade pasta is simple and flavorful, the wine selection is fantastic and the staff was exceptional!! The atmosphere is classy with a comfortable feel. I would recommend this Resturant to anyone who is in the area! Very pleased with the whole experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my second true love after my fiancé. We had a miu romantico night with delicious food in this small, discreet Italian restaurant. Nice decor, but more importantly, exceptional food and service. I felt ok giving them my money, even though I was a bit more than I anticipated. I wish we could have our wedding here it is THAT good."}
{"text":"My friends recommended this place for true authentic Italian food. I have to agree this is a great place for Italian food. You walk into a lovely chic atmosphere with chandeliers and candlelight. The staff is truly amazing over the top attentive, at your service, warm and friendly. I'm seated in the corner near the kitchen overlooking the entire restaurant.  I kind of felt like the godfather here or godmother.  I take a look at the menu and spot many of my favorites burrata and gnocchi so naturally, I have to order these.  Rosemary bread & olive oil, Burrata, Zucchini flower stuffed, Gnocchi paired with some lovely greek wine.  It was all divine the presentation and flavor on point. After all that I didn't think I could take another bite, but my server insisted I order dessert. I did, ordered the creme brulee which was Delicious!   I would definitely come back to dine here as it was all you would expect and more."}
{"text":"If anyone ever says they like Italian food, I ALWAYS recommend this restaurant. Two of my friends have already came here at two different occasions because of my recommendation and they were just as pleased. I had the gnocchi and it was so great! And for dessert I had the creme brûlée which was definitely the best I've ever had, it was SO GOOD. The service was spectacular, the waiter was good but it was the waiter that brought out our food for us that really stood out and explained why the restaurant was called carisma."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best experiences of my life. Took my boss and it was truly a fabulous experience. From the waiters to the sommelier-everything was amazing from Astrid the server. He is the best of what Canada is. Kudos Carisma amazing service"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food with excellent service - the perfect combo. I ate here once at lunch and another time for dinner - everything spot on during both visits.  Service was exceptional each time - very \"old school\". Staff are quick to take orders, refill drinks / wine glasses, make great recommendations and ensure everything is just right. Staff tended to be older and very professional.  Food was really good. A couple highlights:  - I love the grilled Calamari appetizer, huge portion and cooked perfectly. Served with warm black olives and homemade tomato sauce. Just melted in your mouth.  - They do a house Charcuterie platter on occasion - it's very good. Served on a per person basis. Meat, cheeses, bread olives, and pickles. Give it a try.  - Gnocchi Quattro Formaggi - I love Gnocchi and this didn't disappoint. Warning - the four cheese sauce is incredibly rich. I wish they had a tomato sauce version. The Gnocchi is stuffed with Ricotta instead of the usual potato.  - There is usually a daily fish special, I tried the grilled Halibut on one visit. The fish was cooked perfectly and served on a bed of Risotto which was also cooked perfectly.   Both my visits were work related functions but I think Carisma would make a great date restaurant. Atmosphere is somewhat formal but still laid back. Lights are dimmed and some couch style seating is available.  Extensive wine menu and a few beer options offered. Apps tend to be in the $15 range with most mains priced between $22 - $30.   Give it a try...  BK"}
{"text":"A classy but still relaxed spot. Good for a nice meal out or a relaxing drink and desert at the bar. Came here in late November with a friend. Sat at the bar - great and friendly service from both the bartender and the servers. It's charming that a lot of the servers and the owners are actually Italian; folks are upbeat and it feels like a real family-run spot.   Bartender recommended a dry wine (way we like it!) in our price range and the rosemary focaccia was nice and light. We split the burrata to start, simple and good. I had the branzino (fish special) and my friend had the lemon veal. Both were tasty. Fish, veggies and roasted potatoes were perfectly cooked. My friend liked his veal and the mashed potatoes too. But my favourite part was probably the deserts - light and fluffy and not too sweet delicious cheesecake and thing, a little crispy but still soft apple and pear tart. YUM!  All in all, casual but still sophisticated spot with yummy, simple, but hearty Italian food with great portion sizes for the price. And a hot bartender to boot ;)"}
{"text":"I've walked by here a number of times and from the outside it seems like a cozy, cute corner restaurant.  Finally, did a lunch here today.  Decor is quite dark inside but nice, probably looks better during the night.  I had the special soup of the day - peach and corn soup.  It was very nice and more of a puree.  I'd recommend if it if comes up as a special again.  My main was the vitelllo saltimbocca.  It's basically veal scallopini with a piece of proscuitto on top.  All of the secondis come with mashed potatos and vegetables, which were meh.  The main was OK, veal was cooked nicely but I wouldn't say I'd order it again.  They have some other interesting things on the menu that caught my eye.  My colleague had the wild boar ragu which he enjoyed.  I'd have to say the best part was the bread they give you.  It's a nice soft Italian loaf that is seasoned and drizzled with olive oil.  I probably ate half of my table's serving.  Our initial waiter was an older gentleman who was extremely friendly and helpful.  They ran out of the wine he suggested, so we were given a more expensive one for the same price.  Half way through our lunch, it swapped to a younger waiter who seemed to lack on the hospitality side.  I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars if I could.  Everything was decent, but nothing jumped out at me."}
{"text":"I am not someone who usually leaves a review, but I take great advantage of other people's reviews. But this was so awesome from the bread to the desert that I just had to say it was one of my best restaurant experiences! And the staff was awesome, and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the States and highly recommended. Agree with that. Service superb! The waiter gracious and available when needed. Help with menue. Good bottle of red Italian wine. Main meals excellent and hot at service, veal and pasta with sausage. Strudel and ice cream excellent. A bit noisy with table next door very loud. Definitely recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"Spent a very enjoyable evening, excellent food and decor. The staff was the best, and did not wait for anything. Nothing bad to say about this restaurant and recommend to everyone. The veal and seafood was some of the best we have tasted. Go for it"}
{"text":"Went here last night and service was great. Our waiter was fantastic but a bit overly polite (thanking me as he passed me the debit machine?), which was a bit awkward.  Food was great. Boyfriend had the Duck special which he loved and I had the Pumpkin Ravioli. The ravioli was a smaller portion so don't order it if you are very hungry. It was also a bit heavy on the olive oil.  The restaurant gets very busy on a Friday night so come early if crowds aren't your thing. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on eating there over the weekend.  All in all a great experience but don't think I would go out of my way to go back again soon..."}
{"text":"Had high expectations but was not impressed.  This is my first time here, and i actually heard about it for many years and didnt get a chance to give it a try. Unfortunately, the food was good as i hoped. I had the osso bucco, and it wasnt tender and flavourless. The rissotto that came with it had not taste. I only smell thmye that came with the dish and taste the parsley in the rissotto. My girlfriend ordered the scallop risotto, which tasted better. You can taste the seafood flavour, however there was sand in her scallop, and the scallop was sliced in half to make it two pieces. She had two pieces (4 sliced in half). The risotto was not cooked well, it was quite raw for some of the rice and it  was hard to chew. Iwas quite disappointed as i had very high expectation.  The server didnt pay much attention to my table, maybe because i didnt order a bottle of wine, like the table next to me. He asked if we needed pepper or cheese, and then went to serve the guest next to us. He forgot to give us pepper and cheese for the tasteless food. Also, i had an empty glass of water for half my meal."}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant was in my home town! We were in Toronto for vacation and Carisma was a few doors down from our hotel. We went there the first night we were in town because it was close and we wanted to keep things simple--we had read a couple of reviews but had no idea what to expect. It was phenomenal. Expert service, incredible food. The bread was fantastic. I had to stop myself from eating so much I wasn't hungry for dinner. I had a gnocchi in four cheese sauce as an appetizer--the gnocchi was incredibly light as was the sauce, not at all heavy. The portion size was perfect as an appetizer. For dinner, I ordered the evening's special which was halibut with a tomato salsa. I can sometimes be iffy about fish--I can feel virtuous about ordering it but not always entirely enjoy it. But this halibut was excellent. It has now become the bar against which I measure all other fish dishes in restaurants (and nothing else has measured up yet!). We ended the meal by splitting the molten lava cake; we've had several variations on this over the years as we're both chocolate lovers, but I think I can easily say this is one of the best ones we've had.   We enjoyed our dinner so much that we went back again on our last night in town, even though we had so many other restaurants to choose from. I again ordered the halibut special, although this time it was done with a mango salsa. And, again, it was excellent. Everything is fresh-made on site, the waitstaff are knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive, and extremely helpful when it comes to choosing wines. Altogether it was a relaxed atmosphere and excellent food; I'd go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Toronto is blessed with many excellent Italian restaurants, and this is one of them.  We stopped in for dinner before a show and were delighted with the experience. The ambience is more modern Italian, with dim lighting and sufficient room between tables so you're not on top of the person beside you. The wine list is extensive so your knowledge of Italian wines will be tested here! For dinner we started with the Calamari alla Griglia - grilled calamari with black olives and a tomato scallion sauce - and the Capesante con Funghi - seared scallops with mushrooms. Both were excellent! The seafood was perfectly cooked, not overcooked, tender and flavourful, with delicious flavourings. Great start! For the mains we had Raviolini alla Salvia - veal ravioli with a pistacchio and sage butter sauce - and the Vitello al Porcini - veal scallopini with a porcini mushroom sauce. The ravioli and sauce was spectacular! wow, that was good. The veal was also really good, but a little light on porcini. We didn't have time for desert, but next time we'll have to give them a try. Yes, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a sexy restaurant!  Dimly lit with art deco plush furnishings, crystal chandeliers and light fixtures and  dark velvet banquet seating.  Great food and old school attentive service.  My sweetheart treated me to a splendorous dinner with my best friend.  We dined on fresh burrata with tomatoes appetizer.  This is my favourite and not easily available in other restaurants.  For mains, I enjoyed the lamb, my honey had the beef medallion and my bestie had the shrimp gamberoni pasta.  Italian food perfectly executed in a sexy atmosphere.  This my go to for meals when I want to show off great food and service.  I want to come back and try other items on the menu.  Full of character and carisma!  How apropos!"}
{"text":"It is a very nice restaurant , service is great and server talks clearly . We enjoyed our first dining experience at Carisma.  Food quality excellent - prices cost the freshness and service.  I'd recommend this italian cuisine if you look for a decent dinning experience, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The starter salad was delicious and I appreciated them splitting the dish when we said we'd be sharing it. But the main dish ravioli was such a disappointment. It had so little veal inside the ravioli I could hardly taste the meat. All I could taste was the flour that was way too hardened. The pistachio was a nice touch but the overall dish was just drenched in oil. The server was very nice and made up for the not so good experience I had with the food. Their drinks are also pretty watered down."}
{"text":"omg omg omg, the food here is quite mind blowing. the mushroom soup is just out of this world you can't taste event piece of of mushroom that they grinded to put in the soup. the beef carpacio is sliced so thin that there are holes in the meat, and the dressing brings out the flavour of the meat nicely. we had the swordfish fillet and the cuttlefish risotto, both excellent. overall a great experience highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I had never heard of this place before, but I'm just looking for any excuse to go again! The staff was so kind and very knowledgable about the menu. Their wine list was extensive and waiters had a recommendation for each meal!  The gnocci quatro fromaggio is to DIE for. I could not stop picking it off my friend's plate. My mea; had lobster but the waiter replaced it with prawns (a very generous amount) at no extra cost. The cheese in the insalata di buffala is so creamy and delicious, you'll be sad when the meal is finished!  Absolutely one of the best restaurants I have ever come across in Toronto. Absolutely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wanted desperately to get off the depressing cold, wet street last night and stumbled into Carisma on King.  Elegantly decorated in rich, dark colours, low lighting, upscale furniture and an intimate ambiance, this place is great to bring a date to.    The menu is contemporary Italian, with it's decent selection of anitpasti's, pastas and mains.  If I ever see beef carpaccio on the menu I have to get it as a base of comparison.  For mains we got the pappardelle with wild boar ragu, and the butternut squash and veal stuffed ravioli(?) with pistachios and truffle oil.    Carpaccio was beautifully pink, super vibrant colouring, with a fresh taste to boot.  Pastas were good not great, nothing to really complain about, but nothing to rave about either.  I'd say the stuffed Veal pasta was better than my pappardelle as it had more depth of flavours and textures.  The pistachios were a fun inclusion.  For dessert we split the apple strudel with pear compote and vanilla ice cream.  The pastry itself wasn't hot enough and thus not flaky enough to  cut up with my fork - it felt like I had to fight with it in order to break off a piece.  Meanwhile the ice cream was still very frozen and rock solid.   The service was very friendly and polite albeit a little smothering.  Our waiter would come by every 3 minutes to ask us something and thank us profusely when we accepted his offer to refill our water glasses.  $100 for two, an app, a cocktail, two mains, cappacino and dessert.  Pretty reasonable.  To be fair, I would like to give Carisma 3.5 stars, as it was a pleasant dining experience. I just can't see myself wanting to go back."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to experience Casima. Just returning from Tuscany my expectations were very high.  I decided to take my Italian clients. The wine selection was absolutely lovely and the dishes were very well thought out and tasty. The service was great, which is a big deal for me. Everyone on the staff was lovely. Unlike my experience in Italy, I enjoyed that they were open-minded to the cocktails which I requested at the end without hesitation. Beautiful atmosphere, dark and very intimate. I will return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch. Service was impeccable and the food was topnotch. Great atmosphere. Professional waiter that really knew the menu and was great for recommendations of food and wine. Not as packed as some of the places on the other side of Yonge. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"If you are looking to Celebrate a Birthday Beware!!! We booked Carisma for a large party surprise Birthday Celebration. The reason why I am giving Carisma 2 stars is the servers and atmosphere was nice, bread and starters were ok. Underwhelming but not bad.  Here is the reason for 3 star deduction:   1) We got charged a whopping $48 + Tax for a Cake cutting fee that they never mentioned till the bill came out. Unethical money grab especially considering how much we spent as a group.  2) The Pasta which should be the star and staple of an Italian restaurant was bland and overpriced. I ordered the special 'truffle pasta' (whopping $45) which I was pleasantly told at the time I could do half and half with the Ravioli ($27). Rather than charging me half and half of each, they decided to charge me the full price of the more expensive dish. I've never paid $45 for a plain bland pasta with a couple flakes of truffle... Both pastas were bland to a point that I could still taste the water it was boiled in. Neither had a sauce and pretty much just felt like it was boiled, tossed in some oil with a little bit or Parmesan and some truffle flakes. Not worth the price tag, frankly I could probably do a better job at home for less. Was not very impressed.  3) Customer Service response. At the time we received the bill, they never apologized for the secret cake cutting fee, we didn't want to make a big stink since the birthday girl was there. I tried contacting the place after but no response.   Overall, I've been to much better Italian  restaurants with better flavour (in this case, this place barely had any) and more reasonable price point. If you like bland Pasta, I guess this is the place for you. Otherwise if you're looking for a restaurant that really elevates the flavour in a dish like me, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Finally made reservations to this adorable place Saturday night. Pulled up and it's such a cute exterior, however, different than expected on the inside - darker but nice and any place that has a huge bottle of Veuve on display is okay with me!  The service is pretty fantastic here, staff coming out of every corner to help make your experience enjoyable.   We had a Malbec reserve that was delish - a great recommend by our server. I thought the bread that comes out was okay, a little hard and saturate with oil. However, the tuna tartare was nice and the pappardelle was maybe one of the best I've ever had. The sauce was incredible and the noodles cooked perfectly. In fact, it was so good that I really wish I had another serving of it now. :)"}
{"text":"Fortune of fortunes ... happened to spend New Years Eve at this new and wonderful Italian restaurant.  It was through the diligence and on his recommendation of one of our party to have secured  a reservation on the busiest night of the year.  No prix fixe \"NY Eve special\", just the regular menu.   As you walk in from the blustery winter cold, you are immediately struck by Carisma's dark but cozy and sophisticated room. At the same time you are greeted with such warmth by the proprietors the cold and greyness outside quickly dissipate.  Carisma's menu is a solid run through contemporary Italian fare delivered with old world charm.  It being NY Eve, i went ahead and ordered 3 courses. Primi, Secondi and pasta.    Primi comprised of 3 different types of seafood; house cured salmon, salami and a salad of asparagus and baby greens with a side dollop of cherry compote, simple, flavourful and just the ticket to whet the appetite  Secondi - pan seared scallops expertly finished to the correct doneness, carmelized on the outside and warm and tender on the inside.  The chunky mollusks sat on a bed of sauteed mushrooms. Exquisite  My main course was a simple pasta with duck confit; satisfying and just the capper to complete the meal.    Around the table we pretty much had a run through the entire menu and not one dish was a disappointment.    Carisma does a terrific job of offering sophisticated and satisfying Italian cuisine in a very competitive neighbourhood.  I'm betting that the homey charm of the place, the fantastic food and great service are enough to steer customers away from the hustle and bustle of the much larger competition in the area."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a whim, after walking by it during my morning search for a hangover cure. Boy am I glad I did!  I told my date to meet me at the bar top because I wasn't sure I'd want to stay long. He got there before I did. He tells me that when he arrived he said he was meeting someone at the bar top, to which the host replied \"Laura?\" (Pronounced \"lauuu-ra\").   I walked in and saw him sitting, waiting for me at the bar. He looked handsome in his linen blazer and loafers. I immediately rethought my decision not to book a table and asked him if he wanted to move to one instead. He agreed. Thereafter began my journey of culinary delight.   Wine: We decided on a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino. Our server a few minutes later recommending a bottle that he swore we would like better. The man did not lie. We ordered two. He knew his wine.  Antipasti: We initially decided on the caprese salad with mozzarella di buffalo. Our server recommended the burrata cheese. It melted in my mouth. We also ordered the calamari fritti - freschisimo (Translation: super fresh).  Primi- Pasta: we initially decided on the gnocchi, however, our super server recommended the papparedele instead. Praise Jesus I listened to him and not my date. The pappardele was savoury, fresh, and abondante.   Secondi - Lamb: My very needy date was gung-ho about the osso buco. Once again, the server overrode us and instead suggested we try the lamb; a dish he described as the restaurant's specialty. The best part of the lamb was watching my date try to cut it. She dropped her fork - twice. I picked it up - twice. The lamb was good. Not great, but good.   Digestive: my date is originally from the south of Italy and has searched for a particular digestif drink in various bars and restaurants in the city - one that reminds her of her youth growing up in the country, bushy tailed, bright eyed, and in love. She asked the sever if they carried this rare traditional drink. The server said yes. She was skeptical. She explained to me that many have promised her this drink in Toronto - only to let her down. And in that moment - super server arrived brandishing an ice cold bottle of : Vecchio amaro del Capo.  Be still my heart. 10/10"}
{"text":"Lovely place. The food was really tasty. I ordered the Carpaccio and the Risotto. Really good Italian food. Their pear Martini is to die for.  Nice decor, cosy, comfortable chairs. Nice and friendly staff.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the dessert menu. No real Italian desserts. I order the biscottis with a Capuccino."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 5 for five reasons,   1. Customer service top notch 2. Food is amazing (seafood salad) 3. Best hair dresser in town works next door so it's a nice place to have a glass of wine after 4. The decor is soothing and classy 5. The waiters give you there all."}
{"text":"3 stars  We started our evening being seated at the back.  There were 11 of us and quite honestly I felt squished and it was really cramped. We ordered the grilled calamari to start which IMO was not with $17.  The server was great as she split the dish in two for me and my wife to share.  It was a bit burnt.  The olives and tomato was a nice addition to the appetizer.  We had the Pappardelle Al Cinghial and the Risotto Ai Porcini.  The Pappardelle was alright and the sauce was made with wild boar meat... We would know from the taste.  The Risotto was okay... Wished there were more mushrooms though.  For dessert we had their lychee creme brulee which was okay.  Service - It was alright, but would have been nice if we weren't seated in a cramped place.  Service would have been better if we weren't asked to pass the utensils down the table.  Food - Bleh.  Not worth the price"}
{"text":"We were here for a rehearsal wedding party. The menu was set. Appetizers were fantastic. Prosciutto wrapped around arugula. Buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes. Calamari and a grilled shrimp. Everything tasted great. Service was excellent! Boyfriend and I had the beef tenderloin. It was excellent. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"A Chanel suit-clad solo diner with quality leather planner & multiple Apple products. Jr. Associates celebrating with an extended lunch and their second bottle of wine. A debrief meeting between two guys, one from the \"Montreal hub.\" Our weekday lunch provided insight into the corporate world of Torontonians, apparently the usual clientele at stylish Carisma. I like eating with the natives, even if I don't blend in.   Foods:  - rosemary olive oil bread: served warm, crunchy bite outside, soft bready inside  - their special caprese w/ burrata: every ingredient was quality, ripe tomatoes, amazing EVOO - galletto con funghi: I wasn't in the mood to partake in their mouthwatering list of pasta dishes, so I opted for chicken breast with a concentrated mushroom jus & nice root veggies."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant twice in the past week and enjoyed it both times.   First visit was also my first time hearing about this restaurant, from a coworker. I ordered their spaghettini with tiger shrimps and I thought it was one of the best pastas I've ever had. I just went to Italy last month but I did like the pasta here more.   The second time, I tried their casarecci with wild mushrooms. This was made with a creamier sauce and I couldn't finish the entire dish - although it was also pretty good. I would recommend this dish if you prefer something heavier, as opposed to the lighter tomato sauce for the spaghettini."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto. Great food, service and ambiance. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"SERVICE: I booked reservations a week in advance for 2 on a Friday evening. Arrived and got seated right away with a window at the front. I requested for a table near the window for natural lighting for pictures and they granted the request which was nice considering it was a table for 4. The server was friendly/funny and honest with his suggestions and opinions of menu items. He insisted on some must-tries and we went with his suggestions. He was very friendly but perhaps slightly long-winded as we waited for about 20 minutes for our bill to come because he was chatting with the table beside us.  FOOD: Very delicious and the presentation was nice. The portions were generous and was filling for 2. We shared the appetizers and it was nice that the kitchen offered to split up the appetizers on 2 separate plates.   Carpaccio di manzo - The Carpaccio was sooo good. The beef along with the arugula and shaved parmigano reggiano and truffle dressing was super flavorful!  Insalata di bufala - Had this with bread and it paired very nice together.  Pappardelle al cinghiale - served with tomato sauce and wild boar ragu. It was my first time having papparadelle and I liked the consistency of the pasta! Really delicious overall  Truffle Pasta - My FAVOURITE dish of the night. This was highly recommended by our server. We ordered the appetizer portion but surprisingly was the same size as the main menu size of the pappardelle. The truffle oil was just the right amount and worked nicely with the sauce. Overall, very light tasting and delicious!  Nutella Creme Bruellee - Nutella was the flavour of the night, overall the Creme Bruelee was sweet but good. The Nutella created a unique flavour and was the cherry on top of a delicious meal.   AMBIENCE: The outside of the restaurant was plain and might be easy to miss, but it's very nice inside. It's perfect for a date night or dinner with a few friends. It has dim lighting inside but overall a romantic environment.  I would say this is one of the best Italian restaurants in downtown Toronto, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"THE greatest lamb chops I've ever had. The place is a little tight for space but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"We came here with my boyfriend for our 1 year. The server was very nice and attentive. complimentary charity bread is offered, it is really tasty and wonderful f you're hungry! I ordered the Paccheri pasta. The pasta was really fresh and cooked al dente perfectly. The ricotta and the peas fit perfectly together and was a delight to my tastebuds. My boyfriend ordered the Spaghettini ai gamberi and apparently it was delicious. My only regret would be that his place doesn't offer enough vegetarian options, which is why I rated it a 4/5.  But i would definitely recommend this place for a date night!!"}
{"text":"The pasta is here amazing, cute and cozy downtown spot with very nice and friendly servers! Listen to the special it's the day, they are better than what's on the menu (also more expensive) The pasta is my go to, they are perfectly cooked al dente.  Another bonus is that there's a parking lot right beside it!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is a must when in Toronto. Family owned and probably some of the best pasta I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian restaurant. For a place in the heart of financial district, it feels much more intimate and the food much less mass produced. The pasta tastes fresh made and the fish perfectly seared. Their desserts will also not disappoint."}
{"text":"Dark intimate Italian restaurant located just steps away from the Omni King Hotel. We decided to give this place a try on our last night in Toronto. We made a reservation ahead of time and asked to be seated next to the window. However upon coming in to an empty restaurant with only one couple next to the window table we decided to sit elsewhere so we weren't on top of them. Now for the food I couldn't decide between the filet and the lamb chops so I asked if the chef could accommodate a mixed meat entree. He happily obliged however the meat was a bit too tough but the lamb chop was delicious. Next time I would just order the lamb chops. We also tried the sea bass and parpadelle pasta which were a bit salty but nonetheless still tasty. The complimentary rosemary bread is not to be missed. Be careful going downstairs to the bathrooms. The steps are shorter than normal and my daughter almost ate it! We enjoyed our quiet dinner here the service was very attentive. Great spot for date night or a special celebration."}
{"text":"This place places their tables so close to each other so there isn't a lot of moving room. After we ordered our food I think they forgot to start us off with breads. When our food arrived then they gave us breads. I didn't even have the chance to try their breads since I was already so full after the main course. The service was decent, but I felt really pressure and they weren't really patient. The place is also really dark, it makes it really hard to see and eat our food.   FYI: THEY DO NOT DO SEPARATE BILLS"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic dinner at Carisma.   We started our dinner in OUR traditional way with lemon martinis and Espresso.   With a first course of Insalata di Bufala.   For dinner we had the Ricotta Gnocchi and the Raviolini alla salvia. We split both and they came from the kitchen looking elegant and delicious.  And the WERE delicious.   The ricotta gnocchi is tender and melts in your mouth as it should. The sauce is decadent without being over-bearing. It's accompanied by what I like to call a tiny cheese crisp bowl, carrying inside of it a tiny fresh sprig salad.   The raviolini alla salvia was eye roll inducing. Causing one to want to repeat each bite forever and ever. Or perhaps to have a 3 gallon bucket of said raviolini to take home with them. The pasta was fresh and the filling was fine. The oil coated them well without dripping over everything. It was great. It was great great.   We also shared one of the nights specials which was a veal medallion with fresh sautéed vegetables.    For dessert we had the molten chocolate and the pear strudel.  While the chocolate was good, for me, the Pear Strudel was a shining star. Warm golden peaches with a light seasoning and flaky soft crust, with a egg of vanilla bean ice cream set atop to melt its way down.   Everything was presented beautifully, cooked to perfection, scrumptious from first to last bite.   It's a fine dining establishment but they also have welcoming arms and good attitudes, so if you left your suits at home, a sweater or button down shirt will do. They'll be pleased to see you regardless of attire.   ALL of the servers and attendants are great. No one breaks a sweat or loses their cool and they're chomping at the bit to make you meal perfect."}
{"text":"Very dark and noisy but a charming ambiance none the less.  The service was excellent, the food was less than stellar.  When you charge $51.00 for a veal chop, you expect more than a small veal chop, mashed potatoes and what I think was rapini (it was very burnt so difficult to determine). We expected exceptional and experienced mediocre food. Wonderful wine selection, but the food did not stand out."}
{"text":"Presented to me as an amazing home cooked Italian place, i was greatly dispointed by the food- definitively not an Italian chef in the kitchen! Truffle pasta with very little truffle but mostly truffle oil and over cooked pasta which is a big problem for Pasta lovers !! Mushroom salad with goat cheese with a tiny piece of cheese it was almost a joke and the whole was not even good; veal way too oily. Don't go there for gastronomic experience. However service is excellent and crowd is good"}
{"text":"Most amazing Italian place I was lucky enough to find! Just such Excellent food. Yum!! This is where I fell in love with Osso Buco"}
{"text":"High end prices, high end service, high end food. You really do get what you pay for here. We really enjoyed our anniversary dinner here. Tip: if you care where you are seated, dress nicely. We noted that the more casually dressed were seated to the rear of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really craving Italian food after a long day of being a tourist in Toronto. My friend and i quickly stumbled upon Carisma and thought we should try it out. I loved everything about the experience. We arrived a few minutes early so we sat at the lovely bar and ordered a glass of white wine. We were then promptly escorted to our seats just a few minutes later.  The hostess and waiters were extremely nice and the atmosphere has a good romantic vibe because it's dimly lit. Carisma has such a great wine selection of reds and whites you really can't go wrong. The staff is also very knowledgable about it as well. I started off with the antipasti scallops which were beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I wish I had more I ate it so quickly. My friend had the carpaccio which was equally as delicious. You should really order them both!  I then had the raviolini as my primi. The ravioli paired with the white wine was delicious. My friend had the lobster ravioli which I kind of wish I got because it was so good. Both the dishes were great though! The next dish I ordered was the chicken. It was a good chicken but I wish I ordered something else. My friend ordered the beef which was amazing. For dessert we shared a creme brulee which is a must! Overall, I would come back here. The staff treats you like family!"}
{"text":"Two and a half. This may be the noisiest room in the city, the loud, intrusive waiters adding to the din. The food came quickly and the apps were good, notably the beet salad. But my main was insipid, veal rather thick and tasteless. Wine prices were vy high, and $7 for bottled water is criminal. In all, this meal didnt work for the four of us, and I wont pay $300 to be deafened again."}
{"text":"Lovely spot for delish home style Italian cooking. The kitchen is super accommodating in personalizing your likes and dislikes. Great mom & pop eclectic space!"}
{"text":"One of the top restaurants in TO. We had lamb chop, beef tenderloin, gnocchi, Carisma salad and all were fantastic. The wine they recommended to us was fabulous (check out the pic). All comes with true Italian service and experience. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Dined at Carisma on multiple occasions and it has quickly become one of my go -tos! Service is top notch, the bread they serve as a starter is delicious, and the burrata (homemade mozzarella) is to die for!! For pasta, I enjoy the spaghetti with black tiger shrimps in brandy tomato cream sauce and tagliatelle in butter and truffle sauce."}
{"text":"Was in town for my wife's bday and decided to give this place a try.   Food was great and staff were very attentive, we had the special as an app so we could give a try since it had truffles and we were not disappointed.   Will def return next time we're in Torontooooo!"}
{"text":"I came here for an early weekday dinner with a couple of old high school friends for one of our monthly get togethers.  The place was pretty deserted when we arrived (around 6:00 pm) and we were seated promptly.  On the whole, we enjoyed our selections but weren't blown away (especially given the high expectations set by earlier reviewers).  I had hoped to introduce my friends a new Italian spot that would impress them, but while they enjoyed the meal, I didn't think they were rushing to come back.  The service was okay, but again not at the level we would've expected for such a fine establishment.  While we were there the restaurant started to fill up and I did find myself thinking that it is a charming atmosphere, and saw a wealthy presumably Rosedale family fill up one of the round tables.  And I did think it would be a nice place to host a larger group at that table.  I might be open to giving this place another chance, but my first experience was good not great."}
{"text":"I was taken here for my belated birthday dinner..read some nice reviews on Yelp so decided to give this place a try. I personally think I was more impressed with the service than the food. The service was excellent, we were looked after to the T...checked up upon within reasonable time frames, poured our wine as soon as we were almost done to the last sip...so the service I would give 5/5...the complimentary bread was amazingly delicious...with rosemary, olive oil and salt...we kept on asking for more bread..omgoodness, we don't usually do this...  The food was nicely plated and presented but the flavours were more like a 3.5/5 at least for most items we all tried. We ended up opening 2 bottles of wine that night, we ordered the scallop, tuna tartar (this was the best dish) with the taro chips, grilled calamari..  When I checked the menu online, I was a bit surprised they had Osso Bucco becuz that is not a dish you see at most Italian places so we decided to give that a try, the veal was tender but the taste didn't hit the notes for me...  We ended up ordering 2 pasta(s), we overhead the truffle pasta was suppose to be delish so we tried a small portion of it. Yes it was good but it was also pricey when we legitimately had one strand of spaghetti each...LOL...  All in all, I think this place has impeccable service with a slight bit above average for the food. Hence, I gave this a 4/5...mostly was for the service..they deserve to be credited..  I'm not in a huge rush to come back due to the pricing for Italian food. I still have other places to try..."}
{"text":"We showed up at 4:15 for our 5:00 reservation, weary from a day of walking the city and, although they weren't open for dinner until 4:30-5:00, they sat us and asked for our patience as they finished prepping for the dinner crowd. Within minutes they asked for a beverage order and as soon as they were ready (before 4:30) they brought us menus. From the hostess and bar staff to the waiter and bus staff, everyone was courteous, gracious and attentive.  Cocktails were excellent and the wine list was extensive. The homemade bread served drizzled with olive oil, sea salt and Rosemary was excellent and they willingly brought out more. The salads were large and fresh (we had a beet salad special, the fresh mozzarella/Caprese, and house salads).  The food was excellent and the portion size was enough to satisfy! The men in our party had the pappardelle with wild boar sauce, I had the fish of the day and another friend had the gnocchi Gorgonzola. We couldn't have been happier with our choices.  The dessert selection sounded wonderful, but we had more than enough and couldn't have another bite!  On top of all this, the prices were reasonable and all well worth it!   Not only would I highly recommend it, but we will certainly be back on future trips to Toronto!"}
{"text":"service was excellent very attentive, food amazing, the lamb chop , best i had.. will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.  If u like well made, delicious, freshly prepared food you have found the place.  Great staff and wonderful cook. Dont miss this gem."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Carisma for dinner. The atmosphere is dim and candlelit - great for date nights! Service was excellent. Our server was very entertaining and checked on us at good intervals. He was great at answering the questions we had about the menu items (translating some words for us in Italian haha).  * BREAD It was complimentary bread but I felt like I should write a note about it.. It's yummy!! I love how sizzling hot it was - the olive oil + salt was a great combo for dressing.  * TAGIATELLE IN BUTTER AND TRUFFLE SAUCE (4/5) I loved this pasta! It was one of the pastas of the day, which was recommended by our server. Loved the truffle sauce. I've always been a fan on truffle-anything so I am picky when it comes to this! The sauce was creamy and flavourful, the cream does not overpower the truffle flavour. I'd recommend you order this if they make it available for the day :)  * BRANZINO (3/5) (Mediterranean Sea Bass, Grilled with olive oil and lemon) This was ok - I felt like the lemon sauce was too much. The fish tasted sour-y because there was too much lemon juice drenched over it. It would be much better if the lemon juice was toned down a bit!  * OSSO BUCO ALLA MILANESE (2.5/5) (Veal Osso Bucco, Saffron Risotto, Herbed Gremolata) This was too bland for my liking. The risotto was watery due to the sauce from the veal. The veal didn't have much taste to it - not sure if this was marinated. I wouldn't recommend this dish.  Overall, I'd recommend ordering the pastas at Carisma."}
{"text":"I have worked a couple of blocks away from Carisma and couldn't believe I had never been here before.  The ambiance inside is very classy.  Nice plush, velvet seats and sparkling chandeliers.    I was  hear for a ladies night and we spent probably 2-3 hours there.  We started with an antipasto plate.  Instead of providing us with one big plate to pick at, they individually plate the antipasto.  There was a warm mushroom salad, arugula wrapped prosciutto, grilled squid, shrimp and some mozzarella and tomato.  Delicious and freshly prepared.  Not a huge fan of the salad and squid, but that was just personal preference, so I traded with my friend.  I really wanted to try to Oso Bucco but when the waiter told us about the specials and I wanted pretty much every one, I decided to try a special and come back for the Oso Bucco.  When we were told about the specials, we were told about all of the fresh delicious ingredients, many of them being flown in right from Italy.  I opted for the veal t-bone.  I wanted it cooked medium rare.  Unfortunately part of it was medium rare, but most was rare.  To be honest, I wish I got the other special I was eyeing...the truffle butter pasta.  Most of my party ordered that for their main, so I got to try it.  It was so tasty and just melted in your mouth.    For dessert I had the tiramisu.  That was their special that night.  It tasted so authentic and homemade.    It was such a delicious meal I cannot wait to go back.  It really brought me back to Italy (where we had all been for our friend's wedding only months before)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love, love, love this place... The food is impecable - you must try the Spagettini Al Gamberi. The staff is professional but super friendly. The atmosphere is luxurious and very chick but somehow it makes me feel cosy and homey!  Strongly recommend it to all the love birds out there if you want to try a nice restaurant when you go out on your next date."}
{"text":"I was at Carisma tonight and while the food was good, I had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in Toronto. Our server, Amadeo, was rude from the moment we were there. He kept talking over us and interrupting our conversations very loudly (without excusing himself) and would quickly grab our plates without even asking if we were finished. At the end when we were paying our bills, he literally stuck the machine so close to my face that the light shocked my eyes. If you ever get him as a server, I would suggest you ask for another server. This server should not be in customer service."}
{"text":"Top notch. From the moment we entered and greeted by the owner, Monica, it was a special night and I was there with my 11 and 12 year old.  Service was excellent - attentive and informative.  We each had an antipasti sampler which came with a serving of each of four. It's unusual that I would like all four things on a plate but in this case I loved them.  We all ordered different pastas - some of us getting split orders so we could sample more of the dishes.  All were perfection.  Desserts were great.  Great ambience as well - I imagine it would be great for a date or business dinner or out with friends.  Monica came by several times to chat and ensure that we were being taken care of. She's so nice and friendly and you truly feel like you're a welcomed guest in her home. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice food. Our server was a little over the top. We had a scallop appetizer with spinach and it was very flavorful. My partner had a nice pasta dish. They make the pasta here and it was perfect. I had a a bone in veal dish that was very tender. We were so full that we couldn't do the desert menu."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to come over here for lunch. This place is very close to the office I have been going to in Toronto. I went for lunch and it was surprised with the amount of people actually dining in there. The place is chic, you are welcomed by truly italian employees where you literally begin your trip to Italy without leaving Toronto.  Everything is fantastic beginning with the super fresh bread with olive oil and a hint of salt. I had the gnocchi quattro formaggi and it was absolutely fantastic! The gnocchi is so fresh and tasty that it melts on your mouth! For dessert I had the chocolate lava cake and it was excellent as well.  The service and food couldn't be better, hence that's the reason for the certificate of excellence and happy customers! And I am going back there again for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Recently I visited Toronto for a conference.  Looking for a restaurant away from the Downtown neighborhood, the reviews on Yelp directed me to try Carisma.  I was not disappointed!  I arrived without reservations, and even though the tables were mostly full, I was immediately seated at a 4 person table.  It starts things off nicely when a person is welcomed like that.  The menu is a traditional \"north American\" Italian offering, i.e. pastas, fish, veal, etc.    I started with a bean soup, which was excellent.  Over the years I've noticed that restaurants that take the time to make noteworthy dishes for often overlooked parts of menus like soups and salads can be expected to really deliver on the main meal.  If the kitchen is paying attention to those prelim details, that is a key indicator that the kitchen is striving for excellent across the board.  And that proved true for Carisma.  My main dish was a simple veal scallopini lemon white wine sauce, with a side of pasta aglio e olio, and both were delicious.   The food menu was complimented by a respectable wine list.  The table service was attentive and warm.  All in all a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food. Don't expect large portions but you will be satisfied. The taste is nothing less than amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I spent Valentine's here and it was perfect. Our table was ready for our reservation time, the service was quick and attentive, and the food was truly delicious. We got:  -2 glass house red wine -Strigoli: Spicy Sausage, Ricotta Salata, Tomato Sauce -Galletto al mattone: Grain Fed Half Chicken, Caramelized Cipollini Onion, Balsamic Pan Jus  The chicken was SO good. I normally don't order chicken at restaurants because I cook it so much at home, but I was really glad I ordered this. i ate it all, even though I wasn't super hungry--I just couldn't let any go to waste. The wine was good, nothing too fancy but tasted great.   It's a small restaurant with a cozy atmosphere. I would recommend this place for a romantic dinner, or a small dinner with friends for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night for a birthday party, a total of 15 people. Walking in, it's hard not to admire the decor and how beautifully romantic the whole place felt. It was packed at 7pm so I would recommend calling ahead for a reso for sure! We had a few servers serving our large group and they made us feel so welcomed. Definitely some of the best service and customer care I've had compared to other five star restaurants. Our drinks were filled and plates/cutlery cleared in a timely and professional manor. The servers even took the time to whip away any food/liquid that would be on the table between courses, how amazing.    Now onto the food, we started with the antipasto plate (Salad, prosciutto, grilled calamari, tomato with mozzarella and bread) which was shared throughout our table, everything was delicious. For the main I ordered the Raviolini alla salvia which was filled with veal in a brown butter and sage sauce with white truffle oil. The pasta was cooked to perfection and I appreciate how the truffle oil did not over power anything! Perfect execution, although I did notice they used a lot of oil/butter but not bad enough to deduct a star. For dessert, we had the molten chocolate cake as well as the creme brule. so delectable! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars ..... Came here for dinner tonight ....  ordered scallops, tuna tar tar, lobster scialltielli, wild boar ragu, branzino   Scallops were seared to perfection, tuna tar tar was also really good. Wild boar ragu I highly recommend, the sauce was light and the noodles thinly made. The lobster scialtielli on the other hand were too thick, luckily I only order the appetizer portion. Branzino was over grilled with a burnted taste. Very disappointed, should have send it back for them to make us another one.  Service over all was okay. Place had no music, very dark and kinda small as well"}
{"text":"Came here for a veterinary conference and the company set us up with dinner at Carisma. Our waiters chose beautiful white and red pairings for the antipasti, and main entrées. I wish I would've asked what kind of Cabernet we were drinking! It was exquisite! And my glass was always full!  I had The Veal special and it was the tastiest piece of baby animal I've ever tasted LOL it came with seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes.   Def an Italian restaurant i'll recommend and return to the next time i'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"incredible service - the starters we shared were split and served as two courses.  small details but really big difference.  classic italian food that was spot on.  Burratta special is a must have if its in.  only thing was decor needs to be a little brighter and fresher to match the food"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's up there in my top three places I've eaten in the city and I was born and raised here. Everything is great! ESPECIALLY the service! Some of the best staff I've ever interacted with...super friendly and very knowledgable. They let u change or swap out pretty much anything...the customer really gets priority here over anything. Then, there's the food. Best Italian I've had in the city...better than sotto sotto. On par with Il Mulino and Carbone in NYC, but at a better price and in a really nice dark atmosphere. Everything we ate was amazing (carpaccio to start, gnocchi, farfarelli, and TRY THE TRUFFLE PASTA if it's in season). Really awesome experience"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and wonderful food. A definite go to in Toronto. There was never a moment that the staff weren't taking care of us but we never felt overwhelmed with this. Water always full check immediately each course on time and without real waiting."}
{"text":"One of the best 2 italian places in Toronto (see my other reviews for the other one). I happen to be here with my wife who traveled for the weekend and I cannot say anything but good things about this restaurant. From the services, to the desserts, it is the best italian experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went for business dinner and had a very nice time.  Service was excellent.  Inviting and friendly they accommodated some special requests quickly and with no fuss.  Even as restaurant filled up they continued to be attentive and we never felt rushed or wanting.  Had veal with mushroom sauce and caprese salad to start.    Everything nicely seasoned and well prepared.  Plating was clean and highlighted the food.  Definitely someplace I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Excellent and delicious! Good for date night, dinner with friends, business meetings, etc.  Service was great.  Our waiter was always smiling and wanting to please.  I agree with all the reviews-  they want to please their patrons so you can get anything on the menu prepared the way you like it.  Food was delicious - we had ordered everything from pasta, fish, and steak and everyone loved their meal. Its a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian cuisine places! The atmosphere is amazing and the server is really helpful. My partner and I went there for our one year anniversary. I have to say it's a perfect dating place with the flowers on the wall and the dim candle light. We had the seared scallop as the starter. Scallop cooked to perfection, the mushroom and spinach underneath are also sautéed and seasoned very well. Everything is nice, just a little bit oily. I had the meat of the day which is a mixed grill meat plate with New Zealand lamb rack and beef tenderloin. Super tasty, perfect medium rare. The mash potato is very tasty as well. I enjoyed every bite of it. My partner has the veal chop. It's the best veal chop I ever had! It's really tender and juicy, also cooked to perfect medium rare.  Even though it's a rather pricey place. But I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This was a very good meal, and I think the service was the best part (along with the scallops and the bread!). Unfortunately, the pasta I ordered was not the best, but the lychee martinis made up for it. A nice, trendy place to have some Italian fare!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in, we were treated with unbelievable kindness. The food was out of this world. The service is impeccable. Do NOT miss the opportunity!"}
{"text":"An excellent meal, a great location (close to the financial district) and really good service. Some would characterize Carisma a bit upscale so you should expect to bill to match...   Plus they had a pretty good wine selection. I would definitely go back, the menu has quite a lot to offer.  This is what we ordered, I'd recommend them all (especially the lamb chops):  Tuna tartare - Finely Chopped Tuna, Avocado, Pineapple, Savory Taro Chips Agnello del contadino - Herbed Crusted Lamb Chop, Goat Cheese, Rosemary Jus Raviolini alla salvia - Stuffed Veal Raviolini, Sicilian Pistachio, Sage, Brown Butter, White Truffle Oil"}
{"text":"Where do I start?!! This place is classy the ambiance is great and the food is fantastic! The staff was professional and very knowledgeable. Our food was sooo delicious! Presentation was excellent! We order the Veal Chop and Lamb Chops both were excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service. The food. The ambience! At dinner, I had the veal and it was delicious and oh so tender! At lunch, I had the minestrone soup and salad with tomato and buffalo mozzarella. Absolutely elegant and delicious! The comp bread is worth the visit. I think the servers are my favourite thing about this place... Think older Italian playboy!"}
{"text":"OK OK OKKKK if you like truffle go here. They have a bomb truffle pasta and an amazing wine selection! I also got the lamb chops which were delish. The veal was sold out when I went unfortunately! Really great staff.  Two cons:   hard to find parking (because of the new laws on king the little parking next to them is always full!)   I got an espresso and it didn't come with a biscotti. Super small I know but I couldn't help feeling a lil biscotti with my espresso would've been the perfect touch to my meal."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate here and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  Her sea bass was spectacular and my veal lemon was an interesting take on piccata.  What really pushes Charisma over the top was the service. Our server was extremely attentive without being \"in our face\".  Started up a chat with the owner and her daughter after and they gave us some nice tips for our Toronto trip.  All told, an excellent Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Very underrated at 31/2 stars. The food, highly personal service and decor keep me coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Choose carisma out of a list of higher end restaurants for an important work dinner and have to say overall it did not disappoint.   The restaurant oozes cuteness and romance. The lights are dimmed just right and the decors are classy yet cozy... I would say it's more suitable for an intimate date with the honey than work function, but the party seemed to like it a lot.   I got the seared scallops for appetiser, veal ravioli for main and the molten chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was delicious. Would I say the dishes were memorable though? I think there are other restaurants like terroni that may do it better. But if you want classic, no nonsense Italian food, this is your place!  Would love to bring a date here. It's one of those places you turn to when you want to impress.   WYWH"}
{"text":"Carisma was beyond delicious! The customer service was amazing and the food was even better. We started with the complimentary bread seasoned with rosemary, olive oil, and salt. It was amazing! I ate a piece before I could even snap a picture. We ordered the grilled calamari as an app. It was seasoned simply and well. You could taste the charred, grilled flavor. It was served with tomatoes, olives, etc. 5 stars for that alone.   For entrees my friend got the daily special of halibut served with an avocado salsa she tasted tasted amazing. I got the rack of lamb cooked medium. The seasoning was perfection and the lamb was cooked perfectly. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I cleaned my plate. Our server and the other servers helping him were hilarious. They were the nicest gentleman ever and really great at their job! Our Carisma experience was outstanding. I highly recommend dining here!"}
{"text":"This is what you can expect from a authentic Italian restaurant (5 Stars !)   Been there Friday July 15 2016. Everything was perfect, hostess, servers, sommelier, ambiance etc.  I highly recommend this place.  R. Galarneau from Montreal Canada."}
{"text":"Word of warning--if you make your reservation with Open Table online, call after its confirmed and see if you can get a table up near the front (table 17); don't let them give you table 1 or 2. They stick tourists there and they are right next to the kitchen and bathroom and are very loud. Kind of ruins the ambiance and devalues your expensive meal, especially when there are several empty tables up front an hour later as you're leaving. That aside, our server was excellent, the food was delicious and the pacing good. It was just impossible to carry on a conversation during the last half of our meal because of the loud noise level. It was quiet and peaceful in the front. Wouldn't come back based on this--there are other places with great food and better seating."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Very friendly.   This is a charming little eatery with a true feel of Italy."}
{"text":"Great restaurant ! The food was great and everything was very fresh. Celebrated our 3 year anniversary and it was a great experience. Will go back again when visiting Toronto"}
{"text":"Really nice place with great service and good food.  My wife and I decided to check this place out on a Monday evening. Usually I wold have expected it to be quite empty but was pleasantly surprised by how full it was. The server was nice enough to offer the appetizer sized gnocchi when I couldn't decide on my main course as I was torn between gnocchi and the Osso Buco. I must admit the gnocchi was perfect and melted in my mouth. It was better than I have had in a very long time. I would say I couldn't find such good gnocchi even when I visited Italy. The Osso Buco was amazing tender and great tasting.  For dessert I highly recommend the Nutella Creme Brûlée. Now I am not a chocolate lover by any means but have to admit this was one dessert worth ordering.  Definitely a place I could recommend to friends looking a place to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came as a party of 4, and were all pretty disappointed. The food was ok - we expected more at that price point - but the worst part was the service. The waiter was condescending when we asked about the more expensive wines. My steak, which I ordered medium rare, came well-done. To their credit, they did apologize and re-make the steak, but by the time it came back out, everyone else was finished with their mains and it made my dinner quite awkward. I wasn't wowed by my experience and am unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a work lunch but I recommend going for a dinner date cuz this place was so beautiful and romantic. Definitely a date spot! The food was very good Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden little secret! It is definitely one of the best restaurants in the area. What makes this restaurant so special is not only the delicious food and intimate decor but also amazing service! We were served by an older gentleman with an Italian accent and he provided us with the best experience! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"I called the restaurant to see what options they had for plant based customers and the person (owner) who picked up the phone, without hesitation asked us to just come over and said that they would accommodate us. This was the first good sign - a warm welcome. We went to the restaurant to find a wonderful ambience and even more exceptional service. They were so flexible with our plant based restrictions and offered us options. I am from the restaurant industry and found that their pasta was simply delicious and their wine selection, divine ! Overall, if you want a great Italian dining experience, this is the place to go to!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday and had a good experience. The food was amazing and liked the dimly lit atmosphere. Staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Great Italian.  I had the pasta special...pasta with shaved truffles and truffle oil.  So good.  Portions are right-sized.   Great atmosphere.  Oh...and the bread is awesome."}
{"text":"I came across Carisma while searching for restaurants to grab a bite after the Autoshow and to celebrate a belated Valentine's with my bf. After narrowing it down between Scaddabush, we decided to go with Carisma as the former was a tried and true but we wanted to try something new.   Upon arrival, the white cafe-esque facade tricked me into thinking this was a cutesy bakery turned restaurant. To my surprise when I opened the door was a dark interior, dimly lit with candles on every table. We were quickly greeted by a server who offered to take our jackets before we sat down.   You know that scene in Cinderella when all the birds fly in to help her get ready for the ball? Well this is what it felt like when we sat down, servers were coming from every corner to bring us bread (very good, crispy crust) spread our napkin for us, offer us water and put down our menus.   We ordered insalata di buffalo (8/10, very flavourful), spaghetti with tiger prawns (11/10, would come back just to eat this) and beef tenderloin (8/10, grilled on charcoal, great smoky crust to the steak) and creme brûlée (8/10, very fresh ingredients, not overly sweet).  The food was very good and fresh but what I would say stood out to me was the stellar service and attention to detail the servers had. My bf wasn't exactly dressed for the atmosphere of King St and yet we were not treated in any way different from the other tables. Kudos Carisma! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has possibly the best service in Toronto. The servers are attentive, informative, timely and charming. The food is absolutely delicious! Choices range from typical Italian favourites (caprese salad) made with fresh ingredients and beautifully balanced to more original recipes (duck ravioli) equally fabulous. The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic evening or a night out with friends, suave and cushy."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience throughout.  Decided to take my boyfriend to this place after some research and reading through reviews.  Had high expectations and was really excited to tryout.  Everything tasted overly oily, heavy (for what it is), complicated (not in a good way), and lost the organic or fresh taste.  Scallop appetizer was soaked in a bed of oil that overwhelmed the freshness of the scallops.  My scallop was very sandy, and I did not even get a chance to bring up the issue because no one asked how it was.   Night special Burrata was in a bed of tomato purée with diced tomato that overwhelmed the freshness of the burrata.   My boyfriend had the fish special with was seared cod, he found the garnishing/sauce on top too busy, and covered up the taste of fish.  I ordered the lobster pasta and the pasta was way too over cooked and extremely soggy, it was like Al Dente got trapped in a stream room and finally being released and got no life left.  I had to choose a heavy/bold bottle of wine to get me through the course.   The server commented on my untouched meal and I was able to bring out my reservation for the pasta.  They were nice enough to take that off the bill. I expect the taste of food to be consistent with the price they charge.  With appetizers priced close to $20, I surely was disappointed of the food.  Although I did like my wine, which is the Vermentino Melacce.  Was still going to tip 20% but accidentally hit $20 instead of %.  And didn't find out until going through receipts.  So, sorry for the cheap tip, but I felt more sorry for my boyfriend for a not so good bday dinner, and myself for failing my judgement of restaurant :("}
{"text":"Pasta was amazing. Service is great. Decor was warm and welcoming. Wasn't sure what wine to get so our server recommended the perfect one after asking a couple questions. Prices are a bit high but I would come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service and warning to food allergy sufferers!   I had a terrible experience at this restaurant recently. I mentioned that I had a nut allergy when placing our order and explicitly asked the server if there were any nuts in either of the two dishes we ordered-he confirmed that both were nut-free. Our food came out and the server suddenly said I'd told him I was going to have Dish A (I never mentioned who was going to have which dish since we were planning to share the two dishes). He said he was sure Dish A was nut-free but wasn't sure of Dish B. It was only then he went to check with the kitchen staff that Dish B was also safe.   As well as failing to properly inform the kitchen staff of my allergy, he made no apologies (actually seemed irritated!) and didn't come back once to check in on us after we started our meal.   The food was delicious but I felt very upset and disappointed during our visit."}
{"text":"Tried Carisma back in the winter. Cozy dark restaurant with a romantic vibe! The food was yummy and the service was great! Also love the neighbourhood it's in. Would return in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the service was great and the food was absolutely delicious. The bread was fantastic! This was our favorite restaurant of the trip! I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
