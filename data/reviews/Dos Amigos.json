{"text":"My favourite Mexican restaurant in Ontario. Phenomenal dishes that are flavourful, filling and entertaining (try the Budin Azteca!), as well as the city's best Margaritas. The backyard patio is a quiet oasis off Bathurst, and the waitress, though a bit icy at first, can become your best friend if you play it right. I love this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food prepared fresh by the dos amigos themselves. This place is superb. Caring, interested service and complex, mouth watering food. Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, but the food was of low quality. I felt a bit of a bad taste afterward."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and keep forgetting to write a review on it.  I like this place's decor.  It is warm and eclectic, so if you are on a bad date you can look at it or even use it as a conversation piece.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating to one of my requests.

The food itself was ok.  Not the best I have eaten, but certainly not the worst.  I had the vegetable enchiladas and I admit that I could not identify all of the ingredients inside, but the cheese covered it up and it tasted alright.  My friend has tacos (I think fish tacos).  She liked her meal.  Didn't love it, but liked it.  

Would I go back here again?  Yes.  Most likely if someone invited me.  I really like Mexican food and I haven't found so many good ones in this city.  They key is how your stomach feels later on and mine was perfectly fine!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed everything on the menu every time I went.  Before I became vegetarian, I really liked their chicken with chocolate sauce (a seemingly odd combo, but very tasty).  And their martinis are fantastic."}
{"text":"Burger was very good, beef and bun was outstanding. Onion rings and Sweet PotatoTater Tots were not worth the extra. 
Onion rings where basically like grill scrapings so thin they weren't even rings. Tots seemed to have extra sugar added, almost like sweet potato pie!!! No good with a burger. 
A great place for a burger and fries but stick to the fries."}
{"text":"Great food. Flavors are awesome, not too canadianized. Relaxed atmosphere. Will go back there for sure...."}
{"text":"Being from California originally, it is hard to find a good Mexican place in Toronto.  Sometimes I wonder if the people who review Mexican food in this city have ever had authentic Mexican or have even been remotely close to Mexico for that matter... but that is besides the point, and I know that just makes me sound snarky.

I was very satisfied with this meal.  It was not the Mexican cuisine I'm more familiar with back in California (costal stuff...think Baja and the like) but more inland style. Hearty and satisfying. The portions were more than enough. I got the vegetarian flautas (It is so hard to find a vegetarian flauta! Even in Cali!) and they were delicious.  I ordered the flan for dessert, which was thick, rich and lovely.  I do not think it was made from that instant crap you get in most places (could be wrong, but it was rich and wonderful to the point I wanted to lick the plate, so I doubt it.)

The decor made me feel like I was back in Southern California.  It was very warm and inviting. The service was fine.  

I will definitely be going back.  I didn't get a chance to try any of their margaritas, but they have so many flavors I most certainly will return to have a few when I don't work the next day! ;D"}
{"text":"So bad....

Greasy, served with a salad for some reason. The entire contents was brown, everything...no sign of anything fresh, just brown and runny. Wrapped in wax paper that sticks to the tortilla. I've lived here for 3 years now and I'm constantly amazed at what people will consider good food! 

Come on people, how hard is it to make a fresh burrito!"}
{"text":"I live just around the corner from this place, and Yelp reviews had convinced me to stay away. When some friends were in town and tried it, they raved about it though - so I decided to give it a shot. It was great!

Their Burrito was delightfully spicy with some high quality ingredients. Others in our party had tacos, and everyone walked away satisfied. Great decor too, and a long list of drink options. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The atmosphere was perfect and the food was AMAZING! There are a couple other mexican places along St. Clair Ave West that I usually go to, and Dos Amigo blows them out of the water. We had the cheese dip with mushrooms; the veggie enchiladas; taco salad with shredded chicken; and churros. The food was ALL 10 out of 10- be sure that if you like spicy food you let them know and they'll add peppers etc. 
The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 is because we went on a hot day and the server was a bit pushy on making us eat on the patio outside, when I wanted to sit in the cute, mexican-theme dining room (we ended up coming in anyway when it started to rain). The food was so good though, I will be going back 100%."}
{"text":"Food was really underwhelming. Atmosphere was nice. Lime margarita was good. Churros were delicious!"}
{"text":"I'd actually like to give this place a 3.5 because of the amazing margaritas. A great selection and super delicious. The patio is a hidden little paradise with lovely flowers and greenery. Service was fast and helpful. I found the menu to be uninspiring. It's not that the food wasn't good, but just that it was nothing special and I always find that Mexican food is quite expensive despite containing quite economical ingredients. I would come here again with friends for margs and a bite."}
{"text":"What happened?? I came here years ago with some friends and it was just fantastic. Came here last week and was quite disappointed by the food.

We ordered an appetizer of ceviche tostadas. There was just a bit of fish and a ridiculous amount of pickled onion and whatever else was the veggie in it. Pretty disappointing. 

I ordered the pork enchilada without dairy. It was okay, but nothing special. I've definitely had better in other places. My friend had the fish special and said it was great. 

Service was good and I enjoyed the boozy sangria, but the food was nothing like I remember. Maybe they had a different chef on that night?"}
{"text":"I love this place and have going for years. Great service, Authentic vibes and amazing Mexican food. They also have a great back patio in the summer. A little expensive, but you will not leave without feeling totally satisfied. One of my local favourites! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good value - the food is tasty, the service was friendly and overall I had a positive experience. This place has a nice 'sit down restaurant vibe' without being overly pricey - the food is homey and the hot sauce is delicious! Not my favourite Toronto spot for Mexican food but it was still a great experience. 

This was my first visit. I would come definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Cheap, good food and great atmosphere. It is a nice place to go to for great Mexican food....one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"I find the lack of Mexican restaurants in the city quite sad. Where's a girl gotta go for some fine Mexican? Chipotle? Taco Bell???!

The menu in this restaurant is quite diverse, and interesting. I'm no connoisseur but I like to try as many different things as I can, and Dos Amigos helps, since their descriptions are quite appetizing. (It also helps when you see a dish with fresh salsa, beans and sexy tacos pass you by, and you can request 'what he's having')

This place is usually busy in the evenings, and it's not unusual to wait around for several minutes, unless you have a reservation. The restaurant is dimly lit and tiny, but I never thought that to be remotely problematic. 
Give Dos Amigos a try, they made a 'tres' amiga out of me."}
{"text":"I love Dos Amigos and have been there many times. Especially the fish tacos and the guacamole. The thing that's been souring my experience is that I keep getting the bitter server. Yikes, she acts like I owe her money.  When I ask questions about the menu she lets out a frustrated sigh. She says no to any request,  she's inattentive. Forgets things. She once made a big issue about me ordering a side of salsa. I said I was happy to pay for it. She didn't bring it out, but she did charge me for it. 
If you go, ask for one of the waiters. They go have sparkling personalities and are extremely attentive. And when you go, seriously... The fish tacos are unbelievable."}
{"text":"I should of known better when i walked in and nobody was dining.  But what the hell, you need to work your way through a lot of mediocre restaurants to find the gold out there.

I opted for the 25$ priz fix:

-A single talapia appetizer taco.   Crunchy, tasty tilapia, hopeful for things to come.
- main course, two chicken tortillas, black beans and salad.  The tortillas were soft mushy and uneventful. The beans seemed to be just warmed up in the microwave and doused with cheese, and the salad was bits of lettuce, cucumber, and tomatoes with your basic balsamic vinegar dressing.  

- dessert was a 3 churros.  Nice exterior crisp, but the inside still seemed raw and doughy.

Price was 28$ after tax.   33$ with tip.

Full, but could have gotten a tastier and cheaper meal at the indian roti house on dupont."}
{"text":"In our continuing tour of Mexican eateries in Toronto, my boyfriend and I checked this spot out last weekend.  It was surprisingly empty for a Saturday night, with just two other tables occupied beside ours, but perhaps that's because it was chilly and not really patio weather yet.  

Our server, although initially stand-offish, was actually quite friendly and helpful once she returned to take our order.  As some other Yelpers have mentioned, they have a huge margarita menu as well as a massive selection of tequilas.  We tried 4 different margaritas, all were pretty good.  As for food, although authentic, it's not amazing.  I had the Pozole soup followed by Tacos al Pastor.  Both were good, but not great.

This place is best for a night of drinks with a little snacking, not really for it's food as a primary meal."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner tonight. I left around 9:30 and I am still stuffed -  it is about 2 hours later! My sister selected the restaurant as it catered to nearly every in attendance's eating habits & was chosen to commemorate her birthday.  I had the Asado Vegetariano - A grilled Vegeterian Oatmeal Flank Steak, stuffed vegetable mole enchilada and cheese quesadilla, served with black beans, rice and guacamole. 

Boy, was it delicious. I really enjoyed the vegetarian 'flank steak\". It was a vegetarian option dined out, perfected. Especially at a Mexican place to boot. The mole enchilada was something different. Trying this restaurant for the first time, it is something I am certainly glad I tried because when I return, I'll know to opt out of that and replace it with more of those tasty cheese quesadillas. The mole was good, not to my liking though. Everything else was simply Divine... I loved the classic beans and rice, as well as the guacamole, which was also ordered as an appetizer dish (x2) for the table... there were 6 of us. 

My stomach was too full for dessert, however I did manage to sample some of the cake my sister ordered.. tres leches was it's name. I'm not a fan of cakey desserts, my pleasentry is always ALWAYS chocolate, ALWAYS! SO I, lucky enough had the opportunity to try some of the churros con chocolate. The churros I know are known to be fabulously fattening as well as tender, soft, and flavourful. These ones, I have to say were alright, they were too crunchy and hard on the outside, I think they needed to be removed from the deep-fryer earlier than what they had been... Personally I think it's best if it's shared, as 4 mini churros, deep-fried batter and all is a bit much for one person. It tends to be very acidic.

All in all, I had a wonderful experience here and I will most definitely be back. 

Mauricio Cabrera is extremely personable, charming and friendly. Not to mention easy on the eyes.

Next time I'm trying the ChocoFlan, the dessert I was so looking forward to, yet they ran out of."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love. This is an absolutely delicious little spot, in every sense. 
The restaurant has a fabulous ambiance, created by the gaudy yellow walls, the soft glow of the tealights in the marble candle stands, and the wonderful Spanish music playing softly through the speakers. The cultural artifacts that stand on top of the shelf are exquisite. 

The wait staff is extremely warm, friendly and accommodating.  As a frequent visitor to Sushi restaurants, this is a welcome and surprising change for me! 

I went to the restaurant last Friday, and had an amazing time. (I should mention that I was there with a Mexican friend, and it added to the quality of the experience. He engaged in extensive conversation with the wait staff in Spanish, and for me, the authenticity of the Mexican experience was further embellished.)

They had a Winterlicous deal running, so this was a perfect time to go. 

I had cilantro soup(which was fantastic), Tilapia (very, very good, but could have been spicier), and churros (just as good as any other place). I also had a Mango margarita, which was to die for. My friend had tortilla chips and guac, Pollo Asado (chicken), and Flan. I also tried his regular margarita, and I can vouch for its deliciousness. 

Go here for the margaritas, and the food is pretty good too. The staff and ambiance won it for me."}
{"text":"service is inconsistent. the decor is weird, but warm. food is very flavorful, but a bit greasy. perhaps authentic mexican food is supposed to be greasy? (speaking as a chinese person, a lot of authentic chinese food is greasy. for example, a few years ago hong kong health officials said that many dim sum items, including steamed ones, were high in fat and sodium.) in any case, i've always enjoy the dishes there."}
{"text":"The food here tastes like it was made at home. It's incredible. Super fresh. Perfectly prepared. And the owners are just the kindest and most welcoming. YOU SHOULD EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I have been to Dos Amigos several times now and I keep forgetting to write a review. I was sad to see the few reviews here and some that were not so favourable. The restaurant is great in my opinion, and the food is delicious.

Keep in mind, I have never had \"authentic\" Mexican, as we do not have a lot of Mexican restaurants in Toronto, so my review may be biased but I have been to a few of the ones we have and so far, Dos Amigos is my favourite.

The restaurant itself is very small and cozy. It has a family restaurant atmosphere I liked and the service is fast. The first time we went there, I thought the server (who I think is also the owner?) seemed a little unfriendly but after a couple more visits I realized she is just very tired most of the time and she really just comes off as a little closed off but she is actually very nice and warm. Don't let that deter you. Try working long hours, probably everyday, keep that in mind. She is a very nice lady and she definitely appreciates the business.

The food there is always great. So far, I've tried: the carne asada with a steak thatwas cooked perfectly despite being very thin (hard to cook a steak that thin to medium but they did it!). The mole... I could eat it with a spoon. It was so deep and well balanced in flavour, just the right amount of spice and that rich sweetness that comes from the Mexican chocolate. Delicious.

I also had the enchiladas with beef and with pork another time. That is my favourite dish, I think. The tortillas are cooked perfectly, they are soft and filled with real meat and not ground beef like most Mexican places in Toronto. The meat is tender and juicy and the sauce on top is mild and very tasty. 

I've also tried their oatmeal \"steak\" (my mother, who is a vegetarian, had it) and it was surprisingly flavourful and tasted very good. They have good vegetarian options in general, which always makes me happy because I have vegetarian/vegan friends.

Their drinks aren't bad either. I've tried a margarita before and it was the right type, not the icy slush that North America seems to prefer but the real \"martini style\" drink. Good amount of booze too. 

And let's not forget their extensive tequila menu. I have yet to go there for tequila tasting but if I were to go anywhere, that would be the place. So much to choose from! 

So overall, highly recommended. There are other OK Mexican places in Toronto but to me, this one will always be the first choice. It's cozy, dependable for good food, and inviting."}
{"text":"Underwhelming Mexican food.

I tried the tacos for lunch, back in April, and was disappointed.  The place only had one other customer besides myself.  This might be more of a drinking place than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Last week when I was up in Toronto, I stopped by Dos Amigos. The restaurant looks deceiving from the outside, but when you go inside, you receive a very authentic warm feel of an atmosphere like you are in Mexico. It was a pleasant evening so we opted to sit in the back patio that included a waterfall, exterior chimney, old Mayan masks hanging on the walls, and all of this covered with a umbrella shape tree which lights up after dawn.
 
Despite a rather long menu and numerous dinner specials, we ordered a reasonably priced and great dish called carne asada, which is is a combination dish of beef, with guacamole, quesadilla, enchilada, rice and beans on the side.
 
The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable; they appeared to take pride in making sure we enjoyed ourselves. We also noticed that the owners were present and seemed to take pleasure in engaging with both their customers and  workers. 

All and all Dos Amigos is a great place to enjoy excellent real Mexican food (not tex-mex) accompanied by some Mexican beer or a refreshing margarita."}
{"text":"I think this is an excellent choice for  Mexican Food in Toronto... The food was AWESOME, every dish my boyfriend and me tried were just Delicious!!.. and the service was Excellent!!.. I will recommend it 100% ..."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food, and a cozy atmosphere!

I was excited coming in here to find out that they do a Michelada (think spicy beer). While I prefer this in the summer, I couldn't pass up trying it out in the middle of winter. I also introduced it to a few others that were with me who, all but one, really enjoyed it as well.

I had a burrito and though they normally don't do a carnitas burrito they said they'd make one for me. Carnitas is on the menu but only in their tacos. The burrito was an average size, was topped with cheese, sour cream, and yummy sauce. It came with a salad and rice, both of which were delicious. Overall just a really good authentic meal.

The table split a couple desserts - the flan and churros. The flan was really good but not my cup of tea. The churro was AMAZING! It's a must order. They make them all in house so they're done right. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

Check this place out for sure for a solid Mexican experience."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food.  It reminds me of home (California) & it is comforting AND nourishing.

So, I was thrilled to hear about this place battling the typical Tex-Mex establishments that people usually recommend as Mexican cuisine.

This place is classy.  Classy & filling.  We ordered the vegetable enchiladas.  Delicious & filled with an assortment of veggies - not just the usual suspects.

& the churros?  Amazing.  The way to my heart is usually through cinnamon + sugar.

A little off the beaten path but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Craving Mexican, and something that felt like comfort food on this windy Toronto night, I called upon an old favourite and knew i wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at dos amigos based on a friends recommendation and this place did not disappoint. The ambiance, service and food were all 5 star. Pleasant Mexican background music with a traditional decor made the experience a plus. The staff was beyond expectations with perfect recommendations, a candid attitude and timely service. The food, the best part!! Amazing tacos (Tapas style) and might I recommend the fish tacos and the portions are fit for a king, come ready to eat. For those that like to indulge in drinks they serve spectacular margaritas and special shots are a must (try the tequila / Zambuca) surprise.  Last but but not least... This place easily rivals grand electric in terms of food and beats in terms of experience. Only downside, bad parking at back. So, u know ur next Mexican spot!"}
