{"text":"We just tried Billy's Dumplings tonight and it was very good - and very, very similar to Mother's Dumplings on Spadina near College.  Good news for us, as we live much closer to Billy's Dumplings than Mother's Dumplings.  We had the boiled chicken and mushrooms dumplings and pan-fried pork, melon, and shrimp, which were great.  The bbq pork buns were on the dry side though.    I'm hoping it gets more business as I'd like it to succeed - the service was friendly and I can now easily get my dumpling fix!"}
{"text":"Food: Steamed and boiled dumplings were good but the juicy pork buns were delicious. I'd give a better rating if there was a bit more meat in the dumplings.   Decor: I liked the hardwood floors and the booths at the back of the restaurant. They should install the wood floors throughout the restaurant to make it feel cozier.    Verdict: Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food here is actually very good -  better than over hyped places like mother's dumplings.  Atmosphere could benefit from changes - but in short, I would go back,"}
{"text":"Billy makes good dumplings. They include meats and sometimes spices, wrapped in flour served boiled, steamed, or pan fried. On the table are spy sauce, vinegar, chilli oil, and sriracha sauce. Small orders are around ten dumplings, large orders around 20.  Prices are reasonable, even low for the area. The first time I are there, a woman was behind a glass cage visibly making dumplings.  It's hard to find fault with this \"what you see if what you get\" dumpling house. You want dumplings, you order dumplings, and you eat them. They taste the way dumplings should.  One disappointment is that the pork buns were not great but - and this is a big but - why did I order pork buns at all?  If you're near bloor and Bathurst and you want dumplings, eat here. You want something else? Go somewhere else.  Oh one last thing. Not everyone likes to mix the soy sauce, vinegar and chilli oil together. I say go for it."}
{"text":"Visiting my brother and his family...popped in late afternoon and had pork and chive dumplings and bean sprouts. All was delicious.  Recommend. But then again I love dumplings."}
{"text":"Straightforward.  What you'd expect from a dumpling place: fresh average dumplings; you never get a water refill; bathrooms are horrifying, BUT you feel so full you want to die, and your bill is under $15 each.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Solid dumplings. My kids love this place. They especially like the juicy steamed pork dumplings and the egg and shrimp ones. Service is indifferent but efficient (not impolite). I gave this four stars because it is clean and the dumplings are yummy and homemade. I must admit that this would not be my first choice in the neighbourhood  just because I prefer sushi, Thai etc... But  as I said, the kids love it! If you like dumplings, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"so I bought a coupon (I think $14 for 25-30 worth of food, can't remember) but it equaled about 2 types of dumplings.  Hubby is pescatarian so we ordered the 2 veggies one (melon with ... and mushroom I think it was).  They were both steamed, no option to fry.  I thought it was decent and worth it especially if you get a coupon."}
{"text":"Great steamed dumplings. Try their beef dumplings. Green onion pancake is also delicious. They have black vinegar sauce, and soy sauce. Nice plates, and clean chopsticks. This place is great!!!"}
{"text":"It appears that this restaurant has closed down. While it is sad to see, as I am sure this small family owned business, I am definitely not surprised.  Conveniently located near my house, I ate in this empty restaurant only once. Food was alright, however I got food poisoning within a few hours of dining here.  I swore never to go back and now I can't even if I tried."}
{"text":"Came here to order soup dumplings and it was delish!  It's located close to bathurst station so it easy to get to.   The lady was nice and service was great!"}
