{"text":"As a transplanted Scot, I know good fish and chips.

I had the Haddock and Chips. Unfortunately, to keep expenses down and profits up, many fish and chip shops have cut back on the size of the fish portion served and often cover it in thick batter (and serve lots of chips) to hide the paltry portion of fish.

The batter here was not thick however, when you fry a really thin filet of fish for too long, you get a rubbery chewy piece of fish and that is what was served.

Had the portion been thicker, the crispy batter and acceptable chips would have complemented the dish instead of being the highlight of the meal.

I've had better and will continue to look for the ultimate Toronto chippy."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fish Basket (haddock, calamari, shrimps, and scallops). I loved the different spices, batters, and textures that were in each one. Generous amount served for a reasonable price, $15, and can be more than enough for two people. Service was friendly and the environment was clean. I was very pleased, and will be returning again to try their famous fish tacos."}
{"text":"I was really glad to see a fish & chips spot open up in the area, especially given the relatively good (and fresh) seafood we can get here in Toronto. (I was also extremely happy to see a non-burger spot open up but that's another matter entirely.)

We ordered 5 halibut & chips meals for pick-up. The store design is kinda cool and despite what other reviewers have said, I think they did a great job modernizing the theme of a wharf. I was also pleasantly surprised by the seating they had, especially when you look a couple doors down at the also-wonderful Craft Burger. 

Anywho, the order came to just under $15 per person with tax. Given the sheer volume of both fish and chips, that's already a plus in my books. The proof is truly in the pudding though and thankfully things were delicious. I found the batter to be fairly light and crispy with the fish cooked to flaky perfection underneath. The chips were... simply amazing. Good fries are hard to find and I'd head here simply for a basket of their deep-fried spuds. Topping it all off was the awesomeness that is their tartar sauce, which definitely had the garlic and dill flavours others have mentioned. 

All in all, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I love the grilled arctic char with the salad, however portion sizes have gotten considerable smaller since it first opened up...hence the four stars. Still delicious and healthy though!"}
{"text":"The One That Got Away is our #1 restaurant in Bloor West Village for a quick, healthy-ish meal. Our favorite items on the menu are the salmon burger, grilled salmon wrap, fish tacos, and fish & chips. The fish always tastes fresh and well-seasoned, the service is always friendly and extremely fast, and the prices are very reasonable. Orders take under 10 minutes to make so if you live nearby, it's a great take-out option--call in your order and it'll be ready when you arrive. If you eat there, there are some small tables and counter space. There's no outdoor seating, but on nice days they pull the window up all the way, turning the counter seats near the entrance into an open air option.

The one time I got served the wrong type of fish in my wrap, the person at the counter immediately apologized and insisted on giving me both wraps for the price of one.

Overall, we're happy to have The One That Got Away in our neighborhood and usually go at least once every week or two."}
{"text":"Came in here with my girl friend for a quick bite a couple weeks ago. As two small asian girls with eyes bigger than our stomachs, we naturally wanted to order the seafood platter that literally just came wit ha bit of everything. Can't go wrong with variety,  y'know?

Either way, we were not disappointed. The platter comes with deep fried shrimps, scallops, calamari, and haddock, on  bed of fries.  Granted everything deep fried is delicious, but my friend and I were quite impressed. I didn't feel disgusted at myself after consuming the platter - which says a lot about how the deep fry is light and ungreasy. The fish was my favourite which is so flakey and tasty, and the fried shrimp were still nice and succulent through all the deep fried batter. My friend LOVED the calamari which was cooked perfectly and not at all rubbery. Even the fries were delicious. They offer a whole bunch of dips (we got garlic mayo and  tartar sauce, but they also have chipotle mayo, mango salsa, etc) that make everything more amazing.

Everything here is self serve, so don't forget to clean up your utensils after you eat!"}
{"text":"I personally do not like fish but adore seafood of all kinds, especially lobster. Their lobster rolls are absolutely amazing!! The lobster meat is fresh, tender and juicy, and the bun is buttered and crisp. The dressing they use is not a heavy mayo based one, its more of a lemon butter or something. The only negative is the size and price, its pretty small and pricey. Keep in mind it is only available on wednesdays and the weekend. 

I have also tried their calamari and it is quite good, the batter is light and crispy. Their fries do tend to be over fried and they lack seasoning. That being said when the fries are fried properly and you add some salt they are pretty tasty. I wish they had more fried seafood options though, shrimp would be nice."}
{"text":"it was ok, not the greatest, but we're willing to try them again later on down the road.  we're hoping they're just going through some growing pains.

haddock sandwich ($7.99). though the menu says it is served grilled, it came breaded and deep-fried. it was ok, the bread was good. had to pay extra for tartar sauce which was disappointing as the other orders came with it.

fish basket ($14.99 includes shrimp, scallops, calamari, haddock, fries, tartar sauce and coleslaw). the order was missing the coleslaw. the seafood was cooked to varying degrees of \"doneness\". the haddock looked anemic, the batter was shockingly pale, not golden as would be more appetizing, the fish itself was \"ok\". the scallops were really good and the calamari and shrimps were a bit on the \"over done\" side. overall everything all together was way too greasy (even for fish and chips), it might have been a different experience if the coleslaw was there to \"cut it\". one container of tartar sauce wasn't enough for all the seafood. we thought the fish basket would be a good sampler of some of the different seafood they offer. it was hit or miss.  while the variety was nice, with the fries it's just too much grease so we don't think we'll be ordering this again as is.  if they offered it with a salad option we would probably try it.

scallop salad ($11.99). no choice of dressing, just given what looked like italian (which was tossed in favor of our own).  came with tartar sauce and mango salsa (which was a surprise). basic salad of mixed greens, tomato, cucumber and sesame seeds. scallops were cooked to perfection. overall an \"a\", a bit on the pricey side but would definitely try again. we suggest they offer a bigger selection of dressings. 

we did not try the soup, they only had the manhattan chowder, no seafood chowder. we hope in the upcoming colder months they expand their menu to include a soup and half sandwich combo. soup's not enough on its own, and it's way too much food with any of the existing orders, for us at least (and we would never be able to agree on a sandwich to share). ;)

oh and cocktail sauce would be a nice alternative to tartar sauce for the other seafood (other than fish)."}
{"text":"The guy who took our order is extremely impolite. How do you expect a customer to come back if you don't know how to communicate with people! Shame on you..
And the food is horrible too. Tasteless like that guy.. the one with blue eyes!"}
{"text":"Cozy casual place. Food was decent however the fish tasted really heavy and greasy. However if I had the craving for greasy fish I think I'd rather visit Chippy's which is 10 min walk from here. Would I come again? Most likely not.

Food: 3
Service: 4
Ambience: 5 (cool cozy place)
Overall: 3 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times, and I really love this place. Great variety on the menu, the food is fresh and tasty, and the service is good. The restaurant itself is a little on the small side, but it has a great atmosphere. It's casual and relaxed, perfect for a weekend lunch. Highly recommend the tacos!"}
{"text":"I tried the Haddock and it was great. Perfect crisp and the chips were good too. Great value, big portions and really cheap. Nice ppl too"}
{"text":"Nice little local spot! I liked their take on a filet o fish, and I will definitely be back to try some of the other stuff. 

Tip: You can get half salad and half fries, if you are health conscious. 

The cashier girl is really friendly, and seems to be best friends with everyone who walks in. I'm confused about the tipping situation here though. You go up and make your order and pay, but the girl brings food to your table. How much tip do you leave?"}
{"text":"Decent food, but the place is rather small and gets crowded especially during lunch time."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a ton of times and finally ventured inside today for lunch.
I was pleasantly surprised by the selection as it wasn't your run of the mill \"fish and chips\" place. They offer much more than the classic fish and chips; including sandwiches, wraps, salads, and chowder/soups. 
There are various fish options to choose from too (Haddock, Arctic Char, Cod, Halibut, Pickerel, and Crab Cakes). You also have an option to have it Baked or Fried...so it's not as unhealthy as you'd think.
All of the meals that my friends ordered looked excellent, and didn't have that \"caught in Lake Ontario\" appearance.
I opted for the Salmon Burger with a salad and it was great! (It looked like they actually put a bit of effort into the salad, instead of the standard Iceberg lettuce with 1 green tomato slice.).
The only slightly negative thing to note is that it is a bit pricey - $13.50 for a Salmon Burger, Salad and bottle of water. 
Despite the price, however, I thought it was worth every penny, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't tell the folks at chippy's (where I've been a staunch supporter for years) but the folks here are doin it right...the one that got away is doing a great job in all areas...from service to food u can colour me impressed.

U had me at the tartar sauce...my server asked if mine was for here or to go....to b honest I'm not sure what I said...They opted to give me a takeout, which I sat and enjoyed. Upon seeing that I'd chosen to stay and eat the server came to apologize profusely for givin me take out when I was in fact dining in. Hardly an issue for me but nice to c that whether the confusion was my fault or theirs, that they were aware and apologetic. A very nice touch considering the poor service i got a few days earlier 2 doors down at craft burger.

The fish was great, the fries were thick cut and still crispy...not soggy...the menu options were perfect.

Definitely worth checkin out"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here for dinner on a Sunday night. The service was great, really friendly as the other reviewers have mentioned.

Not sure why the other reviewers had such an issue with the food, I found it to be quite good. We had the cod and pickerel fish and chips and both were very tasty, not over-battered or over salted. Not the best fish and chips of my life, but at least the best place to get fish and chips in the Bloor West area and not too expensive. I'd recommend you give it a go!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy! The fish was hot and fresh and the wait was short. Will be back often as I am a big fish fan!"}
{"text":"This place is a small little restaurant. Good for dining in and take out. 
My first time here so I didn't know what to order. I told the waiter at the counter that I wanted a fish that flakes and is juicy. He recommended the haddock fish and chips. And it's delicious.
Perfectly cooked, very light batter, inside the fish is not over done. 
It's a good sized portion and comes with tar tar sauce. 
I'm really glad I stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"Came in while walking along Bloor and just had to try it. The fish is awesome, I have never had a better pickerel fish n chips. The salad is awesome too, no one has mentioned how big the salad is. The crab cakes are a1, the grilled halibut was better than any other sit down place in the area. 

Great place, very simple and efficient. Came in when it was empty so I can see it getting busy , please enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would love this place if it didn't feel like it was taking a big bite out of my wallet. I enjoyed 3 fish tacos for dinner and was still feeling hungry. The fish tacos were pretty good, but they really could be a bit more flavourful as the only padding was shredded lettuce and some mayo/salsa. I don't usually like hot sauce on my food, but it was definitely missing a kick. The fish and chips looked much more filling, so probably a better choice for dinner if you're in the area. I would go back to try some of their other items...I think it deserves another chance..."}
{"text":"The fish was tiny and I am not sure if it even was fish, they bulk up on fries and the service sucks."}
{"text":"They should call this place ' the Sour Tuna' based on the sour guy that works at the cash - sour, sarcastic and stares at you while you eat! Had halibut but the fish looked like cod and very thin. Fries were old and refried - will not come here ever again!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, excellent fish and chips, and really good homemade tartar sauce ... what more could you ask?  Actually, if you're asking for homey atmosphere, a thriving lunch business (always a good sign), and a full range of retro \"Pop Shoppe\" flavors (remember Green Apple pop???) in stubby glass bottles whose \"twist off (hah!)\" caps threaten to rip your hand to ribbons just before finally letting go ... then you're in luck, because The One That Got Away has all that too!"}
{"text":"They make a wonderful Fisherman's Basket with scallops, shrimp, calamari, fish and fries. The fish and scallops are very good but the calamari can be hit or miss. The shrimp, though, is consistently the best I've ever had -- really fresh and delicious. The service is friendly but sometimes a little flaky or slow. They're always happy to correct any errors, though, and that more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"It was pretty gross to say the least. They really need to keep their oil clean. My fries and the batter of the fish was the deepest shade of brown I've seen on fried food. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I can get to and from the office within a 5 minute stumble, or maybe it's because I can't get away from the smell of their fries, but this place gets it right."}
{"text":"I'm a total carnivore, but having eaten here --- this is definetly the exception to the rule.  Not only was it fresh and tasty, it was filling too.   

First time here the menu seems kinda bland, you choose your fish and you choose which way you want it.  But let me tell you, don't let the menu fool you -- they make the fish fresh on the spot.  You can literally taste that this is not your old frozen fair fish.

Fish & Chips, Fish Tacos, they salad combos are great too.

Be warned they only have very limited seating, so be prepared for take out  or drop by when its not so busy."}
{"text":"Love this place! It may not seem like a lot from the outside but their food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm not always in the mood for fish and chips, but when I am, this is the place I enjoy going to.
Good service and really good fish n' chips. I come here when I need a causal bit to eat.

The portions I find are always huge and they give you a shit load of fires. I can never finish them, and it's a shame because they are so tasty!

I no longer live in the neighbourhood, but go back once in a while for these fish and chips."}
{"text":"There was a very sweet, upbeat girl who greeted us when we came in. She instantly made it a welcoming experience and was knowledgeable about the menu. 

We had the salmon with salad and the haddock with salad. The salmon was grilled perfectly, very juicy and tender with the right amount of seasoning. The haddock was lightly battered which was great. The salads were just right with what seemed like homemade dressing which was very delightful! Overall great experience and very impressed."}
{"text":"I tried the fish tacos here.  There were great!  Fish was tender and the cilantro, lime and seasonings were amazing!  I will definitely be returning to try other items.  I'm glad they are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with another family and our little kids. Food was served fast and very freshly made. Fish tacos were great, and my haddock and chips was excellent. Fries were delicious, fish was not overcooked. Batter was tasty. 

Not only was the food good, but the restaurant itself was nicely decorated and restrooms clean and easily accessible on the same floor.

Will definitely go back again. Very fair price for the food."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for work. Excellent place to eat fish and chips - best I've ever had!  Awesome service, reasonable prices, delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Its small and there's not much seating. The staff are friendly and the prices are fair. I had the fish tacos and fries. The tacos were good. The fried fish was cooked perfectly and the corn tortillas were very tasty. The toppings on the tacos were kind of meh, just basic tomatoes, onions and lettuce with a drizzle of sour cream. I wish they were more creative with flavour here. The fries were great. They tasted really fresh and fried to a dark brown. I would like to go back and try the classic fish and chips cause that fish in the tacos was perfect."}
{"text":"Went here once for lunch with some co-workers on Friday afternoon, the place was really busy. The lineup was all the way out the door at one point. The dining area is quite small, most people do takeouts.

Food price is a little expensive for fish and chips, however they actually taste good. Fresh fish, decent batter, good tartar sauce, and good fries. 

There is pretty much no service, you order what you want, then you wait for your food until they call your your number to pick up your order.

Although it was very busy at the time, we were lucky we found a table. Most people there just eat and get out quickly. This may not be the case if you go in a non-peak hours. Another note: their chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable to sit on. 

TL/DR note: Although they might be a little over-priced, their food still taste good. I would recommend ordering for takeouts instead of dining in."}
{"text":"My experience was much better this time around. My portion was a bit smaller which is fine by me since I'm not a big eater in the first place. Everything was cooked perfectly and stayed piping hot on the cold walk back to the office.

It was the first time I'd experienced their lunch rush however and I might just wait an hour later or start calling in."}
{"text":"Great fresh fish tacos, my friend had the halibut and chips..... both where very tasty and for sure will be back soon again.

yum yum....."}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips!! 
You have to try it out.
I had the \"normal\" halibut with chips. Delicious! The batter was amazing!

Will def. be back! Also, I've heard the fish tacos are very good too! YUM!"}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've ever had! The chips were perfectly cooked. I was having a really rough day and this cheered me up somewhat."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place initially, I was excited to experience what it had to offer.  What better way to satisfy the hunger on a cold evening right?

Decor:
The feel I believe they wanted to achieve here was a old fisherman's warf type of ambiance with a bit of old meets new.  This place is pretty small unfortunately and could seat maybe 15 people at most.  I've never been to a big, spacious fish and chips joint with modern decor and TOTGA makes no attempts at distinguishing themselves from the rest of the crowd.

Food:
I have this mentality that when I go to a restaurant that I don't plan on frequenting that often (yes, I don't think I'm going to eat Fish and Chips everyday without exploding), I tend to shell a bit more dough because 'when in Rome' right? In my case, 'when in potentially health hazard restaurants if you eat too often'.
So this time, I didn't ignore my 'when in...' and ordered the most expensive fish which is the Halibut(at $12.99 w/chips) 

**side tangent here.  Why is it called Fish and Chips when clearly chips aren't served?  Just go Fish and Fries.  A good April Fools prank would be packing a bunch of french fries into a chip bag and when the customer opens it, there's a note saying \"What? These are also known as chips in the Fish world\" =P

Anyways, back to my review.  I'm sad to report that the halibut was not flaky and the batter was bland and a bit too chewy.  In the world of fried fish batter, if you want to distinguish yourself you need to really put all your eggs into the batter because that's your selling point.  It seems like this place didn't care much for that unfortunately.  The fries were pretty good but I tend to enjoy more thin-cut fries.


Overall:
This place had it's appeal at the storefront because it had a picture of a mermaid.  Maybe if they had a special mermaid dish or played on the title 'Fish and Fries', then I would have maybe given another star:P

Nice try little mermaid, I'll have to let you get away next time I see you."}
{"text":"Been here over a dozen times and would recommend it if only for the fish tacos.

They've always been fresh and tasty, though a bit pricey for the amount you get."}
{"text":"Really good neighbourhood joint. Affordable, especially for the area. All sorts of fish available fried and grilled. Salmon burger is great, and obviously classic haddock and chips!"}
{"text":"Just got home with two orders of halibut and chips.I really doubt they would have the nerve to serve the halibut portions I recieved in both orders, two combined equaled one decent serving, and it was very dry."}
{"text":"I've been eating here twice a week since this place opened, and it's a solid, consistent joint.  I really like this place because they know what they're good at, and keep doing it well.

My go-to is the grilled arctic char with salad (love the strawberry vinaigrette dressing), although I do love their fried calamari and fish tacos - and have been known to split a fish basket with the BF.

Nice staff, clean spot - can get a little crazy during lunch hour though."}
{"text":"OK quality of fish and chips. Portions were average. the only issue was the reference to the use of purell hand sanitizer... if it weren't for that.. then it would have received an additional star."}
{"text":"Came in today with some friends on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. One of us had a mad craving for clam chowder so all of ordered their seafood chowder (which according to the fellow that worked there contains the top 5 fish on the board, shrimp, clams & scallops) and it was lovely! It wasn't fishy at all - in fact it was a very hearty clam chowder (with the odd scallop bit) to me and wasn't too salty. It totally hit the spot on a cold, snowy afternoon. At first glance the little cup seems a bit pricey at $4.75, but if you think at what you get at Tim Hortons for a bowl of soup and how little \"stuff\" is in it, their Chowders are very reasonably priced. FYI the Manhattan chowder has the same seafood ingredients but is tomato based and dairy-free.

A couple of friends ordered the Fried Haddock & Chips and the portion was huge - it would be way too much for me to eat on my own for a meal. The fish was tender, flaky and not \"fishy\" - a sure sign that their fish is fresh. If you're a fish & chips fan this is a good spot to check out. 

The decor is interesting - metal ceiling tiles with deliberately peeling paint, wooden benches and barstools but only enough seating for about 10 customers. The largest table seats 4."}
{"text":"The highlight of TOTGA is its ability to fulfill and exceed your craving for deluctable fish 'n chips. 

The little shop never has an available seat when I go, mind you its prime-time lunch rush. But well worth a pick-up or take-out! The fried Haddock Sandwich is delicious; you can taste the freshness of the fish, the buns are light and soft, adding to a perfect balance with the fish, and with just the right amount of toppings and sauce to it. The fries weren't too shabby either. The grilled fish sandwich is a healthy option that is very popular apparently. 

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly,  slow service,  overpriced,  small portions . 
Go to Kingsway fish and chips instead ."}
{"text":"I had the haddock and chips. It was just alright. I'm from the East-coast and find you Toronto natives are so eassssssssssily impressed with fish. It was too expensive for haddock.

Fries were pretty nice, though. SALTY. Skip this spot and make your way up to Harbord FnC. It's worth your commute from douchebag alley.

PS The chairs were really uncomfortable. So get take out. Or nothing."}
{"text":"A caveat for my review...I ordered the Fish tacos, as other reviews had recommended them.  Had I been hungrier, or had more time, I would have ordered some actual Fish & Chips.

The tacos are only available after 2PM and, as you can see from the picture, they definitely looked delicious.  Apparently, you can have them fried (crunchy) or not.  The gentleman behind the counter recommended the fried version, so that's what I ordered.  $10.99 for three tacos seemed a tiny bit much, especially without any \"chips\", but I figured I'd try it once.

Leaving aside the fact that I HATE HATE HATE cilantro, I managed to try some of the salsa verde that they give you with your order.  I'm sure most people would say it goes with the tacos perfectly, but I hated the stuff.  Now, this had NOTHING to do with the tacos themselves.

The tacos were good.  Not great, but good.  Interesting to eat small versions of breaded Basa fish inside soft tacos.  There's really not much that's fancy in this dish.  Breaded fish, lettuce, tomatoes, etc etc.

I ordered a side of the chips and they were as good if not a tad better than anything I've had in other places.  Presentation was neat with their metallic plates covered with faux-newspaper.  

This place is definitely a hipster joint, and it's in the right spot for it.  If all you want is a good fish & chips dish, with a good selection of fish to choose from, then this place is perfect.

In any event, I have to come in on Wednesdays, since that's when I can try their Lobster sandwich...:D"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food. I had battered haddock both times I visited; the batter is light and the fish is fresh. Decent pricing as well for a generally over-priced area. Cosy atmosphere, great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I could see this taking the place of my shawarma addiction. 

Other posters have no doubt covered the details, but stopped by last night on the way to the Raptors game (cough, choke) and had the Char wrap. It was glorious. A little spicier than I was expecting --I dont know what they put in there, but I like a little fire so it was perfection in my eyes. Things seemed reasonably priced for what it is. my wrap was $9ish (no side) and I think everything was under $15. Theres seating, but not much of it. Wait was about 10 mins for the food, as it was cooked fresh."}
{"text":"I was *really* into the Halibut and Chips at Vancouver's Go Fish.  If you want fish chips in Canada, I guess I am sticking to that recommendation.  

The matter of it being impractical to just hop over to Vancouver, though, means I should probably review TOTGA instead of dreaming about the West Coast.  And I have mostly good things to say about TOTGA, especially given the location.  The fish is fresh, the chips are real, and this is pretty much what you need for nicely executed fried seafood.  

Plus, if you've been eating in Chinatown all week (cf. other my other Toronto reviews), the change of pace is welcome.  4 stars, even if you're still in the Midwest, making seafood from the sea a slightly odd proposition."}
{"text":"Authentic, rustic, \"genuine feeling\" fish and chips?
Clearly this place is in Toronto because nowhere this pretentious would survive (and thrive) anywhere else.

The presentation was good, although the fake newspaper felt like something Macca's would do, to be perfectly honest. The chips were great but that's not what I came for. 

I swear when I bit into the fish a tiny, \"womp womp\" sting was sounded. 

They act like they deserve a prize for preparing from whole fish fillets (I'm assuming \"market fresh\" but since they're frying it, my bet is--and it tastes like--it's at least two days old.) If the fish and chips here are so amazing, the fillets should be fresh, fat, juicy and falling apart in moist chunks. Mine was slimy, just like fillets from a frozen box, but slightly fatter with fresher batter. 

Speaking of the batter, here's one factor that was totally up to them to shine, and they blew it. It is utterly, for the lack of a better word, \"whatever.\"  It lacks that \"grandfather's secret ingredient\" factor--I mean, that whole \"rustic\" thing is what they were going for, right? 

As someone who grew up on fish and chips prepared by hand, and with an ACTUAL famous fish and chip shop on the corner,  this felt like a bit like going to Disneyland: shiny, glossy, expensive, and ultimately, totally fake."}
{"text":"First off: love the name. Way to pick something that makes one think of fish and lost love. Deep. 

Anywho, the person at the register sensed my boyfriend and I were first timers so he gave us the rundown. I thought this was really sweet that he took his time to explain each fish and the possibilities that could accompany it. It was great because on our way there I said, \"You know what would be cool? SALMON FISH AND CHIPS\" Well, they didn't have that however they have arctic char which is like salmon, but milder and more batter-appropriate. I wouldn't have known this had it not been for the man's guidance! I kind of wish that I went for my first instinct (fish and salad) but instead went against my own grain at the last moment and got fish and chips. I feel like I can handle eating a ton of salad but not a ton of fries. However, I couldn't not get their classic dish; I just couldn't bring myself to. 

We sat down, pretty empty on a weeknight, and the food came to us in no time. The fish was to die for. Perfectly cooked under a light but satisfying breading. I was well-informed because the fish was just salmon-y enough for me. The chips were delish as well and the portion was enormous. I saw some other people getting the sandwich and I would definitely like to give that a go. My only qualm is turn up the heat, dudes!

I'm not a very fish-and-chippy girl. It was not my idea to come here. HOWEVER, it was excellent. I find it a bit difficult to give a fish and chips place four stars but I have to in order to properly honour this experience."}
{"text":"Who got away?! Katy Perry?! Haddock? Halibut? 

With a funky name like this, I had high expectations for the fish and chips here, and I was not disappointed! 

I ordered the Halibut & Chips, and it was delicious! My mouth is watering just reminiscing.. It's a little pricey at around $14 (not including a drink) but the freshness of this recently deceased halibut will delight your taste buds. It's nice and crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. There's a real difference when I sampled my friend's haddock, which was more chewy and tough to swallow. I recommend the halibut if you appreciate the fresher option. 

One star off for service, sadly. The cashier was having a bad day and had a hard time cracking a smile or maybe I should have cracked a fish joke. 

Next time I'm in the area, I'm trying the fish wraps and tacos... or maybe the crab cakes or possibly the lobster... argh, just let me eat all the seafood!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get some fish n chip around king west as i don't think there are other places that offer it in the area. The service was very nice and helpful. The decor is trendy and clean. 

Not good for a big group if you want to sit down, better for a small group of friends. 
Nice place to grab a bit to eat before going out!  It would be better if they offered beer.

I was a big fan of the fries n mango topping."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day with my wife after work and really enjoyed it.  I had the Fish Platter which at $15 is only a few bucks more than I would pay at Chippy's for just a fish and chips, but also includes 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, a good serving of calamari in addition to a big piece of haddock and fries.  Everything was delicious but I was particularly impressed with the scallops which were fried to perfection and the calamari which had a fantastic seasoning.

My wife had the grilled Baramundi, and while she is a picky seafood eater she loved it, and her salad was fresh and tasty.

Server was very helpful and friendly helping my wife pick a fish she would enjoy.  Wharf-like decor is a nice touch as well.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been to TOTGA multiple times but I feel as if their portions and quality has been deteriorating. I typically order the fried haddock and chips, each time the fish gets smaller and smaller. Service is friendly and quick, you may need to wait a while during the peak lunch hour. Highly recommend ordering on Ritual during lunch hours so you won't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"I wanted to have anything grilled with a salad so my friend suggested this place. To be honest when I heard that it was fish I had my doubts about the oil and healthy odometer but I ordered the salmon with salad and was very impressed with the taste. The portion however was on the smaller side. My friend had ordered the fish basket which included a basket of calamari fish and fries and it did taste pretty well except for the overused oil. ( was not fresh oil).

Other than that the service was fantastic, the atmosphere was cozy and clean. I would come back and try it another day when my fish cravings kick in."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Inside feels like you are in this torn up fishing boat which adds to the whole experience. We ordered the haddock fish and chips and the fish platter. Both were great. They use just the right amount of batter and everything was just lightly salted. Not sure why there have been so many negative reviews as of recent."}
{"text":"Love love love! A great options for fish and chips, if you're looking for something a little healthier. I've had the grilled fish with salad a few times.  Rather than feel like I'm missing out on the real thing, I now prefer this version.  It comes with plenty of vegetables and a delightful mango salad.   Prices are a little high, but the portions have been big enough to share. 

As others have mentioned, it might be better option for a small group or take out."}
{"text":"As a Brit, i can tell you that this is great quality fish and chips!
I can tell you now, hands down, you wont find a chippy in England better than this.
There is soooo much choice of types of fish and sides, much more choice than anywhere in England.
The salmon burger is amazing.... So juicy that you cant really eat it as a burger, it needs a nice and fork. The thing will fall apart in your hands. I have learnt not to eat those in the staffroom infront of everyone now. The fries are to die for! Theyr crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and theyr dark and roasted in something special i think, then covered with salt.... Maybe a bit too much for some ppl. But not me, i love the stuff
Iv not tried the calamari yet, however the guys at work keeping walking past me into the staffroom with theirs and it smells delicious...

I couldnt tell you about prices because as I say, Im British and fish costs a fortune there (even though its an island surrounded by water :s) its about $12 for me to have a salmon burger and fries at this place. However there are no english chippys that do salmon, let alone in a burger, thats far too extravagant. But a normal cod and chips would cost you over £10 ($16)
So i am happy to keep spending it at The one that got away"}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop to eat here after passing by this place for years.  It is much roomier than I had always thought it would be like, there is enough seating for maybe 15-20 people. I got the cod  fish and chips and a side seafood chowder.  I took a seat and awaited my order.  Not too long afterwards  they brought out my order but it turned out they were out of chowder that night.   They appologized  and refunded  me the money for the chowder.

The food itself was great. The cod was  a good size with the batter crispy and cod moist.  The chips were also tasty yet not overly salty.   I'll won't be just passing along anymore and will definitely stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place before I came, so the expectations were pretty high.
As soon as my friend and I came through the door, we were instantly hit with the smell of tasty fish. At that moment, I knew we had come to the right place. 

Considering the menu I was seriously torn between ordering the classic fish and chips or a grilled fish sandwich but ended up going with the sandwich (I needed some vegetables in my life and the sandwich comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion). When our sever brought over my dinner, I knew I had made the right decision. The sandwich looked lovely and was a decent size. Fries weren't included with the sandwich, so I bought a small order of those as well. The \"Small\" was more than adequate! 
I ordered the grilled arctic char because I had never tried that fish before and it turned out great. The fish was cooked perfectly. It was juicy and well seasoned. The crisp veggies were the perfect textural balance in every bite, giving it a necessary crunch. The bun holding these delights within it was also spot on. It was light and scrumptious, adding a bready flavour that I loved. My only regret was the size of the fish portion. I wish it had been a touch larger because some bites of my sandwich were only bread and vegetables.

Overall, a great little spot with delicious fish and friendly staff! I would definitely go back and eat here again.

P.S. The \"newspaper\" under the order as well as the nautical decorations were a nice touch!"}
{"text":"The salmon burger was unreal, very delicious... But did leave me wanting more, portions are a bit small for what you pay. Alas, some of the best tasting seafood in the city."}
{"text":"New owners (starting 2017?) - quality has gone for sure :("}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant was the one that got away from me. I ordered it for delivery from doordash and by the time I got it the fries were soggy and the batter on the fish was gummy all the while being drenched in oil. I know it's fried so of course there's oil but it was the kind of oil that made you're stomach upset. The coleslaw was also disappointing. I like coleslaw as something fresh and will cleanse my palate from all the oily food I'm eating but for some reason the slaw was kind of oily as well. I don't know how it is when you order it in person but as far as delivery it made me feel ill."}
{"text":"I'm mostly vegetarian, but I eat a few pieces of fish a month. So when I saw this place, and then confirmed they were selling sustainable fish, I was excited to try it. I came in with a wave of people, it was an extremely busy lunch hour on a Friday. I can tell you right off I hate the system they have set up. You place your order, get a number, and then wait to be called. The problem is, the kitchen is not equipped to deal with the volume. And, the numbers are called in no order whatsoever. So while I'm number 155, they're calling a 175 before me. Why it takes so long to grill a piece of fish, I don't know. I was happy to wait the \"5-10 minutes\" they ask you to, but I was there for close to half an hour, constantly hearing numbers way after me being called up. Irritating! And then to top it off, the girl who is scrambling to get all these orders done doesn't even have the time or inclination to answer a question or do anything except scowl at you. Really poor service! I hope this is just part of their growing pains, but I won't be going back for a long time. Even though the sandwich was delicious (artic char on a portuguese bun) with mango salsa and coleslaw sides. I kind of wish it wasn't so good, then the picture would be complete. I guess the trick is not to go when it's busy, and not to expect anyone to smile at you or show appreciation for your business, and you'll have a great meal."}
{"text":"did he really get away?  or did you let him go?

I have been waiting and waiting to eat here.  \"Everyone\" already came and went.  Now it's my turn.

I love the name (course if it got away, how'd they catch and cook it?)  I'm not sure how the name came about or what it is they're playing on, but that's okay because I love fish & chips and this place does sustainable fish - cooked on demand.  If I had to sum it up, I'd say this place is like Big Smoke but instead of meat, it's all about fish.  Same idea: simple drop-in decor and eat-in seating, reasonable prices, custom choice menu, and fresh ingredients made-to-order.  It is a winning formula.

Halibut is a classic so we ordered that and the Barramundi because I like saying it.  They have all the fixings you need: vinegars, katsup, and homemade tartar sauce.

I will definitely go back.  Although there was a bit too much excess batter, the fish inside was so buttery and meaty that I can still say I really liked it.  The fries were delicious, of course.  I've never had bad chips at fish & chips.

Next time I will be coming for the fish tacos...and chips.  Always have to have chips."}
{"text":"The overtime food series continues with \"The One That Got Away\".  At first I thought the name of this place was based off a romance novel by Danielle Steele.  You know the best sellers that people buy at Indigo that eventually get turned into a romance movie your significant other drags you out to watch.  Yeah those ones!

Anyhow I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that I had my meal about 2 hours after it was made give or take.  Can't blame them for those soggy fries tho, it's not their fault they came late!  Back to the food stuff, I ordered the Artic Char, because I like my Fish and Chips fancy.  I also ordered a side of fries because, I like to carb it up once in a while.  Fries with ketchup mayo and pepper make the 5 year old inside me giggle a bit.

The fish was good, and still crispy for being out for so long.  The fries were a bit soggy, but they probably tasted great when they were initially tossed into the box.  There was a lot of fries...like enough to feed a small family to be honest, but I ain't complaining!  More fish would be nice, but I was pretty full just on my Fish and Chips box!  Overall they do a great job labeling and organizing on their food, unlike most Orderit.ca restaurants.  I would definitely add them to my list of Fish and Chips places I would try again!"}
{"text":"When they first started out they were amazing, but I guess as their reputation grew they cut down on the quality and ingredients. I now prefer another fish & chip place in Kensington market."}
{"text":"Go to spot for fish and chips in west end, simple and delicious, favourite is trout and chips and salmon burger is also very tasty"}
{"text":"A nice looking place with semi decent food. I had the trout sandwich which has way too much bread and lettuce with very little fish. The flavours were all covered by the lettuce and bread. The halibut fish and chip was not good either. They should've given a smaller piece of fish that was thicker. They give you once piece of fish that is long and thin which tasted very dry. I'm used to getting two pieces of fish when I get fish and chips. Very cheap on the fish considering the price you pay. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I had the halibut and chips (12.99), and I thought it was fantastic!  The batter was pleasantly light and crispy without too much of a grease overload.  The fish itself was quite thick, perfectly cooked and flaky.  

I also really liked the tartar sauce, as it had a nice flavour - perhaps of dill pickles?  The garlic mayo was good, but not the best I'd ever tasted.  

The portions are out of control, and I could only eat 1/2 of the delicious fries.  I would consider coming back and just having the fish all by itself!  Would definitely like to try the seafood basket next time!  

The decor was great too - kind of like an urban harbour, with portholes, rope rigging, and distressed wood.

What separates this fish and chip place from the others is the option to have your fish grilled, and served as a sandwich, wrap or salad - so if someone from your group wants to eat healthy, they can.  Its definitely a nice addition to the hood if you don't feel like burgers or bbq."}
{"text":"We ordered the fish basket and lobster roll..
The lobster roll was ridiculously small and tasted very bland, definitely not worth 17.99..
the fish basket was decent but nothing special about it!"}
{"text":"I strongly dislike fish in general and this place made me reconsider my bias.  Fish and chips should be heavily breaded and greasy right?  Not this place!  So good...

First timers should definitely try the grilled barramundi.  It's so flavourful, meaty, exotic sounding and with the salad, it just makes you feel healthy.  The seafood chowder is wonderful as well, chock full of creamy, seafoody goodness.  The more 'traditional' breaded haddock is absolutely delicious and unexpectedly light.  The thin, crispy breading is just so good.  

Great portion sizes, causal take-out atmosphere with interesting architectural details to look at (whether real or faked).  We came late at night and while not packed, there was a steady stream of customers."}
{"text":"A takeout favourite of mine. 

The halibut wrap is my go to. 

The salad is a good portion for the cost and the dressing is good if you don't want something too rich.

The menu could have a bit more lobster items. Lobster poutine?"}
{"text":"I eat here probably once a week.  Line ups can be long during the lunch rush and aside from the soup and side salads everything is made fresh so there can be a little bit of a wait. 

Their fish wraps are huge and delicious and are my favorite but they are incredibly messy.  If you are a slow eater (like me) your wrap will inevitably leak torrents of pico de gallo (et al) juices all over you.  Not sayin to avoid the wraps because of this, just keep it in mind as it could be very embarrassing with certain dining companions.  The fish tacos on the other hand are almost as messy yet somehow less flavourful (would have thought they'd have similar ingredients and taste but they don't).  The tacos are made with fried fish, but wraps by default are grilled...after discovering the awesome crunchy texture of the taco's I've been asking them to fry my fish for the wraps, AMAZING!

I've also had their fish and chips (ok), salmon burger (sooooo good), fish fillet (also good) and their lobster roll (a bit meh and doesn't live up to it's potential).

What I like about this place is they pack up the food for to go orders in a way that lets steam escape and everything stays crispy.  It seems like such a simple thing but there are other fish and chip places that don't do this and their food becomes a soggy disappointment."}
{"text":"What da?! What happened to this place? Everything is so soggy and the fish didn't seemed to be cooked properly. Seems like hits and misses but more misses than hits. I wish I can be more creative in my review here but what more can I say?"}
{"text":"I was walking in the area. The \"lobster roll\" special on the window got my attention. It turned out it is special on Wed and not available other days. My friend and I ordered the fish & chips / fish & salad instead. It was quite delicious. I love the rainbow trout with salad a lot! Will come back one of those Wed to try out the lobster rolls!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a lurker on Yelp for years now. I have decided to contribute to this community by writing my first review for this awesome joint.

It doesn't let me give it 4.5 stars, so I will give it a 4! Come on now, no restaurant is a perfect 5.

I have to say that it's one of my favourite places to have fish tacos in the GTA. I have been here several times and not once has it disappointed me. The fish, tortilla, salsa verde, pico de gallo and whatever other ingredients they put in there makes me want to go back for more. I have been to Grand Electric, La Carnita, and other restaurants who also serve fish tacos but are not known for them (ie. Joeys), and I still think this place is the best. 

When I went, they only had fish tacos after a certain time in the afternoon and all days on weekends. Make sure to call before you head over. You go up to the counter to order and they'll bring over the food when it's ready. The portion is just right for me, but if you have a huge appetite, I cannot say you would feel the same. If you aren't a fan of fish tacos, they also have a list of fish & chips which others have raved about. I have not tried them, so I cannot comment. Price wise, I think they're average compared to other places that also sell fish tacos.

The place isn't very big, so it may be more difficult to find a place to sit during meal time. They have couple chairs against the front window and you can people watch as you eat!  

This location is also very convenient, as it is along king st. streetcar. 
I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Small, casual, no frills place with excellent food that is reasonably priced.  My wife and I ordered two wraps, char and cod, which to me were excellent and she thought they were good but a bit spicy.  You will wait a bit because of the food being freshly prepared but that is worth the wait for good food.  Not a huge drink selection, just canned sodas and water from what I saw, and no dessert menu.  If you are looking for good fish with nothing else I give it 5 stars.  Will defiantly go again."}
{"text":"Being situated within the food landscape of King and Spadina, The One That Got Away is a more affordable, causal spot for lunch. I've been here twice and on both occasions I got the fish basket.  It was my friend who introduced me to this joint and he recommends the fish basket to anyone who frequents.  

The basket is about 16 dollars plus tax, but it's a sharable dish for two.  Therefore, it's decent in regards to its price to portion ratio. The basket consists of a mountain of thickly cut fries topped with two fish fillets, calamari, and shrimps. Everything is fried, so this was a perfect choice for a Friday lunch (Fried Food Fridays, I call it).  Everything tasted pretty standard here in terms of flavour and nothing really stood out as spectacular on both occasions.  However, the ratio of seafood to fries changed on my second trip; the fillets were smaller and there was only a sprinkle of calamari and shrimps. It seemed to be a cost-saving measure which I did not appreciate. Overall, I wouldn't say others should jump at the chance of eating here, but definitely consider it if you want a cheaper option to sate your seafood craving."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The staff is always great, even when it is busy. I normally get the trout (flakey and delicious) with a salad that is just perfect. 

I think this place is great and I've never had a problem with the food. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how many times I've passed by this place to and from work. The One That Got Away does fish right, and does right to your wallet. For around $10-15 you can be diving into a massive plate of your selected seafood.

I went there with my boyfriend during lunch and found the hostess to be extremely friendly, the service super quick, and the food great! Would highly recommend stopping by for lunch or even a quick pre-bar meal.

Best for take out!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review. Came back here for more fish n' chips because I had such a great experience with them last time.  I ordered the same old haddock and chips. Little did I know that their quality of food is not consistent. Last time when I came here, they made me one of the perfect fish n' chips I have had. It was fresh, crispy, and the batter was on point. The fish did not get soggy until 30mins after. However, going back this time felt like I was in a total different restaurant. Right when I got my fish n' chips, the fish was already soggy. Looking at it made me lose my appetite. It also seems like that have been using a different batter. I am not sure if they gave me a different fish, but it certainly tasted different. I will have second thoguhts of going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, so maybe it was an off day-but me and my partner were not too impressed. 
We got the Manhattan chowder to share, and split the Wednesday special lobster roll, and the haddock and chips. We thought to try the staples to make a good first impression. 
As for the lobster roll, the other reviews are right, it truly is very small. Not worth the price.
The haddock and chips were very bland, and for a fish and chips place, this was probably the most tasteless tartar sauce I've ever had! 
The Manhattan chowder was just salmon and tomato sauce, so nothing exciting at all. 

While everything did taste fresh, probably wouldn't go back, I had been wanting to go for a while since moving into the neighborhood. 
Was not impressed. 

Although the man who took our orders was very pleasant and professional! So he was probably the highlight."}
{"text":"I'm not big on Fish and Chips but this place has made me a fan, and more inclined to eat it more often. We ordered the top-end fish and it was excellent, although a little more pricy than one might think for such a simple recipe. We picked up three orders and drove for 15 minutes to our destination and the batter was still crispy and the fries were excellent. Amazingly, nothing got soggy. I wish they had longer hours to make it more of a late-night or after-hours stop."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh. Had the Arctic char on salad. The fish was seasoned well. 

They have their Inhouse dressing which is delicious. 

Would go again as the fries looked great"}
{"text":"Me and my husband got the $10 for $20 voucher on fabfind and used it today on the fish basket and an Artic Char sandwich. Overall, we are happy and very satisfied with the quality of the food, well done! With the fish basket, we got a taste of their fried haddock, calamari rings, scallop, shrimp, and fries with coleslaw and tartar sauce on the side. The batter was just right, especially on the haddock and calamari, lightly battered, crispy, and seasoned to perfection. Definitely not heavy, overly greasy, nor too bland or salty. All the seafood items were juicy inside their batter shells and not overcooked at all. Tartar sauce and coleslaw were tasty and prepared with care. Fries were good, fried to perfection and not too salty either. Finally, the Artic Char sandwich was excellent, fish was moist, accompanied with generous amount of fresh greens inside lightly toasted and seasoned french roll.

My only disappointment is the quantity. There was a lot of fries but I was more interested in the seafood and I wish I got more of that, especially if I was to pay the $15 regular price. The calamari portion was ok but I wish the haddock piece was a bit bigger and that I get more than just 2 scallops and 2 shrimps. How about 1 more of each?

So overall, I would recommend this fish and chip shop. I really did enjoyed the taste of the seafood products I had today and hope that they will keep up the good work, and maybe throw in a couple more scallops and shrimps into that fish basket next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fish Basket off of Ritual.

The good: calamari very tender, tartare sauce is decent

The bad: did not get scallops as indicated by the menu, the fish were ridiculously SMALL and only 2 pieces, the coleslaw is definitely leftovers as it has gone bad, tasted disgustingly sour (the bad sour, not the good sour).

Would not go back."}
{"text":"Excelentes tacos de pescado 
Muy parecidos a los de Mexico 
Y la salsa tarta de las mejores 
Papas en su punto"}
{"text":"Solid fish and chips. They even try with fake newspapers like their used to do until it was found to be carcinogenic.

I always get the standard but their non fish baskets are pretty good. The scallops and such were tender and crispy. I love their mango chutney and the salad that you can have instead of the fries. The chowder though needs work."}
{"text":"This place -- i have no words to describe it.. where do i begin?

I got here at 9:40 - they close at 10pm and we were starving and needed late night eats! So how can we turn down fish tacos, fish and chips, and other fish related foods?! HUGE fan of fish tacos here!

We go in, and there were 6 of us... but 4/6 ordered fish tacos (which are only available after 2pm) and 1 ordered the Arctic Char and chips.. (1/6 ordered just fries).

The fish tacos came with 3 of them (no sides) and it game with a small ramekin of what LOOKED like guacamole -- but definitely wasn't. I believe it was a jalepeno hot sauce.. SPICY! these tacos were amazing! there were gigantic pieces of fried fish and it definitely got messy with all the sauce.. 

I didn't get a chance to try the arctic char but it sure did look moist! and as for the fries?! its a ketchup and vinegar heaven!!!

i am actually torn that i don't work closer and i want to literally try everything on their menu.. you can get these fish as sandwiches or wraps or just the usual fish and chip combo... ugh! amazing!!!

the service was excellent.. the guys that work there are casual and cool and are indeed friendly.. i accidentally dumped out my metal fork into the garbage when i was cleaning up and was teased at by them!.. but it's all good :) super nice guys.. theres no doubt that people will go back!"}
{"text":"I would rate the fish and chips below average. The oil they use seems old as the fries came out brown and saggy. The fish tasted too fishy ... the chef was in the back cooking and eating at the same time. Gross. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Rainbow Trout fish and chips and my friend had the mixed seafood basket. 

1) The service was fantastic! The staff person was very friendly and provided information about the different menu items in accordance to our questions. She truly had excellent customer service.

2) The food was great! Fish and chips are my guilty pleasure and I have tried places throughout the city. This spot has a lot of selection, is reasonably priced and very well flavoured. The fish was well prepared. It also didn't feel overly oily as sometimes fish and chips do!

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I've been twice so far though and both times the food was worse than average. The fish in our fish and chips was over-fried and my fish sandwich was utterly flavourless. It's unfortunate because there really is a dearth of good places to eat out in the Bloor West Village. 

The upside is that the people who work there seem to be very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Decent fish burrito. It was tasty and fresh so I guess if you want to pay $9 for fast food this is better than most other quick meals you can get."}
{"text":"4.5*

Oh boy,  this may be the first time where Yelp has lead me astray... I've lived by this place for like a year but not gone in because of its 3.5* rating (which,  let's be honest, on Yelp might as well be 2*!) Finally thought I'd give it a chance cuz i was lazy but really wanted fish and chips and I'm glad I did! 

They have so many varieties of fish,  it's awesome. I had the rainbow trout which could be cooked grilled or battered and fried. The batter was light and not oveepowering; it's always tough to get that right in fish and chips! 

I added the coleslaw which was delicious and should probably be included because it goes so well. 

I plan to try at least 2 more types of fish before I move out of the neighborhood soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fish tacos. 
The fish was definitely fresh but the flavour was a bit bland. The lemon and salt added helped a bit

The tomatoes were so delicious and full of flavour. The sauce was good too."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are wonderful.   the service is fabulous and the people are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I came across this little place tonight as my friend, my boyfriend and I tried to find a place to eat along King Street west. The fish and chips at this place is very good. We ordered the Fish Bucket and other item to share. I have to say the chips were very good - very satisfying.  The calarmi in the Fish Bucket was really good too. I would say my favorite was definitely the calarmi. I would definitely come back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with my friend who is ridiculously PICKY! I love fish and chips and so does she. We ordered the haddock and fries. The girl taking the order was very friendly and smiled a lot. Such a nice greeting. She brought our food to our table for us. Amazing. The food tastes great! The fish was fresh. Just flakes of great fish. Batter wasn't too heavy. Just perfect. I asked for extra crispy and it was done perfectly. Great flavour. Fries were crispy also. Overall, very happy. Will def be back to try other menu items. Oh and the tarter sauce--- fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I'm not one for eating fish that often , but I decided to go in for lunch one day. I ordered the halibut and it came with fries. It only came with one fish filet on top of fries. The fries weren't anything to brag about, they were actually a little burnt. But I do think the halibut was a great choice. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll have to try another choice on the menu."}
{"text":"very good fish and chips.

so delicious. i didn't get to finish my fries but i took them with me and ate them my entire way home. fast service. people are friendly. not a lot of seating space. only bad thing there was no a/c. it was a very hot afternoon and trying to enjoy fried oily food was a bit hard. maybe i'll buy the food and ... go eat it somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the Calamari'N'Chips and honestly one of my least favourite calamari ever. It wasn't over cooked or anything but the batter has way to many spices and seasonings in it. It takes away from the flavour of the calamari itself which was disappointing. If I get fried calamari which is a favourite dish of mine I expect a lightly seasoned batter. Not something that requires me to have lots to drink to handle eating it. And the chips were mediocre at best which was also saddening because they looked so good.

On the other hand the portion size is huge. Which is cool. But I would honestly prefer good food over portion size.

I will probably not eat here again. Which is sad because I had high hopes for this quaint little fish and chips shop."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent fish taco for lunch and decided to give this cute neighbourhood place a try.  The portion was appropriate but the fish taco was disappointing. I thought it was tasteless, even with the homemade salsa. My bf's halibut was good because the batter was light but it was pricey for the what we got. The tastiest item on our plate was the tartar sauce."}
{"text":"I found this place while visiting downtown Toronto and looking for a restaurant on my way back to my hotel in the burbs. I had a craving for fish and chips! 

The service was great - the woman working the counter was friendly, explained the menu and was all around cheerful. 

The food was meh. I ordered the cod with fries. When she brought it to my table she said \"you got extra cod today - we thought it looked small so we added another piece, but it was actually a lot so lucky you.\" The thing is - it WASN'T a lot. It was just two very average size pieces of fish and a lot of fries. Meh.

The batter was not the best I've ever had, the fish seemed fresh, the fries were ok, but the prices are high for what you get. It wasn't anything to get excited about."}
{"text":"Had cod and halibut fish and chips. Was satisfied with both but I've tried a few better places in the city for fish and chips.

The potions and price were good. The fish was decent no complaints but again nothing special.

The fries were really good, although they were a bit too salty. 

This place is small with not much seating so you might be forced to get take-out if it gets really busy."}
{"text":"I've only had the fish tacos so I can't comment on anything else, but it's only because I can't not have them when I go there. Delicious! I'll try something else eventually..."}
{"text":"Working just down the street from 'Sandwich Alley' (though one by one they are being dismantled *tear*), can get a little dangerous. Especially when you think you're going to start on your healthy diet and start eating fish and hey look, there's TOTGA! You get lured in by their variations of fish on a salad, grilled on a bun - awesome you say! But then things turn for the worse, you see their fried calarami, deep fried crab cakes, and the show stopper - the fish basket (fish & chips + calamari + scallops + crab cakes) and then its just game over.

You had a good 5 minutes of healthy in your life but ultimately there's no holding back from the deliciousness that TOTGA can serve up! Everything they serve is delicious. I still wouldnt' consider any of it to be the 'best' fish and chips (still goes to Fresco), or the 'best' Fish sandwich (still goes to 'The Fish Store' on College) but TOTGA is still up there!

Quick friendly service (free fish & chips on their anniversary? hells yeah!) and good portions (except for maybe the fish salads, their grilled fish fillets are always a little on the small side) make this a place I come back to weekly.

I have to say though, if there's one thing that can leave you in that middle ground of your internal healthy fight, it's the fish tacos. You get the deep fried awesome fish, with some added veggie garnish (WIN - maybe? whatever I'l take it), and tasty sauce that make it probably my favourite thing on their menu.

So if you're in the area, staring down the Sandwich Alley trying to make a choice, just head into TOTGA, you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, however today the Halibut was over cooked and thus became a bit tough."}
{"text":"I was impressed with how juicy my fish turned out. 

I ordered the Barramundi salad and the seafood chowder. The salad vinaigrette was good - tangy, sweet, sour - topped with pine nuts. YUM!

The chowder was very hearty, filled with fish, vegetables, potatoes. It was a bit on the salty side for my personal preference, but it might have been the fact that it was on the stove for some time since I had a late dinner.

I like the presentation. It's simple. The take out containers are great. They are all recyclable. I personally don't like Styrofoam takeout containers.

I would love to come back to try the other dishes, especially the scallop and calamari. Heck, the tartar sauce for their fries will have my back *drool*

It's also nice to know that their bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"One of the places on King that opens until 10pm at night,so it's a good option to order take out when working late, or if you just want to sit in for a casual eat. 

They have a good selection of fish - from salmon, to pickerel, halabit, scallops, calamari, shrimp and baramundi - which I got. You also have the option of having your fish with chips, as a sandwich, wrap, or salad which I think is a good way to cater to everyone's tastes.

Being a salad junkie, I got the baramundi with my salad, which was supposed to come with dressing and mango salsa. with my dressing on the side, the fish was put in a separate take out container so the salad would not get soggy. Confirming whether or not I would get mango salsa, I was a little disappointed that they were \"out of season\" so they were offering beets instead, which I was okay with.

However, I wanted a side of manhattan clam chowder, and they were sold out of that... and the seafood chowder too... so that was a double downer.

Taking the salad back to the office, and wanting to get into the salad before it gets cold, I was extremely surprised to see the portion size of the salad... it was incredibly small like a SIDE salad that didn't even fill half of the small takeout box. I have to say that they grilled the fish very nicely. It was flaky and had very good flavours, but for $11, it was definitely not worth the price. 

Knowing all this, stick to the fish and chips because I'm sure you would get a larger portion of fries cheaper. 

............. the day after I got this salad, I got takeout from Utopia Cafe and the salad, no joke, was 3 - 4 times larger than the greens I got here. and I consider college still the main area of downtown so there is no reason the portion sizes should change this drastically,"}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant, my friend and I were both very lost what and how to order. Luckily, the worker was able to come by and explain it to us (although he was not the best at explaining, we got the idea LOL) and the food came out fairly earlier than we anticipated. 

The fish was nice and hot with the perfect amount of seasoning (not too much nor too little) and the fries were very crispy. It also had such satisfying portions my friend and I left the restaurant feeling stuffed! 

I would say the restaurant is a nice place to have a chat and eat with a friend especially in the summer time because you can walk around the city after to digest the big meal :)"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips. The fish is perfectly cook. I usually get the haddock and fries wth a side of Cole slaw. The fries are so tasty especially with dark vinegar. The fish is well seasoned, it doesn't have a fishy taste. The staff is super friendly. The portions size is huge they usually give you a nice long and thick piece of fish and it's lightly breaded not too much just right. For their anniversary they gave away free meals. Very generous gesture."}
{"text":"Came here during my stay in Toronto and I was looking forward to some seafood, after reading the reviews I made my decisions I walked about 15-20 min to get there once there I was the only person in the restaurant and when I was ready to order they were out of everything!!!! I mean what's the point of being open and not having food I was extremely disappointed after walking specifically to-get there."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: This is my first time having a lobster roll, so I nothing to base this one on besides my own opinion.


Got the Lobster Roll with fries, which is ONLY available on Wednesdays.
$15.99, for a small hotdog bun of lobster meat with a shit load of green onion on top. Served with fries. 

The lobster itself was flavorless, and really really tough.
The bun? WHY!!? It was a freakin' hot dog bun! 

They included a small container of butter. But it didn't do a thing for the tough, rubbery and tasteless lobster in a white hotdog bun.

Didn't even end up eating it. 
What a waste. 

That's all I can say about this.
NEVER EVER again."}
{"text":"Day-amn those are some tasty fish 'n chips right there. 

Choose your fish: haddock, cod, halibut, Arctic char or pickerel.

I chose cod. The batter was super crispy and the fish tasted very fresh. Great tartar sauce too. And the fries were also quite crispy and overall, well above average.

However, next time I would request extra lemon wedges because lemon juice is such a perfect complement to deep-fried fish. One wedge is just not enough."}
{"text":"I ordered the Halibut along with chips and was pretty damn satisfied. 
The halibut was great, average among other fish and chip joints I've been too, but the fries stood out.

A little on the pricey side for fish and chips with the halibut being $13.99.

Staff was super nice and very helpful so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Decent fish, ok chips, awful chowder. Feels like a few pieces of overcooked seafood mixed with potatoes and water mixed in a blender. No seasoning and grainy texture."}
{"text":"The death of good service has been greatly exaggerated...at least within the confines of this King West seafood restaurant. 

I had seen in the cover of the most recent copy of NOW an article about Toronto's best fish and chips, and on that list was The One That Got Away. Seeing as it's close to where I live and I had a friend visiting who was in the mood for some battered fish, we decided to give it a shot.

First off (and no disrespect to NOW), the review had said that the prices were high but the portions generous. The portions are generous, but the prices are NOT high. I don't get what people are talking about when they say that. It's a fish and chips/seafood joint on King West, and it's only $9 for Haddock and $9.50 for Cod. That's outstanding for anywhere, let alone this part of Toronto. It was some of the most fairly priced fish and chips I've had in the last 8 years. And it's delicious. Perfectly battered and not over fried, the fries as well a crispy consistency of golden flavor. Not east coast good, but still very, very good. 

The atmosphere is nice. Quiet, clean, comfortable tables. Clearly marked places to put your trays after you're done eating. Clean and simple.

Last but not least, the service. It was top shelf. I called ahead to see if reservations were required. The girl I spoke to politely told me the restaurant doesn't take reservations as it has a 20 seat capacity, and that once I saw it I'd understand. She was right, it's cozy, but like I said, comfortable. When we arrived there were a couple tables free and bar stool seating at the front. And the staff (we only spoke to girl at counter) were top notch. She was friendly, explained the menu to me (after I was dumbfounded that fish and chips in Toronto was $9.00), and brought the food to our table in quick time.

From what I've seen, this is the best deal you can get on good fish and chips in the city.

Totally worth the visit. GO NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  We had a craving for fish & chips relatively late and this joint was open until 10pm.

It's a tad pricey but portions are big.  Oddly, the fries were the highlight of the haddock & chips ($9) - a bit salty, but crispy and good flavour.  The haddock was overpowered by the batter.

We also split the fish basket ($16) which was a mound of fries, calamari and a smaller cut of haddock, some slaw and two pieces of scallop and shrimp each (come on, son!).  The fries and calamari are good - a bit shortchanged oh the shrimp and scallop - but it's decent value.  It's a lot of food and if I could do it again, we should have just ordered the fish basket to split.

Again, not great or bad.  Just open late and big portions of greasy fried stuff."}
{"text":"Good value for money and its location  (King West : where everything - including egos - is usually inflated!) . Fish and chips. This one had a good taste to it not bland, which was my biggest fear. Fish was meaty not greasy. 

The coleslaw was real, not of the plastique astroturf type (I'm looking at you, Col. Sanders of my youth).

The takeout bag was chock full with condiments, napkins and kit. 
For $10 + tax you are left completely full.

Any plans for a liquor licence? I was thinking an ale would go well with it."}
{"text":"Great really casual place for a quick bite. Had the fish basket (shrimp, scallops, calamari, etc.) and was thoroughly satisfied! Would go back!"}
{"text":"Had the fish platter which comes w/ two each haddock strips, shrimp, scallops and some squid. The batter could've been lighter and crisper and they could've used fresher oil, but my biggest complaint was it was more chips than fish. In total, it was a pretty full serving of food, but it could've been tastier. My other complaint was the complete lack of deep fried Mars bars."}
{"text":"Small but very well decorated. Pleasant staff and very fast service. I had the halibut tacos and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"We actually wound up at The One That Got Away by accident. We'd originally planned to hit another fish and chips joint, but it was closed even though it was a Sunday.

Anyway, we found ourselves looking for a relatively close fish and chips place and The One That Got Away was the winner.

It's a small, unassuming place, and you place your order (and pay) at the counter and then wait for your food to be brought to you. Service was fast and efficient.

I decided to go with the Cod and Chips, since they were sold out of Halibut.

The food is quite good. The fish is lightly breaded and cooked perfectly, although I was a little disappointed by the somewhat puny size of my piece. The fries are also quite tasty, even though they were way, way, way too salty. (I basically had to drown them in ketchup to disguise the intense saltiness.)

I've also gotta give a special shout-out to the house-made tartar sauce, which is among the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Finally a good fish and chip place in Bloor West!  Had the haddock and chips and fish tacos. Nummy!  Fish is nice and crispy (not oily at all) and the chips are perfect. Definitely be going here lots!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. So far I have tried their:
1) Barramundi Sandwich
2) Fish and Chips w/ Haddock
3) Fish Tacos
4) Coleslaw

Of these I really loved the Barramundi Sandwich the best. It had lots of flavour and was well put together. I had been looking for a good fish sandwich for a while and this fit the bill.

The tacos were also really good but a bit pricey (around $12 plus tax). Fortunately the portion is a really good size so its somewhat worth it.

The coleslaw as an add-on is well worth it. I love a good coleslaw and think theirs is really nice (not the creamy style).

The Fish and Chips I found were just ok which kinda shocked me as this is what they are supposed to be known for.  Anyway if I go back I am going to have to try one of their wraps to get a good coverage of the entire menu."}
{"text":"Would have been 4 stars if the fish was as good as the rest of the seafood it offers! 

We ordered the COD AND FRIES ($9.49) and the FISH BASKET ($15.99) which included shrimp, scallops, calamari, haddock, fries and coleslaw.

Personally, for a fish and chips place, I didn't think the cod or haddock was that memorable. The batter kept falling off and it got really messy with flakes of fish and batter here and there. You couldn't really taste the fish cause there was just too much batter which is a shame considering they use ONLY sustainable fish.

BUT, the scallops, shrimps and calamari STOLE the show. A nice thin crispy batter that didn't hide the delicious the lovely taste of the seafood one bit. The calamari and scallops are a must-get!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for your fish and chip fix in the West end. I ordered the cod and chips for $9.49 since the halibut and chips was a whopping $13.99! 

Fish was good,  battered perfectly and held shape by the time I got back to the office. I was a little disappointed that there was only one piece and the fish seemed so small but I think it's because it wasn't heavily battered like typical pubs. 

The fries were quite good - crispy and not so greasy.  It was actually the perfect amount of fish to fries,  without feeling to oily. 

Not a bad place but I'd still venture out for a more authentic fish and chip experience."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite today - been meaning to try the fish tacos for a LONG time.

We had an order of the 3 Fish Tacos and an order of Seafood Chowder. 

I honestly found the fish tacos to be a little lack-luster. The fish was nice and crispy, and the tacos included salsa and mayo-based filling - but there wasn't a lot of flavour to speak of.

I would come back to try the Fish and Chips, which seems to have seen better reviews. Hopefully a better experience next time!"}
{"text":"Bonus star whenever you offer delivery for fish and chips, wished we had that lol.

In the busy area of King (well, what isn't) so convenient to walk to, though not for big groups, just a handful of 2-seaters.

Unfortunately, the best were sold out at lunch, kinda surprising, only 12:30pm.. No Haddock.  Went with the good old fashioned cod.

The batter was light and crispy, and not oily at all.  But the fries--this, along with the homemade tartar sauce, are the winners ;)  

Pretty fast, felt guilty as they bring out the food to you.  Their credit card machine didn't have a tip option, so Mr. Owner, may be a good idea to re-program this in.

Surprising, Amex good."}
{"text":"I had the Fish Tacos yesterday, and they were great! I would definitely get them again. I plan on trying the Pickerel next time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was only one other table there aside from us. Decided to order the fish tacos and the fried haddock sandwich. 
The fish taco was nothing spectacular, batter was quite good, but it seemed like they used one fish and cut it into three pieces. Sauce was not very flavourful and it was quite pricey for 3 small tacos. On the other hand, the haddock sandwich was quite good, enjoyed the light batter and the bun was soft. However, one downfall was that there was no sauce in the sandwich, not even tartar sauce! I had to use ketchup to make it taste a little moist and to have some flavour. 
Don't think I will be making a trip all the way down to this place again. 
For cheaper and better quality fish-and-chips, I suggest going to Fresco's fish and chip at Kensington market."}
{"text":"I have a hard time giving this place a two because: The staff are incredible.  They're really nice, and charming folks.  I want to love this place.  But here's the thing - the food?  It's not so great.

I had the basket, which had scallops and squid and fish and shrimp.  The coleslaw wasn't great - it's like what I make at home, because I don't take time to let the flavours merge together, and become awesome.  It was basic.  The shrimp seemed to be fried too long, same as the scallops - they were somewhat burnt.

The squid was ok, but without flavour.  It almost tastes like everything is fried together, without any changing of the oil.

The fish?  The fish was good.  I might go back and just have a fish and chips - and then I'll have to re-review, because the fish aspect really was a true delight.  But everything else?  Kind of a let down.

Still - people come in all the time to pick up food, so there has to be something going for it.

Probably the fish.

Also the fries were great."}
{"text":"Fast service but very small piece of fish. We ordered one cod and one salmon, both pieces were very small. Better fish n' chips in the city."}
{"text":"Moderately priced seafood in an old-fashioned environment. I typically get the seafood platter (that includes all kinds). The food is quite yummy, however can get a bit salty. Staff is quite nice and seating is limited.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place has a nice modern atmosphere, the girl at the counter was very helpful in showing us how the menu works. The food came out fairly quick and was very well done."}
{"text":"I got take out for this place so will give a summary of that and not pay attention to service or the actual location.

For $11 I ordered grilled haddock and fries.  The portion of fish was tiny but tasty.  (maybe they should consider changing the container to make it seem bigger).  The fries were extremely greasy.  - Take a look at the pictures

I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"First off, amazing fries! Also the fish was what you would expect from a hunk of fried fish. It was really yummy. I would definitely come back for all of my fish n chips needs. And they have fish tacos after 2pm! So I want to check that out. But after reading about Chippy's and their downfall from grace I decided to give this place my business instead and I was not disappointed.

It's a great place to stop by on a rainy night. The atmosphere of the restaurant suits it."}
{"text":"This is the best place for fresh seafood and impeccable customer service! Their grilled salmon burgers with salad are healthy and delicious! Crab cakes are uber authentic and haddock with chips is sure to please."}
{"text":"Good chips, fish wasn't very crispy, breading detached very easily. Ketchup had an overly tomato-y taste. Malt vinegar and sriracha available are a good thing."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the over reviewers here; great staff but meh food. 
We ordered the halibut with fries, coleslaw and calamari. The halibut was over cooked, the calamari was too salty and the coleslaw wasn't anything special. My cousin did not enjoy her fries. 

I have to admit, after hearing good reviews about the other location, I was eager to try it out once they opened up in my area but I was disappointed with my experience. 

Maybe it's because they're still working out the kinks? I would try it again, but probably go with a different selection next time around."}
{"text":"The place is small and best for take out. But it is fast and fresh! The food isn't overly greasy and tastes fantastic! 

The service is usually friendly enough, as it isn't a sit down place. There are about five tables to eat at along a bench on the wall, it definitely not a group spot. But if you are hungry and in the mood for fish and chips, you cannot go wrong here! The dishes are also really affordable! Two people can get fish and chips for under 25$ (tax included!) and The servings are also large enough that if you arent that hungry, one serving can feed two people! 

Totally worth stopping in for a bite!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Great friendly service! Not really well lit outside, I had a difficult time finding this place but am I ever glad that I did! Friendly service and very yummy fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Great place - but i don't see what all the fuss is about. It's a little cute restaurant with a good focus and some good flavours."}
{"text":"We've been permanent customers of this place for the last two years. Came for lunch, dinner, tried pretty much everything on the menu: fish and chips, wraps, salads, fish tacos and basket, halibut, cod, pickerel, salmon, trout, crab cakes, calamari, lobster rolls on Wednesdays, grilled or fried, you name it.... You can order it with salad, fries or half/half. Fantastic. Ask for chipotle mayo with your fish and chips. Simply, the best!

Always absolutely fresh, impeccably prepared and absolutely delicious. Oh, and don't forget seafood and Manhattan chowders. Very yummy and generous portions.

I must say that Neil and the team are doing amazing job, great food, very tasty. Very friendly, efficient service. Kudos!  You rock guys!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
It's really cute in here. Light and airy. Tin ceilings. We got take-out so I didn't really look around too much. It's nice for a casual eat. 

THE GOODS
I heard mixed feelings about the halibut and chips so I opted for the halibut sandwich. It was DELISH! The halibut wasn't fried; it was grilled and came on a nice bun with a butter that tasted a bit like garlic bread (which I love). Fresh tomato, lettuce and mayo were added but didn't take away from the fish. I highly recommend the sandwich. It's a bit pricey at $12 for the size but for the quality, I'll pay and I'd have it again. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
If you're looking for a quick bite in the King and Portland/Bathurst area, don't let this one get away (cue symbols)."}
{"text":"Lobster Roll Wednesday - thats all you need to know! Ok ok, the fish-n-chips are great too, as are the fish tacos with the diced mangoes!"}
{"text":"Visited again last night and this time tried the Fish Burger. Holy crap it was amazing. It tasted like a fancy version of a McDonalds Fish Burger but 1000000000 x better. The chips are also amazing and the clam chowder was delish. We will be back."}
{"text":"i'm not a fish and chips expert, but i've been to many places in the toronto and this amongst the top three (reliable and british style being the other two). the fish is fresh and the batter is fluffy and crunchy. 

the décor is fine, but usually i just eat in the nearby park."}
{"text":"I had a long layover in Toronto, so decided to head into the city to get some coffee and grub. I ended up eating at The One That Got Away for lunch and dinner that day and even went back on my return layover two weeks later. It was that good. The service was also great. Phil, who happened to be working both days I went, was friendly and helpful. I'll definitely stop by again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I would have liked to have given this establishment a higher rating, because the food was actually quite delicious (particularly the mango salsa). Unfortunately, when they neglect to make 1/2 your order? That's rather a bother. 

I had ordered dinner for 5 and sent my sister to go and pick it up (about a 15 minute walk away). When she returned, they had only put 1/2 of the order into the bag! I called to alert them of their error and they tried to pin the mistake on me, claiming that I neglected to order 1/2 our dinner. Riiiiighhhttt...

They ended up not charging us for the forgotten food, but we still had to walk all the way back to the restaurant to pick it up. 

Another delightful tidbit? Upon picking up the 2nd batch of food the girl behind the counter informed us that she had a bad case of food poisoning and had been stuck in the bathroom all evening. Yum. Totally the mental image I want right before I'm about to chow down."}
{"text":"What a treat! Loved these fish tacos and so authentic with the newspapers - my friend good the halibut tho soo good too!"}
{"text":"Everything here was great, friendly staff, quick service, great fish and chips, amazing calamari. I miss having Chippy's over in the Annex, but this was great. Love it, would love to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to TOTGA location on King West before so I was excited to see this branch open up in Bloor West.

We decided to get the Fish Basket ($18.99) which contained shrimps, scallops, calamari, haddock, fries and coleslaw so we could try a bit of everything.  The basket came with 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 scallops, a handful of calamari, 1 piece of haddock, a small handful of fries and a very tiny container of coleslaw.  It also came with 2 containers of tartar sauce.

I found the food a little over deep fried.  The batter coating was very dark and hard.  Either the oil is too hot or maybe it was left in the deep fryer a bit too long.  I think that there are better fish and chip places in our area that I'd rather frequent.  I'm letting this one get away."}
{"text":"Batter - yes! Tartar - yes! Fresh fish - yep. chips - mmmm.

So these guys do fish and chips really well - the haddock is a great option and $4 cheaper than the halibut option at $9 vs $13 or something.  BUT, here's a good tip!

An extra piece of fish is only $6 for any order and it can be any type of fish. Sooooooo basically buy the haddock at $9 and then order a second piece of halibut for $6 and you just saved like $4 on paying for that super expensive halibut. 

You're welcome!"}
{"text":"The One That Got In My Mouth. 

I'm starting my lunch sessions in this area and this had to be on my list. Fish and chips are a must for Fred Leong and hearing that this is arguably the best downtown, it was first on the list. 

Let's start with the fish... The batter was nice and crispy and the fish was moist - exactly how I like my fish. It's also a generous size for one piece so that's nice. But! The chips were honestly the more memorable part of the meal. I typically try to share my fries but these disappeared in an instant. 

Side note: Ritual ease of use is great. Walk up to the counter and tell them your name and it's all good. Grab the drinks yourself."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from the gym to cash in my fabfind coupon. It's more of a take away place but they do have seating for 10-12 diners. 

The counter guy was very friendly and you can see into the kitchen for a good view of what the kitchen staff is up to. Everything is clean & tidy looking with cute fish & chip shop themed decor.

This place basically has 5-6 kinds of fish, which can be purchased FRIED with chips (fish & chips) or grilled and served in a wrap, sandwich or on salad. They also do fried calamari, fried shrimp and fried scallops which can be combined with either chips, in a wrap, sandwich or salad.

I like that they do some healthy options; not all fish & chip shops do salads.

I tried a barrimundi salad and a shrimp salad. Everything here is made fresh, so you wait 5-10 mins for your food. The salads were huge but the fish portions were a bit small. My barrimundi filet was probably 4-5 oz and the shrimp salad came with 5 large battered/fried shrimps. Came with tartar sauce, salad dressing and a mango salsa on the side.

Food was quite delicious but it's just slightly overpriced for my liking (menu items are between $7.99-$13.99 or so plus tax), so -1 star for that."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos based on the reviews here. They were really disappointing. All of the flavour came from the salsa verde. The price point is confusing too, $11.85 for three small pieces of Basa, the cheapest fish and no sides. That's more expensive than the salmon burger with fries. If they insist on charging that much, I suggest they: replace the flavourless iceberg lettuce with anything else and replace the cheap basa with haddock or at least give the customer a choice.

Update September 2013:
I didn't put up a separate update because my star rating remains the same. I ordered the Fish Basket and wasn't impressed. The halibut was horribly tasteless. The calamari had some weird rubber band thing that I've never experienced with calamari anywhere else. The fries were rubbish. I threw the coleslaw out because it was put in the same basket as all the hot food and that should not be the case for takeout...The only good thing was the scallops! So I've given this place another fair chance, sorry guys you're not for me. 

I'm letting this fish get away."}
{"text":"Have been here for fish n chips numerous times (just because it is so close) every time being more and more disappointed. Fries are good but fish is small and not battered very well. Think I've given them enough tries to honestly say that is the best they are capable of and move on to another place."}
{"text":"The cashier was very nice and greeted you once you walked in.

We ordered the fish tacos and fillet a fish with chips. Both were really good and fresh. I would definitely come back to try their fish and chips as well another order of the fillet a fish(it's awesome!).

I highly recommend this place for those who craves a good fish burger!!"}
{"text":"Arctic char sandwich was excellent. Flavourful yet light...and frankly it was huge. Good music, clean space and appropriate fish house design. It has a great window to sit at and watch the world walk by."}
{"text":"3.5 and rounded up cuz my friend said he'd eat here everyday. 

The three of us got to share:
- fish platter: deep fried haddock, shrimp, scallop, calamari, and fries. My favourite was the calamari...seasoned so well! It also came with coleslaw and tartar sauce. 
- fish cake with some greens: sooooo good. essentially a mixed of seasoning, haddock, and potatoes. that really made our meal. it was all of our favourite.

The price was right too. The three of us for about 23 dollars and we walked out really full. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The service was good and friendly, and the food quite delicious.  I would want to go back to this or a branch of this place sometime.  They have different kinds of fish you can choose from for your fish meal and some quite pricey.  Both the soup and calamari were tasty.  You're probably going to get salad in some way so don't order it separately."}
{"text":"Contrary to all the popular menu items that other's tried, I opted for the salmon burger as the healthier option.

The salmon MELTED in my mouth, the bun was so soft, and the condiments added (aioli mayo) was just the right amount. I loved it. The salmon burger is two thumbs up!
I ordered it with fries, it wasn't anything to rave about, it was just good.

The server was helpful and cool.

The interior design was nice, i loved the brick walls and the window that could peer into the kitchen to watch while the chef's make your food. Nice and casual resto to dine in.

I will definitely come back to try the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"The most disgusting Halibut & Fries, guess the fish got away and the crap remained. I would highly recommend the Sea-witch as you don't get recycled fries. Can't believe we wasted good money and the management claimed they cook it the right way. An insult to Fish & Chips lovers. X off my list for sure. They deserve zero stars."}
{"text":"I always saw this place when I was on King Streetcar heading home. However every time if I was walking by this place was always closed at late night. Finally I made it a destination of my date and was well worth it. 

This place is a very small but cute and tidy. Everything inside decorated like from fishmen home. They serve like 5 different fresh fish, I tried the cod fish with fries. It was DELICIOUS!! Cod fish is like my favorite thing aside from Sea Bass which recently has  law of banning them being served. Cod fish is thick, yet tender, juicy and flaky. Piece of heaven for fish lovers. 

The dish serves with HUGE amount of fries. For a person who normally eat relatively healthy and clean, it's a lot of oil and saturated fat at once.  haha,,,,but I can handle it once a while. If I had two stomachs, I would have ordered one more order of the fish and chips!

On Wednesdays they have lobster special. They only make lobster wraps on Wednesdays from what I was told by the person working there. They would prepare bunch of fresh lobsters in the morning, and often they are sold out in the afternoon. I will definitely try to check it out next time. 

Make sure go before 9:30pm. They close at 10."}
{"text":"Walked into lou dawgs (bbq place next door) on a lazy sunday and decided to get the hell out of there and checkout what else was available on king west. Stumbled by this place and thought i'd try it out. Pretty simple menu but inventive at the same time. Had a halibut wrapped which was really good. I think i had coleslaw which was also pretty good. friends fries were good and crunchy. 4 stars because it was better then OK but no 5 because it just wasn't AWESOME! but good."}
{"text":"Opted for a late take-out lunch. Ordered the a seafood chowder and Arctic Char and chips. Chowder tasted good and was hearty -- packed with fish, scallops, clams, shrimp and potatoes -- but the broth could've definitely been thicker and creamier. 

Arctic char was very good and the fish itself was decent, not just an excuse to eat fried batter. That said, the coating was crispy and oily without being greasy. Fries were disappointing as they were dried out and lacking a crunchy exterior, though they did look good...and probably tasted better a few hours earlier, before they went under a heat lamp.

Overall, I'd recommend and would definitely return. But it didn't stand out."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good fish sandwich this is the place. Also the lobster roll on Wednesday is phenomenal. The salad accompanying the fish is tasty and always fresh. A favorite healthy meal when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a healthier quick lunch.
They have a great selection of fish where you could have in a wrap, in a sandwich, in a salad or as fish & chips.
My favorite is the grilled pickerel in a wrap where it is mixed with greens and a fresh and tangy salsa.

The fish (which I believe are all sustainable species) is fresh and good quality, so it's well worth what you are paying."}
{"text":"I was so eminently disappointed by my last visit here, I need to update my review. I had promised a splendid fishery to a non-yelping friend based TOTGA's fairly deece rating. Now mine and Yelp's reputation is ruined. Thanks a lot guys. 

It started when we both ordered the fish tacos. Though the orders were punched in at the same time, mine took a staggering 25 minutes longer than my dining partner's. As we waited, I could espy a noticeable lack of hubbub in the kitchen. One guy was doing salad prep and another washing dishes. What about my tacos?

The cashier probably heard my silent (yet potent) seething, when an order placed after mine came out first. \"I don't know why they're being so slow today,\" she shrugged. Please note that she mused about this Pressing Quandary not six feet from the kitchen staff. Why not ask them? 

It wasn't until another cook emerged from the basement that the second order of tacos in their batch was undertaken. From soup to nuts I spent 30 torturous minutes in this establishment, waiting for a trio of fish tacos. 

And the real reason I'm writing this review? They weren't even that good. Normally delicious food will dissolve my hanger (hunger/anger) and make a long wait seem like a trivial happenstance. Not this time. The scar of my long wait time was rejuvenated upon tasting those bland soft fish tacos on tortillas that could barely stay together. Never again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food here and the place seemed really cozy. I asked which was the more popular option and the cashier advised me about the halibut and cod for the fish and chips so I ordered the cod. My batter was very crispy and light, the fish felt a tiny bit lost but the fries were amazing. I didn't need much to compliment my meal but I did squeeze the lemon over the cod and dipped respectfully in the tartar sauce. Will come back and try the halibut and hopefully it stands out a bit more."}
{"text":"Updated review. from negative to positive.
 The portions may not be huge and the prices may be a little high but the quality is always second to none. The owner and staff are always friendly and it's a great place to grab lunch in the King West area."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Not overly friendly and the food is bland. Actually all of us who went felt terrible a few hours later. I don't understand the hype.  Most pubs have better fish and chips. I had the basket which was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Damn good fish and chips. I made my first visit here after hearing such good things about this place for a while. I ordered the fish basket which had Haddock(best I've ever had, so meaty. Better than stuff at the eastern passage, ns), shrimp, scallops, calamari, fries and slaw. I ordered take out since the place was kinda busy for a monday evening at 7pm. 

Opened up the bag and it came with everything you would need to have a seat in the park(ketchup, malt vinegar, napkins and a folk/knife combo). Always a plus. Everything above was deep fried and delicious minus the coleslaw and scallops. I might have been spoiled recently in having such delightful scallops at Woodlot that made these taste kinda gross. The slaw is missing some flavour, too bland of a vinegar or oil. Another thing I love is the different batters for each fish. 

This place holds it down for one of the best fish and chips spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Was craving old fashioned fish and chips. Stopped in for take out. Ordered the halibut with chips. Perfectly deep fried just enough batter. Delicious the best I've had in many years.  Melt in your mouth!!!  Fries with the peel. Wonderful. I will be back."}
{"text":"2 out of 5...find out why...below
I like to have dinner dates with my friends...about once a month or whenever I can.
I believe in reviewing establishments for good and for bad because people need to know 
Once my group of friends got together we entered the establishment. A little bit bigger then the average hole in the wall...might fit 18 people at best case. I was instantly taken back by the massive chalkboard behind the cashier, I also took notice of a few items being scratched out for the evening. I let my significant other order first. The conversation went as follows
Hi can I have the fish basket
I'm sorry we are out of shrimp...*insert a small chuckle fro! The cashier (proceeded to mark shrimp off the board)
Well can you substitute for something else?
No (didn't apologize...chuckled again)
Well OK. At this point no discount of any sort was offered.
A cook from the back yelled out that they were out of coleslaw as well
The cashier laughed a bit more then a chuckle and crossed out coleslaw.
At which point the cashier offered more tartar sauce as a substitute
To which point my s.o ordered the salmon burger with fries, having been upset about the fish basket situation this was her other choice.

My experience wasn't as a polling, but slightly disappointing 
I ordered the pickerel wrap w a side order of large fries...was a bit of a shock to find out that they didn't have gravy...of any sort...just tartar sauce , different mayos, and salsas.
I went with pico de gallo...which turned out to be full of cilantro, which I hate.
7-10 minutes for hot food was worth the wait 
The flavors of the fish I had was amazing...the fries were excellent and a good portion...but no gravy!
Everyone of my friends had enjoyed the flavors of the food...minus the missing items on the menu for that night.

I was very happy with the taste of my food...but the customer service in regards to how the \"sold out\" Items, left me with a bad taste in my mouth
No substitutes, no discounts, just more tartar sauce...which let's be real...costs no5hing

I probably won't be back to this location, but I am willing to try the bloor st location"}
{"text":"Got away eh?  I'd let the line out on this one...

I'm gonna keep this one brief since it's hard to go on about disappointment.

The place has a nice ambiance to it and it's bright and inviting.  The staff are also friendly and courteous, but it just doesn't really amount to the disappointment really.

Being a place that specializes in Fish and Chips, you'd think that they would have a good handle on it.  To my bitter disappointment these were hardly up to par to some fish fry shacks I've visited.  I opted for the halibut and chips - and I'll give you that the fries were decent.  The fish however was a completely different matter.  The batter was thick, bland and with no character at all.  And it seemed the fish was way overcooked to the point where it was a bit tough and dry.  So part of me questions whether it's the quality of the halibut (and possibly the other selections) before the fry.  Because let's face it, you can deep fry almost anything and it'll most likely be a tasty mess.

In the end, I'm glad I got to try it out, but they'll be the ones fishing for me if they want my business again."}
{"text":"Walked in because they had a sign outside that said, \"salmon sandwiches\" and I wanted one! But we actually forgot about that until we walked out and saw the sign again haha.

Anyways, so me and my boyfriend shared the Fish Basket (check it out on their website, bottom left), and it was sooooo goooodddddd

Their fries were wonderfullllll, definitely salty though.. but I kinda ignored that. Scallops were SOO yummy! So fresh and so THE BEST :) And the calamari was nicely seasoned. But the haddock was only alright....

The place looked so adorable! Loved the decorations! I had no problems sitting on their metal chairs. The waitress was expressionless, but wasn't mean."}
