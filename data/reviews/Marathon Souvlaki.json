{"text":"Best Greek food in town! The service is great,  the staff is friendly and the food is awesome. I always choose this place"}
{"text":"Très bon repas. J'y suis allé un midi où on offrait un spécial gyro pite pour 11,50. Assiette très généreuse. Par contre, le riz goute un peu la cafétéria (les assaisonnements goutent artificiels) et les patates n'étaient pas très bonnes (trop cuite et on dirait que l'huile devait être changée). Je recommande malgré tout! La salade maison est excellente."}
{"text":"Had the fried zucchini which was drenched in oil. They were uneatable. The feta cheese tasted like cardboard. There is no way this is even cheese. The souvlaki in a pita was decent. The restaurant was a complete mess. The restaurant was maybe 20% full but there was food everywhere on the floor. You think the half dozen or so of waiters would have cleaned up a bit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite greek restaurant. Since I was a young boy, I have always loved the gyro, souvlaki, tzaziki and fries well done in a paper bag on the side. To this day it's the first place I say when someone says where we going for dinner."}
{"text":"Good place for a good meal.  Prices have gone up recently and portions smaller.  Love their salad dressing."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded for lunch and dinner...

Quantiy of food for the price is good. same with the quality....
Poor Customer service.....and slow servie...

From last experience, ...we didn't get our food for 45 mins......got there prior to rush hour...and waiter keep saying sorry..(atleast he said sorry, usually tehy don't )
BUt once we ready to pay u gotta wait another 20mins for this guy to come arround with the bill.....

Place is clean and neat and good for a group and couples....

I still go there because i like the food.....ONLY food...If I can order without looking at their face...i will lv it more"}
{"text":"Running out of Gyros on a thursday night ?? really ?? extremely disappointing. we came for their main dish and they ran out of it."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere! Busy place and good customer service. Prices are affordable and had a good time"}
{"text":"Among the good places in montreal for Greek food. Really good souvlaki pitas, and even has options for vegetarians. Would come again."}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day, I would! This place is great for comfort food. The portions are huge and the prices are great. I always go for the souvlaki pita plate because it's so good. I once had the fried calamari, but it was only ok... The garlic bread that they serve at the beginning of your meal is also really good, but it seems like the bread was better a few years back than it was now.This restaurant is always packed, so try to get there early if you want to avoid the wait. The service is surprisingly fast even when the place is full."}
{"text":"Expensive with slow service the one in Laval is better I found to much chicken base in the chicken as it was very yellow"}
{"text":"the service here is lighting fast!!!

If i grade with service it's 4 stars, but I only do the food so 3 stars.

We came, we ordered, we ate, and we left all within 25 minutes!!!

The fried calamari is standard taste wise, it hit the spot, except it comes with cocktail sauce and not tartar sauce, and no lemon wedge.

The doner pita/gyro. The tzatziki sauce is a bit mild for me i would have liked more salt and tang. The doner meat was very good though fresh and juicy.

Definitely recommend this place for a quick eat, there's always a lineup but it moves very fast.

very nice I like it very much"}
{"text":"Great value for your money! I had the chicken pita platter with the Marathon salad, and half portion of fries and rice. Excellent! The chicken pieces were big and juicy. Service was quick. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good service at Marathon, located by Baton Rouge. The beef gyro was tasty, made relatively quickly, and was fresh. The Greek salad was good too. It's rare to find hot sauce in Canada other than Tabasco, so that'd be a nice addition. But this is a place to get food quickly, that's not fast food"}
{"text":"Their Filet Mignon Brochette Plate was pretty good including the fries and their house salad. This is the only thing I order here after trying their other dishes which are pretty plain but they are a franchise so it's expected.

Seating and Service are good."}
{"text":"Marathon's is a great family restaurant. The food and portion sizes are satisfying. The staff is pleasant. The food is great. It's a quick bite, as well as a nice sit down. I recommended any of the franchises. Try the Chicken or pork Souvlaki !"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Eat in and take out. Great service. Great food! Never disappointed. The BEST souvlaki and the best baklava in town!"}
{"text":"Marathon is consistent and delicious. I come here with my family every time I'm in Montreal. I always get the double stick dinner and I think the food has actually gotten better overtime. When I was there last, the chicken sticks were noticeably larger. Always stuffed when I leave and am very pleased with the overall food and service."}
{"text":"First experience was great.
It is a franchise --and offers some Greek specialities.

Service is present, courteous and fast.i didn't have to request to get something. The waiter on that night was the one requesting me whether I needed something and proceeded to get it done on the go.

Food was not bad. The establishment is not cheap --we had enough meat for two for under 30$. For instance , the calamari plate was not the best , but it was good and not oily , this is a big plus as you don't feel completely drained and dead after your meal. The souvlaki pitas had enough meat and plenty of sauce for one to be satisfied. Their fries tasted like potatoes chips cooked in the oven--so goood. As for the Greek salad , wasn't great but it wasn't bad.

Anyway , I felt like the reviews for the restaurant did not do justice. Indeed, marathon souvlaki is an excellent restaurant with Greek specialities, if is affordable and you feel like a customer that they want you to come back for another visit , which I personally will."}
{"text":"Wonderful Greek cuisine we had the chicken and the pork with with chocolate cake for dessert"}
{"text":"Very good (both locations I've tried... Des jockeys and des sources). 
Service ranges from super friendly to curt and a bit impolite. But overall, good enough that I return often. 
Food is consistent. Well oiled machine. You go in knowing what you'll get. That's important because no one likes being disappointed. They have a fairly small menu and that helps keep consistent plates coming out of this bustling place. 
It's noisy. It's packed. It's not a date place. It's just good, reasonably priced Greek food. I always order the veggie pitas and even my carnivore friends agree it is so well put together and tasty that they don't miss the meat. Dip your fries in tzaziki and you're a happy person."}
{"text":"Just took my Greek girlfriend to this restaurant. Right off the bat we didn't feel that welcome. Nobody talked to us until we got our orders taken, but even then the waiter barely said anything. We never got asked for drinks, but since everybody else was drinking water I assume they didn't get drink orders either. 

I ordered the Calamari and she ordered the Souvlaki Pita. We did enjoy the food, however the portion sizes were huge and we barely finished. 

I would give Marathons 3.5 simply because of how fast the food came out and the taste. Yet the service and portion size brings it all way down. We may go back, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the immediate area and a pretty good Greek resto overall!"}
{"text":"Our place to go to for Greek food.  Love the souvlaki and the salads are great!!!  This is our go to place for Greek cuisine.  Never fails...  You must give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"it has been a while, so i forgot the taste of the food, but the quantity was definitely worth the price: i couldn't even finish the whole thing by myself!"}
{"text":"The food they serve is in so way real Greek food, they don't even attempt authenticity. If you're okay with eating extremely Americanized generic \"Greek\" food then sure go to marathons but in comparison to real Greek cuisine it's seriously beyond awful. They shouldn't call it Greek it's just American with tsatziki on it. Decent price wouldn't pay more than that for the quality they deliver."}
{"text":"Good place for large group but food was okay.  The lamb chops were fatty and gyro dry.  Their fresh fries were the best part of the meal!  Baklava was old, hard and chewy.  Not worth the $4!"}
{"text":"Fully renovated 2015

More seats. Same great food.  I don't see why they have renovated since the place was already clean and well maintained. A classic in Greek food, I am going there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Giving away four stars is not what I expected but how could I not? My clean plate at the end of the meal is clear evidence that this place is worth it. 

Sure, the menus are laminated and the hostess may not give you any warmth at the door but wait until you get to the table. Our server was attentive and had a good sense of humour to keep up with my family. He even upgraded our tzatziki to an extra large and brought us more to take home. 

For something like $10.75, I got a chicken stick platter. Attractive title! Forget that, it comes with your choice of a Greek salad or \"Marathon\" salad, which is the same thing with lettuce. One last choice, rice vs. fries. For me, I didn't have to make many choices by going for the Greek salad with half rice and half fries. Three sides!  
Fries: Thick potato discs, not too greasy, not traditional French fries, delicious. 
Rice: No complaints! Some spices and parsley throughout, nicely cooked. 
Greek salad: Hefty cuts of tomato and cucumber with slivered onions and just a few olives. Really enjoyed the dressing and letting the rice soak some of it up. 
Chicken: Unfortunately my least favourite? Great grill marks but was a tad dry. 

It was enormous portion but that didn't matter to me! I loved all the combinations that I could make, especially with a side of tzatziki. I had all the classics in one place and at a low price. Woo!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Marathon Souvlaki. I came for lunch with a co-worker and ordered the gyro lunch plate. It was HUGE! It came with salad, bread, potatoes and I ordered tzatiki on the side for $1 (worth it)!

The place was busy at lunch, however we were seated quickly, food came fast, and we got take-out boxes with ease.

Check this place out for a quick, delicious, fairly priced lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go for Greek food! Like the fries and gyro pita there. The service is ok. The waitress seldom come to check on us. Will go back if have any more Greek food cravings"}
{"text":"Good family dining.  A bit loud and crowded.  The food was nice; good flavors and nice portions.  The salad had a creme based dressing instead of the usual vinegarette.  Meals come with warm garlic toast.  The biftiki is very nicely done."}
{"text":"Gyro plate - awful. Was highly recommended by the waitress but was really not tasty. I don't recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great service and food everytime. I made reservations since we were 6 people, we were able to grab a booth. I ordered the pork souvlaki stick with marathon salad and rice. Love the dressing with the salad and chip fries. I can never finish the plate since the portions are huge so I took it home. My boyfriend loves the chicken brochette platter which takes bit longer to prepare. He  placed his order as we were seated. TVs played the hockey game and even though it was packed, the noise level was good not too loud."}
{"text":"The best Greek fast-food place in town.  You'll get plenty of food for the price and the service is good too.  

Surely beats Arahova, Casa Grec but it's a toss up with Marvins!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today,really fresh food excellent service,a little loud inside,but will definitely return soon,very clean inside"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Greek cuisine, but Marathon is my fav for it. The original Laval restaurant is better in my opinion, but this one on the island is really good too."}
{"text":"Fantastic value!

Portion sizes are quite generous.  Food is pretty good as well.  Decor is like a perkins/ applebees.  Service is friendly.  Not the best middle eastern restaurant I've visited but I can understand why it may be popular.  Its very \"easy\".  Easily located, easy parking, easy menu, easy atmosphere (very kid and family friendly), and easy on the wallet.

What I really liked about this place was that I was given the option of \"a little bit of both\" instead of only rice or only fries as my side."}
{"text":"Best quick fix Greek in the entire city of Montreal. If you never want to be disappointed, always full out of your mind with cheap, high quality, flavour bursting food..come here. Love Marathons forever."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service! I like to order for pick up once in a while. Food is always ready on time, just hard to find parking sometimes."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here for a last minute dinner with the family a few months ago and have to say that our experience was pretty solid. Good service, great prices, and good food - nothing out of the ordinary but nothing bad to say either. A-OK!"}
{"text":"Simple, delicious Greek food for a great price. They specialize in typical Greek food (souvlaki, doner), and do it right.

Bottom line: if you're looking for some sort of super trendy and modern restaurant, Marathon's isn't it. If you're looking for a casual Greek restaurant that's consistently good, fresh, and fairly priced, then I'd highly recommend paying Marathon a visit."}
{"text":"Though it has almost nothing for vegans, the food did look delicious, presentable,  establishment was clean and service excellent!"}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant on Friday evening with 4 others. I have eaten here before and the food good. 

This time we were here for dinner. Food was decent and expected a nice meal out with friends.

There was an extremely large issue and I would never set foot again in the restaurant.

My friend chose the greek salad that came  with the meal. It was not your typical salad and had no lettuce and the plate consisted of 90% tomatoes. She was not expecting a tomato salad! As most places do not serve like this,  it was not what she expected.

When the waiter was asked to change salads to the marathon salad, he became disgruntled. We had to persuade him to ask the owner to replace the salad although only 1 or 2 bites were taken.

Normally a restaurant would not hesitate to make a change under these circumstances. I then spoke to the owner and explained the situation. The owner said he would replace the salad. 

When the new marathon salad arrived, it was only lettuce and dressing. None of the items that come with salad were on it. Ie olives, cucumber, feta cheese, tomatoes. 

The manager explained the lettuce was the addition to the greek salad to turn it into the marathon salad.

THE ORIGINAL SALAD WAS TAKEN AWAY!!! ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS LETTUCE AND DRESSING!

We tried to explain it was not a full marathon salad and she was left with lettuce and dressing.

The owner refused to correct the situation and even accused my friend of trying to steal food .  eating a bit or 2 of the greek salad, which was really a tomato salad and changing it to the Marathon Salad he considered to be stealing food!

I have never heard of anything so absurd in my life. The owner even continued argue and say this is how he serves a greek salad and she should have known what to expect and he is Greek and his is a \"real\" greek salad. 

In the end nothing was resolved except unhappy customers who wont come back again. 

No wonder the waiter was disgruntled, he has been trained by the owner!

Arguing and accusing the customer of stealing?

Hence the reason it is a 1 star review. Unfortunately we could not give it less!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very tasty food.  I had a gyro plate with the marathon salad.  The other reviewers are correct, the dressing is delish!   The gyro meat was good quality and very flavorful.  I am coming back for more.  Great value, casual relaxed and the Chianti was nice."}
{"text":"Folks seem to like this place so we gave it a try (again). Our first time was okay, but didn't blow us away. This time was slightly better, but still only worth 3 stars for me. The place itself is set up well for groups of all sizes, feels clean and even has a couple TVs playing whatever sports is of the moment. I ordered the souvlaki stick plate, which came with rice and a Greek salad. The souvlaki was great, and I preferred it this way as opposed to inside of a pita (which is how I had it previously). The rice was also surprisingly good. The salad was like, an afterthought. In fact, maybe they were trying to get rid of their tomatoes because the salad was literally overflowing with them. Not the best balance for a salad. Anyways, I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in the neighborhood and I wanted something on the healthier side, I'd consider stopping in."}
{"text":"I love this place, we usually do take out, the plate with the two pitas is enough for two people. The fries and salad are amazing! Everything is just yummy!"}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews and was hesitant about going in but I'm very glad I did.  I had the lamb chops and they were fantastic.  Exploding with flavour, tender and cooked to perfection.  Wow.  The more than generous sides of fried potatoes and Greek salad made for a very filling and satisfying meal.
Service was a miss though.  My waiter did the job but a complete lack of finesse. He went to another table so they could pay and he put his handful of plates on their table.  Weak.  I watched another fellow serve the dinner plates out, dropped a potato on a customer's lap, shrugged and continued putting the plates down.  No finesse.  Friendly, sort of, but no finesse.

Food was a 5, service maybe a 2.5!"}
{"text":"Really solid, if unspectacular Greek food.

I come here more often than I should since there's just not that much Greek on Decarie.

The good is the appetizers that are under $5.
Definitely choosing the kopanisti.

Onto the main menu,  pork souvlaki,  chicken souvlaki,  gyros, lamb chops, chicken brochette and loukaniko

No rib steak or shrimp or other staples.

The plates all come with rice,  fries and a choice of Greek or marathon salad (same as Greek but with lettuce and dressing).

The souvlaki itself has gotten smaller, 4 cubes per pita.
Another thing is the noise level of this place is off the charts (it's always busy, but I think the acoustics play a part here).

Service is pretty solid, but not much interaction since menu is so small."}
{"text":"Marathon Souvlaki seems to be a locally owned souvlaki restaurant with only a few locations.  This Marathon is located in a shopping center near the Montreal hippodrome, among a Baton Rouge, Roots and Stitches...off of Decarie.

The food is a good value.  They have options of chicken or pork souvlaki, gyros, doner meat, etc. You can get one or two of each, or a combination plate with your choice of two items from a series of selections.  Along with your meat choice, you have the option of rice or fries and a greek or marathon salad.  They also have merguez sausages and calamari available.  The portions are large, and the average price is $15 per person.  Along with your meal, you will get free garlic bread.

Every time we go, the service is nice (for Montreal).  My only complaint is that they don't come around enough to offer refills on water.

If you are in the area and hungry, or if you are looking for a good souvlaki restaurant, you need to go here, it's really good!"}
{"text":"I use to really vouch for Marathons.. until about a year or so ago and the plates got a bit smaller. I realized there was an ownership shift, the staff remained the same as did the prices but the portions shrunk. I did get a small amount comp'd last time because the chef left me a hair as a token of appreciation  to find later in my half chewed food. But atleast I got a free fry for having rated the man's shampoo. Marathon you lost your touch now we head up north for good Greek.  To souvlaki bar."}
{"text":"This restaurant has always been consistent. The food is great, the service is friendly & efficient and the prices are acceptable. The portions are very generous. The meals are delicious and well presented. The staff is welcoming. The only thing that could be improved is the dining area. It can use a little renovation but it's definitely not avoidable. I highly recommend this restaurant for some great greek cuisine, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and great price, you can't go wrong at Marathon's. My personal fave is the chicken pita plate with marathon salad and rice, not sure what goes into that salad dressing but it is to die for and you can buy a bottle on your way out."}
{"text":"I generally dislike the West Island, but I'll make an exception and enter its perimeters when I'm in the mood for Greek because I love Marathon. That's it, that's all. 

They usually start you off with bread that is, to be honest, sorely lacking in flavour. After all these years, I'm still not sure what they put on it - olive oil? Butter? Or maybe garlic butter? 

I always order the chicken stick with rice and the Marathon salad. That said, you can ask for potatoes, or half rice/ half potatoes (which is what they generally serve). As well, they have another salad option but I don't remember what it is because I never have it.  The chicken is perfect, with just the right amount of juiciness and flavour. I'm sure most people would say the rice is just 'OK' but I really like it. It's got a nice taste to it and its not sticky or clumpy. The salad is good but they do tend to overdo it on the dressing, so if you don't like too much, I suggest asking for this on the side. The salad is comprised of Iceberg lettuce, some onions (that I remove), tomatoes, cucumber, 3 Kalamata olives (yes, I counted) and a slice of Feta cheese. Personally, I'd like to see a few more olives in the mix!

The downsides: It's a Greek restaurant and they make you pay for Tzatziki, which boggles my mind every single time. Hello? Isn't that a staple when eating Greek food? I eat my meal sans sauce, because as far as I'm concerned, it should come with the meal.  

The staff can be a little neutral (i.e. you don't really feel the love - they're not very smiley). Go for the food! Just remember that Thursday-Saturday nights will likely be packed, so be prepared to wait or go early."}
{"text":"Saganaki is good little greasy but hey.

The salad is the real reason I come here the dressing is really good not your typical boring Cesar or boring oil and balsamic.

I wouldn't recommend anything else from here. If u want good Greek u go to Tripolis not marathons lol"}
{"text":"My favourite souvlaki place in Montreal to pick up some gyro pitas and bring them home.
We both agree they are the best we've had here.
The restaurant is always busy so we just get take out - because it's so packed and noisy it's not where I'd like to eat but we'll go back again and again for the pitas and fries   :-)"}
{"text":"Food is great but not very great selection. They have smaller meals for children and the location is convenient. Also, the restaurant is nicely decorated, often packed though. Overall, I would recommend Marathon's for a family supper or anything that isn't too classy."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place religiously each time I visit Montreal since the first time my family and I went here."}
{"text":"Got take out from Marathon and ordered pitas to go I was near the airport and the Yelp Rating was thumbs up.

  I had the gyro (beef/pork mix), the meat was shaved, tender and perfectly seasoned. My fiancé got the souvlaki pita platter which has pork off a skewer and I just prefer shaved meat consistency. 

 The tatziki sauce was plentiful it had a good creamy-cucumbery flavor some red onion slices, tomatoes, and the pita soft and chewy. 

 The rice had diced carrots in it and it came with a side salad too to complete the platter. Salad is iceberg, I don't consider iceberg a nutritional salad in my book, but it had a Greek creamy-vinaigrette tasty (maybe not homemade since I saw the \"fries\"come from a previously frozen bag), tomatoes, cucumbers, white onion slices, nice chunk of feta cheese, and A Single Olive on top.

I was very happy with the food quality and would try it again when in the mood for Greek."}
{"text":"Came straight from Pierre Trudeau airport to Marathon for Greek food with my sister and fiancé. 
  There's a Huge parking lot and a patio seating for warmer months. There's also a Greek theme not overly done, just right.
 
 The waiter came by after soo much waiting. We were starving which didn't help. 
After more waiting the waters and menus. More waiting and the Challah- like bread is served, not pita or traditional flatbread, I found that odd.

 We ordered the double humus appetizer, and had to order Pita bread separate, and two orders of that, so it adds up.
   I had the gyro (beef/pork mix), the meat was shaved, tender and perfectly seasoned. My fiancé got the Souvlaki pita platter which has pork off a skewer and I just prefer shaved meat consistency.

I was very happy with the food quality and would try it again , just maybe take out from now on here."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my go to Greek spot actually, because it's closely accessible by metro and by car. Food tastes OK, its does a great job at satisfying my once in a while gyros cravings. I suggest the gyros plate, its their most popular and comes with rice/fries and choice of their house salad/greek salad. The house salad is great, and the ingredients were fresh, I wish I had some more to compensate with the guilty meal! Their little medallion fries used to be crispy and mushy on the inside, but I was disappointed for my visit this time. They turned out tasting bland and almost cold. Hopefully I get lucky with a fresher batch next time around. 
Moreover, I find the pita to be a little on the chewy side; do make sure to take reasonable bites ;). 
Also another tip for the ladies, I wouldn't recommend ordering the pitas for first dates, as it can get a little bit too messy to eat (unless you're a confident clumsy eater of course!).
Price is slightly high considering it's very similar to food court food. But you do pay for what you get (service and dine-in). It's still very affordable. 
Service was great, informative and fast. Thanks!
All in all, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I would really rate this restaurant a 3.5/5 but I'll kick it up to a 4 since we generally do take-out and don't have to eat there. 

They have your usual variety of Greek dishes: hot and cold appetizers, souvlaki, and pitas. Depending on my mood I get chicken souvlaki pitas, the fried calamari, or maybe a pikilia plate if I want a bit of this n' that.  It might sound odd, but one of my favorite things there is the taramasalata dip; which is one of the best versions I've had. Otherwise I'd say it's pretty solid fare, I happen to like their tzatziki because it's thicker which suggests it's made with strained Greek yogurt.

It's always busy here so even when you phone in ahead of time for take-out you might have to wait a bit to get your order."}
{"text":"Traditional style resto, booths and tables. I've been to their other locations and my first time here. Quality of the food is consistent. We were a large group on a Wednesday evening. Good service. Everyone ordered the souvlakis. Large plates. Good salad and fresh ingredients. I had the chicken brochette. Moist and tasty. Large portion. We got loud, sorry folks. Family style not to fancy. Good greek fast food."}
{"text":"Being in Montreal so many times I've come to realize that Montreal has soooo many Greek Restaurants.  Lets add Marathon to the list of Greek placed I've tried in Montreal.  I ordered the lamb chops.  The portions were huge and the lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection.  My only issue with Marathon was how tight the tables were.  I little more space would have been nice.  Over all a 4.5 star experience."}
{"text":"Decent Souvlaki for a great price. Great place to fed the kids for cheap and it beats McDonald's(which isn't that much cheaper). Just don't bring your date here, unless you know she loves Souvlaki and your trying to save a buck ;)"}
{"text":"Wow! Their giro was phenomenal!!! Their homemade white wine was also refreshing! The service was fast and friendly. It's truly a gem nearby Namur metro area! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite take out restaurants.   Very busy on friday, best to call ahead as the take-out area is VERY busy.   Everything is so fresh, and just love the Marathon salads!"}
{"text":"The good:
- not too pricy
- portions are decent
- free garlic bread
- service is fast and efficient

The bad
- not the friendliest service (servers left even before I could finish ordering)
- pretty standard Greek fare 

Overall, a pretty safe choice to grab a bite with decent portions."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner here the other night. It was packed and judging by the masse of people at the door, we anticipated a long wait for a table. Luckily since we were only 2, the hostess was able to squeeze us into a small table as soon as we walked in!

Our waiter was... efficient. Took our orders quickly, asked all the right questions and filled our waters as soon as they were empty. He wasn't overly-friendly, which was ok with us, since we just wanted to eat and get out quickly. Instead of asking how our food was, he just gave us a thumbs-up with a questioning look on his face. Fine by us for that night, but I would normally expect a little more warmth. 

The food was GREAT. And lots of it for the price. For $10.95, my plate included a large vegetarian wrap, rice, fries and a generous heaping of Greek salad. Same price for the Doner plate, which my date ordered. 

Would definitely go back. Reservations are a must if you're a big group!"}
{"text":"Best restaurent in the whole westisland, lunch specials are amazing. Crazy how a gyro with soda fries and salade is cheaper thn a trio at shitty dagwoods doen the street. This restaurent is in complete power. Long live Marathon"}
{"text":"If you are like me and are sometimes too lazy to make dinner after work, are looking for something above fast food but not quite take out,  go to Marathon. They've got good food,  pretty decent prices. Let's face it: it ain't sophisticated cuisine, pretty simple and to the point but Marathon doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is. 

***A recent reno job on the interior spruced the place up some."}
{"text":"I love marathons.  I usually get the doner pita with the marathons salad.  It's amazing.  Best dressing."}
{"text":"A staple in our family. The girls get the chicken pita duo with Greek salad an the boys get the donor pita with marathon salad. We share, plenty of food."}
{"text":"Yummy quick Greek food. Good for take out and even better for an early lunch. Love the tzadiki and fries. The Gyros are not bad reheated just ask for the sauce on the side! Fairly priced and easy to share amongst friends."}
{"text":"Every time I visit family on the Montreal area, I need to stop here!
The staff is always friendly and you can enjoy a eating in a nice clean atmosphere. 
The doner gyro is fantastic, fresh pieces of pork, seasoned and cooked to perfection. The closest thing you will get to a gyro in North America, hands down. I'm from NY and no place can touch a Marathon Gyro."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 20 years now. And the biggest compliment that I can them is that the food is incredibly consistent. There's never a surprise. You get what you expect every single time. Best souvlaki in the montreal area. Don't let the amateurs tell you differently. You can take your Marvins, Village Grec, and Arahova and stick em where the sun don't shine because that's where they belong."}
{"text":"Best souvlaki in montreal hands down! And they don't do it by being creative or fancy. The biggest compliment that I can give them is that the food has been exactly the same for 20 years, probably longer, dating back to their first location in laval. There's never a surprise. You get what you expect every single time. Best souvlaki in the montreal area. Don't let the amateurs tell you differently. You can take your Marvins, Village Grec, and Arahova and stick em where the sun don't shine because that's where they belong."}
{"text":"Very crowded restaurant, which is not a bad thing (good ambiance). I ordered a gyro pita, which tasted pretty good. Service is good. Would go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always stop here at least once whenever I visit Montreal.  I ran into someone in Ventura Calif, who was from Montreal and Marathon came up as a favorite casual restaurant on the West island for both of us.

The portions are very large, so if you plan to try different things keep that in mind.  I've tried most items on the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais j'aime bien aller chez Marathon.  La salade et la sauce surtout, je crois, retienne l'attention de mon palais, ainsi que leur frite plate et ronde.  Le choix est très simple, le prix très bas, c'est surtout un resto du midi, j'y allais souvent avec les gars du travail.  2 Brochettes de poulet avec leurs frites et la salade marathon, ça fait la job en maudit.  Je recommende toujours tant que votre seul raison d'y aller est de remplir un creu dans votre estomac.  Genre n'y allez pas pour la St-Valentin, on s'entends..."}
{"text":"Tried Souvlaki after my mother in law kept telling me how amazing it is (yes, she loved it so much and wants to name my future daughter that) 
We went to Marathon Souvlaki hoping for light, guilty free comfort food after a long hectic weekend. Marathon Souvlaki was all that and more, we had the Souvlaki chicken plate and the tzatziki dip. 
I would have preferred pita bread with my dip (it's available separately- but realized a bit too late)
The chicken was flavorful and tender, the rice was cooked well and the fries were quite more like thick crisps. 
The portions at this place are rather large so I would suggest share a plate between 2 if you aren't starving. 
Didn't like the ambience as much but the food really makes up for all that. 
Our server wasn't very pleasant, but the food made up for that as well. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good Greek food."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Saturday evening. The place was packed guys and it was filled with a lot of families with kids. I would reserve a spot during rush-hour times. We waited in line 10-15 minutes. It wasn't too bad and the hostess was polite. We got a table and ordered calamaris to share. It was delicious! Then, we each ordered chicken stick/pita and let me tell you, those portions of rice/potatoes were pretty generous. I took the Marathon salad. I especially liked the vinaigrette and the feta cheese. The chicken souvlaki was fresh, topped with creamy tzatziki. I ended up not finishing my plate as there was too much rice. In all...Loved this place :)"}
{"text":"I \"love\" this restaurant! Although my experience with them is always the side door for takeout, our meals here are always excellent. The chicken, pork and lamb souvlaki pitas are amazing. Sometimes we'll order the platters and I would recommend asking for 1/2 fries (medallion) and half rice. I tried one of their jumbo Marathon salads last night and it was delicious. The only negative is they're not 100% at checking their orders and I was short changed a pita more than once. When you call to complain, they have a ledger to credit your next visit by whatever you were short changed but this would not be necessary if they double checked the orders. I now always check the bag before I leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish we had food like this in Michigan...Greek restuarants who claim to have souvlaki please take notes, you have no clue. We have been to every Greek restuarant you can think of in Michigan...everyone.
None of them can even come close to what is available in Montreal, even though these are chain restaurants they are great.
The porc souvlaki is out of this world, the frites and the rice are wonderful as well as the salad. Everything here has taste, everything in the states is so bland. On the other hand refills are free, all drinks come with ice, and a large is a large. Here glasses are small, there still trying to figure out what ice is and you do not get free refills. But the food is incredible."}
{"text":"Let's face it ..the food is good. 

But the service. Ugh. No one to greet me at the door Friday afternoon, which was fine as my friends were already on the terrasse. ..but I got a big \"where are you going? ???\" Yelled over to me from another part of the restaurant when I walked to meet my party. 

Um. No. Maybe saying \"excuse me ..I am busy..please wait to be seated..\" while she was chatting her girlfriends and chewing gum...but no..

Then...all was well...but we had to ask the waiter 3 times for everything.  Ice for my tepid rose wine. I was finished my meal before it showed up. The restaurant was empty and the terrasse was mostly full with 2 wait staff and a bus boy. So not terribly busy (there are maybe 12 tables) ...\"No onions, not in the salad and not in the pita...ONLY sauce on the pita for the child\" obvious translated to onions in and on EVERYTHING. 

Either way..the food was great. Will not be going back though. I'll drive to the one in Laval. 

Stars are based on food only."}
{"text":"Big servings.. Good food! Yummy greck salad.. If busy, you gotta wait.. Good price as well.. I like the calamari and chicken pita."}
{"text":"Great tasting food at reasonable prices.  Service is quick and portions are fair.
Somewhat limited menu, but still enough variety for anybody.
Amazing place for a quick healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Un classique du midi dans le Technoparc. Marathon Souvlaki est reconnue pour ça nourriture et non pour son staff, ni pour c'est beaux menus plastifiés. Un choix s'impose sur le menu midi-express: Doner (gyros) pita, moitié-moitié (frites et riz), une salade grecque et un Pepsi. Sans tomber dans les clichés l'essayer c'est l'adopter. Pour moins de 10$ avant taxes et pourboire c'est difficile à battre. 

Les midis de semaines sont bien remplis, surtout les jeudis et vendredi. Il est recommandé d'arriver avant midi. De plus pour les groupes de plus de quatre une réservation est de mise."}
{"text":"Been going for many many years. Laval was where I was introduced to marathon 20 years ago 
Service and price is not what is use to be
But we still love it . Great lamb chops , and the kids love the souvlaki"}
{"text":"Marathon's is a expensive restaurant compared to casa grecque. The food is good but not worth the price. The restaurant was packed and I was elbow to elbow with the guy at the next table.

The service was slow, and the waiter gave me the wrong dish which was for the other table..."}
{"text":"The reviews seem spot on point.  Took a visit here for lunch, although busy we were quickly seated, service was especially prompt and the food was Damned Tasty.  My group ordered the doner (gyros) plate with Marathon Salad, Rice and a side of Tzatziki sauce.  Great portions, good flavor and very authentic.   Maybe I was uber hungry, or easy to please.. but I have to say this was some of the best tasting roasted gyro I've ever had.  

As I left, I wondered if they deliver.... to the States?? LOL"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner here last night that consisted of a donair platter on the patio. Very reasonable as it came out just over $15 with tip. It was a belly buster of a meal. Excellent quality and freshness! This place is a fat man's paradise if you are down with greek food!  Copious quantity and very tasty!"}
{"text":"I just love Marathons! From the famous Marathon salad to the Gyro pitas. Always received great, fast friendly service from this restaurant. 

The food is fresh, it looks and tastes amazing. We have never had a bad experience here it or at the Laval location. 

It gets nuts at lunchtime so try to be there a little before noon. You'll thank me trust me!

Parking here at this location is horrible so heads up! 

Pro tip: bring gum for afterwards"}
{"text":"Good food, clean restaurant, friendly service. Food is priced right, the portions are perfect size and what can you say about the famous Marathon Salad?? Love it!

This location is always buzzing. Plenty of parking available. Nice sized terrasse if one feels like dining outdoors.

It is a good bang for your buck restaurant. We've always been served well and eaten well at every location. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Last night was there perfect sharp on time for take out excellent service food is great and not expensive at all you guys are the best!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously love it here. The food was great, huge portions, and it was really cheap. It was $30 for my partner and I to share a starter and each get a plate with a pita, salad, and fries which also came with a drink. You also get this delicious garlic bread at the start. Neither of us could finish, there was way too much. It was really noisy, and the pittas were a bit heavy on the tatziki, but it was oh so good."}
{"text":"Wow, the best vegetarian Greek pita I've ever had. The ingredients were very fresh, including the tomatoes and feta. I loved the rice (but forgot to ask if it was vegetarian or not). 

Quality ingredients and service. Would love to come back again. 

PARKING: Large lot and easy access"}
{"text":"I wish I could marry a Marathon souvlaki. It's so great here. The food is always tasty and fresh, the Tzatziki is one of the best I have ever had and I think their salad dressing is made with crack (no matter how full you are, you always go back for more). I LOVE this place"}
{"text":"I'm a regular and will remain one. The staff is amazing,y friendly, service is quick and the food is to absolutely die for. Their tzatziki is home made. It's so flavourful you can't even imagine. Nice selection of beer and wine also. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have great Greek cuisine, at a great price too."}
{"text":"Marathon at any location either In Laval or Montreal they are really good and the food is just too delicious  so delicious that I have to restraint myself! But seriously worth to go try and warning, you will get addicted. They serve Greek beer and other choice of soft drinks. House salad really good along with their French fries. My favourite is the the Doner plate! Thus, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with friends. We had a huge party and they were really good about setting up a table for us - considering we did not have reservations. Service was quick and friendly. A plus for offering to give us separate checks without us asking. 

I had the chicken souvlaki and it was good. Food was plentiful and worth the price!  Restaurant is neat and clean."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Generous portions. Amazing takeout.
You know that it is great just by looking at its lineup!"}
{"text":"No frills. Great Greek food and service just as you'd expect. Food portions are very generous at affordable prices. Would definitely recommend for someone who is craving souvlaki or gyros"}
{"text":"This is a great unpretentious, lively, loud, family-friendly Greek place that hammers out consistent and delicious grilled meats and sides. Been many times, have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat for 20+ years now. Traditional Greek cuisine that hits the spot, especially when you need a boost during a crappy day.

The original is located in Laval but this new location keeps the food and service on par as the original.

A few notes :

- Many different and delicious dishes to try out. My all time favorite is the chicken pita platter with their delicious marathon salad and fries.

- The Tzatziki is fantastic.

- I recommend any lamb dishes they have.

- Service is extremely friendly and quick.

- As I go only for lunches due to its proximity at work, I cannot see how slow the service gets for dinner (as its the main issue for the laval location). However, this place tends to get pretty packed at lunch so make sure to get in a few minutes early or be forced to wait some.

- The price tag is honest and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Classic Greek meals that are delicious and inexpensive. Significant portions will not leave you hungry."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the years and usually I'm very happy with the service and the food/prices. BUT the last 2 times I came I found it disappointing in a few different areas. Service wasn't horrible but was a little slow considering the restaurant wasn't overly full and didn't really come by the table to check on us we usually had to flag them down, a few details that would have made the experience better. The food was also not great the last two visits -gyro meat was oily yet dry at the same time , rice was hard and the tzatziki was just ok. This was very disappointing considering that this isn't the level of quality that I'm used to from marathon. I'm hoping this was a rough patch or bad luck because I used to really enjoy coming here. Im sure I'll go back because I would be willing to give this place another chance considering the fact that I've had much better experiences here than the last two and I'll do so with the hope of being able to update this review with an upgraded rating !"}
{"text":"J'ai manger chez Marathon des dizaines de fois et je ne m'en tanne jamais. C'est un endroit qui offre une constance dans ces plats, je sais a quoi m'attendre de Marathon. 
Une portion de tzaziki a partager entre amis avec le pain qu'ils offrent, juste ca ca vaut le detour."}
{"text":"Great Greek food, huge servings, and inexpensive. One plate can reasonably feed two people, what with the massive salad and large sides of rice/fries offered. They don't skimp on quantity, that's for sure. Quality is also plentiful; salads are fresh (although a little heavy on the olive oil) and meat dishes like brochettes and souvlaki are moist and flavorful. Friendly service, and wait times are surprisingly short. Superb value for families."}
{"text":"Marathon is usually one of my favourite restos but I find this location falls short. I came here with my family for lunch today and we were all a bit disappointed. The lunch specials are great and super filling. I had a souvlaki pita with marathon salad. I love the dressing they use on the salads and they are generous with the feta. Unfortunately everyone's meals came out luke warm. I've found this to be a consistant problem at this location. The atmosphere is nice, I get very nostalgic here since I've been going to the one in the west island since I was little and the decor is pretty much the same. Overall, I find this location to be inferior in quality and service to the west island one so I will probably drive a little further to the other location when I get a tzatziki craving!"}
{"text":"I always hear people raving about this place but I was not wowed. Oddly, I like most things on the menu but food was just ok.

I really think Marathon's is over hyped.

I've been here twice and ordered the chicken brochette plate, called \"chicken stick\" on their menu, for 11.45$
I found the chicken dry and chewy. It was like eating plain chicken breast.

I've tried their pitas before and just not a fan of the tzatziki sauce. Overpowering, smelly.

Rice is very good, and salad is alright - as another reviewer mentioned, its just iceberg lettuce.

The bread basket they serve everyone is trying to pass off as garlic bread, but they use oil, not butter. It's gross.

The best thing on my dish was the feta cheese, really."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and let me tell you this Greek restaurant does not disappoint!! This place is always packed. The fried calamari is good and the tzatziki as well. I like that they give garlic bread at every table even though I try not to carb up. I usually get the lamb with rice and fries and the marathon salad which is basically Greek salad but with lettuce added. Sometimes I get get the souvlaki pita which is also good but I really like the lamb. The portions are big and the price is right. I always get the red house wine... it's surprisingly good! Its a nice resto to go wit your family or a group. It's not very romantic so I wouldn't say it's a good date place but if it's a casual date I say go for it!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. The service was timely and friendly. The menu was short and to the point. I feel like smaller menus means fresher food. The food was excellent and served very quickly. By far, the best place I have dined on the road in months. I will be back on any trip to Point-Claire in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great food, fast service and friendly staff. Also everything is super reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Decent place for the price. Plates are very generous, meat is pretty good but the sides are pretty basics and too much oil on the vegetables. Still a good place to go with your kids"}
{"text":"I was going to write a review to show some support but now i'm fantasizing about gyro meat and headed to my car lol"}
{"text":"ate here with the parents. we all ordered the same dish - the chicken brochette. i was surprised to see the \"americanized\" food portions they give you ... a huge brochette of nicely seasoned grilled chicken with onions and peppers, fries, and a huge salad (get the marathon salad - the dressing is pure crack cocaine!). this place was packed and constant foot traffic coming in and out - and according to my parents, it's always this way - which tells me the ingredients must always be fresh with this constant turnover. i'm not sure how good the other locations are, but this one was a very good experience for me."}
{"text":"Really did not like the food here. Our waiter was in a rush and not very attentive. Made me feel like I was bothering him a bit"}
{"text":"I left a review a while ago about the ladies working in the take out, not being so professional, today when I went to pick up my food, the girl wasn't even smiling, she seemed a bit stressed about the big crowd being there.... That's fine, I guess. Food was great and I was so excited to eat my Marathon salad, when I opened the lid and was ready to take a nice bite out of the feta cheese, I saw that there was a piece of hair on it!!!! A small piece of hair! I was hoping that it was just the spices on it, but nope, confirmed that it was hair! That's the most disgusting thing ever! Now I'm going to have to think twice before I eat here, which is sad because I loved their food. :("}
{"text":"Great place to visit with kids, the service is extremely fast, food is fresh and everything I tried was very good. 
I liked the fact that the minute you sit you get a generous portion of garlic bread to help you think about your order. Try the Marathon salad or the chicken my kid loved it."}
{"text":"pretty good food. Huge portions. Definetly worth a try... been comming here for years. Generelly take the donor plate with fries and marathon salad. Have to say that salad dressing is addictive and the fries are extra crispy ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious greek food. 

I can still taste the delicious tziaki and freshly made pita.  

We shares the calamari which was probably the.best I have ever had. Tender not even close to chewy. 

The greek salad is served a bit differently and some people at my table were thrown off but I actually really enjoyed the way it was served. 

Delicious greek food in a casual environment."}
{"text":"Nice big portions, the souvlakis are good and the service is really fast. Now I have an extra casual place to get dinner on a weekday with the family if I don't feel like cooking. There's lots of parking outside."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's nice and warm inside. Pretty spacious and doesn't make you feel cooped up. This is the perfect place for a casual dinner.

FOOD: Awesome quality. I love getting their pitas here, no matter what meat it is, it's always flavorful. I personally am not the biggest fan of their rice so I just get the fries instead. I also love their marathons salad. The dressing is delicious. Overall, a definite go-to place for me. Their garlic bread appetizers are really good as well, although they are a bit greasy...

PRICE: Very good prices for the quantity and quality that you get, especially at lunch. I usually bring a part of my meal home (and I eat A LOT), tells you how big the portions are!

SERVICE: Service is decent, it depends on who is serving you but it's usually pretty good."}
{"text":"We went here super hungry and were quickly seated. I consider this place as the Montreal equivalent to Paramount.  We had the Gyro's with fries and I must say, that was the best Gyro I ever had!  The meat was juicy and not salty. It had the right amount of veggies and sauce. The fries come in a round shape and taste fresh and crispy. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come for greek food. Their service is always great, the food is always tasty, and the portions are huge for the price! Tonight I had 2 chicken sticks with fries and greek salad, and I can't complain about a thing... ok too many tomatoes in the greek salad maybe but thats about it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times in the past, and have never been disappointed. We had called ahead of time because we were a large group (i.e. 18 people), and we were seated within 10-15 minutes of our reservation time, which isn't bad considering our experiences elsewhere. I usually get the same thing when I go here - the chicken gyro pita with rice and Greek salad.YUM! The tzaziki wasn't too overpowering, but was creamy and delicious. The chicken was plentiful and the pita nice and crispy, yet doughy on the inside. The rice was flavourful and given in generous portion, and the Greek salad was simple yet delish. The only reason why this place doesn't get a full 5 stars is because our waiter was quite rude and unattentive - we had to flag him down multiple times to refill our water, even though most of the time he was just standing at the counter near the kitchen talking to co-workers - and also because Arahova's (the one on Taschereau in Brossard) is my #1 Greek fave."}
{"text":"A SOLID 3 star. Muck better than Arahova. Huge portions, delicious tsatziki sauce (garlicky but not to the point where your mouth still tastes like garlic the morning after!) and affordable. Definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Montreal. Very fast service at lunch time. Never disappointed.  Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice place for a chain! Not a taste twister, but definitely decent drop-in location if you are hungry.

Friendly, quick and useful service. They even speak English and are not pissed if you do - a huge bonus around Montreal area.

The food was very good! Big portions, excellent quality. Not a high-end restaurant level with custom food, but something absolutely decent and eatable.

Overall, I would compare Marathon to a Red Lobster in its better days. Type of food is different, but you know what I mean. :-)"}
