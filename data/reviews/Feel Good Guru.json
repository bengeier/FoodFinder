{"text":"Feel Good Guru is in the progress of slowly opening.  It's a take-out place right across the street from Trinity-Bellwoods Park, and conveniently located in my neighbourhood. I walked in not caring what I ordered, I wanted to try... anything. 

I ordered the soup, which was a hearty miso based vegetable lentil, with lots of greens and packed with flavour. Perfect for today's rainy glumness.

The space is really clean and relaxing, there is seating for about 4 people, but like I said, it's styled as a take-out place (so you know, you could hypothetically take stuff out, and eat in the park.) There are fresh herbs in a wall-mounted garden (that look absolutely lovely). They also have a useful website that actually gives you the information 

I've come to expect raw cakes to be delicious, and Feel Good Guru's cake was no exception. In fact... it was even better than I expected it to be (and the raw bar is raised pretty high already.)  She gave me a sample for free, and I want more of that chocolate heaven in my mouth. Luckily they are right down the street, so I could wander over any time I want. Lucky me."}
{"text":"Really expensive for the portions and taste quality -- they taste good, but not any better than Urban Herbivore or Fresh, and the portion size is half of what they give. 

Drinks are also really expensive with simple fruit/veggie juices costing 8 dollars. 

No real place to sit other than bar stools. 

I really wouldn't eat here again knowing there are such better options out there."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a super healthy 'feel good' meal, this is definitely the place.  The food is fresh and tasty and the staff were enthusiastic.  I had two salads and a smoothie, with a tip this came to over 27$.  While I really enjoyed my meal and I was certainly full, the price was just too high, especially considering there aren't many seats to sit down and enjoy your meal.  The salads were flavourful and fresh - lots of veggies, nuts and seeds, good dressings if garlicky.  I did not have a dessert but they looked fantastic.  Overall, I'd recommend it if you are willing to pay the price."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend to try it out and was blown away as to how good it was. I had the Feel Good falafel and it was delicious. I'm new to raw foods and you would never know this was a raw meal. Very good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the wrap and salad combo. I can't remember which wrap it was, but it was super delicious. The bread was made out of dehydrated yam mixed in with some herbs/spices. It was very delicious and innovative! It's different from the usual wraps/sandwiches you get at other restaurants. All the ingredients were fresh and full of flavour. My boyfriend had the falafel wrap, which I loved too. If I can ever figure out what each of the ingredients are, I will make it myself too! 

The service was great. I was helped by the tall Chinese lady. She answered my questions professionally. 

What I love about FGG is that everything is local, organic, fresh, and vegan. I've been to other vegetarian restaurants and FGG trumps. It has this mystique. You'll be surprised at what you're eating, guessing what it is, and just wanting more. The dishes are creatively made making you feel oh so good."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst food experience in my life. I paid over $25 for JUST one small slice of cake. Organic? Please, What a joke. I recommend going to Fresh on Crawford if you're interested in something similar."}
{"text":"Shake and salad were delicious but the service was ridiculous. Expect to wait 10 minutes before being greeted with a simple hello and expect your questions about The food to be answered with seriously uninterested responses. I'll take my shake needs down to fresh for their happy hour specials and pleasant service. Too bad."}
{"text":"Mmm, the food is so tasty here and you know you are fuelling yourself up with some good. Really informative staffs here and never rush you to order (and we're talking about the most indecisive person ever). 

The only downside of this restaurant (and the reason why I refuse to visit it more often) is because it's SO expensive and overpriced. Yes, the food is organic, fresh, etc. But, it really drives more people away from opting for healthier choices. The takeout box for the salad and/or noodles is extremely tiny for the price you pay for - it doesn't even fill me up! Since I'm forking out over $10, I do expect some degree of fullness. It's more of a snack for me and I'm already a tiny person to begin with. 

Do see myself coming back here in the future, since my best friend is a vegan - but, don't ever see myself coming here on a consistent basis even if I'm usually in the Queen West area."}
{"text":"Tried the Bangkok salad with the avocado and cheese sandwich.  Both were quite good.  The dressing on the salad was very delicious.  Loved the zucchini,  edamame and spiralled carrots in the salad.  

I think their service is very slow and the prices are quite High.   For Half sandwich with a very small side salad,  I paid about $17, so very overpriced."}
{"text":"I went here too many times during a vegan-style health kick and found the food to be pretty lack lustre. Some items hint around pleasant flavours while others range from tasting like compost to nothing much at all.  And for the price!  Insanity.  It may be healthy but there are other places that offer vegan food that is actually satisfying.  It looks pretty though!"}
{"text":"Initially I loved going to feel good guru  to get food. I thought vegan, healthy, yummy. Their Tokyo Toss with Kale Salad was my faveourite combo. I had to stop going because to pay for that much food, and still be hungry is a big no no after awhile. The problem with their food is that it is so high fat which most places that serve raw gourmet food are, you either have indigestion (especially when the salad is pretty salty too) or just want to go get some more filling foods. I go occasionally now to pick up random desserts here and there, but if I'm hungry and want more of my money's worth I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"I love the food but hate the service! It's been a year that I have been going to Feel  Good Guru off and on, but after today I can tell you that the SLOW, TOTALLY UNAWARE or CONCERENED staff is not an anomaly, but a systemic management problem.

Three major problems:

There is no coherent ordering process or responsibility delegation of the 2 (sometimes 1, rarely 3) staff. It can take 10 minutes to be greeted. It's not clear where to line up when there are more than 3 people in line.

The staff can not handle a line up of more than 2 people. It is the most frustrating experience having worked in food service to see the staff UNABLE TO MULTI-TASK or delegate tasks between themselves.

The staff seem so unaware that people come into the store, wait 3 minutes, see the snail-pace of the operation, and leave (and there were only 3 of us in line). I've seen It this happen multiple times.

I think the reason the staff are detached from customer experience and moving so slowly is that they are all on juice detoxs, reached altered consciousness, and simply don't care."}
{"text":"Amazing, wholesome, fresh food. Had the green smoothie and the avocado, tomato and cheese sandwich. First time having raw food and it was so good! Good enough to make me consider converting. It is a little pricy, but health trumps money any day in my mind."}
{"text":"Before finding this place I went to Fresh, but the wait for a wrap was 20 mins-forget that!!

I came across this place and  reluctantly entered. I say this because it didn't look like a place to eat. It kinda has a strange set up.

Inside, the front if the store is quite bare, but  appeared clean. At first  I couldn't decide what I wanted but settled on the 2 salad combo. I needed to use the washroom and when I found it I was quite shocked! I had to go down the hallway (the walls and floor were filthy) and could see the kitchen from a distance. It looked quite dirty too. 

Seeing the bathroom just topped the cake. It's was gross!  Had I seen all if this before I wouldn't have ordered. 

I went to pay and when I left I opened my bag. It was a super tiny container with my salad. What?! I paid $15 for that? Unbelievable.

The curry salad was tasty, but defiantly not worth that price."}
{"text":"The rawzagne will blow you away, these people know how to make began delicious!! The food is creative, different and tasty, and best of all very good for you. Another queen west gem!"}
{"text":"Tried the Pad Thai noodle, Quioa Salad and the burger, all tasted refreshing and good.
They are flavourful and not bland.
Love it, a bit pricey...can't afford to go everyday...but you get what you paid for, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give a higher rating as I really enjoyed the food (green smoothie and rice bowl) .  This restaurant did not honour their Yelp check-in offer.  I was entitled to a free bliss ball by checking into Yelp.  The staff didn't have a clue what I was talking about and just said they didn't have any.  This is very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I found myself in my old hood with a craving for something healthy. After a few taps of my trusty Yelp app, I went to feelgoodguru and got a super green smoothie. It was delicious and exactly what I was looking for. The girl at the counter was super helpful. 

The drink came out to just over $10. The drink that I wanted happened to be in a glass bottle (they did have others that were in a disposable clear cup) so I had to pay $1 for the bottle, which is refundable if I bring it back in. Not a big deal, because I know I will be back to check out more of their goodies."}
{"text":"I live a few doors down, and all of the food at FeelGoodGuru is fantastic.  Although the prices do seem a bit high, the quality of the food and the intricacies of each dish can be seen.  All time favourites = Avo & Cheese Sandwich (try 1/2 w/ salad); no bull buritto; hemp shake, juice cleanses (order in advance).

Best thing ever: cinnamon bun"}
{"text":"Feel Good Guru is a new addition in the Trinity Bellwoods area serving up organic/raw food.  They kind of price themselves out of the market, with a Chinese-style takeout box of soba noodles (the Tokyo Toss) ringing in at almost $16 with tax and tip.  Why does eating healthy always have to be so damn expensive?

I've been to other raw/vegan places before that I think are a lot more creative in terms of the dishes they put out.  

There isn't much in the form of seating, so you'll want to get your meal to go (perhaps across the street at the Trinity Bellwoods Park?)  

The herb garden on the wall is quite interesting, and there is fresh lime/lemon water at the counter for free which is refreshing.

Happy to see another raw/vegan option, but still nothing special."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm an omnivore and I don't have any dietary restrictions, but I do like vegetarian food a lot.  Yes I know this place is vegan and I know the difference, but my point is that I do know a few things about eating vegan.  

I came in looking for a quick snack/pick-up and got the Super Green Fuel.  I have no idea what it was but it was $8 for a small snack size.  I don't mind paying that for a health drink, as long as it taste good.  This did not.  It tasted like it looked, green and yucky.  I'm not sure what was in it, but it felt like they just added a bunch of things together.  And for $8 that was the size of a small soda?  Way too pricey.  I'd rather just have wheatgrass juice.

Verdict: maybe I got the wrong thing, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I just tried feelgood because I love vegan food and cannot eat dairy, so always looking for the next spot. I go to Fresh a lot, and Looooove their BBQ burger. Went to another one in liberty, Live, and was more impressed than ever! 

Tried FeelGood, and i will not be back. I know vegan is overpriced, and generally don't care, however for $25 i got a bite sized burger and noodles with a bite sized brownie. The burger was TASTELESS. It looked really pretty and sounded delicious, so when i tasted it i was so very disappointed - nothing, no flavour at all! The noodles were actually not bad at all, in honesty I would possibly try them again, but I wouldn't pay $15 for them as they are very basic. The brownie was INEDIBLE!  Lastly, the girl at the counter was rude. Not overtly rude, but just had this passive aggressive personality and could not be friendly if she tried. I don't like that trend in Queen West, and won't go to places with rude people (unless the food is amazing, and then i really don't care anymore!). 

I would not recommend this place. I should have looked at the reviews before i tired them!"}
{"text":"Food is delish - fav is the avocado and cheese sandwich. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Twice I have called my order in so it's ready by the time I got there and both times they forgot to punch it in and I ended up having to wait 10+ minutes when I got there. I expect great service when I'm paying $14 for a sandwich and unfortunately it's not found at feel good guru."}
{"text":"The only place in Toronto I know of that sells fresh wheat grass juice, but at $5 an ounce it's hard not to feel cheated. It's a vegan take-out place not strictly a juice bar, so if you just want juice, stick to Kensington market."}
{"text":"It's so exciting to have a place making vegan, local and organic fare accessible- and right across from Trinity Bellwoods! I took my delicious NO BULL BURRITO over to the park and had a wonderful little picnic. Can't wait for more beautiful sunny days to picnic in the park Feel Good Guru styles! And, come cooler weather- I'll be back on the soup train. Feel Good Guru may as well be a soup whisperer! 

The Redjoice beet juice (along with everything on the menu!!!) is to die for! To put it simply, you just have to EAT HERE! Whether it's a key lime tart or an earth burger- you'll thank yourself and FGG later!"}
{"text":"I strolled in here a couple months ago and ordered a watermelon juice, no more than 400ml, and \"meh\" tasting. I was expecting it to be a bit pricey, since it's a health food joint right across from Trinity Bellwoods, but 10 F*CKING dollars? Move your store to Beverly Hills where it belongs. Jesus.

Good for you if you can afford this bizzniss, but for me... Never again."}
{"text":"Had the hemp shake elevate during a date in the park. Looking forward to the Tokyo Toss on my next visit. 

Friendly staff and inviting decor!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with a friend of mine. I was so happy with what I ordered. It was so wholesome and healthy (you feel it). So far, I've tried the earth burger, the avocado and cheese sandwich, the hemp shake elevate, as well as the super green smoothie, and a couple of the desserts.... My friend and I split that raw slice of chocolatey goodness, and I've tried one of those energy, raw cocao and goji bars- delicious. Something I can not seem to get enough of.... Make Kale not War salad. Everything is amaZing. The staff are friendly and informative. This is the new place to be. Hopefully soon, they will accept the LiveGreen Card. :)"}
{"text":"This is a review based on their catering, I didn't visit the restaurant.

I LOVE this place. I am a total non-vegan, but my boss and I occasionally do vegan catering for office meetings. We've ordered from Belmonte Raw a few times but this place was a zillion times better.

First of all, the customer service is just excellent. Moira (I think she's the owner) answered by initial call and helped me through the menu and didn't push for me to spend top dollar.

We ended up ordering 8 juices, the Bangkok Pad Thai, Kale salad, Quinoa Salad, No Bull Burritos, Cheese and Avocado sandiwches and an assortment of treats.

Everything was seriously amazing - beautiful to look at and actually tasted good. There were some brownies with some kind of hot chilis added (delicious)

I highly recommend the pad thai, burritos and kale salad.

Delivery guy was super nice and on time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their food is delicious, healthy and the owner is an absolute sweetheart! After hearing me rave about her soup, she gave me a breakfast cookie for free. A really small but sweet act of appreciation. 

Love feelgoodguru!!"}
{"text":"Git in here and git yo' kale on!

I liked Feel Good Guru right off the bat because the owner seems to like fun names, catchy slogans (\"make kale, not war!\") and punny (healthful) references.  We were off to a great start, sight unseen.

Walking into the location - across from Trinity Bellwoods: perfect for an impromptu feel good picnic! *you're welcome for the tip* - made me want to dust off my spork (best utensil ever) and jump into the options.  Here's what I tasted samples of:

- smoothie made with hemp, dates and bananas
- green juice
- kale salad
- raw falafel, wrapped in collard leaves
- burrito \" \"
- raw pizza
- carrot cake
- chocolate brownie

Hmm.  The list confirms: I definitely did *not* just eat with my eyes.  

All was great, and I would (will!) happily eat any of it again, but a special shout-out goes to the raw pizza topped with divine pesto, and the varied flavour and amazing textures of the desserts.  I defy even the most cynical to test any of the treats on offer and then argue that \"feel good\" and \"taste good\" can't go hand in hand (challenge extended, Toronto!).  

On a note that doesn't involve putting things in mah mouth: the staff is warm and open while fielding questions, the space is crisp and fresh and white (hollllla for the edgy edible wall installed), and the service was fast.  Though the restaurant is geared towards takeout, there is space for a few people to sit and munch while looking out the window and giving passersby two thumbs up.  

Yelp note: Feel Good Guru is still in the process of getting up and running, so certain small tweaks are still happening; when I went, for instance, prices for menu items weren't listed which led to a total guessing game when I hit the register.  Eventually I think they're aiming to be open 10-8, 7 days/week."}
{"text":"Tasty. Everything I have tried here was delicious. My favourite is Bangkok doc noodles. Prices are high but most of their ingredients are organic, which justifies the higher prices."}
{"text":"I used to be quite fond of this place, but I just had a not so awesome experience. I'm going to split the difference and go with three stars... but I'll likely only come back for my lunch needs, and never again for a juice fix, and I remain pretty unimpressed with their Saturday staff. 

Their vegan treats are delicious, and they do make their juices in house. However, they don't make juices to order, and sometimes later in the day the cups of green juices (what I'm usually after at this type of place), need some refreshing. 

My annoyance is surrounding their juice ingredients not being clearly listed (on the plastic cup options). I recently went for one of these bad boys and when I asked the girl at the counter what was in it, she said: \"like so much, pretty much everything.\" What does that even mean? I asked her to clarify, she didn't/couldn't. I asked about the couple of things I can't have and am adverse to, and they weren't in there, she seemed to know what was *not* in the drink, so I went for it. It ended up being a very grainy and chunky juice, which I probably would have known beforehand, had she just taken the time to explain the ingredients. I rarely complain about service, but this instance really got my goat, especially since this kind of treat is pretty pricy."}
