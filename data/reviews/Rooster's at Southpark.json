{"text":"The inside of Rooster's is fine, and the service is nice, but it's sneakily expensive and a little frustrating because of the combination of high prices and a la carte menu.. The meat portions are very, very small. Vegetable and other choices are relatively larger. I ordered the hangar steak and it was literally 6-7 bites for $18. I'd consider this more of an over-priced tapas restaurant than anything else.  Although all of the food was quite good, I won't be back as there are too many other choices providing a better experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch a few days ago at the South Park location. Loved the interior, wine for days with a comfortable feel. My salad was perfect, not too big, scallops were tasty. Our server seemed busy but was very friendly and stopped by often to check in. Desserts were also tasty."}
{"text":"Consistently good and our favorite go-to place in Charlotte. Always delicious and I love how the staff seem to know us now and make an effort to chat. Truly feels like a neighborhood restaurant. LOVE Jim Noble's purpose and mission too."}
{"text":"Love this place...Live a few minutes down the street and is the first choice when friends come in town. Great food, good ambiance (some noise and good crowds but not too loud), and a cool setup/decor make for an awesome dinner.

Strongly recommend the wings and any of the potatoes au gratin"}
{"text":"The wait staff were wonderful, the restaurant very nice. My husband had the salami and cheese pizza which was excellent. I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes could have been more flavorful. Overall will return and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Service was great. Ambiance was great. Bbq chicken was tremendous. Don't recommend the salmon (very basic, came undercooked). Coconut cake is a must have. I just can't give 5 stars because I was let down with the entrees overall. Simplistic dishes."}
{"text":"Disappointing - met a friend there for dinner; he had been there several times but this was our first visit. My friend and I had the quarter chicken natural, which was fine, but on the small side. It was tasty enough, but not particularly juicy ( the kind of moist chicken that I would expect for $11). My wife ordered the \" famous\" six small shrimp for $17. Seriously?

We also ordered three sides - the corn, the beats and the succotash - all were fine but not unique in any way.

Since we split the bill with our friend, my part was $45 and some change for the chicken, 6 shrimp and two rather small sides. We left feeling a bit hungry.

There are many, many more excellent restaurants in the area where $45 + tip would have gotten us a more interesting and unique meal for that amount. Cafe Monte on Fairview, Upstream, and Village Tavern immediately come to mind.

Bottom line: food didn't have any pizazz, the prices were way out of line and we'll not likely give Roosters our patronage in the future. Just too many other good places in the South Park area"}
{"text":"Great food, great wine list. Specialty wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Service is always exceptional! Especially if you just grab some drinks from the bar. The hostess is always really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for business dinner two years ago and was good. Went here tonight for dinner and the dining experience was underwhelming to say the least. Service was horrible at best. First all of our meals come out except for one...it finally was delivered 5 minutes late. My husband ordered the large pork chop which was served cold and raw in the middle. The restaurant staff insisted it was cooked medium as ordered. Finally they took it back, and brought back the same pork chop which was still not cooked. Again, they insisted it was cooked correctly. No one wants to eat raw pork for obvious reasons. The prommes frites came out cold as if they had been sitting out all night. Those had to go back...the fresh ones were good. My husband ordered a Cabernet and was brought some red blend wine. We were afraid to say anything at this point. Ruined my birthday dinner with friends to say the least. Frosting on the cake...only one women's  bathroom stall was opened for entire restaurant so had to go to Walgreens down the street to use restroom because there were so many people in line to use the one at restaurant. Also food was delivered and it took us a while to flag some one down to bring us forks so we could eat. Oh ...well after some complaining and returning pork chop for the third time we got pork chop comped. Don't waste your money on this poorly managed restaurant. Go to Dresslers, Vivace, Carpe Diem or one of the other of comparable restaurants in Charlotte. By the way, the manager never came over to our table. Too busy."}
{"text":"This place is always good. I eat here as often as possible. The food is great and so is the service!"}
{"text":"I was at rooster's two days ago for dinner. I love the atmosphere there. 
The open kitchen is great and the weird wall of roosters is okay in my book.
I ordered the gnocchi with duck confit. When it arrived I was shocked by the size of it. It looked like an appetizer. I couldn't believe they didn't at least try to beef it up with more spinach and onions! When I bit into it I was in heaven. It was incredible. Perfect tender pieces of gnocchi and wonderfully flavorful duck in a sauce that I was scooping up with bread when I was done. My only complaint-not enough(although that's a big complaint). If they presented their dishes as small plates that would be one thing, but I placed my order expecting a nice sized plate of food(not a huge amount but a bit more than I got). That being said, I would return to rooster's,I just might eat a light snack before I leave home."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great. I had wood fire wings, Mac and cheese, salmon and pineapple crush cocktail. All of it was just great!! Atmosphere was wonderful as well. Just Fabulous. Highly Recommend !!"}
{"text":"Too many misses for us to go back, starting with the slow service and ending with over priced offerings for our tastes. I like to say something nice so I will add that our onion soup was quite good and the very small mushroom pizza....well, .nothing special but since I love mushrooms, I liked it ok. We asked for bread while we waited and what there was of it, was good. We certainly did not leave feeling stuffed so I guess that's a good thing! Just a little let down."}
{"text":"Great place if poor service and expensive cold food is your thing. The service was unbearably slow.  They ran out of pork shoulder and au gratin potatoes. When we were finally served it was cold. The bill was incorrect twice!  AVOID!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful time we had at this restaurant.  Friends of ours have been raving about this place and so we all went together last night to have wine and appetizers.  DELICIOUS!!!!  Wonderful service and great selection of items to choose from.  I would highly recommend this place.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Ate at Rooster's for dinner on a weekday around 6:00pm - we were seated promptly. The smells, oh the smells, when you walk in! You're greeted by a great smoky aroma, undoubtedly from the spinning spit fire roasted meats. We started with mussels, a special that day, which were great. We order mussels as an appetizer practically everywhere, and these lived up to our standards. I had the hanger steak, and my husband had the chicken, we also ordered the au gratin potatoes and haricot verts. Everything was great - though the highlight for me may have been the potatoes, I finished every last potato piece on the plate. They were truly decadent, and should probably be limited to a rare treat due to how creamy and cheesy they tasted.The haricot verts were also good, but slightly hard to eat because everything was served either on a very small plate or in a large, deep bowl, leaving no space to use to cut up the beans. Over all, very delicious and I'm sure we'll return!"}
{"text":"Ate here this past week. Honestly didn't know that the place was even there. I was pleasantly surprised by the feel and friendliness of the staff. I had the burger with a side salad. Burger was on point salad was fresh not pre-made. Love the smell of the wood fire ovens. 

The only bad thing, I think they could do a better job of making sure there is enough bread on the table. We asked twice to have the basket refilled and it took a bit. The bread is made fresh in the ovens daily, and it's outstanding. 

This is a must place if you love wood fired food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sunday brunch here and really enjoyed sitting out on one of the patio tables. We had an excellent server and everything about our meal was very enjoyable; fresh, cooked well, and seasoned perfectly. We would like to come back and try dinner, but would highly suggest to friends for brunch."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!  Just found this place randomly and enjoyed the experience.  Staff and food were amazing!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place, including \"Best Overall menu\" from Charlotte Magazine.  So my boss and I went there for a business lunch to try it out.  It definitely smells wood-fired, which I found quaint and enjoyable.  The one thing I did not find enjoyable was the \"Wall of Roosters\".  I get it--the name is Rooster's; but McDonald's doesn't have shrunken Ronald heads all over the wall. It was a tad weird--and a few were staring at me!

I was going light, so I just had the Arugula and goat cheese salad, which was good. It was a salad--Mom won't hear about it, but I would order it again.

My boss had a burger, which he described as \"fantastic\" and had the potatoes au gratin as a side, which was a recommendation from our waitress.  He loved those, and was moaning through most of lunch.  

Our server was friendly and helpful, and since we were two of the only customers there, she was very generous with the water and bread.

I would definitely go back to Rooster's, and look forward to trying something more substantial next time!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant.  The calamari appetizer was greasy and the server didn't ask why we had her take away an almost full serving of the dish.  There were two Grouper specials on the menu, one was already sold-out.  According to the server they only had 4 orders available to begin with; this tidbit of information left us with the impression that the \"special\" was nothing more than a way to dump food scraps on customers at a high price.  The other Grouper dish was overly salted otherwise it could have been tasty.  The grilled shrimp entree was unimpressive and looked very lonely on a large plate with no accompaniments, as did the roasted chicken breast.  As a party of three we all walked away disappointed and felt the offerings were over-priced. We are reside in the Washington DC region and the SF Bay Area and are accustomed to pricy restaurants and don't object when the food is good."}
{"text":"Service was good but not able to say much about the food.  Menu is over priced for the food being served.  Don't think we will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever!!!!!!!!!!!! Wtf we had a reservation and waited over an hour"}
{"text":"I recently ate at this Rooster's with a party of eight. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful the entire night. The food was fantastic. It is rare that everything that comes to the table is amazing, but that was the case. The seafood and other meats were all excellent.  Every side dish I tasted was cooked perfectly and flavorful. I have been numerous times, and I am never disappointed. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am shocked this restaurant is not rated one of the best in Charlotte.   I have spent 3 nights in town and ended up eating dinner here all 3 nights.  Amazing service and food.  The service and staff are unprecedented.  They are very informative and solicitous to your every request.  Obviously chicken is the specialty but do NOT miss the Charcuterie plates or the desserts.  Out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Recently had a outstanding dinner,  but do not order desserts, for some reason it always mediocre."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with Rooster's.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and it came w/o a celery stalk, just a wedge of lime.Mom ordered a white zinfadel and instead of saying they did not have it they brought a rose instead and said it was the sweetest thing they had!  A little insulting. We ordered our food then and the salads came quickly but they were finished and we waited a long time for our entrees. Finally asked the waiter and he said the kitchen forgot the hamburger which held him up.  Food finally came and all was good except the CORN that everyone raved so about....it was terrible.  Dry, overlooked and no flavor for $6 in a very little bowl.  It was also very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation.  Maybe best to go for a lunch date!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, wonderful staff and good atmosphere. Loved the wine selection (even though I'm mostly a beer gal). The food was perfect. Totally recommend for a date night and can't wait to go again. It's family style with the sides and the protein choices are made for even the pickest eaters."}
{"text":"High level; good food, poor service, and oddly conceptualized menu. Took my family there on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived in time for the start of the dinner menu which worked well. However, when we went to order some of these dinner menu items, items such as the pizzas were not ready, along with a couple of the potato-based side items. Details of this were not disclosed when ordering, which was quite irritating. Which brings me to the service, which was extremely average for a 3.30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Drinks and food took along time to arrive, the menu was poorly explained, and just generally not very impressive. In addition, we had fruit flies at our table throughout the meal. When I mentioned this to our server, she said they knew about the issue but it was because of people opening the front door- interesting explanation I thought. My concern was apparently shared with the manager but no visit was paid to our table thereafter. Beyond that, the food was very good and had a nice ambience. I would suggest they decide what kind of the restaurant they are in terms of al a carte vs non al a carte since some dishes included sides and some didn't. For those that didn't, this was poorly explained and the side dishes were expensive and not particularly family style, as suggested by our server. Also, it was kind of odd receiving a breast of duck in a cold dish, without a plate to add sides to. While I'd recommend the food, there are far better restaurants for the price point, with better service."}
{"text":"The service was great!!! Mac and cheese and spinach was on point. If your a steak lover try the hanger steak."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal there tonight.  All the dishes that we had were great especially the BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The atmosphere was really nice. The service was excellent. It was obvious that others were enjoying their meals too."}
{"text":"My experience with roosters has lead me to this conclusion: The management and the owners of this restaurant are greedy and arrogant. They treat their staff with little to no respect from what I saw. I witnessed a manager yell at a young waitress till she cried. The food is decent, but way overpriced."}
{"text":"Rooster's is a locally owned Charlotte restaurant. The decoration is rustic with European influences- food is a mix of Spanish, French and Italian cuisine. They also try to incorporate local products/flavors into the menu each season. I've never had a bad experience here. The servers are friendly and attentive. Keep in mind that the portions are small (a la carte) 

Recommend: linguini and clams, sweet potato ravioli, farm fresh mozzarella salad"}
{"text":"Just had the worst, greasiest, saltiest calamari ever. I typically like this place and eat here often. I've had their calamari before too. Never has the food been this awful. Must be new kitchen staff. Service from  the friendly bartender was great; which is why I offered the extra star."}
{"text":"The smoked wings are amazing! So incredibly good! Try them you won't regret it! The Mac and Cheese is also extremely delicious! My daughter ordered the kid's duck confit and loved it! We sat at the bar, the bartender was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food  unique menu  my favorite"}
{"text":"Their brunch game is pretty weak. Their brunch menu consisted of 4 or 5 items. Then they hand you their regular lunch menu.  The food we had was pretty oily and one note (our mozzerella pizza and grilled cheese sandwich). The tomato basil soup tasted off as well. I missed the anchovy spread on my ceasar salad. There was rock hard croutons and funky tasting black olives instead. I didnt have the best experience here food-wise. Seems too safe and plain. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have to speak about this because it frustrates me when I read these reviews. I am so sick of hearing everyone complaining about how EXPENSIVE roosters is and the small portions..... This is absurd!  Im sorry that roosters does not have the same prices  and massive food portions as Applebees that most of you all must be used to who complain about the $ but give me a break. Roosters for the money, food quality and service is probably the best deal in town. You would spend 3 times your tab if you went to Del Friscos or Mortans downtown. 

To be able to have a very nice dinner for 2 for under 100 bucks in CLT with wine is a deal. 

STOP BEING SO CHEAP PEOPLE JEEEEZE"}
{"text":"Rooster's is great for special occasions. Manager Yuri and server/bartender Jeff helped us put together a private event in the wine room. From first contact to the end of the party, the staff was attentive, courteous and professional. The food was delicious and pleasing to everyone, and drinks were fantastic. Thank you rooster's!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Uptown location.

Lots of win here. 
Stopped in without a reservation to celebrate a friend's birthday.

Great, knowledgeable service, 
Warm, pleasant atmosphere, 
Worthwhile wine list,
Delicious charcuterie and cheese offerings ( Humboldt Fog, anyone?)

Definitely a welcome Uptown addition."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to treat my husband for Father's Day dinner. We started with the calamari (delicious), I had the salmon and my husband the short ribs with au gratin potatoes and butter beans. My daughter had the sliders from the kids menu and enjoyed them as well. We will be back again, worth every dollar spent!!"}
{"text":"Service is great, but food is ok.  We ordered the roasted chicken and a few other chicken dishes and they were ok.  3 stars because the service was great."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beatiful and in a great location but the service is very slow. It took a long time before the waitress even came to our table to introduce herself and take drink orders. Additionally, I ordered the chicken, their speciality dish and it was dry and bland. I could have made a better chicken dish at home which is very disappointing. Finally the prices are too high for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant , nice atmosphere. engaging wait staff  disappointing food. My wife and I recently had lunch here and to be blunt I've had better sandwiches at takeout places in strip malls , in other words price didn't match presentation.We definitely expected a little more."}
{"text":"My mom and I came in for lunch today.  We had Geoffrey as a server.  My mom had ordered a bowl of soup & vegetable plate.  I ordered breakfast.  Everything was going great...and then we realized that our entrees were taking a while to get out.  We did not have to ask about our food.  The manager, Fernando (I think :) -- came to us and apologized on behalf of the chef saying that our food would be out momentarily.  Our food ended up having a 32 minute ticket time.  

I work in the restaurant industry and it is in moments like these that restaurants either SINK or SHINE.  ROOSTERS SHINED!!!!

I had a certain expectation of comps, but my expectations were exceeded when we were told that our entire meal would be comped as well as a complimentary dessert (which had not been ordered).

Kudos to a restaurant team that understands customer service and long-term vision.  We will DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the portions were so large I had leftovers to 2 days.  Our waitress, however, left much to be desired.  Upon the server finally coming over to greet our table, I ordered a pomegranate martini.  The waitress asked me if I had ever had that drink there.  I told her I didn't recall.  She said she'd never seen it made there but wouldn't go check to see if it could be made.  Finally, my boyfriend asked her outright to go check.  She, of course, responded with a lot of attitude, and ten no surprise, the drink couldn't be made.  That set the tone for a lot of attitude the rest of the night from her.  I would have given 1 star based on the service, but the bread and water ladies were no nice and helpful, I gave 2.  

Bottom line, the food was alright, but don't ask for anything extra or risk the awful attitude we endured all night."}
{"text":"Great ambience, concept, and service. Had the salad-of-the-day (a bit simple), bbq pork shoulder (meh), smoked salmon (very good), and roasted beets (good)."}
{"text":"A miserable experience from start to finish. Loud sports TV being broadcast in the bar where we waited and sipped the expected overpriced-yet-average wine. We were led to a table in a far corner from which we could view the delivery door being opened and closed. Then our waiter, who had either NO training or the worst sense of timing ever, strolled by to take our order after we'd been waiting, oh, 15 minutes or so. The food was bland, arrived haphazardly, was cold more often than not...you get the idea. And when we were ready for the check? You guessed it -- another 15 minute wait. I cannot fathom the appeal of this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch over the weekend. Service was great!  No complaints there.  However, the food was a bit disappointing.  I thought the price should reflect a higher quality of food.  Ordered tomato soup bisque which was really good.  For the salad with scallops, the avocado that was on the menu as being a part of the salad, was actually guacamole blobs around the plate.  It tasted like they got too ripe so they blended it and squirted it on the plate.  The dressing wasn't bad, scallops were cooked pretty well but with only 3, I felt it needed a 4th to complete the large arugula portion.  My husband ordered the Vietnamese sandwich, which wasn't quite there either.  The pomme frites were on the larger side but a bit softer, not as crisp than I would imagine for pomme frites.  Overall, for the money, wasn't worth it to me and felt that Firebird's one block down had better food for the price."}
{"text":"Surprised by the good reviews on this place.  I had a Vietnamese pork sandwich with daikon. It was copied pork with bad BBQ sauce and coleslaw.  Been to Vietnam y'all. This isn't even close.  Service was slow.  Waitress did not speak English well enough to communicate with our table.  Questions were left unanswered.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch spots in the South Park area. Get there early because it gets full fast!  Tomato Bisque soup is the best!"}
{"text":"After my third visit to this restaurant, I think it will be some time before I return.  First of all, I find it more than a little off putting when the first words out of the waiter's mouth is \"Would you like bottled sparkling or still water, or tap water\"?  It's just plain annoying and seems to suggest that you're cheap if you don't spring for bottled water.  What it really says to me is \"while you're here we'd like to wring as many dollars out of you as possible and if we have to make you feel uncomfortable while doing so , so be it.

We went for brunch today, and I was going to order the open faced serrano ham and cheese sandwich with mornay sauce until my waiter warned me that the portion is very small and that I might want to order some additional side dishes if I ordered it.  Given that he must have weighed 140 lbs soaking wet, I took him seriously and changed my order to the Southpark Fry:  duck confit hash, fried oysters, fried egg, and duck jus.  Sounds delicious, right?  It was merely OK and for $14 there should have been more than two small fried oysters and one ounce of duck confit.  There were more onions than anything else in this dish.  If this was a large portion, the ham and cheese sandwich must truly be tiny.

My wife had the \"steak burger\" and again we were annoyed at the small portion.  It was the size of a slider and completely unremarkable.

If you want to spend $40 on lunch and still come away hungry, Roosters is your kind of place."}
{"text":"Not as Good as I thought it was gonna be. The food was good but nothing special, especially for the price. Everything was a la carte and again the sides were not unique or special in anyway. I got two specialty drinks from the bar and they both sucked. Sent one back and didn't even finish the other. Our entrees were pretty good , my boyfriend got a steak and I got a salad, the dressing was delicious. The decor inside is cool and it's beautiful inside."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one here has mentioned the shrimp and grits...they are the best I've had anywhere...and I'm a foodie! I'm afraid to try shrimp and grits anywhere else because I know I'll be disappointed, and so far I've been right. My son won't visit me from NJ without going for shrimp and grits. AWESOME! Also their vegetables are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times while visiting my parents in Charlotte, and think it is great.  I don't think we've ever made a reservation, and have always been seated promptly.  One of those times was at a table near the bar, which was fun because the bartender was sommelier-ish and was able to recommend some delicious wines off their list.  Every time I've been, I've had the burger, medium rare (awesome).  The brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and asparagus are all great.  I've sampled the pork shoulder and it's very good.  I didn't find the prices to be particularly outrageous, but I don't have much experience dining in Charlotte, so I can't really speak to that.  All in all, I'd recommend going here if you're in the mood for some yummy wood-fired a la carte food."}
{"text":"If you enjoy great Southern cuisine ,this will be the place for you! the food is amazing...the service is perfect...and the ambience is excellent! I enjoyed the beef short ribs...and a wonderful arugula salad with feta..SO fresh!"}
{"text":"Rooster's cares. They care about their food (local and sourced), the ingredients, fresh. They care about spices, people. They take care of you, patron or worker. The restaurant truly is a Southern jewel. The owner, kind hearted Christian Jim Noble. The manager, tender, evasively strong Fernando Derado. You ruin your experience in Charlotte if you don't come here.

~ex employee, 6 months separated, knows the value of a good restaurant in the South."}
{"text":"If I have someone coming to Charlotte for the first time, I take them here. 
It's a boisterous place with a central open kitchen and some damn fine food. Actually, the fries here are the best friends I've had anywhere. In the world. 
THAT good.
Making reservations ahead of time usually circumvents any wait time. If you want the Mother/Father's Day brunch - and you do - book it early. It's a wonderful brunch with so many good things on it. 
The menu at Roosters tends to be small. The lunch menu of sandwiches/burgers, salads, a couple soups (French onion is a standout), small pizzas and the like will please pretty much anybody. Dinner has a standard menu that has chicken, pastas and the like with 2 features every night. The fish selections are always wonderful. The other special can be a pasta, pork, beef - it's entirely seasonal and random. 
They will ALWAYS sell out. 
Roosters is not the place to go to at 10pm Saturday night and expect to find the trout with fiddleheads still available. The secondary menu feels like a letdown once the glamorous specials are out. 
So, what's the favorite thing here besides the fries? Pan roasted corn. Yes, really. It's a local thing and a roosters is known for their corn: peppery, buttery and good. 
The best thing here is something nobody else will want or notice, a totally overlooked menu item: on the children's menu is my son's most favorite dish ever: duck confit.
You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Jim Noble is the man."}
{"text":"I usually go there for lunch and I try to have something different each time. The basil pesto pasta was excellent, however, the chef is a stickler about keeping the menu items as is and not allowing for any changes. Even so, the ambiance is good and the food comes out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Sometimes you enter a restaurant with certain expectations. Sometimes these expectations are derived from reviews online, sometimes friends' praises, and other times it's by coming upon the restaurant itself and gauging the quality of food simply through the interior design/ambience. Upon entering, and seeing the open kitchen right in the middle of the restaurant, I thought to myself, \"I'm in for a scrumptious dinner.\"

The walls were adorn with a number of prismatic stuffed cocks, and everything else looked trendy and clean. The restaurant was so busy that there were no available seating inside the restaurant. So the four of us opted to sit outside instead. This restaurant apparently has a huge winelist. Were I a wine drinker, I would've appreciated it very much. Alas, I am not a drinker of wine due to a lack in a certain required sophistication, thus I did not appareciate the wine list. In fact it made the menu very confusing. Yes, I am dumb I couldn't figure out the menu at first. 

The menu items are moderately priced. $$ according to yelp  price range. The wait staff was attentive and got to our order fairly quickly. To start we ordered smoked salmon and fried oysters. The fried oysters came with a side of marinara sauce and the breading was perfect. The oysters itself was very fresh and juicy. The smoked salmon was smoked well and subtly flavored. The only complaint I have regarding the salmon is that it could've been chilled a little bit more. It was a little warm. Typically I like raw fish to be slightly colder. 

I ordered the Quarter chicken dark done natural style. They got me with their rotisserie chicken going round and round in the back of the chicken. Plus, with a name like Roosters, got to try their chickens. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese because my friend swore it tasted like it was made by our lord and savior JC.
 
I was not at all impressed with the chicken. In fact my first thought when I tasted it was, \"Boston Market is much better\" But, to give them credit, they use organic or locally raised chicken, so that does affect the texture of the meat making it slightly tougher than caged chicken. So that is excusable, however it was certainly lacking in flavor. 

The mac and cheese was good, but not mind blowing. One of my friends had onion rings. Those were some good onion rings. The breading was flavorful and the rings very thin and delicious. The spinach was very well done as well. My other friend had the mussels and he loved it. 

Portion size wasn't an issue because I wasn't all that hungry. 

I think this is one of those cases where I ordered the wrong dishes. I should try other, more exotic items like seafood or breaded dishes since their breading is so good. I'll update their rating next time I visit the restaurant. However, for now, I'll have to give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent. As newbies to the Charlotte area my fiancé and I are making our way through the more popular/well-known restaurants in town. We are using a list of Charlotte Magazine's 25 best local restaurants as a guide and Rooster's is near the top - so we gave it a whirl. We loved it. From the taxidermy roosters on the walls to the open kitchen, dimly-lit ambiance, and excellent food, what's not to love? We didn't have a reservation (which I'd recommend) so we sat at the bar (this is often our preference anyway so it was perfect) - we enjoyed excellent wine, ate the cured duck and creamy Chapel Hill cheese to start, and finished with gnocchi, pan-fried corn, and BBQ chicken. All-in-all an excellent meal made better by an excellent ambiance. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came here twice, both in a small group hanging at the bar and as part of a larger one with a formal sit-down dinner. First the negative: the sit-down dinner was pretty bleh: mass-produced for mass capacity in the function room, which was kind of chilly. Hanging at the bar was better with appetizers and wine: try the calamari for sure. The wine-by-glass list was largely very decent and reasonably priced. But getting kicked out at 11 because the place was closing was a bit of a drag. This place gets super-crowded on Saturday nights, so they must be doing something right, but I'm not quite sure what that is, or what the whole stuffed cocks on the wall thing is (I mean roosters, you pervs!)"}
{"text":"The chicken wings and the braised beef rib were very good. The service was great and it was a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Rooster's in South Park for the first time on Saturday night.

My first impressions of the restaurant were excellent. We had made a reservation via OpenTable, and upon arriving for our 7:30 reservation at 7:25PM, the hostess took one glance at her terminal after asking my name and said, \"Your table is waiting, follow me.\" That's what I want to hear.

Once we were sat, however, it was a full 10 minutes before our server came to our table. After such a prompt seating by a hostess who conveyed gravitas and professionalism (she wasn't some college kid, which impressed me greatly) I was expecting promptness and seasoned professionalism throughout the place. 

Our waiter finally showed up, and didn't ask if we wanted to know the specials, or have any information for us. Instead, when I asked him about the beers on draft, he informed me that no beers were on draft (which is fine) and disappeared for another five minutes to get us a beer menu. 

He placed it with us, then left again, then returned to ask us if we had decided on drinks. We had, so we ordered them, and again he was off - with no inquiry about if we had any questions on the menu, and no offer to take our order. Yeah, I was hungry. Got a problem with that?

We finally got bread, and water, which I had trouble getting refilled. I also drink a lot, and drink fast (which yes, caused me problems in my college days). I found that water-filling staff members would  come and fill the water glasses of the newly-seated tables around us, without a single look at my empty water glass. Finally, I stopped one woman going to the table next to me and asked with my eyes and a nudge if she could spare some more water. 

Our orders were eventually placed and the food was good - very good. But the portions were small. The three stars are for the food, to be sure. My husband ordered the lamb chop special, which he very much enjoyed. He particularly enjoyed the mint sauce that came with it.

I ordered the hangar steak, cooked medium, and the pan fried corn. I received hangar steak, cooked rare. Fortunately, I can enjoy steak cooked along the spectrum from rare to medium well, so I didn't send it back. Besides, I had waited long enough for my food, I wasn't about to let my server take it back so he could have them re-cook it and risk the spit. So yeah, when he checked in I smiled broadly and said, \"Everything is great!\" as I ate my steak that mooed. The corn was good, but nothing I couldn't easily recreate in a cast iron skillet at home with a few ears of fresh corn and some butter.

This restaurant visit was a part of our \"date night\" so my husband and I enjoyed  the evening. The next day, my husband confessed to me that he was expecting more from a \"wood-fired kitchen\" - like, stuff that actually tasted like it had been cooked over a wood fire. Neither of our entrees had any smokiness to them. He had been itching to go to Firebirds, but we chose Rooster's instead because it was \"new\". Firebirds delivered more on the smoke when we last visited there.

We likely won't be going back to Rooster's for date-night in the future. The food was okay, but didn't wow me. The ambiance was \"meh\". The gem of the night was that fantastic professional hostess. I wish Noble could channel that excellence into the rest of the experience at Roosters."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was rather underwhelmed by Rooster's. Basically, the wood-fired roasted chicken wasn't anything I couldn't order from Harris Teeter. Not great, not terrible, either. And if I'm going to shell out big $$$ for a meal, I'd prefer to get my socks knocked off.

Still, the atmosphere and decor says a lot about Rooster's; I did like how spacious and roomy, and how quaint, the restaurant felt. I think it makes a nice place for a quiet date with someone. I'll probably try it again...soon-ish."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Roosters South Park and eat there often, even though its a hike from Concord! Had lunch there Wednesday and between my pork spare ribs, daughter's pasta and wife's spit-fired chicken we were once again pleased. We ate our roasted veggies too: corn and beets that day. Especially appreciated young manager Yuri stepping in to assist the wait staff...how did he know? He used to be a server, the second time we have experienced this connectedness (Steve is always great!) and proud of Jim Noble's staff promoting from within. Sometimes I go just to breathe the wood-fired air but the food is always excellent and we feel at home when we go!"}
{"text":"We started off the night with the house caesar salad and the roasted chicken pizza. The caesar salad was decent but just a little light on the caesar dressing. Aside from the burnt crust the roasted chicken pizza was one of the better parts of the night. The toppings were flavorful and had it not been burnt it may have been an excellent pizza.

For her entree Ella got the Potato gnocchi with a rabbit confit. The gnocchi was light, fluffy, came with a really  delicious sauce and a crispy confit. Our only complaint with this dish was the ridiculously small size. For an $11 pasta we were expecting a full bowl that would be a hearty dinner. What we got instead was hardly big enough to be an appetizer.

I got the steak burger for my entree which may have been alright.. had it not been served nearly raw. When the waiter asked how I liked my burger to be cooked I replied \" medium well \"instead it came out juicy, red, and bloody with a light sear. I also got a side of Pan Fried Corn which was one of the better dishes of the night. My burger came with a side of onion rings which were greasy, lightly battered, and not worth finishing.

Ella got the Caramel Cake for dessert and after one bite declared it inedible. For my perspective it was extremely sweet and had the texture of pure butter. I went with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream because I wanted to compare it with the one we got at the Kings Kitchen a few weeks ago. The final verdict.. a lot of chocolate, not enough peanut butter crunch, and the ice cream melts way to fast to be enjoyed throughout the dish.

We didn't like Roosters much and for the time being can't recommend that anyone waste their time trying it. If you love it.. thats great, but for the creepy rooster wall, dim lighting, burnt food, raw food, and small portions we cant recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow. I came here for a lunch with colleagues and we tried a bunch of appetizers and different lunch dishes - it was all delicious. The manager didn't think I liked my salad, but I was just stuffed. Amazing food!! we had the calamari, pimento cheese, and wings. I also had the tomato basil soup and chicken spinach salad which was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in there Valentine's Day around 5 pm. There was hardly anyone there and plenty of staff. The chicken wings were very good as was the salad. My low grading is due to the very unfriendly staff. We sat at the bar and we were acknowledged enough to place an order and pay the bill. Obviously we weren't looking for romance if we're sitting at the bar. We won't go there again."}
{"text":"When in Charlotte, I always go to Rooster's! I can always depend on excellent food and get excellent service from the hostess to the waitress to the entire staff. My wife and I have never had a bad meal or bad experience at this place. All appetizers entrees are superb but the coconut cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Already kinda biased because I have been to the one in uptown before so I already had high expectations and it didn't disappoint! The food is just consistently good and service is just as good! Came here for dinner Friday @ 8 made a reservation sat down after about a 3-5 min wait.  I was going to order one of the specials they had on the menu that night but they ran out :( so I settled on the wings! Not that it's a bad thing because they are really good! Honestly don't think you can have anything bad at Roosters! Becoming one of my favorites places to go to get a good meal!"}
{"text":"Visited the Morrison Blvd location for lunch on a Tuesday. Really cool, clean, contemporary place that smells sooooo good. The wine bar is in a separate area and looks great too. Our server, Maurice, was very friendly and helpful. Good, but somewhat limited, draft craft beer selection that seems to rotate. They have more options in bottles. Falafel wrap was great and was a generous portion. My husband ordered the quarter chicken and enjoyed it (wasn't sure it was quite worth all the hype, though).  The side of beets was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Roosters does good things to chicken! Their food style and decorations are like an upscale Cracker Barrel (minus the breakfast) - Half Chickens, Meatloaf, Pork Chops, Shrimp & Grits plus other Southern staples like pimento cheese appetizer and fried oysters! I'm a native North Carolinian, so these items please me greatly! The decorations are rustic farmhouse antiques like old butcher stands & taxidermy Roosters. And the food is served in small cast iron platters to add to the rustic charm. Today we went family style and ordered all of their most popular menu items. All of which were delightful and the seasonal gelato: Peppermint stick was the perfect finish to our feast.."}
{"text":"Restaurant is totally over rated, overpriced chicken, expensive sides with average wine selections. Skip the smelly interior and go to BrickTops."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Excellent service, delicious smells, great ambiance and a fantastic meal! Will surely be going back"}
{"text":"Rip off.....tiny portions of average food at high prices, not a good combo.  Poor service to boot.  Very dissappointing"}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis, probably at least five to six times per month (yes, we don't cook at home, so plent of opportunities for dining out each week). As a couple, or in a larger group, we've never had a bad experience at Roosters. I'm truly amazed that I have read some negative reviews. Everything is ala carte with reasonable prices. I don't usually eat chicken, but have had theirs, both regular and BBQ, and have found it to be exceptionally good. My favorites are the short ribs (very tender and flavorful) and the onion soup (incredibly rich). When it's offered, which is only when they can get a special local tomato in season, the BLT is absolutely wonderful. Service is exceptional, team approach with some taking order, others delivering the food. The roosters on the wall are interesting and a unique decor. An excellent choice for groups (they have a second set of tables across the hall) and I don't think you can go wrong eating here. My one negative is that the corned beef hash on Sunday brunch is not your typical hash, not bad, but not at all what I expected (so there, I can find some fault, but really had to work at it)."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it is certainly not a value. Tends to be loud during lunch as well, so if you are planning a working lunch, bring your outside voice. Parking is better than most places on this strip."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get- $8 salads & sides- even appetizers like 2 oz. of salmon -$8 with nothing else on the plate- no capers, crackers- nothing. 1/4 chicken (small) is only $10- but served with nothing. Food is good- but you'll leave hungry unless you get a salad, appetizer, entree, side."}
{"text":"I admit, I was a little scared/overwhelmed by all the taxidermied roosters on the wall when I entered the restaurant (Note: if you have a fear of birds, this may not be the place for you-- they literally have one wall ornamented with stuffed roosters). Our server Steve was the man..he may have been the best waiter I've ever had. He was so knowledgeable, fast, and friendly. The General Manager even came out to say hello. I had the cheese plate, the gnocchi (which was to die for), and the soft shell crab that had a panko crust. Everything was delicious. I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go on a date or when I am looking to treat myself. Everything is fresh and the presentation is always lovely. The service is some of the best I've had. I have had a waiter from the restaurant recognize me out on the street weeks later and say hello. The cheese plate is always a wonderful way to start the meal, the wines are wells priced and it is a lot of fun to share lots of small vegetable dishes. My fiance loves the duck confit and I am in love with their succotash and the macaroni and cheese. This is one of my favorite place to eat, I just wish I could afford to do it more often."}
{"text":"Lunch fried oyster salad and tomato soup bam! Dinner wood fired quarter chicken, fresh salad and excellent portions. When you see the decor you understand. It's tastefully done and quite impressive. I do believe the food and chefs are qualified to prepare anything off the menu that may suit you, menu changes daily with new fresh preparations thanks rooster"}
{"text":"So everyone told me I had to try out Cowfish. Well with a 2 1/2 hour wait on a Saturday night (I should have expected that) we ended up going to Rooster's instead and I was not disappointed. 

Rooster's is an interesting place. We opted for sitting at the bar that looks into the wood fire cooking area. Twas a little warmer but we were famished and didn't want to wait for a table. Everything is a la carte so you have a good amount of options on what you can order. I'm a sucker for trying new cheeses so I was really close to getting the pick three option until one of the chefs in the cooking area told me you only get an ounce each. That would not do for my level of hunger. Instead I got the fire roasted chicken wings. I almost embarrassed myself for how fast I tore them apart. They were smoky, flavorful, and so delicious. Along with a side of spinach I was completely satisfied. 

One day when I'm rolling in the dough I'll come back to this place to enjoy all the things I wanted on the menu...aka all the cheese!"}
{"text":"So Glad we chose to eat at Roosters.  My wife has Celiac Disease so eating out, although easier these days, still a gamble for \"Gluten-free Restaurants\".  After looking in Yelp at the reviews we were pretty comfortable in our decision.  We loved it from the moment we walked into the door.  Great atmosphere with the Rustic Vibe and open concept kitchen..   our server was phenomenal giving us the right amount of time to decide.  His suggestions and concern for our allergies were his number priority.  
The food??   Phenomenal.  I ordered the Pork Loin special and my wife the Duck. The kids ordered the Burger, the 1/4 Chicken and the Bisque.  For sides we had the potato's, grilled corn, beets and fries.  Everything was absolutely delicious!   
Thanks Rooster for the out of town experience!   We'll visit again for sure, when in North Carolina again"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best diners I've ever had in Charlotte.  I ordered the beef short rib and fried corn;  both were off the charts.  Great setting and the host was wonderful!  The dinner party I was with all agreed this place is very special.  Thanks for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Great Lunch menu, horrible dinner menu and they take forever to serve you food, especially if you have a togo order. It took me 45 minutes to get my order and they knew I was waiting at the bar."}
{"text":"For the past year & a half this place has been my standby for dinner after arriving at CLT airport.  Food is much better than the chain type places nearby... however, last few times I've been there I've left a bit disappointed.  I was there two nights ago & felt the food was overseasoned which is hiding the true flavor.  

Service is always very friendly & accommodating.  Next time I'll remember to ask for dressing on the side & steamed veggies unadorned.  Yes, there are folks that can't survive without salt... give them a salt shaker.   With the awesome Charlotte Farmers market nearby... let the veggies speak for themselves.

I find lots of fried and \"smothered\" options on plenty of southern menus.  Roosters needs to be a gourmet cut above to match the price & service.  They've hit the mark before & they can do it again  You can definitely do worse in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hey Roosters folks, the common them thru most of these neg. reviews are portion size...do u read these at all?..I've seen similiar complaints on other social sites....most folks aren't looking for a Golden Corral hog trough buffet to gorge themselves, but enough to come close to justify the prices you charge. If I order range-fed chicken, I don't expect the whole bird, but i DO expect more than a baseball size piece of meat with artistic drawings/arrangements on the plate for $15. You consistently get some of the worst reviews of any Southpark eatery..WAKE UP before you CLOSE UP!"}
{"text":"Rooster not to be confused with Chef Marcus Samuelson restaurant Red Rooster in Harlem, NY is a refreshing take on Southern open kitchen dining with a refreshing menu and true Southern hospitality staff.
While in SouthPark the family and I usually steer toward the typical four restaurants and one day we decided to randomly select and try something different after shopping and Yelp popped up Rooster and we said since it was first in the results we would try.
Today marked our second visit and each time we were HAPPY. Our first visit yielded memorable items in which we repeated one of them = the dessert of desserts Coconut Cream Cake. This cake is not your typical cake it's cool in temperature and extreme in flavor with layers of awesomeness and a MUST HAVE.
Our FAVORITE apps include the avocado toast it's so flavorful with cilantro and pickled red onions and the fried oysters. The oysters are fried to perfection and the sauce is full of flavor. This place is one of the very few places that give you a nice amount of fried oysters in your order which is a plus.

Tonight I tried the grouper over fingerling potatoes and a confee which was tasty, the potatoes and veggies more than anything because the fish was sorta over cooked but still tasty. If it was cooked a little less it would've been perfect. My hubby had the hanger steak which he wasn't too impressed with its flavor. He did however enjoy his duck tenders and the roasted corn side it was amazing.
I Love the decor and have me thinking if all those roosters on the wall are real stuffed roosters Hmmm. Well if so cock a doodle do LoL

Great place with friendly staff"}
{"text":"Coincidentally, good friends of mine were passing through Charlotte during one of my moves.  They offered to help and, in return, I offered to take them out to someplace really nice.  We picked Rooster's because (a) it was new, (b) I had wanted to try it, and (c) it was fairly close to my new home.  

We were all pretty tired from packing, moving, and cleaning all day (me, most of all), so it felt like a load had been lifted off my shoulders when we walked into the fairly dimly lit Rooster's and were immediately seated without a reservation.  My only shock came when I discovered that the menu items were all offered a la carte, and no one item was all that cheap!  I let that pass, though, thankful for my friends' help and hoping that we'd have an excellent meal.  Turns out, we did have an exceptional meal.  Every a la carte item we ordered was delicious, starting with the soups and breads, and finishing with dessert.   It was about $200 (for a party of four, with drinks) that was well-spent, considering what the cost of movers (and/or my time and patience) could have been.  

I'd love to go there again, but with the pricing for each item, it's going to have to be another very special occasion before I return."}
{"text":"Oh my...save your money folks.  Had a reservation... STILL had to wait 20 minutes... with no where to wait....the bar was full so we stood at the door getting in peoples way. The waitress and the hostess were as nice as could be... unfortunately it didn't make up for the MICROSCOPIC portions of food we got for dinner.  Honestly, I don't think I have EVER been to a restaurant with portions this tiny.....  I think they are catering to gnomes.  It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so expensive, but it was VERY overpriced for what you get... the food was ok.... sorta tasty, but my dinner was a bit salty, my husband and daughter had the tiny microscopic Hanger steak, which they liked, but again, we walked out starving. There are too many great places in Charlotte to eat where you can get you're money's worth.  Go there instead."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night with a few girlfriends.  We didn't have reservations so they put us at the \"Chefs Table\" which is the bar surrounding the kitchen.  We loved it! I would definitely recommend making reservations to have a normal table for next time, but it was fun to watch all of the food being cooked and the kitchen interact.  I ordered the Mushroom Fregola which was delicious! Our waiter was attentive and they always made sure we were doing well and our waters were filled even though we were kind of in the back corner.  I would definitely recommend and return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"After trying to come to lunch a bit late the other day, we were finally able to hit this place during lunch hours. Lunch ends around 3-330p, so make sure not to go to lunch too late like we did. 
The atmosphere when you walk in is very comfortable. The smells are divine coming out of the open roasters. While casual, it has a rustic classy feel. All of the interior is very well themed and compliments the rustic-style rotisserie foods. 
Service was on point. Our server checked in appropriately and refilled waters without being asked. Though not up to our server, our food came out quickly even though the restaurant was relatively busy.
My partner and I shared the arugula, chevre, and peach salad. The salad was very fresh and had a good summer feel. The peaches were not very acidic which paired well with the vinaigrette. When the salad was delivered, the runner asked if we would like fresh cracked pepper. We should have done so, as it was definitely a flavor I felt would have helped break down some of the vinaigrette. The vinaigrette wouldn't have been an issue if there had been a touch more chevre as it was the counter balance, but the chevre was extremely sparse. An ounce more would have been perfect.
My partner and I shared two different sandwiches, one being the chicken, gruyere, roasted garlic balsamic and the other being the spit roasted turkey breast with bacon. I'll start with the chicken. The chicken was moist and the balsamic was perfect. However, when it came down to the gruyere it was hard to find. When we opened the sandwich, there was very little. We weren't sure if this was intentional or not, but in both areas that there were cheese it was lacking. 
The spit roasted turkey was fresh, crisp, and refreshing. I opted out of the mayo (I'm not exactly sure who would put mayo and avocado on the same sandwich, but that just seems like overkill to me) which was a good choice. I felt that the turkey lacked seasoning as the chicken on the other sandwich had been so flavorful. This is a personal preference as my partner did not agree, but I would have rathered wheat instead of white bread. 
Both of us got fries on the side, and while a bit overly salted, the hand cut fries were crisp and fresh. 

All in all, we'll definitely be back. I wanted to try their lunch before diving into dinner and I fully anticipate returning soon."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night and this time the server Stephanie did an amazing job!! We were with two people that had never been and they loved it as well!! I don't know what they changed but whatever it is it's working!!"}
{"text":"The best barbecue chicken and Mac/cheese and the veggies. I really would go back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Following a recommendation, we stopped in at Rooster's during our short stay in Charlotte. I was not disappointed.

We had the NC BBQ Pork Shoulder and the Roasted Duck Breast. I very much enjoyed both dishes. The pork shoulder was very tender and coated just right with seasonings, spices, and bbq sauce. However, the duck breast was the real star of the show. Juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They managed to perfectly capture that good ol' rich & oily duck taste into those morsels. Potatoes au-gratin and the wilted spinach were our sides. They were good, but not much to write home about there. 

If I'm ever back in Charlotte I will definitely be looking to stop by here again."}
{"text":"Ahhh Roosters, where did you go wrong? Why am I giving you only two stars? Because, frankly, with the exception of the pan roasted corn and the wine list, you deserve 2 stars. Ugh.

Yes, the portions are small, and so when you add up enough things to get full, suddenly you parceled together a $24 meal.  But I just have a problem with the execution. I've been twice for dinner and twice for lunch. Their grilled salmon was burnt and not tasty. When I got a salmon salad on top of frisee, red peppers and fingerlings, the salmon was almost pure fat and tasted awful and I walked away hungry. 1/5  The pizzas are tiny.  Oh, the fries are actually quite delicious.  I'm just not clear why my friends like it so much.  Next time, I would just go to sit outside, have a glass of vino and maybe munch a little on the corn. 

Chef Noble, all my love for King's Kitchen, but this one misses the mark consistently for me.  Regrettfully,
Jules"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 5 on a Sunday afternoon .ended up being 4 of us.  Dining with my husband & niece & nephew. They gave us a large corner booth . We decided to share our food so we could try a little bit of everything. I'm glad we did! Ordered the Crostini bread with their pimento cheese, the dry rubbed chicken wings & the tomato basil soup.  The pimento cheese & bread was great! We used the soup almost as a sauce . Lol I had the shrimp & grits ( which are the large fluffy hominy ones btw) nice husband got the meat loaf he is particular about but said this was very good . Others got a hamburger &  the spit roasted chicken is large , tender & tasty! The atmosphere is cool with a open kitchen concept. The wait staff & management are attentive ! There is a wall celebrating Rooster's of all breeds. So vegans might not appreciate but I get it & thought it was quite unique . There is an enclosed courtyard area? Did take pics at this place ( sorry should have! ) atmosphere is relaxed rustic with some antiques . Tip- at brunch you can order eggs & things that aren't on the menu. Just ask"}
{"text":"My little sister's birthday dinner choice. Lots of small portions (not cheap) very nicely presented with a nice selection. OK lots of roosters -and a pheasant- on the wall with high ceilings and dark wood mixed with stone for atmosphere. I thought it was nice. 
My sister went for the Gluten Free menu and had the Rooster wings which were so tasty that I wasn't offer even one! I had the chicken fried woods mushrooms ( a bit bland but the dipping sauce was great.) My sis's husband had the onion soup which must have been good 'cause nobody was offered a sip and it was gone is 60 seconds. He had scallops for main course (4,) quite rich. I had a chicken quarter. Everything was elegantly served, the wait staff was very attentive, the deserts were something (my sister's pear sorbet was exceptional.)
A nice dinner can easily exceed $50 per person, but  it qualifies as a culinary experience to be properly savored- not just a meal."}
{"text":"Our first time to Roosters for an evening out with friends and we were not disappointed. We made a reservation by phone earlier in the day and we're seated right upon arrival. 

Our waitress was Kelby and she did a great job going over the menu, making suggestions and giving us time to decide and order. 

We ordered quarter roasted chicken, fried oysters, and 2 bbq meals along with onion rings and green beans (called haricot verts) and it was all good. The chicken is what I had and it came in a small cast iron pan and was super moist and seasoned well. The 2 guys ordered the bbq, and I had read in another review that the meat was cubed, but it still seemed strange. It wasn't as plentiful of a portion as I would've expected.  Hubby said the flavor was good but nothing spectacular.  The fried oysters were a hit and the onion rings were thin and crispy, my favorite! 

We ordered 2 desserts to share, the coconut cake which I HIGHLY recommend and the chocolate mouse pie which ai didn't sample. The coconut cake was light, creamy and just really good!

The price points matched the Southpark area, the decor was adorable and the ambience was casual but still super nice dinner night out for us. 

We would recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! hey have some of the best cheese and cured meats to start with. The wine list is great also so plenty to choose from to pair with your meal. The specials are always delicious and the portions are generous. Definitely put this place on your radar."}
{"text":"This place is the best food, service, and atmosphere in town. Waitress was extremely knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. We had a large group and had about half of the appetizers and then shared the sides as well since it's an a-la-cart type place. It's a little on the pricey side, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food and wine is great! We tried the duck, scallops, burger and chicken. They were all perfect. The spinach and asparagus was also very nice. Would definitely come back to try more. Everything was seasoned nicely. Had an amazing waiter. He allowed us to taste the wine before we purchased the bottle. Great for a date night or a ladies night."}
{"text":"Roosters was a very good experience. Service, ambiance and food! Extraordinary! We live 700 miles away and Roosters was worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner at Rooster's. While I have had their lunch several times, this was my first time having their dinner. It did not disappoint!

I had the Caesar salad and bowl of tomato soup. My boyfriend had the steak burger with butter beans. Everything was delicious. We ended the night with the coconut cake. My boyfriend doesn't even like coconut and even he loved it. It's worth it to visit just for the cake!

The service is good here. I like that they take their time. But I could see how some people feel it is on the slow side. There was no need to make a reservation when we went- we walked in on a Monday night and were seated immediately! 

Ambiance is good, but the birds aren't for everyone! Overall great experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. There is nothing I've tried that I did not like. All the food is delicious. Personally I love their short ribs and bbq chicken. It's easy for everyone at the table to try each other's dishes. Warm and welcoming atmosphere. Great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Wednesday night to try this place out. At first we were greeted with a semi-snooty \"do you have a reservation?\" which is fine to ask but you don't need to look down on me because we made a last minute decision to dine at your establishment. And, for the sake of being honest, the lack of the last star is because of this initial greeting. A second hostess appeared and the attitude disappeared and we were shown to a nice booth. 

We sat for a few minutes and had the chance to decide what we would like to drink from their pretty impressive wine by the glass list. The wine I originally ordered was out but the substitution was delicious so no big deal there! 

We placed an order of wings to have as an appetizer and they were delicious. These are not soaked in buffalo sauce dip them in ranch dressing wings, they are dry rubbed and smoked and the flavor is amazing. 

For mains I went with the burger and fries and the husband had the salmon and a side of the corn. First, let me say that he was kind enough to share a couple of bites with me so I could taste his and even though I'm not a big fish person I thought the salmon was really good as was the corn. The burger was delicious! Seriously, one of the best I have had in a really long time and the fries were also so good! 

The service was spot on and we're really looking forward to going back and trying more menu options. The patio seating looked really nice but I have recently quit smoking and there were people smoking at those tables so I'm not sure we'll be able to enjoy that anytime soon."}
{"text":"Omg, gimme some more of that duck.

Place was on point, service was great, food was too, top notch expierence,

Went for a private xmas company party, and they had no problem accommodating us, (30+),  we totally booked in advance too (please dont expect to walk in with 30+ unannounced\") tho i bet you they would have problem if you did.  

Their service staff rocked it out; drinks on time, attentive, and super polite and friendly,  what more can you ask for,

Food,
Man, everything that came out was on point.  Tasty, warm and all was well seasoned, no complaints.

Not gonna lie, duck confit... gotta give it a try, pretty legit.  

And the bread pudding too for dessert...omg, its a southern staple, and they completely nailed.  Not gonna lie, i licked my plate,

Overall,
Job well done guys, 

This place had been a staple in the Charlotte area for quite some time, and i totally understand why now.  Only wish would of come here more when i lived here, 

A++ guys, well done."}
{"text":"Great service, lovely wine selection and decant food. I had the cheese board & hanger steak...it was even plenty to share. The hanger steak was cooked perfectly. 
Definitely a great restaurant in the Southpark area."}
{"text":"Great place to go when on your own. Sit at the bar frequently when busy, have sat at tables as well with friends, and just a great experience all around. French onion soup and wings are amazing. The coconut cake is beyond delicious...no words to explain. Staff are always friendly and accommodating whether a party of one or 10. Nice walk from Piedmont Row Drive so hopefully burned off a few calories consumed!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever endured! I had the hanger steak, it was prepared perfectly, medium, great marinade, but came to the table ICE COLD! With the exception of the Mac n Cheese the sides were below par! Every time we would order a beer from the drink menu the server would leave, come back and say \"we're out of that beer\"! We spent $300 for an evening experience that was truly forgettable! Giving this place 1 star in overly generous!"}
{"text":"Chef John approach to using farm to table ingredients is displayed in the presentation and bold flavor of the a la carte choices of the menu. My sister and i came here from recommendation of previous yelp reviews and was pleasantly surprised with our choices. On the table we had smoked wings which was delicate vinegar smoke flavor with dry rub spice that blend well that had us licking fingers. We also enjoyed the chef special duck that was marinated in salt pepper sugar and its duck fat juices overnight. The duck was tender and full of flavor.  The next dish we had was one of the regular dishes  chicken that is rotisserie in the huge Italian brick oven and glazed over with light bbq sauce  that was a great combination of sweet and tangy. To complete our delightful  meal we had four sides smash potato, spinach , roasted beets, grits, and mac and cheese. All the sides had unique twist that only chef John could create that made the sides standout on there own. 
I was surprised how this resturant used simple ingredient and farm raised quality meats and veggies to make a menu with so much depth and variety that I will definitely be back to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! 

My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner last night and loved it. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but it wasn't too bad, we grabbed a drink at the bar and then the table was ready. 

First of all almost everything is A la cart so know you're going to spend money. We started with the charcuterie and had them pick what was on it. I'm so happy we did that we got some things we wouldn't have picked ourselves. My boyfriend got the chicken which of course being called roosters they're known for. He got the chicken BBQ style which had an Indian influence not a traditionally BBQ but he really enjoyed it. He also got a side of Mac and cheese...which was amazing! 

I got the mussels  which came with toasted bread and it was salty and delicious. I got a side of fire roasted beets and onion rings. Both were amazing. 

All in all the experience was delightful and our server was so friendly and helpful. We would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I was sent out to get a to-go order for my office. Everyone was a fan! Portions are light, but seemed to be enough to suffice. They were nice enough to write everyone's names on the lunches. THANK YOU ROOSTERS. I've also been there for dinner which was also nice."}
{"text":"Been enjoying Roosters since it opened and still love eating here. A great place to take out of town visitors too!"}
{"text":"This is the most stellar restaurant in Charlotte. It is my go-to place for great cheese, amazing wood-grilled meats, and good wine. The waiters really know their stuff. Try the duck confit or hanger steak for entrees and macaroni and cheese or corn for sides."}
{"text":"Still a favorite! Had lunch here last week.

Loved the grilled cheese and tomato bisque and the coffee.. OMG, to die for! Wish I could have taken a bunch of beans home, but my suitcase was seriously already like .2 from being overweight at 49.5 lbs...."}
{"text":"I eat here about 10 times a year and I had not had anything but a good experience. The food is always good. I love their: oyster salad (fresh and non greasy oysters), burger and fries (great fries), fried chicken livers (if you do not like liver try theirs it is soft deliciousness encased in a perfectly fried batter).
As far as service goes I have only experienced professional service and on more than one occasion I remarked how well run the place was. 
I tend to have lunch here so my comments may not apply to dinner; at lunch it is a good buy (entrees about $8 - $12). For dinner try Zebras, Carpe Diem, Barringtons, Gallery all of which offer an upscale dinning experience for an upscale price. Sorry for any misspelled names."}
{"text":"Wow!  Grilled meatloaf with seared spinach, sweet potato purée and fried onions.  Portions were perfect!  Flavors worked well together even when plated in porcelain coated cast iron serving pans. Deserts were not an option, we were so full from the lunch meal . #13 on Charlottes Best Restaurants for 2017, it is there for a reason!!"}
{"text":"We had a birthday dinner for a friend at Roosters. The ambiance and atmosphere there is great. However- the service was lackluster and the food was so/so. The waiter was slow and was too into the food and menu. He was also very introverted and kept to himself and was soft spoken. The food was fine- not bad but not great. Most things are ala carte- I had a pizza and my date had quarter chicken. I'd go back- but it's not a favorite spot of mine by any means."}
{"text":"Calamari- was good with the dipping sauce but the batter they fried it in was beyond salty

Mac and cheese- cheesy, a little on the salty side, but overall some good mac

Half chicken- definitely recommend getting it with the bbq sauce it was very tender and juicy

scallops- nothing special a little undercooked in my opinion

coconut cream cake- so good but a little too sweet for me 

our server was great though and was happy to make suggestions and explain the menu for our first time. probably will be back to try some of the other stuff on the menu, it seems like a creative menu just on the pricier side"}
{"text":"Fantastic fire roasted BBQ chicken! It was fresh and juicy. 

Something I didn't like however was the price and menu options. There were very few food options (I'm pretty sure their wine list was longer than their dinner menu). And $11 for a piece of chicken with no sides? Seems a bit extreme. Even for a high-end restaurant.

We didn't even get any bread before the meal, although I did see another table who did."}
{"text":"This is our second trip to this location and it is subpar compared to the Uptown location. On this trip, most of our food was heavily covered in ground pepper. A place that has food like this should not use chefs who seem dependent on pepper. All of the flavors of the dishes (strip steak, peas, spinach, onion rings) were completely lost due to the amount if ground pepper. Another small thing, but they seem unable to produce a glass of Diet Coke that isn't flat or taste like an odd mix between regular and diet. The staff has been great - other than the guy who breezed by and asked how we were enjoying things but didn't care about our response as he kept going and responded as if we gave a glowing \"yes\" in reply. 

I will be sticking to the Uptown location and trying out the Ballantyne location. This is my last visit to this location."}
{"text":"A Very Unique CLT institution, but pricey!

Went last night on corporate event. Best Calamari ever! Fried Corn, Brussel Sprouts were pretty good. Assorted Mushrooms ($10) were AMAZING.

I ordered NY Strip \"medium\", and was served overcooked steak... twice. Manager came out to apologize. Interesting that they couldn't get that right. Despite me ordering $29 entree, they comped 2 desserts.

Coconut Cake and Bread Pudding were top hits.

Check Out the Bar Bites Menu (after 4pm). Very good selection, $5-7/dish"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch here!  The place was fairly empty. I had a little pizza and it was about 6\" in diameter; just right for me but not my husband. I loved the French onion soup. Service was very good!  I asked for some chopped fresh basil and she came back empty. Weird for a place that makes pizzas!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday for brunch over a holiday weekend.   They, like most of Charlotte, we're very quiet with many traveling.  This worked to our advantage with stellar service and impeccably prepared food.  Lori's french onion soup was excellent with a deep, umami flavor.  My order of chicken livers over polenta was, quite frankly, one of the best riffs I've had on this overlooked,  rustic culinary treat.  I kicked it up a notch with a 3 minute poached egg which ran all over the plate.  Mmmm.  Perfect.  I paired it with a glass of prosecco to give it a little elegance.  

Other than smelling like a campfire when I arrived home (which I liked), I was happy we visited.  A return is in their future."}
{"text":"***edit.... I did give it three stars. That was until an employee or chef from roosters in Charlotte made a yelp profile \"steak r\" to email me and call me an idiot for pointing out how shitty the salad was. What a douche. LOL. ****

***they contacted me a second time to call me names for editing my review to reflect their harassment***

This place was just ok. I went there for a business lunch (I live in NYC)... got a cobb salad and the whole thing was deconstructed... like lettuce in one part, cheese, bacon, all like 3 inches away from each other on the plate. This place isn't new american.... they have no business turning a standard lunch salad into what they think is going to be avant-garde masterpiece. Our waitress was very nice, the service was fast and welcoming. But the food is average."}
{"text":"I've worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years, four of which have been spent here at Roosters... hands down, one of the BEST restaurants out there. The food is simply amazing. I always tell my guests to start with the charcuterie board. The selection is great and it's always served with mixed olives, crostinis and a housemade black grain mustard (goes the best with the duck ham). For dinner, you have to order the seared sea scallops or the boneless beef short rib. If you want something a little less formal, the smoked wings are delicious. They are seasoned with a dry rub and smoked. They are then prepared in the open flame brick oven for a nice crispy skin- so good! For sides, don't miss out on the succotash (fresh corn sliced from the cob and sautéed with butter and salt/pepper mixed with butter beans that have been reducing in a chicken stock). If you want to indulge in some comfort food, go for the Mac n cheese or the augratin potatoes. A perfect ending to any meal is the coconut cake. I'm not even a fan of coconut and yet I LOVE this cake. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Simple and tummy happy garden to table comfort food.  Rotisserie chicken was good, fried oyster was great and coconut cake and MAC and cheese was awesome!
Wonderful meal over all.  Great service too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Rooster's is one of the more consistent and enjoyable venues in Charlotte. They succeed in food, aesthetics, alcohol-related needs, and service.

Tall ceilings. Open atmosphere. A diverse menu crafted with care. Full bar with house cocktails that honor trends and blaze trails at the same time. 

The bar is long. Bar tables are long, high tops of stately wood often shared with other patrons.

In the dining section, many booths and wall tables providing a booth-like privacy add to the charm and splendor of Rooster's.

Rooster's menu varies often because they focus on what is fresh and available, and what is in season. I've not loved every dish I have tried, but that's a matter of personal taste rather than quality or preparation."}
{"text":"Dined here with friends for Sunday brunch. Large open space with roomy booths, which makes for a very comfortable and intimate dining experience.

I had the shrimp and grits. Delicious! There's a bit of a spicy kick due to the chorizo...fun for the taste buds! My husband got a traditional breakfast. Good, but nothing extra special. Like others have mentioned, the portions are not large; however, it was plenty to get me full (not stuffed).

The service was good and everyone seemed very friendly. The decor is a conversation starter with a wall of stuffed roosters. 

It is pricey, so going is a luxury when you can."}
{"text":"My husband always talks about this place but for some reason we never went together until this past Sunday. I had to get something at the mall and we didn't feel like eating at the food court. So my husband mentioned it and we decided to check this one out. Since the one he always goes is in another location. 
We got there around 4pm, they were not busy and we were sat right away. 
We decided to sit outside because the weather was nice and the afternoon was pretty charming.
We decided to split half of chicken with a side of mac and cheese. 
The food got ready pretty fast.
I am not a big fan os Mac and cheese, maybe it is because wherever you go the Mac and cheese will always be different, however always blend. But this time for my surprise and happiness the Mac and cheese was wonderful! So cheesy and creamy.... Tasted like  real Parmesan cheese! The chicken came in a sauce that looked like butter and was really great!
I keep dreaming about that mac n cheese, it is 10$ for a small side but it makes every penny worth it!
Our waiter was really friendly and attentive.
With that being said we will definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I always come by when I'm in town, more for the atmosphere than the food. I'm not a big Southern foods fan, but definitely try the vegetable plate. Mac and cheese, roasted beets, corn, onion rings are fantastic.  The BLT isn't on the lunch menu, but with heirloom tomatoes, fantastic bread, and thick-cut bacon, this is hard to pass up. I also adore the chicken, arugula and apple salad at lunch. The service is amazing and the wine list is fantastic. Let your waiter talk you into a Spanish wine on the list or take part in the $2.50 glass during the week-such a great deal!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here today! The grilled chicken sandwich was very good, love the onion jam on it. The pan fried corn is delicious, perfectly sweet and salty. The Mac and cheese was excellent. The cheese flavor is smoky and strong, love it! We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place! So cool and modern, different from normal. The food is all good. Went with a friend and my family. The food is decently priced-- like a nice restaurant but not overkill snotty pricing. The wine we had was decent. Weird that it's in a strip mall, we had trouble finding it at first, but I would definitely go back here and take other friends."}
{"text":"Food was way too salty, never had such a salty steak in my life. Service was not great . Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Man-o-man!  I really do like this place.  We went with another couple for dinner, later took 97 year old dad there for lunch and two more times for dinner and lunch.  Very consistent and very good.

Sad to report that I have yet to try their namesake wood-fired chicken.  Too many other interesting and nice menu options that push chicken lower on the list.  I will eventually get there.

I can't remember the name of the dish...sorry, but it was a mix of mushrooms and chicken (ooops!) in a baking dish like a stew.  Rich, creamy and delicious.  And there is magic in the mixed mushrooms served as a side or appetizer.

The short rib is so yummy that you eat slowly to extend the ecstasy.  On the mashed potatoes!  Aaaaaaahhh!! 

Salads, from side to main course are generous and their dressings are made in-house so are wonderful.  Onion soup is as it should be:  rich, cheezy and hot.  

Service is great.  Wait staff have personalities, not over-done, and relate to the people at the table.  And they are more than willing to arrange substitutions (within reason, please) and accommodate likes and minimize dislikes.  And when there is an issue, they simply replace the item and don't charge you.  Nice.

They do a good job here, so give lunch a try, and come outside of prime time when it is not so crowded."}
{"text":"We order off the local menu everything is delicious. 

Short ribs are excellent 
Corn
Green beans
Bummed they were out of the fried okra!

This gal from LA would come again!"}
{"text":"Ken is awesome. Sweet man and very polite server. If you happen to go here for a late lunch or just wasting some time, go here and ask for Ken. I came in on a lazy Sunday just planning to waste some time and enjoy a nice atmosphere. I sat at the bar by myself. First thing I didn't like was that they didn't have sangrias. The manager told me that they didn't even have merlot. After looking at the drink menu, they did have merlot by the glass. Officially don't like him. Ken came over and served me. I ordered a small Ceaser salad and some smoked wings. Salad was different but gourmet. The wings were great!  Come in after 4pm for $6 wings. The menu is fairly small but the food taste is Worth the lack of selection. I might not come back for a dinner date but if I want to waste some time at the bar, I'll ask for Ken."}
{"text":"This is 3rd time I ordered something to go from here for lunch but the first time I really decided to say something because usually I just get a side item to go. 1 piece of chicken and a small side order of succotash should NOT cost $19.50 including tax, Quality of food is good but chicken honestly no better than roasted one from grocery store except it does have an interesting smoke flavor to it. The lunch menu was no cheaper than the dinner menu & just had a few less choices. The 1/4 chicken was $11 & 1/2 chicken was $14- that is without even 1 side!! I thought for that price that the servings would at least be more than plentiful but that was not the case. Yes, it was plenty for one person but the price is just outrageous, truly. My suggestion would be to have combination plates nor significantly increase serving sizes to at least give the impression of value. Also not impressed with having to wait at bar in order to get to go menu.There is curb side pick up but I preferred to go in & get it & not pay a tip for simply getting take out."}
{"text":"Came with for a quick lunch one day! Had the lunch special ... Nc bbq chicken sandwich... With sweet potato fries!! It was delicious ... I left nothing on the plate. Affordable lunch menu prices! Definitely will come back for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining at Rooster's for dinner with colleagues. I've always been a fan of mushrooms, but I never knew they could be as delicious as they were in the wild mushroom appetizer. The duck breast entree was also exceptional."}
{"text":"I have no idea how many times I have eaten here. I think that there is an imprint of my bum on my booth 2 away from the kitchen door. I always start with the arugula salad, then either the veggie plate or the spit fire turkey sandwich (best sami in town), butter beans, and the coconut cake. OMG the coconut cake has a creamy vanilla englaise they drench over it. It is so good. About the butter beans. This is a big thing for me. If you've never had them you need to try them. They are amazing and so good for you. This is something Rooster's does so well. If you have a vegetarian in the family you need to come here. Roasted beets, carrots, corn, whatever is in season. Then there are the meatetarians. They will be happy too because Roosters butchers their meat in house weekly. Basically, if I have a group of people with different tastes I need to please I come to Roosters. Everyone will be well fed at a reasonable price, and leave very happy."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant! We ordered the hanger steak and it was so good! Would definitely order it again! Also ordered the pepperoni pizza. Very thin crust and super light. Really good pizza. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Well this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE go to spot for a nice dinner with the hubster! The staff is great and the Food.....Um...the Food....my lord the Food...is incredible! I mean I could accidentally chew my own tongue when I devour, yes devour Lol, their Food! It's out of this world DELICIOUS! It's like an eye popping, jaw dropping, party in your mouth experience when you taste their food! Seasoned and cooked to perfection! My faves are their BBQ Chicken, Au Gratin Potatoes, Mac and Cheese, Fried Corn and Caesar Salad. I get this EVERY TIME I'm there! If it ain't broke, why fix it? Lol. Thanks Roosters for making my tastebuds dream of your food!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here.  I was surprised at the food and service.  I will co0me back again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant just a few days ago to celebrate my birthday. I was in town from Winston Salem visiting friends and there were so many restaurant options to choose from. I decided upon Roosters after reading many positive Yelp reviews and they did not steer me wrong! The first thing you notice about Roosters upon walking in is the smell. OMG the food aroma was so enticing. I knew right away this was going to be a good experience. The restaurant was beautifully decorated and the music was awesome....a mix of older soul music. They had this really cool wall of Roosters to your left and the cooking area was right in the middle of the restaurant so you could see what was going on. We started with drinks. First, I ordered the pineapple crush (I think that's the name). I didn't like the drink but I heard it was pretty popular. The waiter immediately whisked it away and returned with my replacement, which was called Bourbon something or other... Sorry I forgot to write it down. But it was absolutely delicious. We started with an order of calamari for an appetizer and the free bread that came when we sat. It was super good and big enough for the three of us to share. Everything here is ala carte and the sides are big enough for two people to share. I ordered the scallops, my friend ordered the hangar steak and my son ordered the burger and fries. All three were extremely good! We also ordered three sides to share... The wilted spinach, mac and cheese and grilled corn. They were so good that I couldn't even pick a favorite!!! Finally, they offered me a complementary dessert since it was my birthday and I went with the coconut cake. It was almost like a coconut tres leche tower of yummy goodness. Moist and Rich and enough for the three of us to share. They even put a little candle on the top. The service here was top notch. Everything came out quickly and cooked to order. The waiter was on point and never let our drinks empty. Several others (possibly managers) even came around to ask if we were enjoying our meal and needed anything. If I lived in Charlotte, I would visit this place as much as possible. It's an upscale vibe but not one that you have to wear a shirt and tie to dine. I highly highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"When I read the review that this Independent and non-franchised chef-owned place was in Charlotte - I went out of my way to eat here.  WOW!  WHAT A MEAL !

Let me say that again.. W O W !   Prices were fair, food superior quality and the hostess was delightful.  Delicious.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but now I've tried SP and Uptown and I just can't stand behind them. Since it's small plates (for not a small price) menu/a la carte model, I've tried quite a bit of things here ranging from daily specials to trusted/all the time items. I can't say I've really ever loved one thing very much. First red flag when going to a nice restaurant is when you can see a block of butter sitting on top of your sea food. It doesn't take a genius to realize butter makes everything taste good, so if you just drown your food in butter your guests are sure to love it. I realize that's common for veggies and for lower end restaurants, but I really expect more at an establishment that is bordering a nice dining experience. Their ambiance and decor is spot on, as it gives the illusion you're at a really fancy place, but the food is just not great. What happened to being inventive with flavor parings? Savory and sweet and getting creative? Literally 3/5 dishes I got were simply drowned in butter. The cauliflower special was decent, but it was literally charred cauliflower with loads of a Parmesan type cheese shredded over it. Second oldest trick in the book, douse your food in cheese and it magically tastes great. I could have gone to a Mexican restaurant if I was looking to get that. The best dish was the bok choy special, as it had sausage and another suspicious oil base it was submerged in, but I did actually like the sausage flavor (even it I doubt it even had 5 leaves of bok choy). I think if the price were much lower you'd understand what you were getting into, but overall I felt fat and stuffed after leaving, and didn't particularly love anything. The duck I had before was way too gamey, and they had no flavorful sauce to challenge the taste. Same with hangar steak this time, the sauce was literally worse that just eating the meat plain. Not sure if they do any marinating or dry rubs (highly doubt it since it literally tasted plain) but that would be a good thing for them to get into. I gave them 3 because they support farmers and have nice ambiance, but the food deserves a 2. The waitress had literally no personality and we might as well have had a robot wait on us. If that was the case, I'll bet the robot would have been more responsive and attentive. It took 2 of us (who actually were trying to hurry) over an hour for us to leave (clock starting after we were seated). It was very late on a Thursday and hardly anyone else there. I think waiting 15 minutes after bringing water to return may have been the first set back, but also only bringing beans for the first 20 minutes after ordering is what probably did us in. I any case, definitely recommend Bricktops which is right around the corner, and I've yet to have a bad meal in the 6x I've gone, and they are very similar in pricing. I think they pride themselves on cocktails and had a lot of wines, spend $90 this time without even trying any. Ouch."}
{"text":"This is a great Charlotte restaurant.  I have been a fan for a long time, but hadn't been there in about a year until yesterday when I stopped by for lunch.  Yep, still delicious!  

They always have a bunch of yummy in season vegetables on the menu.  The menu does not provide any descriptions, so you can be adventurous.   Or, don't be afraid to ask your server to explain a bunch of things to you.  I sure did when I couldn't decide between 5 items!

The dressing on my wedge salad was really salty, but I'm guessing that's not normal.  I was so hungry I didn't say a word and ate it anyways.  The mushroom pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've eaten here. When I did- boy was it good! This place is A la carte and a bit pricey (yet another \"you get what you pay for\" type of place). I ordered steak and onion rings - my buddy ordered duck with spinach. Everything came out so well prepared. You can tell they really put effort into presentation and quality. The steak had all the fat cut away - the meat was perfect and delicious, my buddy's spinach looked so good in the butter sauce - so bright green - at the time I didn't eat spinach but, it looked delicious! If you want to impress your date - this is a good place for that. It costs quite a bit but, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I have 3 allergies which are typically not listed as ingredients on the menu. My waitress Elise was wonderful and informed, and helped me find items I could eat and would enjoy. I often experience a lot of difficulty with my allergies when dining out so this was a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Uptown Location

This was another new restaurant in my Uptown Shuffle effort of trying to break old habits and eating at a wider variety of places while stuck Uptown.

The menu had many choices and I selected three offerings, the seared scallops, the assorted mushrooms, and the pan fried corn. Each and every dish was rich and flavorful and far exceeded my expectations.

The wait staff was attentive, my water glass was always full and I was consistently checked on to see if the meal was to my liking.

I left the restaurant full and satisfied with plans to return again. Next time I may try the bar which had several interesting chalkboard specials such as quail sausage,  venison bangers and mashed, and duck wings. Very Intriguing."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past year. The first time was ok. This time the service was poor and the food a little less on point.  My advice is to drive a couple more blocks to Bricktop and get better food and service. 

This time was during lunch with the place about 1/4 full (not very busy).  Table of four people. We were perfunctorily seated.  We waited 5 minutes for a server to come and fill the water glasses. He did say our waiter would arrive shortly. We waited another five minutes for him to show up.  Then he asked if we wanted anything else to drink. One member of the party asked to see the beer menu (more waiting).  Brought the beer menu and left. (More waiting)  Showed up later and took the drinks order. (Waited some more but not too long). Drinks arrived.  Waited some more and he brought the menus.  Waited some more and he took the appetizer order. Appetizers came out in a reasonable timeframe. Took our entree order but when one person wanted something he was told they were out of that and two other entree items (could of mentioned that when he gave the menus).  Food came out in a reasonable timeframe but the waiter did not clear the appetizer plates or the empty beer bottles on the table. (Which had been available for several minutes).  Just placed the entrees and left.  A few minutes later he came and cleared the appetizer plates but left the empty beer bottles!   Some food  was ok but one member of the party said his meal was really bad and left most of his food on the plate (he is a college student and tolerant of college fare so this says something). Entrée plates were cleared fairly promptly but the empty beer bottles remained on the table.  Water glasses were filled at good intervals. Check arrived at a reasonable timeframe. 

I seldom write poor reviews but this experience warranted it.  Due to the food quality, poor service and portion size for price. I recommend you not go here"}
{"text":"Saturday night at 815 pm, party of 5. For those who have yet to try Roosters, their approach is a wide variety of small plates designed for sharing.  Everything is always prepared perfectly. This is a well run restaurant; caution you need a reservation unless you want to sit at a high top table in the bar area. This night we had several salads, Calamari (not as good as Wolfgang's). The flounder special was delicious, one of the best fish dishes we've had. Other entrees included the parpadelle with beef ragout, natural juice chicken, hanger steak and mac and cheese. Everyone loved their selections. Dessert was the currant bread pudding with vanilla gelato and a coconut cake. Everything was spot on. A $34 zin worked well with our choices."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for the first time last week when I had family in town and must say this is a great option for groups as they have great quality food and lots of space.  Really enjoyed the elegant and welcoming atmosphere on the inside which boasted high vaulted ceilings, classic upscale decor, and huge comfortable booths if you're looking to a great setting to have dinner with a group of friends or family.  The interior really compliments and sets the table for the limited yet adequate dinner menu and family style sides.  Personally, I really liked the menu as it did not give me anxiety trying to decide on what to get.  They specialize in rotisserie chicken and a few other unique dishes, but everything we ordered was great.  By all accounts, the chicken was incredible and I ordered the duck for my entre and it was very, very good (although not the best I've ever had, I would still recommend to anyone who enjoys duck).  The sides are a la carte and done family style, so we shared the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese between 4 people.  The sides were superb and made to order.  They also had a great wine and drink menu which we shared a bottle or Cote du rhone ($36 not bad).  All and all it will not be the cheapest ($$ on Yelp should prob be $$+), you definitely get what you pay for here.  Will return!

{"text":"First off, I will say that the food here was VERY good! I went here with five other people last night and we were all really pleased with the appetizers and main dishes. We seriously got a ton of food: cheese, fried oysters, salads, two half chickens, gnocchi, steak burger, dessert, almost everything on the menu. Also can't forget about the wine, the list seems long, but there really isn't a ton a great wines on there. I wouldn't consider myself a wine snob (who would?), but I don't think I would come back for the wine (if you're into that). Food and wine aside, the service was also great. Our waiter was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Really the only thing I was disappointed with was where they sat us. We had a party of six, so they sat us in an atrium they share with their neighbors. It was quite. Too quiet. Eerily quite. They had no music playing so our conversation echoed quite a bit. I don't think this would be a problem if we were inside, but it did take away from our experience, slightly. 

All in all: I would totally go back just for the food. It was very tasty! :)"}
{"text":"Roosters has so many great dishes to choose from.  Start with the appetizer of the charcuterie plate with the chicken liver mousse.    The only con would be that they never give enough bread for the meats and cheeses.  Ordered the beef short rib for dinner with sides of corn and mac and cheese.  If you only want one side, definitely order the corn."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday, and I was really impressed with the atmosphere.  The dining room was open, but wasn't as loud as some hardwood-high ceiling places can get.  There was a huge bar area, so I could definitely see myself coming back with a friend to split a few small plates and have a glass of wine at the bar late one weeknight.

I love small plates--I really enjoy being able to pick both a meat and a vegetable.  And, by pairing small dishes, my meal came out to be quite reasonable--I had the macaroni and green beans, and it ended up being under $15 before tax, tip, alcohol.  The green beans were wonderful - tender and perfectly cooked.  And it was a huge portion!  I definitely had leftovers, and two people could have easily split them (I guess that's why they're \"sides\").  The macaroni and cheese was really good too!  I love a well-made macaroni so I continually order it at restaurants, and end up disappointed most of the time because it lacks flavor.  I wasn't disappointed here!  The macaroni was rich, but not just creamy.

Everyone else I was with really enjoyed their food--most of us got a salad or vegetable and another of the small plates, and we found it the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Jim Noble's, dating back to the original Noble's restaurant.  Also, this is my fourth time eating at Roosters, but my fist time eating lunch, and my first time back in several years.  Each time that I've eaten dinner at Roosters I've greatly enjoyed my food and experience....until now.  A group from work decided to grab lunch at the South Park location today.  While the menu options looked great, the food itself was not.  We started off with a few appetizers: calamari and fried livers.   The calamari also tasted undercooked as it was soggy and not very crispy.  The bigger issue was the livers, which were okay until I realized what I had just eaten was still uncooked with blood dripping from the center of the liver.  I let the server know and they removed this item from the bill.  I'm not sure what type of response I expected, I just thought that the reaction and response, or lack there of, wasn't adequate knowing that a customer had just ingested undercooked chicken.

For my meal, I asked the server for his recommendation.  He told us, \"without a doubt\" the prime rib sandwich is the way to go.  So, several of us ordered the prime rib sandwich, which was one of the specials.  To make a long story short, it was not good.  It wasn't terrible, just not what I would expect from a Jim Noble restaurant, or from a sandwich that cost over $15.  Also, the side Caesar salad was very mediocre.

All in all, I was very disappointed with Roosters.  Hopefully, I won't also end up with food poisoning to accompany the disappointment."}
{"text":"Have to agree with other reviewers.  I know some upscale restaurants have very small portions, but the food quality at roosters does not make up for the appetizer sized meals.  The server told us the sides were enough for 2-3 people to share and we did not find that to be true either.
Duck, shrimp,pizza and a pasta dish were  all ordered at our table.  All were reported to be ok or good, but nothing was earth shaking. 
Atmosphere was nice and service was great...but food not good enough to justify the prices."}
{"text":"Placed an order to-go at the bar and the service was great and quick. BBQ chicken was to die for and loved the spice rub on the wings. The sides we got were the corn and au gratin potatoes and they were amazing!! Definitely wouldn't plan to share the sides amongst more than 2-3 people though, portion sizes weren't that large."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents last evening to celebrate my mom's birthday. Since I was with my parents, dinner was on the early side at 4:00. We were greeted and immediately seated at a booth near the entrance. I was charmed by the rustic, industrial feel of the restaurant that included little doses of whimsy thanks to the frequent placing of roosters.

Our waiter came over to go over the menu. Roosters serves its sides a la carte, similar to a tapas style restaurant. They recommend getting an appetizer, a protein and sharing the sides.

My mom ordered the quarter natural chicken with fingerling potatoes, I ordered the smoked wings with pan fried corn, and my dad ordered the shrimp with fingerling potatoes. Unfortunately, this type of restaurant was out of the norm for my parents. When it comes to cuisine they are not adventurous at all. My mom liked her meal, she just wished that it came with more aus jus for her chicken. As for the shrimp my dad ordered, he received a plate of SIX, small shrimp that cost $17. SIX SHRIMP FOR SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. These weren't jumbo shrimp or anything like that. Just six, small grilled shrimp in a light sauce. All we could do was laugh because it looked ridiculous. I'm surprised the waiter was able to serve that with a straight face. A grown man served six shrimp. Just let that picture settle in for you. Thankfully, my order of smoked wings was a very hefty portion and I was able to share some with him. But seriously Rooster? take the shrimp off the menu. You're not doing anyone any favors with that option.

Honestly, if you come as duo, ordering the smoked wings is good bet because it's a bowl of at least 8-9 good-sized wings. The corn had a nice bite and flavor. The fingerling potatoes were OK, I would've preferred the yukon puree (aka mashed potatoes) but they weren't serving them at the time for some reason. As for the complimentary bread, it tasted stale and we were finally served it after sitting for a while.  The waiter seemed distracted even though it wasn't that busy.

Suffice it to say, my dad now has a good dining story to tell. Trust me, he's been telling EVERYONE he knows about how he was served a plate of six shrimp (for $17). Can't say that I'll personally be back as I wasn't blown away by the food and I don't like visiting a restaurant that's only serving certain things at certain times."}
{"text":"For lunch, tab for 3 without wine was $75. Quality of pizza has fallen ... oily, too much cheese, not enough mushrooms. Tomato bisque is as good as ever. Mac & cheese dry and salty -- avoid. Pan seared grouper was one dimensional, salt only with a tough and somewhat crispy skin. Bread basket contained cold sliced bread. Ordered salmon salad, waiter returned saying they were out but he could add a piece of warm salmon for $4. Huh? Jim Noble, come in and fix your restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to Roosters for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It's very clean inside, and it smells deliciously of food cooking in the wood burning stove. My husband had the meatloaf with sweet potato purée and spinach. I had a chicken and cheese pizzetta, which is a fancy word for pizza. We enjoyed our food. My pizza was ordinary but good. Nothing extraordinary. My husband's meatloaf was very good, but the portion size is small for the money. Overall we enjoyed the experience there mostly for the nice environment and attentive waitstaff. We would return."}
{"text":"Some of my co-workers really like Roosters, so I've eaten there a few times. However, I'm always kind of disappointed.  As many people have mentioned, the serving sizes are minuscule.  Now, I am not saying that every restaurant needs to serve Applebee's-size trenchers of filler, but here you have to spend a lot of money to leave sans hunger.  In addition to this, the food is relatively so-and-so.  The last time I went for lunch, I ordered a roast turkey sandwich.  It was ok, except for the fact that the bacon was burned.  You'll find a lot of little careless errors like that.

Additionally, the dining room is so cavernous that you cannot hear your dining companions, and, perhaps even more frustratingly, the servers cannot hear you.  They really need to put up some acoustic paneling or something.  

Rooster's... meh.  There's potential, but it's just that--still potential."}
{"text":"Very amazing food but a little pricey. Everything is  A la Cart so the tab added up quick for a steak and chicken with 3 sides to share with an app. We spent $100.00 that's including tip. 
I like Kings kitchen over Roosters (Same owner) little less expensive, still amazing food and doesn't feel as fancy which I like. 
Still a great place and I would go again! :)

Oh and the rotisserie chicken with BBQ is amazing."}
{"text":"This place has really perfected southern meets European cuisine.   The staff is awesome,  and the food is well done.   Great short ribs and salmon.   The sides are next level. Pureed sweet potatoes are buttery smooth.   I loved the hoppin, John and beets.   A must visit dining experience."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here based on other Yelp reviews.

They were not wrong! This a a great place.

And, as others have noted, very slightly overpriced (all dishes are a la carte, sides are $5-$7).

Also, note to Northerners: I ordered BBQ chicken. I should have expected it but was slightly surprised by the Carolina style, vinegar based BBQ sauce. Once again, it was VERY good, but just don't think that it's like the typical St. Louis/Texas tomato based sauces.

Also, server was very attentive and the atmosphere is very cool. They have an extensive seating area/bar around the open kitchen ... which I should have sat at as it's WAY more entertaining!"}
{"text":"It was fun trying a lot of different things, but of course at a cost since it's à la carte. It was good; not great. My favorite part was my arugula, almond & goat cheese salad. My husband liked his goat cheese platter. My wings were way too salty and dry. I liked my polenta and the corn was good, too."}
{"text":"First time visit; will return!

I had never been to Rooster's before but was thoroughly impressed. I took advantage of making a reservation online and called the same afternoon to confirm. When we arrived, the door was opened for us, and the hostess had casual conversation with us and made us priority even though it was fairly busy. 

As soon as we were seated, our waitress Leah greeted us and welcomed us to the establishment. She quickly took our drink order and returned to go over the menu with us. She gave excellent dish recommendations and told us how their food is gathered from local vendors and how it is prepared. 

The food was amazing. Large, flavorful portions consumed the plates; not once did I think I didn't get enough food. We didn't opt for dessert but they had many options along with coffee drinks too.

The only complaint I have is that it was rather loud. For being an upscale restaurant, with prices being what they are, it was a bit annoying having to almost yell across a small table to communicate with the person I was with. 

With the experience I had at Rooster's, I will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"My favorite place to enjoy dinner and drinks when I'm in Charlotte. The salmon is perfect and the chocolate mousse cake is the perfect ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"So this was another one of those places.  The kind of place which was talked up like crazy.  We went here one Friday for lunch this past summer, and I can honestly say I was disappointed.  I was told how good their burgers are and how 'kewl' the place was, etc... blah blah the usual...

We arrived around 11:20am --I know that's early, but I start to eat my desk if I get past 11:45am.  We were seated instantly and our drink order was taken relatively quickly.  About 15 minutes later, at about 11:40am, our drinks were brought to the table.  As you can imagine, I'm starting to think about chomping on the table at this point!  Soon as our waitress passed out the drinks --that she clearly ran out to bottle herself at the local Coca Cola bottling facility, she took our order.  Then we waited...  And waited.  And waited.

Finally, the order was brought to the table at around 12:35pm.  I received a side salad, which was simply just a side salad and nothing more --I 'think' it may have had a tomato on it --bonus, and this smallish burger sitting in the middle of a plate the size of a small platter --interesting, I thought.  I figured based on this plain, weak presentation, this thing was going to taste like fillet on a bun!  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It tasted nothing more than 90/10 ground beef cooked on my grill at home one night after work, without seasoning--very disappointing.

To add to the fun, they actually screwed up my coworkers lunch, resulting in him having to wait another 10-15 minutes for the reorder.  Aside from the fun activities of the time it took to get the order, the restaurant itself was literally 55°; it was freezing in there.  Perhaps that was because I had no food inside me to keep me warm?

For the food you got and its taste, I felt was overpriced --maybe they just have to charge a lot to keep the AC units running with such ferocity..."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my wife after reading the reviews. We came in one night and waited to be seated. Placed seemed a little busy. After about five minutes we were sat and waited for someone to take our order. We waited about 10 minutes and watched as staff came and went. Not one person said hello or we'll be with you shortly. That from a customer service perspective is unacceptable. We got up and left. Unable to review the food since no one helped us. I'll leave you to decide the service rating."}
{"text":"Just got back from a fabulous dinner at Roosters. My friend and I were seated quickly and begun to peruse their wine by the glass menu. Minus 1/2 star; I had higher expectations for the wines by the glass. Its like they tried to hard to be diverse and missed a little. Other then that the items on the menu were great. 

We ordered the Onion Soup, the arugula salad, the brussel spouts, hanger steak, and the pumpkin gnocchi. My favorite was the gnocchi. It was perfectly cooked light and delicate. Those 5 items plus two $9 glasses of wine ended up being a bit over $40 each including tip. Definitely worth it. Food was done in what I like to call \" gormetey\" as in; every dish tasted unique and different. The only thing that I didn't look, ie: the other minus 1/2 a star is because the onion soup was a bit salty. It was amazing just a bit more salt then I would prefer. 

I would definitely recommend this place and its the type of place I would take my boyfriend or out of town visitors. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Rooster's food is average. I've been a couple of times and both experiences were unremarkable. I don't generally bother writing restaurant reviews, but upon recently learning that Jim Noble--the owner of Rooster's--actively supports the far-right, discriminatory group Alliance Defending Freedom, I felt I couldn't remain silent. Guess what? You have the freedom to spend your money at any variety of restaurants in Charlotte that have better food and are owned by decent humans who operate their businesses ethically. If you care about not supporting a bigot, then there are plenty of other wonderful restaurants to patronize. I'll never set foot in another Jim Noble establishment* again.  

* King's Kitchen, Rooster's, and the soon to open Noble Smoke"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit, but its been a few years since the first..(1st visit was perfect 5*.......Great atmosphere, great service, awesome food, fair prices,, be sure to check out the brunch menu!....."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice for dinner and both times we were very pleased with our meals as well as the service.  Roosters can either be a $40 dinner or a $100 all-out eating fest.  We have tried both approaches.  

The first night we ate there for Valentine's Day - we shared a 1/2 carafe of wine, we each had a salad, and I ordered the hangar steak (delicious!) and my husband ate seafood off the specials menu.  Both of us were incredibly happy with our meals.  We shared some beets as a side dish - very tasty!  That evening a special dessert was also offered - an apple tart that required about a 20 minute preparation so I ordered that when my dinner arrived.  The tart was incredible.  My husband ordered the coconut cake and, unfortunately, it was still partially frozen when it arrived at the table.  

Tonight we ate at the bar.  Very cordial server, bartender, hostess, busgirl ... everyone was very friendly.  We did not have a reservation so we opted to sit at one of the community tables near the bar.  My husband and I shared a plate of zucchini fries with a lemon aioli.  The zucchini fries were pretty good but the lemon aioli was amazing!  My husband ordered the hangar steak tonight and I ordered the smoked wings.  We shared a plate of brussels sprouts as our side.  I am an enormous wing fan and these were fabulous.  They were hot in a peppery hot sort of way.  The plate of wings was huge but I somehow managed to finish them with only a little help from my husband.  I cannot wait to order these again!  No dessert for us tonight and no drinks so our bill was just over $40.  Delicious."}

that have no back allows for more chairs but it is very uncomfortable

with a jacket on
Ken the bartender was excellent today he needed running shoes made lot trips from behind the bar
Food and service was very good 
Will go back
All servers and bartender seem to have a very good working relationship"}
{"text":"High end Southern cuisine. The interior has a feeling of modern barn chic. The wait staff all wore thick aprons, attentive and knowledgeable about their food. I was with two other coworkers, so we were able to sample a variety of dishes. Many are large enough to share, but its almost tapas in style so each person could order 2. The duck wings were double fried, served in a thick, rich, and a (little too) sweet sauce, tossed with sesame seeds. Definitely had an Asian flavor. The cauliflower was charred and nutty, the yellow/green olive oil adding a great vegetative flavor. Mussels were served in a delicious broth, I used the crusty bread and a spoon to sop up every bite. The succotash was buttery with sweet corn and beans. Cocktails have some amazing combinations of interesting liquors that I even had to ask what they were."}
{"text":"Review just for the bar!

Went here last night for after dinner drinks and I will definitely have to come back for dinner. 

Everyone was very friendly here, the atmosphere was comfortable and intimate, and decor is Euro Country with a wall of stuffed roosters (which may have freaked me out if I had noticed it before leaving).

Our bartender was a funny, funny man who makes a killer gimlet. They have a wide selection of wine and alcohol. And a great seating area in front of the bar. 

Watching the chefs in the open kitchen made me drool a little bit. I'm eating there soon. Who wants to join??"}
{"text":"So upon the request from people who insisted I try this place.. I have, finally!

Venue - I saw the establishment first from inside the plaza like indoors - and thought it looked a bit.. old.  But yesterday, I had came in from the front and was relieved and surprised to see such a nice set up.  Okay, the roosters on the left side of the wall is a bit much.  I will not let that deter me from what else is to come. 

Service - Good.  I had a waitress who took care of my friends and I. 

Food - As others have mentioned, not ground breaking.  I was anxious about what I should order. The obvious being, chicken!  But I just did not feel for chicken last night. So I had help from Yelp's tips and reviews and I have ordered:

- Mac n' Cheese: Good, hot and piping good.  Cheesy and delicious.

What I ordered on my own
- Fried Oyster: It was okay.  I asked for an honest opinion that it is to die for, but.. it was mediocre.
- Lobster Bisque: It was good. Not bad

Price - It was a little pricey, hence I avoided the Scallop entrée (which I normally ALWAYS get). I just cannot bring myself to pay $19 + sides.. just.. not worth it to me. And the Yelpers helped steered me away from it. 

I left feeling content.  Would I come back, meh.  If my friends wanted me to come meet them up, I would."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. Duck confit was highly recommended but wasn't very well browned outside of a single spot where it touched a pan. I've usually had it browned/crispy everywhere. BBQ chicken was very fatty. 

The succotash was great.

Probably won't come here again but I might go try the burger. Too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I had the anger stage which was cooked to perfection. I also had the roasted fingerling potatoes and the gratin potatoes, butter beans, pizza, onion rings, the friends that came to help celebrate my birthday their dishes were out of this world delicious! Our waiter named Joseph was very attentive and offered great feedback on what drinks to try and make sure that we had everything we needed. 
I plan to go again and again! My new fav local spot!! 
#woot#woot"}
{"text":"Awful waitress was not attentive left us sitting 15minutes however very attentive 2 the table across from mine and their 2 oversize dogs. It was clear that we were racially profiled.  It seems the south has yet 2 accept they lost 2 the Yankees. They received 1 star only because I would not have been able 1 post w/o it"}
{"text":"My husband and I were greeted by the hostess very nicely and shown right to our table. Our first time to dine here & will be on our list of favorites for sure! 
    Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, and offered ideas re: sides etc.
   Our only complaint was our waitress was very rushed and would often sprint away before we could ask a question or  make a request. She almost seemed out of breath. She also spoke very fast & we needed to have her repeat herself.  Very noisy atmosphere, yet we really enjoyed the fun decor.
    The menu was exceptional, Many interesting choices!  The specials sounded delicious. Great wine selection.  Our salads and entrees were wonderful, perfectly seasoned and prepared. As foodies, we are happy to say, Rooster's does not disappoint! We WILL return!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Uptown location and loved it, so I decided to visit this location as well. The quality at this location was great as well. I went with the BBQ Chicken and mac and cheese. The BBQ Chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce had great flavor. The mac and cheese is also very cheesy and delicious as well. Our server was great and made great recommendations for our party. Typically chicken is fairly safe and similar at most restaurants, but I'd definitely put Rooster's a step above."}
{"text":"I have been to Roosters countless times. It is one of my favorite restaurants. I typically start with the onion soup or lettuce wedge with blue cheese. Try the open faced meatloaf with shiitake cream. The wine prices are more than reasonable. The coconut cake is great. The chocolate pate with pistachio ice cream and pecan praline is even better. Not sure how that is possible. Both desserts are out of this world."}
{"text":"My daughter really wanted Mac and Cheese. At first we were a little intimidated, this place looked a bit more than casual dining.  However, the wait staff was very pleasant, I couldn't get my drink below half way if I tried (and I tried!)  The food was perfectly portioned, all be it a bit expensive, but the atmosphere, food quality, and service is where the price comes in.  My daughter ordered a side of ketchup to mix into her Mac and Cheese (after much debate), it was met with a quick turnaround and the hostess came over and set her at ease, suggesting next time she should try and mix the tomato soup with the Mac and Cheese. Lastly, the lunch menu had just enough selection so we weren't overwhelmed. We will definitely come back with family for special occasions, or just for the Mac and Cheese service!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, our server was awesome I forgot her name unfortunately. 

I made reservations for five and my Dad checked in first. The hostess seats us at a table for four, not five. She was real short about it, I understand that it was a busy night but I still had to wait 20-30 more minutes than my reservation time. I honestly don't think she thought my friend was part of our party, because she was not Caucasian or Asian. Just being honest. Dinner was cold and the potato side was raw. Spent $300.00+ for dinner. Maybe the one in uptown is better."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was okay, it was a busy Friday night though.  Really thought the sides were the best parts of our meal. This isn't taking anything away from the mains, Pork Chop (me) & Flounder (wife), as those were awesome as well but the sides were awesome-er! Wish they had more local specialty craft beers on-tap, but other than that, four thumbs up and a food coma for us! We will be returning for sure..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here just the other day and dinner some time ago.  We enjoyed both visits, although I have to say I enjoyed the dinner menu more.  This time around I ordered the roast chicken wrap.  I was planning on ordering something different, but once the server explained to my husband what was on it, I decided to order it too.  Put pickled red onions on anything and I'm in!  The wrap was good, but close to being over-seasoned.  It comes with a side of fries, but you can get a different side for $1 more so I ordered the onion rings.  I'm glad I did - they were great.  Cut thin, almost like onion straws...quite addictive.  

Service was excellent and the food came out FAST.  Almost too fast! I wish the server knew a little more about the craft beer selection.  When asked what the Highland Seasonal was, she responded that she wasn't sure but she knew it was good because the brewery planned to start making it available year-round.  Rather than wait for her to check into it, I simply ordered something else.  No biggie.

I love the atmosphere of this restaurant - laid back and cozy.  I'm looking forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today; the special salmon cakes on succatash.   It was excellent.  I'm not surprised to learn from the server that they usually run out of it.  The service, selection, ambiance is excellent,  parking in adjacent lot.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Unique restaurant with good service and good food. A few items I want to mention were exceptional. The chicken wings. The Best....   The martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. Yummy if I could handle a lot of booze I would have had way more than just one. The coconut cake was very good. The augraten potatoes were very good. The place was really neat. Two large bars, at least four dining area, great atmosphere. Will be back next week after I get my knee injection at Flexogenix clinic down the street."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty big and is really nice inside though the exterior is pretty cookie cutter in a strip mall.  The food is served a la carte and we were told by our server that everything from dressings to breadcrumbs is made from scratch in-house. They are a farm to fork concept, with most of it being local. The portions vary so if you're very hungry ask whether a side is necessary.  

I had pork spare ribs, slaw, frites the ribs had a great flavor I have no idea what kind of vinegar they were done in but it was very unique! I loved it but I must say the ribs themselves seemed very fatty and not an amazing quality but they were made to perfection!  The fries some yelpers bragged about were just ok nothing special but not bad.  My brother ordered the spice rubbed & smoked wings.  Talk about flavor wow they were smoked to perfection I ate two of them before my brother was ready to stab me with a fork!  The only problem is its 12 bucks for an order of either 10-12 not sure so very pricey!  So all in all a good visit is remember you are paying high dollar for your meal.

For desert we ordered the coconut cake and the & caramel cake w/caramel sauce, praline gelato,  both were really good above average quality and taste. I would say all in all this place is worth your time to give a try I really liked everything about it even if it a little price especially since the ribs had a flavor unlike any i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Not really great. Service was very slow even though the restaurant was not busy. We ordered the chicken fingers for the kids and there were 4 pieces of the size of chicken nuggets at Chick-fil-a. They have brought more in and did not charge us, but this was very strange. I ordered the roasted chicken pizza and it was an appetizer size, I would have eaten something else if I knew it. The pizza tasted okay, could taste the garlic only nothing else. Restaurants keep adding garlic to tomato sauces and this is wrong, should be stopped. Tomato sauce does not have garlic, not sure who taught that to the american chefs. The fries that came with my wife's burger were great and she said the burger was average but nothing memorable. Will probably go back, but without high expectations."}
{"text":"Whether you are uptown or out here in South Park area Roosters is a solid choice for either dinner or lunch.  I've been to this one a few times and at my latest visit I tried the fried oyster salad.  So perfect, the coolness of the greens combined with the warm fried oysters was just a perfect combo.  

The service here was great but the seating was a bit awkward where my girlfriend and I sat.  I have to mention it because it was really noticeable.  The table was a solid six inches away from both of us so it made for a weird eating arrangement to say the least.  

I wouldn't let that deter you from eating here at all though.  Just get a better seat :)"}
{"text":"Independent and non-franchised chef-owned restaurants are like snowflakes, each one a little different.  Some you adore, some just aren't so appealing.  Certainly Rooster's and it's high-profile chef (for Charlotte) fit into that category.  Having now visited here a healthy handful of times, I can say if you are the type of person who looks at dining out as more of an experience than an occasion to stuff your gullet, Rooster's will appeal.

First, the ambiance:  Spacious room with an open kitchen right in the center, where the wood-fired grill is always visible.  Like a buzzing beehive, the chefs busily push each other on while servers quickly pick up plates and make deliveries to the surrounding booths and high-topped tables.  The decoration is best described as rustic European-country farm.  A wall of wine compartmentalized into bins contrasts with stuffed fowl on the opposing wall.  Dark woods and dim lighting make for a most intimate and romantic feel, though it can get a little loud due to the high ceilings at peak times.

Cuisine is primarily European-inspired with an emphasis on local-sourcing.  But the Southern influence is noticeable throughout, especially in the veggie offerings and vinegar-based barbecue sauce.  Like a finer European restaurant, the concept is smaller dishes, with a big emphasis on flavor, texture, and/or presentation. Again, the idea is dining as a full sensory experience.  Fries cooked in truffle oil, buttered butter beans, house-made gnocchi.  Even the cheese and charcuterie boards have some interesting picks. Surprise find for me- chicken liver mousse.  I'm not a liver eater, by any means, but I'd put this smooth operator on crunchy toast any day of the week.

All this said, I don't find Rooster's pretentious at all: servers are happy to take time with you and will gladly take back anything that does not appeal and offer a substitution.  The menu also includes a full range of staples for the not so adventurous. 
 
Wine is almost a must here due to the voluminous wine offerings and the captain's list.  Broad enough to appeal to just about any palette and price point, the selections are well known by the educated severs who can help you pick.  They will also let you sample any wine sold by the glass before pouring a regular serving.  A small selection of microbrews and a full bar complete the drink offerings.

Bottom line: If you are into large portions, and favor quantity for your buck, you will leave here disappointed.  If, though, you look to quality and overall experience, I find Rooster's has it in spades."}
{"text":"Not impressed. One bathroom for women and men with one stall in busy large restaurant. Vegetables poorly seasoned/bland and not special to warrant a la carte pricing. The meat course is the only thing I felt was quality checked and seasoned well. Cosmo coctail was poorly made which is why I switched to wine. Small wine list. Service was fantastic and the atmosphere was enjoyable however I just wouldn't come back here again based on my poor food experience and high price tag. There are other quality restaurants I'd spend 30% less, not have to wait to share a bathroom, and have more quality seasoned food in this area."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken was insanely good!   Cool atmosphere, MAC and cheese was stellar, and different.  Anxious to come back and try other things."}
{"text":"Located across the street from South Park mall. I came on a weekday for lunch. Server was attentive and nice. It has decor to support the name. There are all kinds of roosters on the wall. I really enjoyed my wine and my friend loved the beer. Portions are great if your trying to loose weight or not hungry.  The food was okay. They have several eclectic dishes. The corn was bland and cold despite it being in a skillet. The strips that came in a sauce was okay, but lacked flavor. I had the shrimp salad and I wish the shrimp was warm and seasoned, but it was plain, cold, and lacked flavor or seasoning.  They just tossed it on there. Management came by to check on the table and seemed to help staff that was nice. Over I am not sure what the hype is about this place on a weekday mid afternoon this place was packed. I am wondering if I ordered the wrong dishes or if they had new persons in the back making the food. The best part about this place is the service, however the menu and food served needs to be re-examined."}
{"text":"So glad our original plans to dine at the Cowfish fell through... first off, we are new to the South Charlotte area, (relocated from West Coast) and have found most restaurants to be sub par at best... due to a reservation mix up at the Cowfish, our party of 6 was left to figure out an alternative dining solution.   Did a quick google search for nearby restaurants and Roosters popped up, soooooo glad it did!!! I called the restaurant, not confident that they would be able to accommodate a party of our size last minute (and on a weekend!) but the hostess assured me that she was going to PERSONALLY put our table together and that when we arrive we would be seated immediately- I thought \"Yeah right\"... boy I ate those mental remarks by the pound..  it was as she said, beautifully arranged and readily available for us to be seated.  The whole staff was friendly and hospitable, I mean the WHOLE staff was!  A pleasant change from what we've encountered from similar dining establishments in the South end.. but the \"icing on the cake\" was our server, Tommy.  He went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was nothing less than phenomenal and he exceeded every expectation from potentially at times, fussy customers?.  The food and the Wine list (our teenager called it the wine glossary lol) only magnified the experience... beautifully cooked med rare burger and hangar steak, to the delectable sides and the amazing desserts... I'm afraid that Rooster's has raised the bar for its nearby competitors, to them I say good luck .. Tommy and Roosters have earned our future business - we have become quite spoiled at Roosters and will make sure that all our friends and family come to dine here!!! Thanks so much for the wonderful experience"}
{"text":"How does this restaurant have so few raving reviews on Yelp? Either the folks in Charlotte don't know a great restaurant when they see it, or it's just a little too southern for the New Yorkers in Charlotte. The food was exceptional, the service was friendly and knowledgeable, and the hosts were incredibly nice. I enjoyed sitting at the stools by the open kitchen, and everything that emerged from the kitchen looked so inviting. I had the roasted duck wings with delicious chili aioli, and the quarter barbq chicken. The chicken was tender and moist, and I enjoyed the sauce. I felt that the chicken could have been even better had it been smoked. The fried corn was excellent as an accompaniment. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, and I think I shall go back for the succulent looking grilled burger. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service! I had the hanger steak and it was very good. They have a great selection of smoked meats, pizzas, pastas, etc... The only thing I found a little annoying was the a la carte sides. $10 for a side of asparagus is a bit excessive however, it is definitely worth checking out if you are in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"We love their Natural Chicken (ask for extra Au Jus!!), their Succotash, and their Brussel Sprouts are the BEST in town (if only they'd feature them more often). Someone there said they were \"seasonal\", but we've had year round Brussel Sprouts at other restaurants here year round :-("}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I had the grilled salmon and it was cooked perfectly.  We ordered enough sides for the entire table to share and my favorite were the potatoes, that could have been my entire meal and I would have been happy. 

I liked that they had local craft beer on the menu although the two best were missing: NoDa and Old Meck.

The atmosphere is great. It's very open, somewhat loud but not enough that you can't enjoy your conversation. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Rooster's is great, with a few nits I wish they would work on.  

The place smells incredible, thanks to the wood-fired grill.  You may smell like you've been sitting around a fire when you leave, but it's a small trade off for great food.  The decor is a bit alarming - And I don't mean to scare you, but there are roosters on the wall.  Try not to upset them....

I've eaten quite a few things off the menu and in generally, it's all really good.  The best tip I can provide is try the specials.  They are generally seasonal and local foods.   I have never been disappointed when order the specials.  Also - the vegetable they offer are just great too.  I'm typically a meat eater, but I enjoy getting a bunch of vegetables to try different things.

My two nits about my numerous experience there:

1) I've only ordered red wine there, and every time I find the wine is served around room temperature.  I know this sounds super pretentious, but I prefer my red wine chilled a bit.  Room temperature is just a bit too warm.  
2) For as wide of menu as Rooster's offers, the drink menu is extremely light.  I would encourage them to develop some cool seasonal cocktails.  This was one missing piece to the experience....

Absolutely head to Rooster's for a great meal - One of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how great the food was. We are from out of town and had never eaten there. We ate tapas style (highly recommend the cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and shrimp) everything was so good and I enjoyed every bite. Our waitress was great. She was very helpful and friendly. She was even great at recommending wine!"}
{"text":"Somehow walked in and sat at the bar during a busy Saturday night!!

Lots of great cocktails---solid wine list and tons of people!

Loved the open kitchen and the quality of usual dishes.  We started with Fried Watermelon---pretty different and good. 

The brick-oven pizza was very good with fresh cheese, meats, and vegetable toppings.  However, the whole meal was tied together by a yummy Chateauneuf-Du-Pape by the glass!!!

Good experience--good food."}
{"text":"It's easy to overlook Rooster's SouthPark location, in a bland retail center across from the mall. But overlook it you must, because just inside the unimpressive facade waits one of Charlotte's best dining experiences.

From the delicious calamari to the signature roasted chicken and beef short rib, everything about our meal was outstanding. But the best part may have been the check -- with perfectly portioned entrees at reasonable prices, Rooster's may be one of the Queen City's best values in upscale dining. So don't let the sparse location deter you -- this is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"My friends raved about this place!

An a la carte establishment that had great food at reasonable prices. I actually think a la carte pricing can work if the entree portions are big enough to make them a meal in and of themselves, which Roosters does.

There wine selection is good and the wait staff is very helpful in pairing one of their many wines with dishes you plan to order.

I had the chopped salad and was told the butter beans were to die for....well, I don't think dead came to mind when i ate them, but they were pretty good.

I ordered the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly to medium rare and tender!  Lordy...lordy!

It is a large space, but the bar had community seating which I love because for two reasons....first, it allows you to \"spice it up\" as you'll never know who might sit beside you...and second, many places in NYC have this type of seating.

If you ever find yourself in the South....check this place out!"}
{"text":"I gave it four stars because it was a bit overpriced and service was slow although, the food quality was very good. 
 
     The reason I thought it was overpriced was because for a side bowl of asparagus it costed $10 and the other $6-$8 sides were small for their pricing. The only other reason it too pricy was because the cornish hen was $24. 

     I thought the food was great. I got the cornish hen. It was prepared in three different ways: flash fried, seared, and baked (as the waitress informed us)! It was also served with carrots, carrot purée, and as well as purple potatoes. 

     Overall the food was great, and although it was a bit pricy, it was worth the cost."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, both locations. Their PEI muscles and their charcuterie are my favorites. I like the fact that everything is fresh and prepared from quality ingredients. I also love the way the owners give back to the community. Def go here to eat! You'll love it."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to my dining experience at Roosters but was greatly disappointed. 

Though I had a reservation, I had to wait 15 minutes for my table. The bar was full and it was raining so I was forced to stand in the doorway as they have no designated waiting area. The atmosphere was far too noisy to hold a conversation. The waitress did her best sales job and told me about the beautiful scallops that looked like \"toasted marshmallows\" when they came from the oven. She didn't tell me that they were miniature marshmallows, three of them to be exact. For $18.00 I got three scallops with no sides. The best part about the meal was the steamed green beans ($5 extra) and the bottle of wine. Hard to mess those up. 

I came home, made a sandwich and crossed Roosters off of my places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went here on a business trip.  My salad was great but the short rib was dry.  The rib needed to be seated more so it could be juicer."}
{"text":"A quick dinner meeting led us here tonight. I started with the arugula salad, followed by the roasted chicken pizza and finished off with tomato bisque soup. All were delicious!! Really cool atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"I heard that this was one of the new trendy places in Charlotte but it is highly over rated.  The prices are high considering the quality and the portion size of the food.  The 1/2 chicken is $13.00 and does not come with anything.  The taste was bland to say the least.  The roasted take-out chickens from Wal-Mart are more appetizing and the mashed potatoes from Bo-Jangles are better too.   It is not child friendly either since there is no menu for them which is a little unusual considering it is a casual restaurant and the family demographics of Charlotte.  I ordered chicken fingers for my daughter for $5-$6 and then added an order of fried for $5.  Horrible value.  The service was disappointing too.  We arrived well before the Saturday night rush and had a reservation and asked to be seated in a booth since there were two open booths.  The hostess said that we needed to request a booth when we called and that it was reserved for someone else.  I have never heard of such a thing for a casual restaurant.   I know that the chef has done well but I would not recommend Roosters to anyone.  There are many better choices  in Charlotte for far-less money and better quality.  I would not even call it a Tapas style restaurant either."}
{"text":"I have dined here 3 times and I just don't think this is worth the price. Everything is a la carte here and the portion sizes are NOT GOOD IMHO. On our last outing we ordered a salad that our waitress said was big enough to share. WRONG! When she brought it out on two plates, the portions were so puny, there was no way that was sufficient for two to share. We like the bbq chicken and the wings which have always been good but the sides are skimpy. We like the panfried corn but it is  $7 as a side and it was  SMALL portion. To be truly satisfying for two you would need two orders and I can't see paying $14 for some corn! I appreciate the whole farm to table philosophy of the restaurant but people also like to think that they are getting good value as well. I never feel that way when I leave this restaurant. 

A previous reviewer stated you should bypass Roosters and go down the street to Bricktop and I would have to agree with that sentiment."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Sean did a great job as our server, and he engaged memorably with our children to make it a special evening."}
{"text":"Rooster's is a tough place to describe, if only because it offers so much. They sell themselves as a Tapas type place, but I think that's a tough description. 

We went there a little while ago for no real reason--we hadn't heard too much about it or anything, but it seemed appealing and new. Again, it's hard to pin down what they're serving up, except to say that it was all pretty good. The place itself is really nice--very large and wide open, with modern tables and such. I like this kinda place--doesn't seem chain-y or anything. 

As for the food, it was good, not transcendent. Lots of small plates and options like that. I actually enjoyed the pizza the most, although it was all pretty decent. At our table of three, I think 3 or 4 national cuisines were sampled, if that makes sense. 

Great wine list, too."}
{"text":"Solid spot with solid food and drink offerings. We always forget about Rooster's when we're racking our brains for dinner spots. On the occasion that we remember them, we're never disappointed. We've sat in their dinning room for a special occasion (happy birthday to meeeeeeee, I'll have the scallops!) but more often than not land at the bar. It's more laid back and there's almost never a wait. 

Any meat or seafood dish is going to be a win at Rooster's. We love the BBQ chicken and scallops. On our most recent visit, I had a daily special -- lamb bolognese gnocchi. It wasn't as good as Bruce Moffet's gnocchi but it wasn't bad either. 

We even love grabbing a couple beers and a charcuterie board. Depending on which 5 meats and cheeses you select, price ranges from @ $22-$28. A steal when most of the meats and cheeses on their own will run you $8-$10."}
{"text":"Wife and I had Dinner here. Suggested you make a reservation, which we didn't and waited a while for a table. For an appetizer we ordered the Pork Belly, and Fried Oysters(both excellent), entree was Half Free Range chicken that can be ordered Natural, or BBQ. Duck Breast, and Spinach. The food arrived at an excellent temperature. Our server Lauren was great, and was very gracious in enduring my jokes. By the way on a side note it was raining extremely heavy and we had walked from the hotel. Gracious lady who was waiting for her husband offered a ride back to our hotel. Great people! If you're in the area you need to eat at this excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Slow service! Food okay. Wait staff didn't say anything about sides, so if you order the chicken that all you get.. Sorry service! Plus it took an hour to get our food and waited for our drinks! Now it's time to stop somewhere else to get some food!"}
{"text":"I love Roosters - both locations. I've never had a bad experience at either location.  The Southpark location is so cozy. The hostess opened the doors when we arrived. We were seated immediately on a Saturday night.

The food is so good! Our table ordered the fried oysters, pizza, bbq chicken, mac & cheese, and the brisket burger. #noregrets

We were not disappointed in our choices. I'd recommend anything on their menu. 

The whole menu is ala carte & they recommend that you order your own entree and share the sides.  Try this place out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I always end up eating here at least once when I am in town.

This visit again did not disappoint.

Went with a coworker for a later dinner.  I ordered the mussels, arugula salad with fresh peaches, and the shishito peppers.  Unfortunately since we were there a bit late they were out of the peppers ordered the heirloom tomatoes with micro basil instead.  

My coworker ordered the quarter natural chicken, au gratin potatoes(which are to die for), and the roasted red kuri squash.  Again because we were there later, they were out of the au gratin potatoes, she ordered the Mac and cheese instead.

Everything was amazing.  I love the fact that they use local ingredients. The food is fresh and has so much flavor.  The presentation is wonderful.  

Some reviewers feel that this place is a little expensive.  I think you get what you pay for and this is definitely worth it.  A true dining experience.

I will definitely be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant, honestly. It has it all. Great, warm ambiance, fantastic service, and always consistently amazing food. Go here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place missed the mark on so many levels for us. 

I'll start with the service, since this was the only great part of the experience. Our waiter was very friendly and spent time with us going over the menu. He was attentive, brought us everything we asked for and offered to replace my soup when I didn't like it. He gets the 1 star I gave here. 

Here's my list of the bad:
- What the hell is that wall of dead birds? 
- The wood fired beets - tasted more like rubber lumps, no wood fired taste. 
- The pan fried corn - yes, it's pan fried corn, my bad for expecting some spices in there. 
- The onion soup - overly salty and has a strong, unidentifiable flavor. 
- The scallops - nothing special at all.
- The prices - for what we paid, I would expect to be spoon fed while being fanned with palm leaves. Really a said combo of inflated prices and mediocre food you could prepare at home for nothing.

And be forewarned: Everything is a la carte. Ordering scallops? That's $20, and then you may add a side for $7. What a joke. 

Bring a fat wallet  of money you were thinking of setting on fire and low expectations and you should leave happy."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the spare rib which was really good but the eggplant was over seasoned. Salad was good and server was accommodating when we saw him. I was really disappointed in the service. Restaurant was not crowded but our server was MIA for a really long time. We finally asked one of the back staff to refill our drinks and ordered another beer from someone who walked by.
I could probably overlook everything about this restaurant that night except the fact that the person who served the food STUCK HIS FINGER ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOWL RIGHT INTO MY FOOD!!"}
{"text":"I know the name is Roosters but all the roosters, pheasants whatever on the walls are creepy & I can only imagine how dusty they are.  I wouldn't want to sit under them.  That said, the food is standard grilled meat & fish & are tasty & presented well and everything is a la carte.  The meat portions were fair but I've noticed portions becoming smaller everywhere & here is no exception.  One vegetable side is b-a-r-e-l-y enough for two people, maybe three if you're sharing 3-4 sides.  I really liked the bacon grits even though I'm not usually a fan, but this is the only other starch if you don't care for potatoes.  Another lady I was with had never liked grits, but did enjoy a small portion.  The staff is excellent & I love how they bring the bottle of wine to the table to present to you and pour your glass even when you've only ordered the glass.  The after dinner drinks/coffees were intriguing and we tried several and they were mostly great - The Rusty Nail(?) was more like a weak tea.  The open kitchen adds to the extreme noisiness of this space, so be prepared for it to sound like bedlam in there."}
{"text":"Rooster was amazing from the time we walked in the door to the time we left. From the hostess, to the water server, to the bread server, to our waitress (ask for Elise, she was awesome!), to the manager, the service was outstanding. The food was even better - my husband got the pork chop which was phenomenal and I got the salami pizza which was also great. We split the Mac n cheese and fried corn which were both delicious and their Rosé and beer were fabulous as well. We will be coming back next time we are in Charlotte! Be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Really well made upscale food with alot of comfort food mixed in.  Kinda small portions but thats the way I like it.  Cozy warm atmosphere where you can watch the cooks make your food."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. My mother-in-law insisted she take us here and we weren't disappointed. We got the fried chicken livers with what tasted like apple butter. They were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all. A lot of places struggle with that so we were very grateful. The burger was very good, cooked exactly how it was asked for. The fries were house made and very good. I had the mushroom pizza and it was amazing. The flavors were a perfect combination with the cheeses, mushrooms, and stone fired crust. It was just a real treat. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with my meal at Roosters. The restaurant is spacious and is quite nice despite its somewhat kitschy looking exterior. The food is served a la carte and we were told by our server that everything from dressings to breadcrumbs is made from scratch in-house. They are a farm to fork concept, and look to support local whenever possible. The portions vary so if you're very hungry ask whether a side is necessary.  

I had the scallops (4 at $18) and added on the au gratin potatoes ($7). It was definitely enough food and everything tasted awesome. The potatoes were easily some of the best I've had, they had just a hint of gorgonzola cheese. 

We split two desserts , the lemon cheesecake with a blackberry topping and the coconut cake. The cheesecake was out of this world, more tart than sweet and just perfectly creamy. It was not a dessert I would normally order on my own but it will be an absolute must when I return! 

The only slight downside is you will end up smelling like a campfire, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Good was tasty!  Had a mixed charcuterie and cheese plate. I left it to the waiter to select the meats and cheeses - he did well. Hangar steak, fries, pan-fried corn and green beans made for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"My first restaurant in Charlotte....meh.  While the servers were nice, service was pretty slow and the restaurant was empty.  The food was ok, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Our experience wasn't very good. Our food had a nice presentation, appeared to be of good quality, but was surprisingly bland in all 3 cases. I had the Beef Short Ribs. It was nice that they were very tender, but were lacking flavor. Others at our table had the Duck and BBQ Chicken, and surprisingly, we all agreed that everything was bland.  Another disappointment was the over-priced average wine.
For our experience, and what we were expecting (from another recommendation) it was certainly way over-priced and not worth it.
The worst part was the waiter we had - he seemed to try to rush us through our decisions and seemed slightly irritated when we asked questions. The manager on duty was nice and stopped by to check on us. All in all, I'm guessing we had one of those \"bad nights\", and unfortunately, walked away without a reason to return.  For the dollar, there are many other restaurants we'd choose over this one."}
{"text":"i feel like i dont ever write bad reviews but i dont have anything bad to say about jim nobles roosters. you can get one of the best meals in charlotte along with one of the better wine list and not break the bank. sometimes i eat at places seasonally but this place has something for every taste and every time of year. lately i have been ordering their fish specials, a couple months ago it was flounder with fiddle head ferns and trumpet mushrooms, this past weekend it was carolina tilefish with fennel grapefruit and figs (mind you i dont like sweet anything) and a port reduction. the fish was absolutely flawless in every way and the accompaniments on the plate were mind blowing. we got a semi-traditional and perfect romaine and heirloom tomato (some of the best tomato's i have had this year and i consider myself a connoisseur) salad as a starter with a couple glasses of pinot gris and rose, split with my friend and left completely satisfied, full and bragging about our dinner later in the night. i love the atmosphere in the resty, the decor, and especially the bar area. we had originally sat @ a table, werent feeling the vibe and asked if we could cruise the bar, they were more than willing to oblige and then proceeded the exceed every expectation as usual. i say it all the time and i will say it again roosters in one of the finest meals in charlotte for the money"}
{"text":"My wife and I have really grown to love Rooster's.  We met my brother and his wife there this past weekend and had several different menu items!  I had the BBQ chicken and my wife had the scallops.  Both dishes were wonderful!  Wine was flowing!  Can't wait to go back and try some new things!  We were there late so next time we plan to stick around a little longer!"}
{"text":"This place was delish can't wait to try them again. Located in South Park but very easy to get to an we got lucky an parked right at the door :) The decor of course is roosters on the wall but not tacky lol dem lighting of course I was with my BFF lol We started with a cheese plate of course I luv cheese yum. We had a goat cheese that melted in your mouth an Brie plus another one I couldn't pronounce lol But all 3 were amazing in flavor .  I started with the Cesar salad the dressing was I could have used bread to wipe my dish to get it all lol It also had a few black olives that really made the salad. I ordered the salmon with asparagus an Mac n cheese. The salmon was perfectly cooked an seasoned flakey moist . Asparagus great flavor crispy not crunchy an the MAC n CHEESE made you wanna smack ya mama lol I'm a Mac n cheese girl n it was so creamy I couldn't figure out what kind of cheese they used I could have ate a huge pan of it lol and yes I had room for desert I ordered their coconut brownie. The coconut layer is on top than bottom layer is the brownie an it was warm . The only thing that could have kicked it up another notch would have been a glass of milk lol I am going back an I've heard the chicken is yum-o please go an try Roosters u won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I love all their food there. I like going for lunch because they have a wonderful Fried Oyster Salad. If I go for dinner, I usually get pasta or Fried Oysters with one of their sides (I really really REALLY like their Yukon Puree). For dessert, I love their Coconut Cake. Perfect place to eat after a day of shopping or to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night after seeing a show in Uptown.  We looked for places that were open since it was already 9pm when we decided to grab something to eat.  I'm so glad we did.  The meal was pricey, but the food was excellent.  We got the choose 3 cheese platter, my boyfriend got the pulled pork and roasted beets.  I got the braised beef rib and roasted turnips.  Everything was excellent.  I would definitely come here again.  The $75 bill was well worth it.    Due to the price, this isn't a place I can afford to go to every week, but we will definitely be back.  Side Note: As we were leaving, we noticed that the bar side of the restaurant has a bar small plates menu, so we probably will be back a little sooner to try."}
{"text":"Wow - such a special treat! We didn't have reservations so when we walked in (Friday night), the only seats they had available were at the Chef's table. We took them and to our surprise had an absolute blast! 

From the moment we sat down we were taken care of by the most professional and attentive group of people. Watching as your food is being made right in front of you is such a delight. Jake from the kitchen was awesome, he greeted as soon as we sat down and spent the next 2 hours checking in on us and giving us little facts about the place, the history and the foods they were preparing. Every plate leaving the kitchen was a beautiful and simple piece of art. You could tell that the team cared about the food they were serving, if something didn't look right, someone was always there to add the extra sauce or to sprinkle the plate with the missing garnishes. 

We had the mussels from the local menu - the sauce and ciabatta were crazy good. They make all of their bread in-house and you can taste the freshness. We moved on to the grilled salmon and the spit fire roasted chicken with pan fried corn and potato fingerlings and enjoyed every single bite. I have been craving a place like this - a place with fresh, local, organic foods (supporting our local farmers!) prepared with care and incredible attention to detail. The perfect portion sizes give you the opportunity to try a nice sampling of different options and even leave room dessert - try the coconut cake with an irish coffee. They have a nice wine list which included a few favorites of mine from back home (Duckhorn, Jordan and Pali). We won't be feeling guilty about eating here a few times a week, a great local spot!"}
{"text":"Charlotte Yelpers most be a harsh bunch as this is a very high four at minimum so surprised by the 3.5 average.  I have been coming to Charlotte over the last four weekends and been staying and eating around Southpark and this is the best place.

The place is centered around the wood fire open kitchen and everything smells great.  The menu is a nice mix of meat, seafood and vegetables.  Some people might get annoyed at the a la carte nature of the sides but I liked that as I have been to many restaurants and really wanted some dish but did not get as did not like the sides that came with it.

The service has at minimum been good and if anything the servers can be a bit exuberant about all the food though I think for good reason as had the duck, salmon, and special seafood dish and loved them all.  The onion rings were perfectly as skinny and nicely breaded and not too fatty.  The only thing that disappointed a little was the salads which could have used some time in a crisper, a paper towel or a salad spinner as a bit soggy so the dressing did not stick.  They also did not have a true steakhouse style wedge salad.

Liked the beer selection also and the drinks in general were good though cocktails could have been a bit stronger.  In conclusion I have been here three times and likely to return a couple more times."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere; amazing bread, french onion soup, and BBQ chicken.  The whole place smells delicious - fresh baked bread and smokey wood.  Some of the dishes and sides are on both the expensive and small side.  They have a separate bar menu that is very good and more reasonably priced.  Always very busy, be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte and wanted to try something totally different, not the typical chain places like Applebee's. I was at the Southpark mall and wanted something relatively close which Roosters was. My first impression upon walking in was great. The hostess was friendly, loved the kitchen in the center and liked the different decor (stuffed roosters on one wall). My waiter was friendly and helpful, explaining the menu, how everything was local and giving me his advice on some menu items. I took his advice and got the duck confit, getting the asparagus as a side. When it came out, everything looked gorgeous. The asparagus was grilled, was a tad firm, but not at all chewy with a great taste. The duck was fantastic! I got full but hated to leave any of it left on my plate because it was so amazing. It had a great sauce, a nice crisp skin and was LITERALLY fall off the bone tender. Not kidding, I pulled on the bone when I cut into it, and the bone came out totally clean. I love duck, and that was one of the best duck meals I've ever had. Next time im in the area, I'll be back. I got those who meal items and a sweet tea and my total was just under 30 bucks, so not cheap, but I was full and pleased. I feel like for a once-in-a-while great meal, it was well worth it."}
{"text":"If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, then I might get ditched for Jim Noble.  This man knows food!

I have eaten here on many occasions, and honestly, have never been disappointed. I find the portions to be sensible, and keep in mind that many of the items are a la carte.  If you order carefully, you will have plenty of food without breaking the bank.  This must be some sort of adaptive trait.

If you get nothing else, please take my advice and order the:

Pan fried corn.  Buttery and slightly browned.  It's to die for.

Duck confit: Phenomenal here.

Assorted Mushrooms: So good, that our dining neighbors *almost* took a bite before ordering their own!

Mac & Cheese: This is listed under pastas, not sides, or vegetables, duh.  It is OUT of this world.

The quarter or half natural chicken is also a great choice.  They also always have excellent specials. Last time it was the duck wing special that stole my heart.  I still catch myself thinking about those wings.... 

The servers I've had are always helpful. 

And for dessert? Get the coconut cake.

The atmosphere is country, cozy, and classy!"}
{"text":"The staff alone at Rooster's make this 5 stars. The food would make it 6 stars if possible. Prices are very reasonable for the quality & perfection they present every time we eat there. The Duck Confit is superb. The Brisket Burger and Fries is my favorite burger in NC. PERIOD. You have to eat at this place! Good Drinks, Great Food. The Pork Shoulder Sandwich at 10 bucks is the best deal in Southpark. Very diverse menu.  I like some of the bread, but they need a nice butter to go with it, oil is ok but butter rules."}
{"text":"Yep! I'm a fan.  Got a cheese and cracker plate along with some mac and cheese, corn and wings - wow was it yummy.  The service was also very good.  Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place Great service and cool bar
Excellent food and menu offers a nice selection I had the coconut cake. One word --incredible 
The bread pudding was excellent 
Recommend to everyone
Will be back"}
{"text":"Food was not too bad, I expected it to be better. I consider their food to be overpriced. Our waiter was very friendly and professional. Don't come here with high expectation on the foods."}
{"text":"Really great dining experience here! Great Waiter, Great Food. Had lunch here and had the fried oysters, peas, fried corn and dry rub smoked chicken.  food was fresh, hot and again the waiter was through and very consistent which for me is always appreciated! If you have never tried it, do yourself a favor and dine here!"}
{"text":"Service is great! The waitress Leah was great at explaining the menu as it was our first time here. Food is fresh and is absolutely amazing. My husband had a burger and I had a turkey sandwich which was probably the best turkey sandwich I've ever had. We definitely recommend this place. Will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were in town for a concert, and chose this place for dinner based on the Yelp reviews and photos.  We were not disappointed!!! It is a little more \"uppity\" than I'd anticipated (the clientele are predominantly upper-middle-class), but I did not feel out-of-place in my jeans and Chuck Taylors.  Our server (I wish I had asked his name) was genuinely friendly, as were the other servers that would pass by - everyone greeted us with a smile.  We ordered rotisserie chicken, and it was the best I'd ever had.  I would recommend this place to anyone living in, or travelling through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not bad. Good service, friendly staff, seated promptly!

I had the pork shoulder, and it was flavorful, juicy and tender. They served it with some slaw, and man this is the second time I've had slaw that tastes expensive. I also ate this arugula tomato salad.  It tasted fresh, the flavors went well together, and I liked the bits of cucumber with it.  It said the tomatos were sliced liek carpaccio which I thought my tomatos would be thinly sliced but they were about 1cm thick.  It's ok. I forgive them.  I had the dessert special after the waitress suggested it to me which was this apple bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream... that... wasn't um great. I felt like I was scooping up butter.  It actually smelled like butter too.  I took like 5 bites and I just couldn't stomach it any longer.  Good news though, the waitress asked how it went and when I told her I wasn't a fan, she waived it!  I would have given this place 3 stars if the dessert wasn't waived but since it was, and since I know that the bread pudding isn't usually on the menu.. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but perfectly sized portions and AMAZING dishes! The steak was phenomenal and the sides were great. Great staff, fun environment, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Another great meal Saturday night at Roosters. The Duck Confit was amazing, also the Pâté and Fried Oysters. Grilled Corn and Sauté Mushrooms topped it off! Only draw back is the noise level."}
{"text":"I hopped up in this joint on a weekday afternoon. It was a bit chilly outside. You know, Uggs weather. It wasn't crowded at all. I sat at a table and pulled up \"We Were 8 Years In Power\" on my Kindle. 

I ordered a cup of tomato bisque, some calamari and mac n' cheese. My order came out in no time. All of it was delicious. The bisque was the perfect recipe for fighting off the chill of the fall breeze. The service was attentive and friendly and she was really helpful with guiding me to the good picks on the menu.

It wasn't too expensive and it was very filling. I'll definitely come back. It was a place with rich southern cuisine that I've come to love but without the confederate flag mystique of a cracker barrel or Kenny Rodgers place.

Well done!"}
{"text":"You know... You come back to Charlotte, having been gone for ten years and, supposedly the food has gotten a lot better during that time, like it has around the country. So you look for some of the top new restaurants, and find Roosters, and Yelp gives it four stars with some glowing reviews and you're like... All right! It's 9:15, everything closes in 45 minutes, I'm in South Park, and wouldn't mind a nice sit down meal... LETS GO TO ROOSTERS!!

Siggggggghhhh. Ugh. Charlotte... So disappoint. 

I dunno. Maybe they were having an off night. I mean it IS Tuesday night. Perhaps expectations were wrong. The place itself, it's gorgeous. Really dug the look of it, the laid back, classy atmosphere, the wall of cock. But maaaaan. That food was OFF. 

We ordered the chicken liver mousse, which was covered with a rock hard layer of schmaltz that we had to drill through. I dunno what they put in there, but the seasoning was just off. Maybe sherry? 

Then the main dishes. The bbq pork shoulder. I don't understand. Why did you cube the pork like that? What was the point? And the slaw. It was warm. Warm slaw isn't a good thing. In fact it's a bad thing. A harbinger of pain to come, of frequent dates with the john and childhood summers filled with church bbqs, and Cole slaw left out too long in the sun. The fries were good though, a lot like the fries you get at Five Guys. 

We also ordered a couple of sides. The spinach was whatever. The Mac and Cheese? Have you all not had Mac and Cheese before?? The succotash was good, corn was sweet, well seasoned. Beans were a bit mushy, but maybe that's how they like it in Charlotte. And the fried chicken of the woods. I ate about five pieces before realizing that it wasn't actually chicken. Maybe cause I figured it was dry and tasteless and that's just how it was cause the rest of the meal didn't have much flavor either and that was probably the problem. 

THE SEASONING WAS ALL OFF. 

Like it wasn't consistent. 

Mac and cheese? BLAND
Wilted spinach? BLAND (did you all use unsalted butter to wilt the spinach??)
Fried chicken of the woods. Bland and blah. Even the ranch needed salt. 

The pork was actually well seasoned. And the succotash slightly over seasoned, little heavy on the salt. 

But seriously. Maybe the cooks were all in. Rush to get home and they forgot to salt everything. But you go to a nice restaurant, spend $90 for two people, you expect a little consistency between dishes. It shouldn't taste like we ordered from five different restaurants. 

But like I said, maybe an off night. If not, God bless em and God bless Charlotte because three stars is being generous. Seriously. Top 30 restaurants in Charlotte? Y'all out of your damn minds."}
{"text":"I was REALLY looking forward to going to Rooster's.  I had checked out the menu on the restaurant's webpage, and it looked great.  I read the reviews from other Yelpers, which made me hopeful.  Unfortunately, the dining experience I had with my girlfriend last week was simply dreadful.  

We ordered the fried green tomato appetizer, and it was truly ordinary.  The tomatoes were breaded too heavily, and there wasn't anything particularly flavorful on the plate.  For dinner, we ordered the flatiron steak, the half chicken, green beans, and cauliflower.  The meats were just dreadful.  The steak was undercooked, and it was served cold.  The chicken was warm when it was brought to the table, but it was so bland that it was not worth eating.  Candidly, a rotisserie chicken from the Fresh Market is much, much better than the chicken they served us here.  The vegetables weren't memorable in any way.  The beans were luke warm and a bit oily.  The cauliflower's sauce/flavoring was simply not enough to make it enjoyable.  We skipped dessert, for there seemed to be no point in prolonging the evening.  

While our waitress was quite good, the bartender we encountered inside the restaurant was clearly working in the wrong area of the restaurant.  When we asked him about some of the wines that they offer by the glass he told us \"I don't drink wine\".  Really?  Then why in the world are you working the bar?  I found that to be a total turn-off. 

I am really sad that Rooster's seems to have such terrible food.  The inside of the restaurant is really neat, and the staff (with the exception of our bartender) was friendly and competent.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not for people what want to stay away from oils I paid 23$ for 3 oz of cod and additional 11 for asparagus that I specifically asked to me cooked with no oil ! I don't know who these people are trying to lie to I can feel the oil on my lips and fingers I even  asked a friend to check and yet they insisted it wasn't oil !"}
{"text":"Rooster's cares. They care about the food (exceptional) , the ingredients (local, farmed), the spices, people and patrons. They take care of you, as a guest you are family. The restaurahnt is truly a Southern jewel. The owner, kind hearted Christian, Jim Noble. The manager, tender, evasively strong Fernando Derado. You ruin your experience in Charloitte if you dont come here.

{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the scallops salad. It was a great combination of fresh and savory with the scallops, crunchy with the cornbread croutons and red peppers, creamy from the avocado and slightly sweet with the corn. It was a great portion for lunch - not too big but just enough to fill me up. The buttermilk lime dressing was really bright and a nice way to pull all the ingredients together. 

My mom ordered the very cake wrap and enjoyed that as well. However the beet cake wasn't so much a cake as it was puréed beets. 

Great service and delicious food - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but it has gone done hill in last few months. Not sure if there  is new management. Last two times in the place was  empty. We had lunch a few weeks ago and had the scallop salad.  Plate came with brown avocado and missing scallops. When we complained to manager he seemed pissed and argued with us on the scallop count and our issue with brown avocado.. We get this salad all of the time and know what to expect.. We were more put off by manager than food.. We went back today and had another mediocre meal. I got the arugula chicken salad. It looked like then took a plate threw a handful of arugula on it then dropped a solid chicken breast on top.. No blue cheese and salad dressing came in ramekin. Wife had veggie plate and some items seemed to be very over cooked. Bread which is usually very good was totally stale and cold the last two times.. 

Come on guys, plenty of places to have lunch in South Park. If I am going to pay $30 plus for lunch I shouldn't leaving wishing I went to Panera."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Local food and everything taste so fresh. I had the duck wings and the pasta of the day and they both were amazing. The grits are out of this world. I would come just for the grits. The problem here is you don't know what to get bc it all looks great."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  The smoked wings are a must!  We also got the Mac & cheese as well as the butternut squash gratin for sides to share...both were amazing!  Everything is a la carte.  The drinks are a little pricey though. No think it's s good place to meet family or friends, and it's a cute date night spot."}
{"text":"Hanger Steak was cooked perfectly and tasted perfect with the wilted spinach and assorted mushrooms."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding...I tried two of the specials ---the potato soup and the mussels. Both were divine. The complimentary bread was a bit dry, but otherwise everything was delicious. We enjoyed Mac m cheese , zucchini and corn as our sides. They were l outstanding though the portions were small.
The server was cordial, but not super friendly and she just wasn't with it. I would have given five stars were the portions larger and the service outstanding."}
{"text":"This review is for the South Park location.  

I love this place.  Love the duck (breast and confit), bbq chicken, pan fried corn, scalloped potatoe side, etc., etc."}
{"text":"I've been here three times because I live so near and can walk to it, and while each time was not a horrible experience, it was not stellar either. 

The atmosphere and the bustle of the crowd lend more to the dining experience than the food itself. 

If you want a marginal experience, then this is it."}
{"text":"Watch what you order.  I had half an enemic chicken and peas and it was twice as expensive as my husbands MUCH more delicious turkey breast sandwich.  My arm got tired from flagging down the waiter and it took us an hour and a half to get in and out due to this.
We used a Groupon and Roosters added 20% to the bill in gratuity.  I get it that people tip based on the reduced price which is completely cheap and lame and you should be smacked in the head and publicly embarrassed for doing so.  But paying 20% for terrible service didn't add to the expereince.  At the Groupon price we paid $45 out the door for 2 entrees, 1 beer (great selection!!!!) and 2 desserts and that was fair.  It would have been $65 without the Groupon and that is WAY too much for lunch.
The french fries were the best thing we tried.  FANtastic."}
{"text":"Roosters is an upscale new American restaurant with a very chef-driven menu and a big wink (check out the wall of taxidermy roosters on the wall).
To start, I had the blood old fashioned with a bourbon-soaked cherry.  It was a bit sweet, but very delicious!  My boyfriend had the bourbon in the orchard cocktail, which was also very good! We also got the charcuterie board, with five choices that I've completely forgotten (duck liver mousse, an excellent aged gouda, a fennel salami, ???).  All of the charcuterie options were very thoughtful and we devoured the board in minutes (we're piranhas, basically).

For dinner, I had the hangar steak, my boyfriend had the duck breast.  Our other tablemates had the veal gnocci, scallops, salmon, and the smoked chicken wings.  Everyone cleaned their plates!  For sides, we had the Carolina gold rice (buttery in the best way), bacon-braised collard greens (I went back for thirds and fourths #nogreensleftbehind), potatoes au gratin (absolutely the best I've ever had), and asparagus (can't go wrong!).  We were pretty full, but we still peaked at the dessert menu (the snickerdoodle blondie sounded amazing).

Service was impeccable, our waitress was delightful and incredibly knowledgeable and helped steer us while reviewing the menu.  The owner (or manager?) stopped by our table several times to check on us.  All in all, we felt taken care of and we left with full tummies and a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Sunday brunch ! Great service ! Arrived 12:45 for 1 o'clock reservation and was seated immediately!
Smells great inside with the wide open kitchen! 
Coconut cake dessert was outstanding!"}
{"text":"They have excellent food. It's quite the culinary experience. The reason only four stars is because if it's your first time there he menu can be confusing. And the waiter/bartender who helped us just confused us more and we ended up getting waaaaay more food than we could eat, you live and you learn. 
Not only that but you need to make a reservation for dinner no matter what time day or time you go. We didn't make a reservation on a Tuesday night and we were seriously frowned upon. Felt all judged for having the gall to enter with no ressies."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice and relaxing ambiance . My husband and I started with the iceberg , blue cheese salad . For dinner , I had the salmon and he had the seared sea scallops .  We ordered the pan fried corn and the haricot vert as sides . For desert , we had the pumpkin cheese cake .
Starting  with the salad , the lettuce was not very crisp . My salmon was excellent so were the sides . However  , we thought paying 20 dollars for four pieces of scallops which was my husbands dinner entree was too much and wasn't worth it . The cheese cake was also good ."}
{"text":"I would give two stars for the food and pricing, but the manager of Rooster's bumped it to three stars. 

Though it was not my favorite dining experience, the manager came by personally several times during the meal to check on the taste and experience, as well as delivered part of our order to the table himself. Kudos to this gentleman for caring about his customers, that did not go unnoticed. 

The waitress noticed us taking time to look at the menu and when we presented questions to her she states \"this must be your first time\". Well, yes, but that should have probably been asked upon our seating and her introduction. We gave her the benefit of the doubt but she performed her job in a flustered manner on the evening that we dined. 

For taste, I must say the meal was only mediocre. I had the quarter chicken with a side of green beans (most items are a la carte), my boyfriend had the steak burger. The waitress did not understand our original order and never brought our second side, which was going to be the pan fried corn. Flavor lacked and I found myself wishing there was a sauce to dip the chicken in. Green beans had a watery sauce on them that in the end just watered down the spices that they tried to flavor with. Pricing is higher than what the quality of the meal deserves. But to each their own, you should always try a place at least once. 

To leave you with a positive, the summer drink menu has a pineapple cocktail on it, this you should try, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here for our anniversary. Fantastic. Is it overpriced? Totally. But is it delicious? Oh heck yeah. Don't come here if you're on a low-fat diet. Had the short ribs--- best short ribs I've ever had. Their Mac n cheese is also to die for."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying we went to have a date night and preferred a booth but as we waited at the bar we sat up by the kitchen and decided to eat front row. Not only were we served with grade A hospitality by the hostess the appetizer and entree both came out with  10 minutes of ordering . Quick service and quality food no doubt we will be back to try the roasted duck!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.

The farm to table, family style dining makes for a great night with friends and family.

The sides are always fresh, and the meats are cooked to perfection. My personal favorite is the short rib, but it's all good.

Highly recommend to anyone looking for that fresh home cooked meal."}
{"text":"We can agree or disagree on the food, it a matter of taste. They have a solid diverse menu with variety of options that almost fit everyone. By far the hanger steak and the duck are my to-go on the menu. Also, the cocktails and wine menu is good. Nothing too special, but good. 

That being said, what makes Rooster's special is their top-notch service. PERFECT service. Fast enough, everyone is so friendly, and better, they truly care to give you a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is tip top!
Food was amazing I asked for the best thing on the menu and after choosing 3 of the 10 recommendations, I can't wait to go back. A comfort modern style restaurant with open kitchen concept.  Cocktails are delightful and made w/ custom craftsmanship."}
{"text":"Ok, when we pulled up in the park lot I was thinking \"I sure hope this place is decent\" and I tell you what, the food here is really good. We has pate', duck breast and the short rib with asparagus and grits. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue! Since my last review I have been to Rooster's several times, for a drink and appetizer at the bar and for dinner. And, I have to say the service has improved.

The food continues to not disappoint. I have always been a huge fan of the pizzas, but have recently branched out and tried a few new items. The chicken, of course, is always great, but I have enjoyed the duck, shrimp and flounder specials and most recently the beef carpaccio. Don't forget to ask for bread upon arrival, so fresh and served with an olive oil and balsamic blend, love!

When the weather is nice try to grab a table outside, if not, enjoy the wall of Roosters."}
{"text":"Always consistently awesome! I've worked at nobles a long long time ago and the perfection and passion in their food is still reflected at roosters as well. Some people say it's pricey but you get what you pay for and they use the best of the best ingredients as well as seasonal produce that is amazing. I've never had anything here that wasn't delightful!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here last night for father's day. We stopped in at around 5:30, after I baked in the sun staying in line for Summer Pops at Symphony Park so that I could put our blanket down. It worked out perfectly (in my opinion), so for those who are planning to go to Summer Pops this month, consider putting down blanket and head to dinner. It's inhumane to make any one person to sit out there in the sun for 3 hours. I cannot imagine it to be any fun or at all enjoyable even with bottles of wine. 

Back to Rooster's... it was quite empty when we arrived. I opted to sit at the bar area (because they have bar bites after 4pm daily). The only disadvantage is that bar area seatings are all backless high stools, not the most comfortable but it's not bad. The bartender was also our server, which they may need to reconsider that. The bar is long, and the opening is toward the back away from all the tables. That means the poor lady has to walk AROUND the bar every time she's trying to reach any of her tables. Needless to say, the service eventually got to be a little slow, with other people stepping in to help out. I didn't mind, we weren't in a hurry, but I could see it being a problem for others.

Food was solid. I have always enjoyed the food at Rooster's. We ended up ordering an array of dishes to share. We had 2 things off the bar bites chalkboard: chicken pot pie ($8) & the pork rillettes served on toasts ($6). The pot pie which was super cute in presentation and tasted great. It looked like a treasure box which was made of a nice flaky crust. The pork rillettes was ok... the apple butter was a little overpowering. From the dinner menu I ordered sea scallops ($18), gnocchi ($12) and mussels ($9). 4 sea scallops came in an order, and while it was seared cripsy on top, it was a little over seasoned. I enjoyed it still, especially the pea puree they were served on. Gnocchi was light and fluffy, and cooked in a duck sugo sauce. So if you are not into liver, you probably need to skip this. Mussels were good, about 18 in an order, and came with a big piece of toast to soak up the sauce. We ended the meal with the bourbon cream pudding ($8). We were a little disappointed they're out of the coconut cake... but the pudding was a good alternative. 

Overall it was a great meal. My parents enjoyed it, the open kitchen kept them entertained. It's a nice quiant setting, which I prefer over all the crazy large restaurants in the area. Now if management can figure out the bar area service assignment, I can then relax for the bartender."}
{"text":"All around amazing! Impeccable service, simple menu all done very well. I had the hangar steak seasoned well and cooked perfectly. My family had the half bbq chicken and the duck breast and thoroughly enjoyed. We split the buttered spinach, pan fried corn, and Mac n cheese. YUM! Highly recommend for a special occasion. Extensive wine list as well!"}
{"text":"Date night was a success because I chose Rooster's.

Great attentive service, though the waiter was a little touchy feely. I guess that's how he likes to interact with his customers, touching shoulders and such. Odd, but not odd enough to say anything.

We opted to skip appetizers and went right to the mains. My wife chose the roasted duck breast which she said was excellent. Very moist, very tasty, truly delicious. I chose the half barbecue chicken and it was awesome. Super moist, very tangy, really easy to eat with knife and fork. Yum and a bunch of it went home.

For sides, we chose three veggies to share - roasted beets, Yukon puree (really, mashed potatoes) and steamed spinach. All were great.

No dessert today. I should have saved room for that coconut cake."}
{"text":"I have been here twice- the first time it was great, the second, yeah not so much."}
{"text":"****/** 4.75 stars. Back again with a couple of individuals that had not dined here before. The service was great as usual. Out of the popular pork shoulder again!!  The pork shoulder rocks and they cannot make enough to go around.

Both individuals were very impressed with the food. It is really amazing, just a great dining experience. I have never been here for lunch but the dinners are impressive.

This is a tasting/sampling type menu. If you want big portions you will not like this restaurant. Of course you can always have big portions by ordering lots of little portions. 

The data speaks for the rating. Everyone I have brought here is impressed. We always get treated like royalty.

Roosters is an excellent price/value in the upscale gourmet cusine category. You get what you paid for."}
{"text":"The dressing in the salad was delicious!!! Seriously want to get some to take home to Raleigh. Waiter recommends the chicken wrap. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Food: this place expresses themselves well. Roasted chicken, pulled pork and seafood are on the menu. You can smell the food as soon as you walk in. I started with the onion soup and had a grilled chicken sandwich with caramelized onions. Everything tasted good, but the chicken sandwich was smaller than I would have liked.  While nicely prepared, I'm not sure I'd get the sandwich again. However, the soup was one of the best I've had.

Service: no problems here. Attentive. Polite. 

Atmosphere: open, you can smell the kitchen which is in the middle of the restaurant, busy, maybe a little noisy for a business lunch, but not so loud where it got in the way

$100 after tip for 4 people for lunch"}
{"text":"While the name smacks of some sort of TGI McApplegarden, Rooster's Wood-Fired Kitchen is pleasant oasis in the middle of strip mall hell. This casual, nay, \"relaxed\" restaurant pays attention to detail, both in service and food preparation. Plates are served in tasting portions so this is the perfect place to go alone or with a big group. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner. The decor of the restaurant is really nice-open but with dark wood and cool design. Ordered the BBQ chicken, which was delicious. It was a decent portion with a delectable sauce. Delicious beets and corn as well. Steak is a small cut but very tasty. Go for the poultry, they are kind of known for it. Reminded me a bit of Tom Colicchio's Craft in NYC with the ala carte sharing menu and market menu. Not as pricey, but equal quality. A great place for a date or a group."}
{"text":"Very solid restaurant with a horrible location. Nothing is more uninspiring than a corporate office building, but despite the locale, the food shined. Charcuterie and smoked wings were spot on and the pork shank with bean cassoulet and bacon lardon was great."}
{"text":"Had a friend's birthday dinner here over the weekend.  We had 16 people (so some of the issues could be due to the size...but I doubt that - see below).

We arrived slightly after our reservation time.  We alerted the hostess that we were here for a birthday party - I guess they had three.  We saw the rest of the group in \"the cellar\" which is through the restaurant and through a shopping mall hallway. There's a large bar that runs the length of the room.  We were sat into two - eight person tables.  No major issues. 

We ordered a bottle of wine to share - the waiter opened the bottle (with a little too much force) and some wine went shooting out.  Luckily, it didn't get onto anyone's clothes (it was a Rioja - tempranillo (red)).  However, there was some (not a lot) on the table/plates/etc.  The wine wasn't expensive - or else I would have been a little more upset.

We had snacked earlier at Corkbuzz (see other review) so I got the mussels, and my friends go the spaghetti, the shrimp, and the duck.  When I ordered the spaghetti for my friend, the waiter responded, \"Really?!  um, ok.\" - with an eye roll.  

After a question about how the shrimp was prepared, my other friend ordered the shrimp.  We all received our orders.  $18 for seven shrimp.  No sides...just seven grilled shrimp.  \"Maybe the shrimp were huge shrimp\"....nope, just normal grilled shrimp.

My mussels were good - one unopened, but they were better when I had them at the uptown location a couple weeks prior.  Spagetti was good!  The duck was amazing.

So, meh service, some things of horrible value."}
{"text":"Rooster's SouthPark is easily one of chef Noble's best restaurants. The atmosphere is date night/special night level nice, but at the same time it's not too serious inside. The decor is a bit whimsical if a little lodge-y. The front of house and waitresses/waiters offer some of the best service in the city. There is a variety of seating options. 

To the food: the food here is consistently outstanding. I feel like the kitchen has figured out some secret to offering great service and great food. I highly recommend their sides! Any protein, their pastas, or their pizzas (which are under appreciated I think)."}
{"text":"Took my wife, her sister and our neighbor for Mothers Day. Once again we were met with great food and great service  The fried oyster appetizer came out hot and crispy and succulent. Caesar salad was wonderfulness as always. Just the right size vs a darn entree sized salad when all you want is a side. Pasta of the day with duck confit = yum and same thing for the cauliflower and onion rings. Dessert?  No brainer. Coconut cake or bust. I even got a bite of honey's without suffering any bodily harm. A good night as always."}
