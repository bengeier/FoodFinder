{"text":"No frills wonton place beside No Frills haha, I'm good..  Wontons are a good size, noodles are perfect, broth just right. It is very similar to Jim Chai Kee (though wonton's are a bit smaller). In fact kitchen guy at WT used to work for JCK. Glad he brought it this side of Hwy 7. :)"}
{"text":"Food: Broth is quite mild, but the Wontons are quite delicious full of Shrimp flavor and quite the abundance as well. The Fish Paste was alright with a nice texture but not much flavor. The steam vegetables was a tad bit overcooked to my liking but overall still edible. The egg noodles are pretty standard, not bad but not extraordinary.  Service:  Typical Eat n Go spot, so don't expect much service at all. Bit of a communication issue as the waitress's English was not her forte. Place your order, get your food, go to the counter and pay. Not really much in terms of steps of service."}
{"text":"The exterior of the place seems worn down, but the food is amazing yet affordable. My friends and I ordered the beef brisket noodles and it didn't take long, 1-2 minutes to arrive. The customer service was really good. The beef brisket was cooked really well and the fatty parts are the best! One bowl was 7.65 (around that price range) tax included which is worth it compared to Japanese ramen or McDonald's. This establishment is suitable or high school students or to anyone in general during the cold fall/winter seasons."}
{"text":"Meh. Just your average wonton noodle place. Nothing fancy. Would go back... if I were hungry and in the area, but other than that, not worth making the trek out to this location."}
{"text":"Very tastey food and the price is great! I loved the chili sauce so much I bought a jar for $5! I only wish it was open later for those midnight cravings."}
{"text":"Excellent broth. No MSG. Very good quality wonton (large shrimp inside). I also like their squid balls. I like all their noodles. A bowl of soup noodles with two toppings (eg. 2 pieces of wonton and 3 squid balls) is $5. No frills decor and service. Service is quick. Great for a quick meal. They also have take-out and frozen wontons for sale ($9 for a dozen)."}
{"text":"Very good and quick service. However, not all the waitresses speak english. Pointing at the one you want works too though. Food is very good and comes out quickly. The place becomes packed very quickly, especially on the weekends but the wait time is not long as people are in and out fast. I have been here twice and I have been impressed both times. There isn't a lot of parking space directly in front of the restaurant, but the parking lot of the now closed Future Shop is close and has plenty of space.   I would come back regularly and recommend here for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Almost 7$ for a bowl of wonton noodles..I would expect it to be outstanding but it wasn't. Perhaps the area just lacks decent places in general??"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a quick fix on a simple, hot bowl of wonton noodles. Small and family-run, the atmosphere of Wonton Hut brings back the memories of the restaurants back in China.   We ordered shrimp wontons with noodles, where they gave us four big wontons each. The noodles and wontons were juicy and tender. I wish there were some more noodles though. We also had the yu choy with oyster sauce and that was pretty solid as well.  Just make sure you look at both sides of the menu. Don't mix up \"wontons in soup\" with \"noodles and wonton in soup.\" ---- On the way to Toronto, from Cali."}
{"text":"One of the best wonton noodle restaurants in Toronto. Home made wontons are really good. Service was fast and polite.  Would definately go back!"}
{"text":"Who wants Wonton??? I DOOOO!!!!!   Wonton Hut has always been my go-to when I crave for a bowl of hot authentic wonton noodles.  80% of the time, I would go for the wonton noodles. The egg wrapper is always silky and smooth (that's really important for me) and the shrimp is always \"crunchy and bouncy\". You know sometimes when you can tell that the quality of service fluctuates/ decline? Like when they put in less and less effort to perfection their \"original recipe\". Well I can tell you that the wontons (especially the shrimp) never changed since they first opened. Same size, same quality. (Ok, enough of my affection for their wontons) Moving on to my next faav..   Squid balls: Definitely something different from other squid balls I've tasted. I don't know what it is and what they put to give it such a distinct flavor... Highly recommend this, the squid balls are very chewy and tasty - which I wish I could explain how salivating it is.   I feel that it is very affordable for the price of one bowl of noodles for the genuine service and quality it delivers. The owner is also pretty cool, he rembs to leave out the green onions when I forget to request it.  Hope you like it too!"}
{"text":"Nice authentic bowl of wonton noodles for those looking for only that.  Fish balls, wontons and a couple other toppings are all good. Recommend with good tasty value."}
{"text":"Wonton Hut has become a quasi-regular weekend hangout for me whenever I'm in the mood for some wonton soup.  The product here is consistently good.  The shrimp wontons and cuttlefish balls are large and cooked well, with a nice springiness to the shrimp.  The fish paste balls are appropriately fishy.  The egg noodles are cooked to perfection as well, al dente the way I prefer (if you can apply Italian terms to Chinese cooking).  My only gripe is with the beef brisket, in which case I got a couple of small chunks of actual brisket along with a few thin strips of tendon and other assorted less desirable pieces.  The place is steadily busy during the lunch hour on weekends, but turnover is pretty fast so the wait isn't long.  Service is brisk and business-like, but the owner is very friendly.  The fish tank is purely for decorative purposes - you can't order a live fish and eat it.  Speaking of d√©cor, the bright green walls are kind of kitschy in my opinion, but won't give you a headache.  Prices are reasonable - usually coming out to about $16 or so for two including tax and tip, and I usually get extra toppings and noodles.  The space that Wonton Hut occupies has seen a lot of turnover in years past as no restaurant seems to be able to make it work there.  I'm glad Wonton Hut appears to be reversing that trend, and I hope it's around for a while.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"The best bowl of soup I've ever had! I ordered the wonton noodle soup with two toppings: shrimp wontons and cuttlefish balls. They were huge! the size of golf balls!  The shrimp wontons were fresh, flavourful, and wasn't rubbery. There was at least 2 whole shrimps in each delicious bundle. The cuttlefish balls was like nothing I've ever had before, they were sweet and not at all fishy. They were obviously handmade because of their size and irregular shape. Broth was excellent, although I could do with less msg (was thirsty afterwards), and noodles were thin, firm and plentiful.  Only complaint was you could see the kitchen and the floor was kind of dirty. Service was quick and friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Agree with Jennifer that Wonton Hut is again another similar restaurant with Jim Chai Kee. However, I definitely found some differences in between.  First of all, the services. Nice and friendly. Not the type of service that you would get at Jim Chai Kee, at least, you don't have to go grab a cup of tea by yourself.  The design of the restaurant is mainly green. Wall, Menu, Logos and even the uniform colour. Oh well, I guess it is the generation of green right? It does overall give a fresh and clean feeling to the customers.  Now, the most important part, food! I had the hot & sour pork lo mein and I special requested to have it with wontons. I think it is a special order since it is not on the menu. The Lo Mein is definitely a good one. I LOVE the sauce, unlike other chinese type of hot and sour that you would get elsewhere, but caution, it is REALLY HOT! Wontons are big and very nice too.  Oh and drinks! They have bottled coke and such, which made me debating between that and soya milk!  Overall, a very great experience and definitely will come again!  Hot and Sour Pork Lo Mein, with 3 wontons $6 Soya Milk $1.5"}
{"text":"If I can give 0 stars I would. Brought my service animal (small little dog IN A CAGE) with me and we were flat out refused service. Told the servers repeatedly that the dog is not a pet but a service animal and that I have license and doctor's note. Server replied: doesn't matter what you have, please leave. I then proceeded to tell them that what they are doing is discrimination and against the law and they can be sued. They shooed me away and told me to go ahead and sue them. Never had such bad service and discrimination. I'm close to tears writing this. Please have your staff educated on service animal rights and basic human rights and treat others with some respect and manners. Food is also not as good as it used to be. Broth tasted heavily like soap water. If you value good food and service then you should take your money else where as Wonton hut treats their customers inhumanely and serves them terrible food."}
{"text":"If you tried the real taste from others Chinese wonton restaurant . You will know why it worth 1 star or even lower!   Unbelievable ! the  spicy mince noodle by using spaghetti and ketchup sauce for the spicy mince! Only here!"}
{"text":"This place offers quick service and wonderful wontons and noodles.  The stock was little too light for my taste though.  Staffs are really friendly.  The red pepper paste condiment was not aromatic enough since all I can taste is spiciness.  The cost was reasonable at $6.75 per bowl of wonton noodles.  Still a great place to go if you want a quick bite."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!   They DO NOT CONVERT US MONEY!!!!!! You will pay Canadian price in US dollars!!!! And when asked he said that he didn't convert because of bank fees!!!!"}
{"text":"I was wanting asian comfort food from my childhood but the food wasn't very comforting at all. There were odd textures and funky flavours in this noodle soup (especially in the fish balls). I'm not sure what all the Wonton Hut hype is all about - It wasn't terrible but it wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"GTA has lots of places where you can get decent-to-good HK style wonton noodles.  If a place proclaims itself Wonton Hut or Wonton Anything, the expectation is raised, and this place does not disappoint.    Same concept as the well known Jim Chai Kee,  choose the noodles, choose wet or dry style, choose the toppings which include shrimp wonton, beef, fish, and cuttlefish balls,  and voila, you have a bowl of deliciousness in a short few minutes.    Oh yes, the tea is served!  You don't need to get up and fetch your own tea in a tiny styrofoam cup."}
{"text":"Quick and convenient service. They don't have a big menu, but i find that makes them more efficient. Quality of food is very good for the price, but i normally don't drink the soup because it seems to have a lot of MSG."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Wonton Hut.  We only started coming here about a year ago because we always went to its other competitor.  I haven't actually dine in the restaurant before because we've done take-out only as of yet.  My favourite is the shrimp dumpling it's so chewy and flavourful, the wontons are good in size and I love it because there isn't too much fat in it.  The soup broth is a little on the salty side especially if you order the wontons/dumplings on its own but with noodles it's fine.  The only con I can think of is I wish they would open earlier, especially on the weekend when you want it for breakfast at 9am but have to wait until later."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars.    Similar to Jim Chai  Kee and Wonton Chai Noodle (Mississauga branch of Jim Chai Kee), Wonton Hut is a small restaurant that specializes in wontons.  Shocker right?  Their wontons are nice, plump and have a nice \"crunch\" to them, but I find them kind of small compared to Wonton Chai Noodle.  I came here for lunch one day and wasn't even 1/2 full.  Granted, I eat a lot, but I think the portions are kind of small here.  I would more or less consider this place as a good snack place, but not really a meal type of place."}
{"text":"Wonton hut is one of those places that you go supposedly knowing that it is a specialty place. I went expecting some classic wonton noodle soup food. overall i would say a 3 star seems appropriate as the wonton noodle soup was not exceptional by any means, and the wonton in particular was nothing special to scream at. i think for the price and quality i would've been better off at wonton chai. Overall the place i would not go back or recommend, unless you have major wonton cravings and are in the area, i wouldnt' highly recommend it,. The wontons themselves aren't very juicy or big or fresh, it is just average at best."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, albeit it is not nearly instantaneous as other places, and tasty, Wonton Hut usually hits a spot when you are in need of a quick bite in the neighborhood.   The Wonton are smaller than at Jim Chai Kei, but they tend to be more manageable. The broth lacks the multilayer of complexity that Wonton broth should have. The noodles are totally chewy and springy as it should be."}
{"text":"Having visited 2/3 of the wonton trinity uptown, I set on a journey try the last of the triad. It brings me sadness to report that, albeit satisfactory, Wonton Hut just did not measure up to competitors Jim Chai Kee and Wonton Chai.   I also understand that every wonton seeker has their own preferences, so I will list out the differences and let you judge for yourself:   - Open on Wednesdays, unlike the other two  - More options i.e. fresh soy milk - Wontons are smaller in size compared to the other two, think golf ball instead of tennis ball  - Shrimp itself is less succulent  Try for yourself and get your wont on."}
{"text":"Nice wonton place at warden and highway 7. Small tables, but quick service.    They are fairly pricey for a bowl of noodle and some toppings, but they have good quality food here.  I usually get the braised beef, nice and tender, non fatty pieces and cuttlefish ball, which has a bounce when you chew.    They are known for their chili oil, great aroma and puts the bowl of noodle to another level.   The service is efficient and friendly. The walls are a really bright neon highlighter green, just don't stare at it for too long.  Hahah!"}
{"text":"Very tiny wonton place, so the name is quite apt. It has a cute HK ??? feel so it was quite authentic.  When my fam and I first went, they did our bill very weirdly (taxed everything then totalled) but the owner spoke to the cashier lady and it all got fixed :)  We went for our second visit and after we left, we were just DYING of thirst. We downed so much water that day, we must have went over our weekly recommendation of water.  Too much MSG?? Or ???Regardless, we were thirsty for the whole day afterwards. Hypertension alert.  Prices are a little high but it's not crazy. $8 for a bowl of wonton noodles. I'd come back if the ?? dumplings weren't as salty."}
{"text":"This is a gem. The beef brisket is tender and tasty. The food came quick and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"The only place in greater toronto that serves al dente chinese egg noodles. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I was getting very bored of the other wonton specialty stores.. and came across this one near my area and decided to go and check it out.  I have to say, this place is very decent for the price you pay.  Relatively cheaper than Jim Chai Kee but their noodles and wonton are better than them.  Big wontons are not very authentic, if anyone been to a good wonton place in Hong Kong, you should know the best wonton tends to be smaller and this place's wonton is on the small end which is perfect!!  I would highly recommend this place if you have a sudden cravings for wonton noodles!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few buddies from work and i was delighted there is a wonton place near me.  Cheap, good, filling, yummy fresh wontons.  If you have been you know the deal, nothing special but tasty indeed."}
{"text":"typical cheap untasty canto food."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice little place to eat. Who doesn't like won ton noodles!???!? Their wontons are delicious and I enjoy the noodles and broth. Though I do prefer Lo mein to the noodles in soup. :)  Their lo mein was very good! I had the I've with red sauce, pork, and wonton. It was just the right level of spicy and fairly delicious. The portion sizes here are a little smaller, but honestly, it's kinda just right for my appetite :) and good price and quick, good service."}
{"text":"Delicious though smallish portion. The service is good considering it is a small fast food resto. They are quite polite. A bit on the expensive side compared to what you might get for the same price at another fast food Chinese joint. Menu limited to a few items."}
{"text":"A surprising gem in the No Frills plaza beside McDonalds. Came here for a quick meal and it was not bad! Aside from the neon green walls, this place reminds me of the noodle places in Hong Kong - small tables and you can see the noodle chef in the kitchen.   I had the beef brisket noodles and they were nicely cooked to al dente. The broth had good salty beef flavor and was served nice and hot. However, there were only 2 pieces of brisket with the remainder being bits of tendon and random beef parts. 1 topping noodle = $4.50.  The cuttlefish ball was large and 'bouncy' but doesn't have bits of cuttlefish in it. I tasted some of the rice noodle which was average - the egg noodles are better."}
{"text":"I probably would not have come here had I not seen it mentioned in a recent article online. Wonton Hut is a small place located right next to McDonald's at Warden and Hwy 7 E. Inside and outside, it doesn't seem like anything special but the food must be good to have been mentioned in the article I read.  The menu is very limited, offering a small selection of soups and lo mein noodles. It didn't take us long to order and our food was delivered very quickly. The dishes were simple and had a very homemade comfort food feel and taste to them. It was good but nothing outstanding.  Maybe the comfort food aspect is what most people find attractive about this place. Markham's Mayor, Frank Scarpitti, came in to pick up a takeout order while we were there. He seemed to be a regular visitor. I later discovered another friend was there an hour earlier. Hmmm, this place is more popular than I thought..."}
{"text":"My first time at Wonton Hut, great and friendly services. Ordered the wonton noodles, beef noodles and vegetables. Broth was amazing, and size of wonton was good. You can tell that it's fresh. However, the portion is small, you might want to double up the order of noodles! Overall a great place, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for quick, delicious, and cheap eats! One of our favourite shrimp wonton restaurants! They also have soup noodles, lo mein, beef brisket, fishballs, and hot and sour pork. You can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Update to my review a few years ago.  I notice now the noodles are better and not soft (actually maybe a bit hard but then again I'm so picky).    Great place for quick delicious wonton noodles!  Although not as quick as Jim Chai Kee (it took 3 min for my wonton noodles to arrive, instead of 20 seconds like at Jim Chai Kee).  Also they have more menu selection than Jim Chai Kee, and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Incredible value for money. I am not even halfway through my soup, and I am already full. I got the shrimp wonton with sliced beef.  The broth is great, well-balanced but flavourful, the sliced beef is tender and delicious, and the shrimp wonton are awesome. The texture of the noodle and the filling is really nice, not too soft, and the flavour of the filling is great. I think there is a whole shrimp tucked in each one. Service was very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Today I had lunch here again with my family, though the food still superb but waited a little (10minutes) before we were seated. We both had cuttlefish balls and wonton noodles and a side order of beef briskets and everything was great. Beef brisket especially was so tender today."}
{"text":"I love this place - I'm a regular of this cute little place.  I usually get either the wonton & noodles or the wonton, beef tripe, & noodles.  Both are delicious.  Their wontons are fabulous as the shrimps in there are huge.  Also, their squid balls are ALMOST at par with Hong Kong with the \"elasticity\" - almost and that's good enough for me especially since there is no other place that can do it so far.  Their vegetables with oyster sauce is also a good complement to add on.  The man at the cash register (presumably the owner?) is very pleasant.    Wonton Hut is a busy place so be prepared to wait a bit - but I've never had to wait for too too long.  The turnover is very very quick."}
{"text":"the wonton was nicely made. fresh and was delicious. the rest, you can skip on the noodles.  but the wonton is not bad at all, very close to what you can get in SF or in HK. new restaurant, so the quality is still very good. hopefully they'll keep up the quality. in the mean time, its a good place to get your craving for Wonton Soup"}
{"text":"Speed and wallet friendly are their forte. (Really a 3.5 star) I was craving for wonton lo mein ($6.75) and decided to try this place.   Their egg noodles were chewy and you can dip into the large bowl of soup for the lo mein. It had a few vegetables on the side, hoisin sauce, and 4 shrimp wontons which were smaller than other speciality wonton places I've visited before. Nevertheless, shrimps were fresh! You can literally sit, take order and finish eating within 30 minutes due to the speed of service. It's a quick meal fix at less than $10 (after tax and tips)!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the wontons offered here at Wonton Hut. I felt it's the same traditional wontons I have in Hong Kong and some parts of China. Their wontons are wrapped with fresh shrimp meat and pork, and the size is absolutely what you would get in traditional wonton shops in Hong Kong / China. Their egg noodles are cooked right, not too soft and not too hard. Whenever I feel like going for a traditional bowl of wonton with noodle, I always go here."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's just me, but I think this place sucks compared to their competition..   Reason, why its not getting a 1 star review is because try have good cuttlefish balls.  Came here with a 2 friends who love wontons.  First of all, the wontons, they were small compared to wonton specialty places. Also, the springiness of the shrimp just wasn't enough..  We also had Beef Brisket, meat quality was poor, I'm sure they braised it for long time cuz it was just falling apart, but every time I took a bite, beef would get sick in between my teeth..  The cuttlefish balls was above par. They were giant and tasted good.. Texture was also very springy..  The bowl of noodles was small compared to their competitors!  Overall, my friends and I will never come back here for their wontons but might come back for the octopus balls.."}
{"text":"Holiday lunch, party of 6.  This place specializes in getting people in and out fast. Like most other places this past Family Day weekend it was quite busy, but at least there were tons more parking at the Warden/Hwy7 plaza with No Frills closed than at other places like Pacific Mall (which was near impossible).  The menu was very confusing - the layout is not readily apparent and we discussed back and forth to figure it out, so I'll quick brief explanation: 1) Each page is a style of dish (eg. Soup with noodles and topping, Lo Mein with toppings (no soup), Soup with toppings (no noodles), other assorted things. Decide which style you want. 2) You are charged for the number of toppings you choose in your dish. The toppings are listed at the top of each page (eg. shrimp wonton, beef brisket, etc.) and the prices for the number of toppings is at the bottom of each page.  I recommend the vermicelli. The noodle choices available were vermicelli, rice noodles and egg noodles. The wonton is good!  Note that if you order more types of toppings, the amount of each topping decreases. We noticed for shrimp wonton: 1 topping: 4 wonton 2 topping: 3 wonton 3 topping: 2 wonton  I do recommend this place for a quick bite to eat if you don't feel like eating at the McD's beside it. They do close on some Chinese holidays (eg. Chinese New Year). We had no problems ordering what we wanted in English."}
{"text":"Reminds me of HK :) But perhaps a little cleaner. The service was excellent! The waitress was very friendly and I swear my shrimp wonton noodles soup came within 3 minutes!!   I do think the portion is a tad on the smaller size but the price was alright. I would definitely be back again but perhaps order something else that might be a little more filling. The broth for my bowl was about average.  We asked if they had other choices (yau ja gwai aka direct translation: oily fried ghost ) for food but it was all mostly wonton, beef tendon, cuttlefish/fish balls, etc. w/ noodles."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for wonton.  Have been going to this place for over 2 years, and the quality have always been there. The wonton has been exceptional, with a lot of shrimp and a good mixture of pork to give it just the right taste.  The brisk has a great taste, and the cuttlefish ball is another big reason to visit this place.  The noodle has good texture and just the right portion.  The spicy oil is made in house and is great without being too spicy.  The place is always clean and the servers always put a smile on their face and provides great service!"}
{"text":"I came back to WH today to have a quick hot meal with my mom and boyfriend before school.  My mom ordered the squid ball and traditional dumplings with lo mien.  Best choice of the day.  The traditional dumplings were fresh and tasty, the squid ball was chewy and actually tasted like squid.  My dumpling & noodles was a little depressing.  There were a lot of shells from the shrimp in my dumplings.  Other than that it was pretty good - the small bowl that I ordered had 4 dumplings .. basically stacking up on each other on the bottom & 3 was enough to fill me.  My boyfriend ordered the beef brisket & said it was just okay, good meat to noodle portions.  The negative was the oil vegetable.  The vegetables were obviously old: they were starting to flower and they weren't very crunchy fresh - they were somewhat stringy and sour-tasting.    I'll be back when I forget about the vegetables or when I'm craving WH's dumplings again."}
{"text":"If you need a quick meal or want wonton this might be your spot   Juicy shrimp wontons and OK soup base"}
{"text":"Cheap and quick bites if you're craving some wontons.  I had their wontons and cuttlefish balls with noodles, and I'm a fan of their cuttlefish. They had a nice chew and you can tell that they were made in house."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this place. I was craving wonton soup and I've always seen this place and figured why not give it a try? I decided to get the traditional wonton soup and added steamed Chinese broccoli for take out. Overall the meal seemed ok but a couple hours after eating I was overcome by chills and bad stomach pains. I'm not sure what it could have been specifically but I'm pretty sure I suffered from some form of food poisoning. I don't think I'll ever go back :("}
{"text":"Wonton Hut is another restaurant that has the similar concept of Jim Chai Kee.   The restaurant is nice and clean. The decoration inside are all green.. And I can tell you that green though pleasant to look at but NOT good to take photos in!   The choices are limited to wonton, beef and fishball with rice noodle, egg noodle or vermcelli. The prices are also similar to Jim Chai Kee.   I decided on the rice noodle with wonton and Beef. The wonton tasted fresh with nice texture. However, I am a little disappointed with the beef... it tasted too chewy.. tasted like something that is overprocessed. The noodles are cut into narrow strips but I found that it is much easier to eat.  The size is a little small, but I should have order the veggie with oyster sauce to go with my lunch!  The services is nice and friendly. The chef was a little concern that I were too busy texting and not eating and ended up all my soup was soaked up by the noodles. He sent another bowl of soup for me without asking! :) (OK! I should have eat first before I play!)  Cash only!"}
{"text":"It is an okay wonton noodle place modeled after the legendary Jim Chai Kee.  The wonton tastes good though smaller than Jim's.  I like the noodle here better than Jim's.  The broth is seriously delicious. Portion of noodle can be larger.  I am not sure a regular guy would find the portion sufficient."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Service was excellent. Home made style wonton soup and beef brisket were fantastic. I will go back if I am in neighborhood again."}
{"text":"Wonton Hut is located inside Markham town square plaza (highway 7 and Warden); it's right next to McDonald.  It's a small little place with an open kitchen that you can see right through from the sitting area. Staff were very friendly, service was fast. As soon as you sit down, staff already bring you your hot tea and chopsticks.  I always get my usual, shrimp wonton egg noodle soup. Wontons are full of shrimps, no fillers. Shrimps have nice texture. Chili oil is not very spicy here (the one at Jim chai kee is a lot better)   Overall, fast and friendly service, good wonton noodle soup."}
