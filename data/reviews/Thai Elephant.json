{"text":"I hate Thai food and I'm not a huge fan of curry but this place has changed my mind. Very reasonably priced and always a great option at lunch because they handle the traffic very well. Not only am I back on the Thai bandwagon but my favorite dish is the green curry seafood."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they deliver. Sometimes I'm lazy and want to eat in, but don't feel like pizza. This is the best alternative. The curry is so good!  And I always get the mango sticky rice dessert too!"}
{"text":"Best pad thai I have ever had the chicken is super good white meat tender and the sauce is delish !! The lunch specials also come with eggroll which is nice ! Best thai place I have found"}
{"text":"I have eaten at nearly every Thai place in Tempe and Glendale, this one is the best. The Pad Thai and Masaman Curry are my go to. Portions are large, I usually have leftovers unless I'm being a total glutton. I miss living down the street from it... now I settle for mediocre Thai food in Glendale. Sigh."}
{"text":"I have visited Thai Elephant twice and I an very impressed how friendly the staff is and how good the food and cocktails were! They have a lot of fun drinks to start things out, the fresh rolls are a great appetizer and all the main dishes I have were pretty good. I really liked the chow mein that they made, I know this isn't the type of place you would typically get chow mein but if you do, it's surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I have only been here for several lunches, however I can say without hesitation it is one of the best Thai cuisine spots in this valley, and that includes some heavy competition. Very busy at lunch, but worth it if you have the time. Try the spicy eggplant, incredible!"}
{"text":"There are two Thai places in this plaza. The 5RCha, which is basically all self-serve and fast food, and Thai Elephant, which is sit down with waiter service. As I was getting food with the family, we opted for the sit down place instead.  Despite the two restaurants supposedly not being connected (according to the lady in 5RCha), I thought the menus were pretty similar. Thai Elephant definitely has a bigger one, and their entire restaurant is quite big with very nice decor.  Service was very good when we went, as the restaurant was less than half full. That being said, there was still one mishap with our order as my mom ordered the glass noodle soup and it came out sans glass noodles. It had to be brought back into the kitchen and replaced, but the replacement occurred pretty quickly.  Food was good. I got the Pad Z U (beef), my dad got the yellow curry (chicken), and my mom got the glass noodle soup (shrimp, cup). My mom's order was by far the smallest, but my dad and I got very generous portions and I had leftovers to take home. The only area where they weren't so generous was the tiny bowl of rice my dad got, which may be a dealbreaker for rice lovers out there.  For dessert, we tried their Thairamasu. Warning: It's not really tiramisu. It's a thin layer of cake on top of chocolate-y, coffee-ish ice cream. It was also TINY, but maybe we shouldn't have expected much from a $4-5 dessert? Still, it was a bit disappointing to see.  The price was pretty typical of a Thai restaurant, with all entrees falling between the $10 - $20 range  So why the loss of two stars? In general, while I did enjoy my meal, it wasn't the best Thai food I had ever tasted and even worse, it wasn't even the best in the same area of Tempe. I don't think I'd make the short trek out to Thai Elephant or even recommend it to my friends--not over the 5 R Cha or Thai Rama near ASU at least."}
{"text":"Just finished the dinner there. The place is easy to find. I ordered the shirmp rice as entree which is super yummy...out of  my expectation. And the guy maybe the boss is very nice and friendly. Will do it again soon."}
{"text":"Nice fresh veggies and tofu, curry was fair, kinda watered down. I had corn cakes as an appetizer and they were just fair."}
{"text":"Slow, terrible service for Valentine's day lunch. Standard Thai menu... There are just better places with better food and far better service close by."}
{"text":"Average Thai food, adequate service.  I had the Siamese Basil.  Unfortunately no alcohol is served but the waiter told me they are working on obtaining a license.  A decent atmosphere except for the grating smooth jazz (please something else!)."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the dining in at this restaurant, but I have ordered takeout on multiple occasions and the food is phenomenal. Lots of good flavor balance in the food."}
{"text":"Fast friendly tasty well priced! Large portion sizes and luncheon specials."}
{"text":"I don't know how authentic the food is as \"Thai\" but I've eaten here about 8 times - and it is always great.  So crowded at lunch you have a hard time getting a seat, but usually low key at dinner.  Very fresh tasting, variable heat, lots of tofu dishes."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Excellent service, clean and welcoming. My husband and I love coming here. Everything is so flavorful. Lots of options..all with unique flavors."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want some quick and delicious Thai food. Nothing fancy, but clean and good. Happy hour is great with cheap beers and greasy apps. I will be back a lot."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place one star.  I was walking downtown with some friends and happened to see Thai Elephant (whose Tempe location is fairly good), so I convinced one to go in and split a dish with me.  It costs two dollars to split a plate, which is fine, except they didn't even give us an extra plate and seemed angry that we were sharing (also, didn't seem very college-student friendly in general). The waitress just plopped the dish down and walked away.  There were very few waiters working a packed lunch crowd, and this meant the waitress gave us the check immediately after giving us the food, and then someone else came and took it before I even had time to ask for a box.    I'm not too upset that I didn't get a box; the food was as awful as the service.  We ordered the drunken noodles with tofu, and it came with thin pad-thai noodles instead of the wide rice noodles--seems like they were being lazy in the kitchen.  Save your money and support better restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"I've been thrown out of better places than this.  I just came back from what was a farewell lunch for a co-worker. The food was okay, and as usual at lunch, it was crowded.  However, we were very much surprised when immediately after they collected our check, we were unceremoniously told to leave.  I could understand if we had been sitting there for a while, but that wasn't the case. We still had our drinks to finish, and would have left within a minute or two - it is lunchtime, we all had desks to go back to.  Good thing we were not aiming for a leisurely lunch.  The food is as I said, okay. But not worth the service, and definite not worth waiting for."}
{"text":"My husband and I were meandering about downtown prior to going to the Dodge Theatre and we happened upon Thai Elephant. The interior is small and cozy with a relaxing decor.  We sat down to an extensive menu filled with rice, noodles, soups and curries and we both decided upon curry for the evening. I chose a yellow and my husband chose red. They were BOTH incredibly delicious.  The curries were a perfect mix of salty, spicy, sweet and sour and the texture of the curry was so smooth and velvety. My only complaint is upon asking for spicy we didn't find the dish spicy at all but some red chili flakes took care of that problem.  I had Thai Coffee and my husband had Thai Iced Tea, both of which were very good.  The women's restroom was not only clean but the decor was nice as well.  We will be downtown soon and we will be going to this restaurant! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Although you can find better Thai food elsewhere, Thai Elephant has its moments. On a not-so-busy weekday evening, the location is nice. A loud diner 5 tables down was raving about his meal, and I believe he called a friend to join him late into his meal. That says something.  The best part, however, was the eggplant in my green curry -- amazing. If I go back, I'll order something that highlights Thai Elephant eggplant. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. I really enjoyed the Green Curry (chicken) but I can't say I will order the Brown Sticky Rice with Custard again for dessert."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times now. It has become my go to Thai place in Phoenix. Great portions and very well spiced. The soups are amazing and for the Pad Thai inclined don't think just order. Food separation for Vegetarian is great and I cannot give enough praise for the staff and how friendly they are. I will be back any time I want Thai."}
{"text":"If I could put minus 3 stars I would. My friend and I ordered delivery from Thai Elephant Monday night. The delivery was at our door within the promised time frame and the food was piping hot. The calamari was good, although the sauce was missing, and the spring rolls were ok. The major let down, and I say major because we were almost in hysterics, was the Pad Thai. Maybe we got a new cook, but it was extremely dry, there was no flavour, and a shameful lack of veggies. The menu claimed it contained egg, but I couldn't find any. Neither of us even got a 1/8th of the way through a rather large portion. I will give them props on their portion size. Even though the other foods were ok, I would still mark them low, because a Thai restaurant that can't make Pad Thai is not worth their salt.  We won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a few years but we just had a take out order and the food was pretty terrible. Very sweet, greasy, not a lot of flavour."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it is right around the corner from my house, however what a disappointment. First of all it is NOISY.  Granted, it was 6:30 on a Wednesday but still wished for I little more peace.  Great food could have overcome this obstacle, but my drunken noodles were just OK.  Really not much flavor at all and I asked for medium spice.  My GF had the fire steak which was super sizzle on the hot platter, but so bristly it was virtually inedible.  The sauce was good but since she couldn't chew the meat, it was hard to tell.  I might order out from here in a pinch, but for the food i would go to wild thaiger."}
{"text":"The food is good. I love the pad thai and the Tom Kha soup. The customer service is unreliable though. The last time I dined in they forgot about me and left my food on the counter for 30 minutes. I kept trying to flag people down but they ignored me. I gave it another try because it was busy that day, this time ordering \"to-go\". 55 minutes later I finally had my food in hand, even though they said it would be 20 minutes. The servers and hosts are nice but unfortunately they are so under staffed that they are running around non-stop and forget about you and your food."}
{"text":"I am visiting on business and had Pad Thai and fresh spring rolls delivered to my hotel. I thought overall the food was fresh, had a nice flavor and the service was quick. They said that I should expect the food in 45 min and I actually received it in less than 30. I will try them again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Is it just me or do a lot of restaurants in the central southern AZ area get 5 stars for an abundance of quantity and not quality? There was definitely a lot of pork in my dish but it was tough and flavorless. And usually I can't handle anything close to Thai hot at a Thai restaurant, but the next level down was what I would call a medium spiciness. Also, I like Thai food flavored with fish sauce but I don't think they use it here."}
{"text":"Love the spicy eggplant! Huge quantities for around $10 a plate. And they give you free soup at lunch. Also, the servers are really sweet. Great service.   I love the thai iced tea too."}
{"text":"Not surprisingly, it appears this place has closed down.  Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"What happened Thai Elephant??? You used to be so good! The last few times I've ordered food, I was so disappointed. Tom yum soup and red curry were both too sweet. Glass noodle with chicken and shrimp has two measly shrimps in them, and the flavors that used to make this dish so good just weren't there anymore. The food didn't used to be that way so I'm not sure if there's a new chef working or what, but I'm very hesitant to go back. Looks like it's time to find a new Thai restaurant.  :("}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix and discovered this restaurant when we left another that had a wait that was way too long.  The service here was excellent. The staff very friendly. Food came quickly and hot. Everything was flavorful and we made short work of it. Had the Thai Veggie Rolls, Pad Thai, Roasted Duck and the Pineapple Fried Rice. All three together made more than enough for two people. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"After falling in love with authentic Thai food in San Jose, CA and San Francisco, I spent years sampling Thai restaurants all over AZ.  This one has always held a place in my top three, debatably even number one when it comes specifically to their Green Curry and Pad Z U.  Relatively mild spice levels compared to many Thai restaurants, for those wondering."}
{"text":"Great Tom Kha, Red curry and chicken satay! So many choices! Masaman was very good too. I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Phad Thai has almost no flavor. Many other great good priced Thai restaurants in Toronto, not reason to come back here."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up food on a business trip. Chicken Thai Salad and Green Curry. Food was ready fast. Delicious and very high quality. Generous portions. Would be back!"}
{"text":"Catered a songwriter camp with 9 dinners, all of which were devoured, with great compliments. Sampled the Ruby Chicken curry which I found to be excellent.  Only drawback was the rice we ordered: we split it between plain and coconut and got 7 orders of coconut rice.   Appreciated the 20% of on take out, which they honored.  Woud recommend this place those in the city. Decor seemed nice and staff was Thai. Would consider dining in."}
{"text":"food's great, service during lunch could be a bit quicker."}
{"text":"I have their drunken fried rice with chicken once a week.  Fantastic food.  Tasty & healthy food and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"We had the veggie spring rolls, coconut soup, massaman chicken rice and khao soi chicken noodle. The veggie spring rolls were good! They were fresh and hot. The coconut soup was pretty good - we ordered a medium and there was a good amount of coconut broth along with some chicken and mushrooms. My massaman chicken was a big portion and I liked the spices and peanut flavor. My partner had the khao soi chicken - it was very sweet so it is good if you like food like that, personally I liked the massaman better!"}
{"text":"Fast, tasty and fresh - consistently the best Thai in Toronto I've come across in a long time. The delivery is always quick and friendly, and the spicy beef salad is superb."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here and I REALLY regret it. I should have walked over to Pai or even Khao San Road. To call what I just ate a \"Pad See Ew\" is a disgrace to Thai food. In no way, shape or form did it resemble a pad see ew from the noodle to the sauce. Ordered a Tom Yum as well and it wasn't terrible, but there was absolutely no spice to it. I'm kind of a Yelp snob so I always read all the reviews before I order, and this one really, really had me fooled. With Pai and Khao San Road just ten minutes away by car/ public transportation, I truly do not understand why anyone would choose to go to Thai Elephant."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. The time window was surprisingly broad at 10-35 minutes, but the food was ready in about ~30 on a Tuesday (so totally reasonable; just give them a call and they'll give you a more specific time). We had the Thai sausage appetizer, Siamese Basil with Chicken, and Thai BBQ chicken. The sausage was interesting and spicy and quite unlike anything I've had. The dish inexplicably came with roasted peanuts and ginger. The taste was great but the ginger and peanuts didn't make any sense. This dish might be better served as lettuce wraps or with some thought behind it rather than as a plate of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. The BBQ chicken was three decently sized thin chicken breasts and Rice. I wish it had included some green veggies (other than the leaf lettuce garnish) but fortunately we shared the dishes and I got my veggie fix from the Siamese Basil dish. We ordered both dishes with Medium spice, which added a comfortable but flavorful heat and there were plenty of fresh and diverse veggies in the Basil dish. Overall, this is on the better end of the Thai takeout I've had and we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"The shrimp wasn't fresh, waitress then agreed to replace the nasty shrimp With chicken satay and then never brought it out. She said \" you might send it back also\" never even telling us she wasn't going to bring it after she said she would. Waitress was very rude and food was not worth the price. Tom yum soup bowl was half full with only pork and mushrooms for $10!?! Very unreasonable, DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"I'm a picky thai food eater.  Call me crazy, but I think my pad thai should come ketchup free.  While I have my favourite thai restaurant in Toronto on lock down (see my review of Sukkothai), I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a little lazy.  I mean, when you're in the mood for some basil fried rice you're not really coming from the gym.  So I need somethiing close to home to satisfy my cravings.  Thai Elephant does so in spades. The food is fast, delicious, and massive.  I always order too much and I'm so full when I finish my plate I have to roll myself home (luckily the pitch is slightly downhill).  My food recommendations: basil fried rice and the beef salad (far more beef than salad)."}
{"text":"Food is great but the place gets super busy at lunch. Get there early and keep your group small."}
{"text":"The worst experience in my life. I went in yesterday with my daughter. And I ordered yellow curry and pat Thai. I asked my waiter. For no tofu on my pat Thai. The order comes  and there's nothing but tofu on my pat Thai. I said okay fine they can replace it . I tell my waiter . I asked for no tofu. And she started raising her voice calming that all orders came with tofu. And I told her I asked for no tofu. And she was very aggressive. At one point she said she was going to call the police on us... one of the worst experiences in my life. And apparently it was the owner of thy establishment."}
{"text":"New Thai near the University - woohoo!! Thai Elephant is a neat little place that just opened on the south side of University just a few blocks from Mill. The menu's huge, and includes several reasonably priced lunch specials. Shared a seafood dish, which was pretty good, but what really stood out was the tofu. Fried so firm and delicious, I wanted more, more, more!! I'll be back to try their other dishes - Thai Elephant definitely has the potential for more stars."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch time, the food was decent, we ordered chicken basil, Siam pork chop and fried calamari.  However, the service was horrible.  I didn't realized that they close at 3 as we stopped by 2:15, but comes 2:30 and our server was nowhere to be found, except when she dropped off the check almost as soon as the food arrived at the table.  She made no attempt to refill our glasses with water, not even once. The food was brought out by kitchen staff and she made no attempt to ask if everything was good or whether we needed anything else. I had to get up and find a different server to ask for water and to-go boxes.  I will not return as there are many other Thai cuisine restaurants in the area with much better service."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time this evening. They forgot a portion of my order and charged a dollar more per item. When I called I was advised that their menu has changed and their website has not been updated. I was then offered a credit for the next time, rather than offering to deliver the missing item.  The food was less than sub par. I found it greasy and extremely salty. Clearly, I declined their offer of a credit as I will not be ordering from Thai Elephant again."}
{"text":"Thai so good it made me want to thank Yelp and add a profile! Searched yelp for the best Thai in downtown Toronto and it came up. Thanks! I was very impressed with my experience at Thai Elephant. Here's why:  1. Its in my hood, (Bellwood) which I like to support 2. It was insanely fast delivery - 20min to my door! 3. It wad piping hot, great authentic taste and good value  I will definitely order again and recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Thai food connoisseur or anything, but Thai Elephant definitely hit the spot. I got the drunken noodles with chicken -- MILD, based on a handful of the reviews here -- and it was excellent. Not too spicy, but still with a little kick to remind you you're eating Thai. The flavor was great and the lunch portion was perfect. The veggie roll you get with the special isn't anything to write home about, but that's okay. Not that important, but the mints you get here are those awesome melt-in-your-mouth chalky mints you always get at weddings. I made sure to snag a small handful of them.  The restaurant itself is very clean and you can definitely tell you're in Tempe, because all I saw working there were college-aged kids, mainly women. They were all pretty friendly and the transaction was brisk.   Prices were definitely reasonable for a working lunch. My only (sort of) negative is that the parking is weird. There's no lot facing University, so you have to pull into a side-street and into a back lot that took a little tiny bit of snooping to find. Not huge deal, though."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food I have ever eaten and service was fantastic! I had the Pineapple shrimp curry and my friend had the duck madness and everything was super flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. Wish we had one in Colorado."}
{"text":"Mixed bag for me! Personally prefer taking out to dining in here. Food's OK, but service - very unpredictable, sometimes slow and they keep the place too warm, especially in the summer.  Wouldn't be my first choice!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had good service and the food had a lot of flavor. The portions sizes were quite generous. I had the pineapple curry with beef and it was very satisfying. My partner had the curry pad Thai and was also very pleased. I shall be back soon."}
{"text":"It has a cozy dining area that was easily able to seat our party of five. I'm no Thai expert, and the food was decent, but it was unremarkable. I had the beef pad thai (it was a toss-up between that and the green curry) which was greasier than I had anticipated. The service was friendly enough, but not very proactive on the beverage front."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  However, the food is ruined thanks to the lack of efficiency from the service itself.  About 30 minutes for drinks, never checked on for meal, neighbors got main dish before apps.  3 servers for whole restaurant.  Terrible."}
{"text":"You know those rainy nights when you're too lazy to cook and you want to stay in and not think about your early morning workout?  That's when you call Thai Elephant.  I've ordered from here a few times and the food is always consistently good. The menu is pretty regular takeout-Thai fare, but the portions are sizable and their delivery is quick.  The person on the phone is polite and always happy to switch the soda for a couple of extra spring rolls.  The estimated delivery was 40 mins, but they usually make  it in 15. I'd recommend the Curry Pad Thai over the regular dish, and the Red Curry is tasty. The Mango Salad was fresh and quite delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible service. Those five words sum it up for me. We arrived with high expectations for this restaurant after reading some of the great reviews. The restaurant was filled to capacity when we arrived. We could tell right away that they were under-staffed as no one came to greet us. I happen to see our reserved table so we promptly sat down. I also grab some menus for us to look at because the waiters seem preoccupied with the other guests. The waiter eventually found his way to our table and we gave him our order.  I started off with the house salad. This salad was worse than airplane food salad. I could not believe what I was eating. The salad leaves were warm like they have been sitting in the kitchen since this afternoon.   I got my entree which was tofu with fried rice. This fried rice was soo salty and oily. I took a few bites and I could not eat anymore. This is not Thai food as I have come to know it. I ended up eating some of my companion's entree which was green curry chicken because mine was too disgusting. The problem with this restaurant is that the 'chefs' are Mexicans. They don't know Thai food from fast food.   The waiter never came by to ask us how we were 'enjoying' the food. To top it off, by the time we were eating our food, half of the restaurant were empty but none of the dirty dishes on the tables got cleared away. It was nasty to sit there eating and looking at all of these empty tables with their half-eaten food and dirty dishes.   I would have had a better time and better food at a fast food joint like Chipotle than at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first Thai food experience and I have to admit that it was pretty tasty! I was expecting the typical small, cramped Chinese-like restaurant where they're mean to you and you feel scared for even asking for a fork. But this place was so nice on the inside, green decor, nice paintings on the wall, pretty lights everywhere. I'd even go there on a date. I ordered the most Thai dish there, Pai Tei, and I really enjoyed. Never had tofo before and I ate it all up. My friends had different dishes like yellow curry and from what I gathered everyone was satisfied. What impressed me the most was the food kept for like 2 days afterward and when I reheated it, still delish!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, speedy service, and generous portion sizes. Everything I would expect from a great Thai restaurant. I wish they would have made my food about 5x spicier. Ordered the thai spicy and was a little disappointed. But it was an amateur mistake. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"went here for my birthday since we had heard it was very good and Thai is my all time favorite food. very disappointing. The iced tea was like water and the water was awful. The table was grimy. The calamari had a thick crunchy coating- reminding me of frozen clams from tv dinners when I was kid. ( we love fried calamari when very light and you can actually taste the calamari.) Green papaya salad one of my favs was bland and only had 2 shrimp which were dry and tasteless. The entrees were better... We had Pad Thai which would have been great except it had that boiled rubbery tasteless shrimp in it. We also ordered green curry with tofu and veggies. It was sweet and spicy which I love, but the sauce was sooo thick. We both had belly aches and felt overstuffed, which never happens to me with Thai, even when I eat too much. We still do not feel that great the next morning.  On the positive, the wait staff was attentive and the service was fast, although there were only 3 tables of customers. Too bad.... still hunting for the best Thai in the Valley. So far I love Wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"rice, especially their glass noodles are so good. they are one of the best thai food with no disappointment. they even have potato instead of a vegetable you don't prefer."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is the best Thai food I've had in AZ!  The food is delicious and I'll drive down from Scottsdale just to eat  here.  There are many  closer thai restaurants to me than Thai Elephant but none compare.  I usually get the pad thai, green curry, change up the 3rd dish and a thai iced tea.  I have never been dissapointed.  The prices are reasonable, the service is fine and the only thing I would change would be to make the thai iced teas bigger, the're not small but La's thai and Thai house in scottsdale give you bigger glasses.  If you're looking for good thai, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say anything about the food but after an hour of waiting we still hasn't got our meal. Due to having a meeting we had to leave. There was no apology. Definitely a cultural difference with that."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional Thai food at a very reasonable price. The mango salad is great as well as the Tom Yum soup. Oodles of noodles is a great dish."}
{"text":"Looks like a cute location, but ordering fried rice and receiving burnt rice is never attractive.   There's better thai food options in Toronto! This place is a real disappointment."}
{"text":"I like spicy. I mean I like to sweat from the bridge of my nose when I eat. When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. \"Isn't green curry spicy by definition?\" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve. I get the sense that this problem is rampant in Arizona; hope to find a solution soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I drive by this place daily and thought we would give it a whirl. The service was excellent (our waitress was extremely attentive and we never had to wait for service). The atmosphere was ethnic contemporary, with lots of dark woods, comfortable seating, and very hip, casual music.  We went around 6pm on a Monday, and it wasn't crowded at all. They have happy hour specials from 5-7pm, so we ordered a couple of Singhas for $3 each, along with the fried sweet potatoes, shrimp, and vegetable egg rolls at half price--all delicious. I would say the sauces could be more varied; they were plum sauce varieties and mainly sweet.   To follow the appetizer specials, we shared a drunken noodle dish at medium spicy, which is just enough tang for a mild tongue. The wide noodles, Thai basil and light sauce (also a hint sweet) were nicely balanced with the mix of veggies.  We topped it off with the only dessert we hadn't seen before: the Triangle Roti, a platter of freshly fried sliced puff pastry with a light sweet spirit and sprig of mint. This reminded us of sopapillas, except lighter in texture.  Overall, we had a great meal. I might opt to order a broader variety of tastes, e.g., fewer fried and more savory ... but we were novice eaters at this place and will surely return."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago, I ordered #88, which is their Thai fried rice with vegetables and added chicken with a request for their spiciest level of heat.  It was amazingly phenomenal.  I was working for a few hours and could only take a couple bites at a time, and when I finished it several hours later, the last room-temperature bite was just as good as the first freshly-made hot bite.  That's a great test of absolutely excellently-flavored and well-prepared food.  Today, I made the huge mistake of ordering what turned out to be extremely disappointing fried rice with vegetables and chicken at a closer Thai place instead of making the drive to Tempe.  That will not happen again."}
{"text":"Great food, Friendly service, Reasonably priced what more can you as for. The staff is nice, graceful. The lightening and decor is relaxing and the food is Great. I like the drunken noodles and Pad Thai noodles. I have been there 10 times or more. I say it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good. But went there recently and my food came out cold / Luke warm. Lost a star and we look elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"It's hours later and I'm still having bad feelings and indigestion because I was served a plate of duck that looked and I am ashamed to say that I know it tasted like leftovers. My duck came under a piece of cut skin with no fat lining. Under the skin that may have been duck skin were bits a pieces of dry old duck meat. It really looked like some leftover. Parts were so old and hard that I couldn't eat them. I felt too embarrassed to say anything to the waitress who seemed uncomfortable with too much English. I can't believe that I ate half my serving before it was totally clear that I was fed scraps. Maybe from someone else's plate. Two servers helped me and they served my two appetizers then before I was even 1/4 of the way done, they brought the old duck scraps on spinach. I wish I hadn't been so polite because now I am having flashbacks that make me even more afraid that I are someone's else's leftover duck. The spring rolls were very good but the peanut sauce was dull. The calamari was great. Overall I feel trauma over the expensive duck entree that looked and tasted like garbage."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was REALLY good Thai food! As usual, I will always base my experience on my go-to dish: Pad Thai. This place did not miss! It was very tasty and fresh and the service was excellent. The prices are acceptable, but they do have some lunch specials that we happened to just miss during our visit. The portions are large and again, the flavors were excellent. Both myself and my wife enjoyed ourselves and will return soon."}
{"text":"We ordered pineapple fried rice and another dish (can't remember).  Overall pleased with the quality and portion vs. price. This place has more selection than most other thai restaurants in Phoenix.   If you are in the neighborhood, this is worth trying."}
{"text":"Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is my favorite place to get thai in Tempe. Expect your standard thai classics with a few twists here and there. There's also a full bar with signature cocktails, try to pomegranate martini, its amazing! I usually go with Elephant Broccoli, which can be prepared with chicken, beef or tofu. Spring rolls and tempura vegetables are awesome as well.   Service has never been a problem for me, and we usually go during dinner time. Servers are always precise and prompt. Prices are fair and the quality is excellent. Desserts are tasty, try the coconut ice cream is there's any left."}
{"text":"We love this place.  If we're going to Tempe and have time for dinner we'll stop here.  The chicken dishes here are better than any other Thai place we've found yet."}
{"text":"I have been hitting the Thai Scene in Az for a while now, and was really surprised to find that the Thai Elephant, which is a place I love Downtown, has  a Tempe location so close to my home.  I just went out for my first test run of the place, and found it even better than the downtown location!  The staff was over the top, my waiter Alex was beyond belief. They made it feel like I was visiting an old relatives place for dinner, instead of a restaurant.   I got the same thing I get almost every day Downtown, Pad Zu with beef, and it didn't let me down. I also tried some cocktails for happy hour, and really enjoyed the Ginger Binger (A rum based drink with muddled ginger and ginger beer) And the Basil Lemongrass Mojjito. Since the downtown location doesn't have a full bar, it was nice to experiment with some Thai cocktails.  Overall I would say I have found my new Thai place for dinner, and would recommend this place for anyone who feels like having a great sit down experience."}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times over the past couple of months and they are consistently excellent.  Their service is good and the food is very scrumptious.  Our favorite is the Pad Thai and we must have a Thai iced-tea when we visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a plate that was \"thai hot\".....it was hot.  Not bad but nothing special.  Will probably go back but will not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"worst food ever tasted by our family seemed like it was nooked in the microwave stuck to the plastic like a pile of crap.worst pad thai ...i would never recommend this place to friends or family nastytasting too.even our husky turned it down ouch yuck...my daughter eats pad thai and she would not even take a dam bite and it stunk like old food..."}
{"text":"Contrary to popular belief among students of the ASU downtown campus, Phoenix really does have a lot of superb eateries - you just have to know where to look. And for those people like me who are often wary about venturing downtown for some grub, Thai Elephant is a great find.  Don't let the tiny venue fool you. What Thai Elephant lacks in size - and parking - they make up for with an extensive menu (and a really hot midday server). My favorite part is how patrons get to select their dish's spiciness, an added bonus for picky eaters.   During a recent lunch visit I opted for the Drunken Noodles with chicken, mild spiced. The delicious dish of Thai thin rice noodles sautéed with garlic sauce, yellow onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, basil and bean sprouts was the perfect size. I found the mild spice to be a little too weak for my liking, but a previous visit to Thai Elephant determined that my taste buds can't quite handle their hot seasonings. The veggies were fresh and not overrun with sauce. The chicken, though appetizing, was in short supply however.   I still left the eatery full and satisfied, especially with the bill. Lunch items are a decent $7 to$9, and dinner doesn't get any higher than $16 a plate. Throw in a drink and tip, and dinner can easily be under $20 a person.   And speaking of drinks, Thai Elephant has a delicious assortment of hot and iced teas, my favorite by far being the Thai Iced Tea.  The service is prompt and friendly, but on busier days (especially at lunch), they can sometimes be slower. That's when I choose to get my meal to-go."}
{"text":"We eat lunch here at least once a week. Excellent food and service. Best bets: Elephant Garlic Chicken, Chicken Pad Thai (hot!) and Green Papaya Salad. Thai barbecue chicken is also very good."}
{"text":"Awesome food, I would rate the taste of food as better than Thai basil. Staffs over weekend are not friendly. And I don't prefer this place for A-la-carte but best for the weekday lunch combos."}
{"text":"I had my second meal out with a guy I just met here tonight. I arrived first, and picked a high top table in the back. I got there just before 7, and the waitress was nice enough to inform me that if I could still get happy hour prices if I placed my order quickly.. So I ordered an appetizer of veggie rolls, and a drink for myself.  When my date arrived,  he ordered yellow curry with chicken and I got the ruby curry fish. I ordered mine hot. The fish was light and flaky, the sauce was appropriately spicy and complex, and the vegetables were a good compliment to the rest of the dish.  For desert we split a thai coconut sticky rice with mango. It was good, but if I return I want to try it with custard instead of the mango.  Overall I was pleased with my meal and the service. I live a half hour away and it was worth the drive for a date, but I don't think I'd make a trip just to eat here."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from the Bay Area, I had ignorantly thought that there wouldn't be any decent ethnic, especially asian ethnic, food. Thankfully, I am completely wrong! Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu, freshly made food, and nice atmosphere. An added plus to the Tempe location was that they allowed us to bring our small pooch to the patio area where we dined. We did have the corn cakes, which were ok. I don't remember them being bad or great...but my husband likes corn a lot, and I think he enjoyed them more than me. The green papaya salad was as close  in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of Thailand as I'd expect around here. We also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty. It was a while ago, so I can't remember the entrees we got. I probably got the pad thai...just to try it, and some kind of meat dish. I definitely don't remember anything being awful...and although it might not have been exceptional food, it was enjoyable. Thai ice tea was yummy, and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me, although he thought it was really sweet and quite good. I do remember that for 2 people, what we ordered was a huge amount of food that we had no chance of finishing, and yet the final bill was quite reasonable.   We weren't able to order any dessert, but I did notice that they had the sticky rice w/ mango on the menu. It probably wasn't in season anyways, but I will definitely be ordering that at some point. This will definitely be one of our go to thai places."}
{"text":"We had to grab a quick dinner before a Sarah Mclachlan concert at the Comerica theater, and decided to walk into here. We had recently eaten at the Tempe location and thought it had been decent, and so were comfortable eating here.   The place was crazy busy! I don't know if it was because the people loved the restaurant so much, or if it was because Sarah Mclachlan was about to play live, but every table was filled!. However, in spite of a new customer walking in every 3 minutes, there was hardly any wait for a table and no line forming due to the quick turnover. Even though the serving staff looked incredibly stressed out and understaffed, they managed to remain polite, and really tried to get to you in a timely manner. We did witness the table next to us get served the wrong meat (pork instead of beef?) in her dish, and even though it took about 10 seconds for the waitress to understand there had been a mistake, she whisked it away without any argument, and delivered a fresh plate with beef 5 minutes later. I thought that was nice, although the customer still seemed disgruntled.  We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls, which were indeed lightly fried as described in the menu. There were bite sized, light, crunchy, tasty and somehow not greasy. I usually hate fried egg rolls, but I enjoyed these.   Next we had the crazy beef salad. What we got seemed more like a korean dish than a thai dish...but that made me like it even more. The beef almost tasted like a kalbi marinade and was gathered to one side while a bed of fresh red lettuce was roughly chopped on the other side. There was a fish saucy dressing served on the side, which I didn't even really use, because I love eating the marinated beef with fresh lettuce korean style. So even though it didn't seem like authentic thai dish to me at all, it was a winner for me.   Our entree was the elephant garlic style stir fry with chicken. It was a tasty light black bean sauce heavily flavored with garlic, with lots of veggies. Since I'm married, I don't care what my breath smells like anymore, so I thought it was great! But I would think twice about eating that dish around someone you're trying to impress.  For drinks, I had the unsweetened Thai iced tea for the first time, and it was really quite good! Just a hint of sweetness with the Thai tea flavor. Being lactose intolerant, I really didn't want to risk the standard iced tea loaded with condensed milk. This was really a refreshing, healthier alternative. My husband really likes the limeade there...I can't comment on it though because I hate the stuff in general.  All in all, I like it there...both Tempe and Phoenix locations. I do want to comment that I tend to avoid curry and noodle dishes as I'm typically disappointed with them at most Thai restaurants, so I can't comment on those...yet."}
{"text":"More like the bland elephant...   A takeout joint, dont bother eating there if you do. Service is fairly poor."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery tonight.  The green curry and panang curry were very watery, the chicken was dry and tasteless.  I'd skip this place unless your desperate..."}
{"text":"I like spicy food and they have good happy hour specials.  The service and atmosphere is very relaxing too.  The noodles are the best thing."}
{"text":"This is a big place with a bar and a patio which stands out from the many other Thai places. It's a place targeting ASU students so I didn't expect too much.   The menu is pretty interesting, unlike \"just another Thai place\". I had the chicken satay and crazy beef salad. I think it's too much protein because the crazy beef salad came with lots of beef and a few leaves of roman lettuce. I really liked the crazy beef salad the flavor was great. I think adding a green papaya salad would have been great."}
{"text":"The husband and I came here in want of spicy broth for the illnesses we were suffering from. We were happy to be served a cup of soup for each of us that warmed our souls and opened our sinal passageways. Restaurant was warm and cozy, service was fair."}
{"text":"I just gave this place their second chance and they completely blew it. A disgrace. I order the drunken fried rice. It was tasteless and simply the worst fried rice I ever had. And the dinner portion is much less than the lunch portion at any thai restaurant I have been to.   The first time I went there I got the pad thai and it was just as awful: tasteless and simply the worst pad thai I ever had.   If you are a fan of thai fried rice, pad thai, or just want to have a filling meal, stay away from this place. It's horrendous."}
{"text":"Place is solid for Thai food. Typically we go for lunch with coworkers.  If it is packed, it may take a while to get the check.  Food is good and flavorful. I love the soups, they are a no brainer."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED at lunch, so they must be doing something right.  But it's definitely not the Pad Thai.  They sat me immediately, and took my order fairly quickly, but then it was over a half hour before I got my entree.  The Pad Thai was edible, but seriously lacking in flavor.  I asked for it medium spicy, but there was no heat whatsoever.  Just a bland, almost maple-syrup flavor.  I would have asked for some hot sauce, but between delivery of the food and the bill, nobody checked on me.  Guess I can't complain too much, however, as it was relatively cheap.  (But isn't most Thai food?)."}
{"text":"Very good service, amazing food.  Dinner entree includes jasmine rice for 9.95 for chicken or tofu.    I had the Siamese Thai with fried Tofu.  This is enough for almost 2 people!!  It's over one lb of entree and 1 cup of rice..  Amazing service would highly recommend ."}
{"text":"This place is really nice.   The restaurant is located on University. It's a little too far away for ASU students to get to by walking, which is a shame as I would have eaten there all the time as a student if it were closer! The restaurant is decorated in a subdued, sleek and modern way and doesn't scream \"typical Thai restaurant.\" The furniture is dark and glossy and there are tasteful art pieces on the walls of mostly nature scenes.  We were seated immediately around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday night. The waitress came by to take our drink orders and I got a Thai iced tea. It came a few minutes later and was huge! The tea was strong, cold and delicious. We came during happy hour which was kind of unusual for me to see in a Thai place, but I definitely would have ordered something off the appetizer menu if I weren't trying to be healthy (most of the appetizers appeared to be fried). Maybe next time!  I ordered the rad nar, a noodle dish that has chicken, a whole bunch of vegetables (broccoli, carrots, onions, cabbage and some other stuff) and a light brown gravy type of sauce. It cost $9.95 or so. The dish was very generous in size and overflowing with vegetables and chicken. The veggies were fresh and crisp, not overdone at all, and the chicken was moist, all white meat cut into uniform slices. There was a subtle spiciness due to my ordering it at a medium level of heat, but nothing overpowering. The noodles were plentiful and wonderfully flavored, but there was a lot of gravy so they were kind of hidden. As in, so much gravy you couldn't even see them, and the gravy was perilously close to sloshing right over the edge of my plate onto the table. No big deal, I just pushed the extra gravy around so I could get to the noodles.   My friend ordered the papaya salad. It was also a generous portion and she asked for it with tofu instead of shrimp, which the kitchen happily did. There were lots of chunks of semi-firm tofu. The salad was crunchy, brightly flavored and a good enough size that my friend shared it with her boyfriend and both were satisfied.  More than half of my dish was left so I asked for a box. The waitress kindly boxed it up for me at the table. I had the leftovers today for lunch and it was another full meal's worth of food, plus the noodles had absorbed all that extra gravy overnight so it was even tastier today than it was yesterday.  All in all it was a good experience and I will gladly go back. Service was fast and pleasant, the restaurant is clean and sleek looking, and the food was awesome. The rad nar was the best I have ever had and the dishes were reasonably priced as well. My favorite Thai place is still Swaddee because, well, it's closer and they have really affordable dinner specials (maybe something Thai Elephant should try? I'm sure it would appeal to all the nearby cash strapped college kids) , but if I am ever in the area of Thai Elephant I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Good place for Thai.  The drunken noodles were pretty good.   My wife had Thai basil with brown rice and it had really good flavor.  Nice cold beer made it all better.  The fried shrimp appetizer was delicious. Will definitely go back.  The only drawback was a \"too cool for school\" college kid who didn't understand he was in a restaurant where others might like to hear their own conversation instead of his.  But can't fault the restaurant for that."}
{"text":"I recently when to Thai Elephant after the original restaurant I was headed to with my boyfriend and his mom was closed. We came here based on yelp reviews alone, and that can be risky since the boy and I are vegan and was just trying to find a place to eat  using my phone. I am very glad I found this place with the yelp.com iphone app!   The restaurant was nice and clean and  we were seated immediately. The waitress was so sweet and very helpful.  We first asked the waitress if the veggie rolls were vegan and she said yes so we ordered them as an appetizer. When she came back to take the rest of our order she asked if everything else needed to be vegan and we said yes so she wrote \"VEGAN NO OYSTER SAUCE\" huge across the top of the bill. The fact that she even asked us, and made sure to make it clear that we wanted our food vegan is very impressive.  We ended up ordering the pineapple fried rice, and the imperial veggie, and something else I can't remember, and all were super delicious!    Thai Elephant has good food, great prices (1/2 off happy hour appetizers!), and great service. Next time I'm in AZ I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Terrific service and very welcoming atmosphere. Ordered tiger on fire. Sooooo good. Can't wait to go there again when in the area!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because of Hooked App 25% discount for entire bill. When ordering I showed the discount coupon to the waiter. When the check arrived, it was not included the discount. I showed the waitress again & she acknowledged it. Again, the discount was not included and she ignored the coupon. I was frustrated but I need to leave to deal with this matter. The food was okay, average Thai food, but the service by the waitress was disappointing."}
{"text":"Somewhat of a mixed bag. Our party of 4 was seated immediately (it was slow), on a Sunday night. We ordered Thai iced teas, and browsed the menu. The teas took rather a long time, given that it was a slow night. The service overall was polite but very slow.   Our main courses all were served over the span of about 10 or 12 minutes - that is, the first dish arrived, then 2-3 minutes later, another dish, another pause, then another... It made those of us who did not have their meal yet feel all the hungrier.  I had the Ginger Heaven, spiced 4 on a scale of 1-5. It was tasty and I enjoyed my meal - though I didn't feel it was exactly 4/5's of the way to maximum spice. My son enjoyed his dish as well, which was a basil and chicken entree. I can't recall the exact name.  The curry was another story. The rest of our party had red curry with tofu and yellow curry with chicken, at 3 and 2 stars of spiciness, respectively.  Both curries were very bland, and too sweet. Neither person finished their dish, nor did they want to. Not a trace of heat in either dish, and I was surprised that the curry was simply not very flavorful. In fact, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between the yellow and the red curry... they both tasted about the same.  I doubt I'll go again anytime soon, but if you do go, I recommend staying away from the curry dishes."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Seafood Hot Pot (\"po thak\") amd the steamed lemon fish  5 stars for the.decor and cleaniliness   5 stars for the service"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place with some very authentic Thai items mixed in with some more Americanized dishes for the less adventurous. The menu is big and can be a bit daunting. Service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating even though we stayed well past close."}
{"text":"Hubby and I work nearby, so we decided to come here for our anniversary lunch.  Arrived about 11:40 am, restaurant was somewhat busy, but still a handful of empty tables.  Placed our order. And waited and waited, looking around and noticed 2 tables arrived after us already got their food and half way done, and we were still waiting for ours.  Finally asked one of the wait staff about our order, he said it was coming.  Another 5 minutes, another table served.  We were informed that our food was coming, so I said just pack it to go, cuz I've got to get back to work.  Seriously, it was 12:22 pm.    I told the person up front when I went to pay about the wait, she said oh because the stir fry takes longer to make.  We ordered off of the lunch menu it wasn't like we asked for anything special.  I don't know about anyone else, but I got an hour for lunch and I can't wait 30 minutes to get the food after ordering.  Eating my anniversary lunch at my desk, thanks Thai Elephant for the super long wait for a Thai food staple.  Btw, I've had better pad thai."}
{"text":"Visiting for a couple weeks and stumbled across Thai Elephant. I highly recommend it. Amazing food and extremely friendly service....I will be back!"}
{"text":"Was here on business and the hotel recommended this place. No idea why. Indifferent service. Food bordering on inedible: fresh rolls consisted of shredded lettuce and a couple of carrot straws. Thai sausage burnt to a crisp. Chicken red curry that was so sickly sweet that it bordered on pancake syrup-- and good luck finding the chicken. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered Tom Yum, Pad Thai and fried rice. I left over more than half of them. I think their taste is similar to Thai Basil, so terrible. I live right at ASU but I'd rather drive to Yupha's to enjoy my favorite basil seafood eggplant and their special fried rice, or crab fried rice at Thai Rama.   The service was pretty good though. 2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Some items are great. Some are definitely not.  Service is sometimes great. Service is sometimes definitely not.  Their lunch special is a great deal, assuming you order 'correctly'.  You get a small cup of brothy soup, a veggie spring roll, and your entree for $7.99-$9.99 (depending on your protein component).  I recommend the Pad Thai, yellow curry, and anything with noodles.  I recommend you not get the red or green curry if you like something that has flavor.  Their 1-5 spice level is pretty tame."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. A nice tamarind flavour to the pad thai, which could have used a little more kick and perhaps some fresh bean sprouts, green onions and lime. Came with an imperial roll that I could have passed on. Good portion sizes. If I come back I'll be checking out the curry section of he menu."}
{"text":"Other than their sub par pd thai, everything else is outstanding. Make sure you try their green curry or their pad ka prao (might be misspelled apologies). Even their thai iced tea is awesome. This is now the only thai restaurant I go to."}
{"text":"Fast, hot delivery of excellent food.  Will be ordering again. We really liked the sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant Bistro is a place I have had dinner at several times in the last couple of years when I have been passing through Phoenix. My favorite dish is the Mango Tango Fish (tilapia) which I always order when I am eating there. I have also ordered the papaya salad and Thai sausage. Both good. Most recently I was there in late January. Except for an occasional server I have  always felt that the service was rushed, lackluster and impersonal. It certainly does not reflect the quality of the food. Even the beer is sometimes cold, sometimes not so much. OK place at best."}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times now. I came in for about the 4th time yesterday. I have to say that every time that I come in ,it is always good. Really good. Clean inside as well as nice ladies room. The lunch is very fast and even comes with a soup and a spring roll. The soup is basically just broth. But, it nice. I got the Yellow Curry this time with Chicken. Really good, I would order it again and again. The other times I have been in has been for Lunch and once for Dinner. Again, always good. You just might have to search out a parking spot if you come at a busy time.But, it is worth it.  4 times always good food and good service , this is a place worth visiting."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly waitress . Food taste is good. Not truly authentic Thai food , most of American Thai taste . Overall good. My chicken satay is great but one skews the meat probably frozen too long ."}
{"text":"I passed by this place several times but never walked in because I usually eat before I head downtown. As most people in Phoenix know, it can be challenging to find an open restaurant  in downtown Phoenix at times. However, one day, I had decided to give it a shot since it was one of the few restaurants open on a Sunday afternoon. The simple fact that it was open on a Sunday afternoon when other surrounding restaurants were closed, is a definite plus!! I frequent Thai restaurants in many cities across the country and Arizona is one of those places that struggles in quality. However, this place is actually quite good in comparison to many of the top Thai restaurants in larger cities. Plus, its price is just right if not a bargain considering the portion they provide. They're able to achieve just the right  taste for their standard fare (pad thai, pad see-eiw, satay, etc.) as well as their pan-asian fare (vermicelli soups, curry, etc.). The service was also very good with attentive, smiling wait staff. I will definitely be back and want to try more of their specials as well as more of their pan-asian items. They are now my downtown weekend spot since the food is great, items are reasonably priced, wait staff is friendly and attentive, and place is actually open! Please keep up the great work Thai Elephant!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and I was happy with the out come. Not only Fast delivery and but good delivery guy as well. We ordered 1.the Drunken Fried rice with Egg this was great. 2. The Green Curry with chicken with potatoes added was perfect. We had medium spice- but could have gone with hot. 3. Calamari- this is where it went down hill. Not fresh calamari and it was over cooked. Will give another try, but in person.   All in all, not unhappy with the experience at all. It was good and will definitely go again when I have that Thai cravings :)"}
{"text":"Very yummmy:) We ordered from the lunch menu about 1pm in the afternoon, it was busy so we waited for our table..not long, maybe about 5mins. If we were a smaller party we probably wouldve been seated sooner, alot of seats for 2-4 groups.It is very nice and cozy inside, they were very welcoming and attentive. Our waitress was great and very hospitable. The food and drinks came out very fast, they sure know how to keep up with the hustle and bustle of the downtown lunch rush, so i recommend this place if your in a hurry!  The lunch plate is enough for 1-2 people, 5 of us shared 3 plates and left pretty satisfied. They bring out miso soup with water to start, always my favorite.   Overall pretty good! The thai tea is always best in the summer!"}
{"text":"One of the best thai options in Tempe, with good food and hefty portions. As a plus, they're nice enough to vegetarianize or veganize most dishes upon request. However, on the many times I've gotten food or takeout here, I'm not sure those who took my order (or those in the kitchen) knew the difference between the two."}
{"text":"I've been back to Thai Elephant two times since my first review, and I love this place even more! Part of my glee has to do with parking (twice in 2 weeks I got a metered spot across the street WITH TIME still left on the meter), but the food is also very very good."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is one of those restaurants that you must visit if you appreciate good Thai food at moderate prices. The green curry is very well prepared, spicy enough and with that distinctive coconut flavor that your taste buds crave.  Portions are generous, and they even come with a side of brown rice (which is a nice thing because on many restaurants they would charge you extra for the rice). Server was very nice, and recommended some dishes, but I would say that anything you order would be good in here (the Khao Soi looked very good too... maybe I'll order it next time!)"}
{"text":"Solid food. Service can get slow during lunch. On the rotation. Panang chicken is solid as is the massaman curry."}
{"text":"The Cashew Chicken is huge and very delicious! It had an enormous amount of chicken (a bit skimpy on the veggies) and came with excellent brown rice. We shared a large mushroom coconut soup and a cup of ginger tea. We were full for just over $30! Excellent on a cold winter evening!"}
{"text":"Very tasty lunch choice in Tempe! I got tired of eating at Thai Basil during college so my friend took me to his fav Thai place - Thai Elephant.   The wait staff is very sweet and knowledgeable of the food if you have any questions. They get crazy busy during the lunch rush, but make sure that you are seated and have your meal on time. Also, the serving sizes are huge so you'll have leftovers for a late afternoon snack if you can't finish your meal like me! :D   The lunch specials come with soup and a spring roll, both of which are delicious.  My favorite lunch special here is the Siamese Basil. The chicken is so soft and so flavorful at mild spicy. It goes with the white rice very well. I wish I had a picture but I was so hungry that I devoured it before I could think about clicking any photos. If it's your first time here, please give this entree a try, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Good food and service but the beeping was extremely distracting. The staff wasn't sure how to stop it and told me the owner wanted it because that's what indicates the camera was on. It really impacted my experience."}
{"text":"Order delivery today from Thai Elephant without had every trying it and was thoroughly impressed! Very delicious. Just got the Panang with chicken & sweet and sour chicken, both unbelievably good. My cousin is from Thailand and makes obviously the best Thai food, so normally I'm disappointed when I get Thai in the states from different restaurants, but not this place! Honestly, they have high quality, authentic Thai food, made exactly how it should be. I will definitely be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"The food here RULES  I've been here three times and it's fresh and delicious. Great portions, great taste. Basil fried rice, green curry, cashew tofu/chicken, pad thai, and mango salad are all amazing."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food - downtown.  This place is really great if you need your thai food fix.  I always get the Siamese Basil (rice, meat, veggies, in a sweet basil sauce).  Fiance either gets the yellow curry or the pad thai.  Both are very good.  Each dish comes with a spring roll as well.    They will be packed for lunch and completely empty for dinner so plan accordingly but really good thai food."}
{"text":"Worst catering service!!! they were late for 45 minutes and the delivery person look at me like I'm just a delivery guy. I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai Elephant! I moved away from Tempe a few years ago and the only thing I miss is Thai Elephant.  Their lunch special is great (entree + Tom Yum soup + egg roll).  I absolutely love the Tom Yum soup and they have the best Pad Thai I've ever had.  The service could be better, but honestly, its just that they're SO busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I have never eaten in, but gotten to go many times.. I live downtown and this has become one of my favorite spots to get food at! Their lunch specials are a great deal! i have been to Thailand, and this is as close to the real thing as you can get! make sure to get it spicy!! (or if you are daring, the \"Thai Spicy\", it's much better!)"}
{"text":"Family and I enjoyed lunch here ! We were greeted promptly and seated. Ordered curry and drunken noodles, and dessert fried banana ,chocolate coconut sticky rice with mango was brought out on accident ! The waitress said its on the house .. The food was flavorful and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was good.  We went as a family of 4 (2 Adults and 2 Kids).  The restaurant charged gratuity (18%) citing that there were kids in the group.  This is quiet unusual and I haven't had this kind of experience anywhere.  I wasn't very happy about it.  Will never visit the restaurant again.  Anyone planning to visit make sure you read all the rules of this restaurant."}
{"text":"When my partner and I first moved to Tempe, we went on a legitimate hunt for the best Thai food. Over a period of several weeks, we strategically visited every Thai food restaurant in the area, extending as far west as Phoenix, as far east as Mesa, as far north as North Scottsdale, and as far south as Chandler.  She and I lucked out, because our final pick for Top Spot was an easy winner not 10 minutes away from where we lived in North Tempe: Thai Elephant.  We loved Thai Elephant for every part of the experience we could expect from eating there. Very nice interior ambiance, very polite staff, extensive menu with tons of delicious options, very fair prices, fast service, and easy take-out options.  Thai Elephant has been my go-to Thai food restaurant for more than a year now and I've never grown weary of it. I've also never tired of their Chicken Panang Curry! Wow. THE best I've had. So creamy and consistently delicious.  Portion sizes are more than adequate, too. We got in the habit of ordering two dinner portions of the Chicken Panang Curry because we knew it would last us a total of four meals (two for each of us). Even the rice is usually done right here.  If you haven't been to Thai Elephant, you'll find it veritably surrounded by other Thai food restaurants (there are multiple within a 1/2-mile of Thai Elephant), but don't be distracted! Go to Thai Elephant and enjoy some of the best Thai food you've ever eaten!  Thank you, Thai Elephant, for providing such delicious food at such fair prices, for always being so polite and enthusiastic to serve. I'll see you again VERY soon. (Can't help it: I'm addicted to your Panang Curry...)     ;)"}
{"text":"Ok so I have always bragged how I loved Siamese cat all over yelp. Since they were closed today and I saw so many people on yelp claiming this placed was better, I decided to try it. I can only compare the one meal but so far I am perplexed what people are tasting. I got the satay. It's chicken satay compared to Siamese cat Mu Satay (Pork). The cucumber dressing at Elephant did not have one cucumber in it. It had some carrots and onions but not one piece of cucumber. The peanut sauce was not bad but not half as good as Siamese. I got the beef Panang which I was sorely disappointed in. It was way too sweet. I actually gave it away. At Siamese it has a very earthy flavor more than a sweet flavor. The Kafir lime leaf is very pronounced at Siamese which I love. Now, the people who ordered with me loved their meals so perhaps if they all go someday I'll try a noodle dish and compare that but for now. I'm staying loyal to Siamese Cat."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try a different Thai restaurant other than Thai Basil in the Tempe area....so was driving around and stumbled upon Thai Elephant. It's a fairly large space, good for groups.   I placed a To-Go order and it was ready on time. I ordered pad thai and a drunken noodle version (forgot what they call it). Portions were fairly large and I had leftovers which is rare.   I asked for extra spicy and they delivered on that! I didn't even have to use the extra chili sauce. The to-go packaging was good and included plastic silverware."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Thai food places. Fast service, friendly & attentive.  Good food! You can eat family style. The place isn't very big, so get there early. They do turn tables quickly."}
{"text":"Great place for vegan and vegetarian options. Most of the dishes here can be customized including soups (which we didn't try) generous portions and deliciously authentic."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this place.  The curries are always very good.  The service is a bit lacking, but it's some good eatin' at a decent price."}
{"text":"The pumpkin red curry was a meal to remember. The heavenly ginger dish was also quite good. Service was fast and polite."}
{"text":"3 stars only because the food is good but the service is horrible. The last few times we've been there, we've walked in and waited by the door for some time before someone came over to seat us. After being seated, we've had to wait for quite a while to get our drinks and order. As far as the food goes - their Thai tea is really good as is the cashew chicken, pad thai, & panang curry. If you're going in to eat, just be aware that it will be a while until you get your food!"}
{"text":"Ordered Traditional Pad Thai: this is ketchup and canned pasta. Really not good, or remotely genuine at all. Do not recommend this at all."}
{"text":"This place never gets it right with the spice. I almost always get the drunken noodles, and started choosing the pork option after a waiter's suggestion. I have gotten a level 5 Thai Hot spicy many times, although my mother reminded me that I was sweating throughout our last dinner there together so I opted for a 4 on this visit. I could see flakes of red chilis, but couldn't taste much spice at all. My mother, who got no spice, and my father, who got a 2, reported no discernible differences in their dishes. I was disappointed but still really enjoyed everything. it's not often you'll get me to eat chunks of carrots.   Crab rangoons are impossible to screw up. The sweet & sour sauce with these ones has an interesting vinegar taste to it. The chicken satay was dry and didn't have much flavor apart from the thick-textured peanut sauce accompanying it.   The four of us ordered Sapporos. Mine was the only one that continued to bubble and maintain a head, and as a result, tasted flat. Leads me to believe their cleanliness standards behind the bar are less than desirable."}
{"text":"Decent Thai place for lunch in downtown Phoenix. Yellow curry chicken was very good, and a friend, who eats there regularly, had good things to say about the Pad Thai. Not the best Thai I've ever had, but decent nonetheless.  My \"Medium\" wasn't really that spicy, and my friend said the \"spicy\" wasn't all that spicy either."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this Thai place after reading all the great reviews.... but I gotta say the food wasn't that great. I've been to numerous Thai restaurants and this place mid pack at best. Additionally, I told my server that I really wanted something NOT spicy and specifically ordered a mild dish. Well the fact that that there were numerous red pepper flakes on my food was a huge disappointment!  The Good: Friendly, fast service. The Bad: Mediocre food, not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Thai Elephant. My wife and I love Thai food, especially a good Pad Thai dish. However, the places in Gilbert (where we live) and nearby Chandler leave a lot to be desired. Tempe has a much better selection, but its too far to drive. So when we are in the area and get a chance, we like to visit a new Thai place.   Thai Elephant was the random selection this time, and boy was it a good one. We did take out this time and both got Pad Thai. Her's was not spicy, mine was requested at Medium. Orders were quick and accurate, reasonably priced, and most importantly tasted great.   Thai Elephant is officially my favorite valley Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Never had a dish I did not like.  Staff is friendly and efficient.  Cost is ok."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were optimistic about this restaurant. However, the food had absolutely no flavor and it didn't matter if we ordered what was qualified as spicy or \"regular\". Even the white rice was extremely over cooked and mushy. The Thai iced tea tasted like artificial vanilla extract and was unpalatable. The green tea ice cream looked like old, brown guacamole and was inedible. Maybe we are spoiled coming from the bay area where we have really good and flavorful Thai food, but this meal was an absolute disaster. I'm so bummed we spent $75 on this meal.."}
{"text":"I was so sad to find out that Tipp's 88 Thai restaurant at Dorsey and University was closed, so my quest for a new Thai place was on. I found this place through Yelp (like most restaurants), and was happy with my results. I'm also out to sample the massamun curry (cinnamon and clove-based curry with potatoes and onions) at each Thai restaurant in the area. Their's is by far the best I've had (as of yet). So rich and delicious with just the right amount of spices that you want."}
{"text":"Placed an order through Grub Hub.  We ordered 3 items, chicken pad thai, shrimp pad thai and seafood pad thai. Grub Hub delivered right on time but I was very disappointed in the meal.  I have had pad thai in a variety of restaurants and I did not care for this one.  I feel I paid too much for the quality of the meal.  I would not be able to recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"shrimp\" soup. There were 4 shrimp in the large soup and the dealbreaker: sugar. Sigh and #fail! My kid ordered the green curry chicken. Way better. Less sugar. But sugar was \"not listed\" as an ingredient in the soup so why can't they leave it out? Really detest discernible added sugar in a non dessert meal.  Below are the promised ingredients: Shrimp base, lemongrass, galangal, lime leaves, mushroom, lemon juice, chili.   As it was takeout, I added juice of one whole lemon plus one green Thai chili pepper. Better now. Still, would not order again. Kids green curry ok."}
{"text":"- decent place for a thai hit in a pinch. - had their panang curry, coconut soup, and mango salad, and i am looking forward to eating it again for lunch tomorrow. (i dig leftovers) - FYI - 20% off for takeout :)"}
{"text":"I am very picky about my thai food thanks to years of working in a Thai restaurant.  I have eaten the authentic stuff, the \"Canadianized\" stuff, the stuff that is actually Chinese food, the MSG filled stuff, the heart-burning stuff, and the stuff that is served to you mild even though you ask for it spicy because you don't look like you could handle it as spicy as you ask for.  Due to all these things, I am very skeptical of any Thai restaurant I come across that I haven't heard anything about.  Seeing how I am in a foriegn city, that pretty much sums up all of them.      I was starving after another afternoon exploring businesses around the Light Rail stops when I decided to head back to my hotel to find a bite to eat.  I got off a stop early at \"Downtown\" a block away from Adam's street and decided to take a stroll hoping to find a hidden gem.  I found the Thai Elephant, a small restaurant and the only one open on this part of Adam's street past 2:30pm.  I glanced their menu briefly outside, hesitated, weighed my options, thought of a possible MSG induced coma afterwards, and decided to take my chances.      The restaurant itself is small but clean with red napkins and optional chopsticks as well as a tv in the corner.  I am not usually a fan of tvs in restaurants, however I have really come to appreciate them as I dined alone all week!  Even if it was playing ESPN.  I sat down and browsed the menu and decided to go with Pad Thai. extra spicy, with chicken (usually a large portion for a very good price) and a Singha.  The Singha was brought quickly and was perfect after a hot hot hot afternoon of wandering around.         The Pad Thai arrived quickly enough and I was thrilled to see loads of chicken and tofu amongst a decent sized portion of glass noddles, all gleeming with red sauce and chilis all over them with a bright toss of cilantro on top.  I opted for the optional chopsticks and dove right in.  To my pleasure and surprise, they delivered the dish spicy just as I had asked.  The sauce was nicely balanced, not too sweet or overwhelming, and each bite of delicious noodles was complimented with egg, tofu or chicken.  I ate about half the dish and got the rest to go.  Total bill: 15.05 plus tip.      I walked back to my hotel and waited for the MSG coma to hit.  Thankfully, I can say that I am pretty sure they don't use any as I didn't swell, get heartburn, feel the need to pass out or consume a dangerous amount of liquids.        If I am in the Phoenix area again I will be stopping in on this place!"}
{"text":"Decent. that's all. I ordered delivery for my two go tos, pad Thai and drunken noodles, and I wasn't terribly impressed."}
{"text":"I come here often, as it is close to my home. The hours posted on Yelp are incorrect for weekends. The only thing that I enjoy eating here is there soup and noodles.   Their desserts which I have tried, are absolutely terrible. The only dessert worth having is the coconut ice cream. Their fish dishes with assorted seafood has some really crappy seafood in it. The scallops as well as the crab or lobster (I don't really know which one it is), are the only seafood that are worth having. The shrimp tastes like I got it out of a bulk bag and its been frozen for a long time. AKA not fresh. I cannot speak on behalf of beef because I have not had any of the beef dishes. The chicken is good, but none of the meats or fish are top quality.  However I enjoy their food, don't get me wrong. I like their food for a last minute idea if I don't have anything planned and really just don't want to cook something for myself. Other than that I don't really view this place is an exciting place to take a date or a person to display the Thai food examples of Tempe. But if you're not trying to impress anyone, and you just want some food, this place has good food for your dollar.  My favorite part about this place is that you can call in an order and you can pick it up, I think I've only sat down at this restaurant once. It is not that they don't have a good restaurant atmosphere, actually quite the opposite I think the atmosphere is really nice. But like I said before, I only use this place as my last minute decision I don't feel like cooking for myself and I would like some good food."}
{"text":"Service was meh and food was worse. We started off with spring rolls and crab puffs. Spring rolls were decent but the crab puffs weren't good at all- the wonton was soft and super oily. Our entrees included orange chicken, pad z u (pad see ew), and yellow curry. The orange chicken was WAY too sweet, the pad z u noodles were mushy (think soft enough for a baby), and the yellow curry sauce was oddly thick which just gave it a weird texture and made me wonder if it had flour or some other thickening agent which is totally not necessary if you know how to make curry. Everything across the board lacked major flavor. Ever had a flavorless curry? I didn't think it was possible till I ate here. Portion sizes were huge but I'd rather be served half the food and have it taste good than to have leftovers of stuff I don't even want to take home. I love Thai food but this place was a bust in too many ways. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Though I do give the nod to Thai Hut over Thai Elephant, Thai Elephant does have a wider selection of dishes, and they can customize the amount of spice you like to take it from bland to lip scolding! I prefer somewhere in the middle myself.  I've sampled many of the dishes here with the Elephant Garlic w/Tofu being my favorite. The Heaven Ginger is also good with Tofu.   The interior design is okay, but it is pretty small inside and has many tables and chairs crammed into the box-shaped seating area. No Feng Shui here!   Staff are friendly, but I find it ironic that the cooks are generally Mexicans, not Thai. Are Mexicans allowed to cook and work at a Thai restaurant? Of course! But perhaps it would be better to have sort of a mix - not have ALL the cooks Mexicans, and ALL the wait and front desk staff Thai."}
{"text":"Located at a convenient location relevant to where I am, I decided to give this place a go with friends today and while the service was excellent, I felt that one of the two items I ordered on their menu should be revisited.  I ordered the lemongrass soup with chicken and asked for it extra spicy. This was the highlight of my visit. It was extremely flavourful - had a tangy, spicy and very soft sweet touch to it. The chicken breast pieces were huge and they had button mushrooms which were very perfectly done!  The traditional pad thai, however, was a big disappointment :( I ordered it with chicken and asked for it extra spicy. It was not spicy at all but that was ok as I asked for spicy chilli oil and was promptly given the jar for it. It needed more salt for sure and less sugar! I had to pour salt on it to balance the insane sweetness of the tamarind sauce. I know it is supposed to be sweet (I am a huge thai fan) but that was dessert level sweet. Gave me a headache.  It also had too many peanuts on the side and it just took away from the whole flavour of the dish.  I was comparing their pad thai to Si Lom's Pad Thai and I have to say Si Lom wins there."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai Downtown. Great service and authentic Curries and noodle dishes. The lunch crowd is business like, the event night crowd is 20-40 ish.   The Drunken noodle or the yellow curries are the best bets."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery.  Order was 100% correct.  Food was wonderful, hot, and thoughtfully packaged.  Pad Thai with shrimp and tofu; chicken satay."}
{"text":"My favorite thai restaurant we went during happy hour where the apps are 3.75 we ordered the sweet potato fries which were really good. I ordered the elephant garlic tofu and it was amazing. My wife ordered the curry fish and.it was excellent.  We wished we ordered dessert the thai Rama  ma su play on the word tiramisu sounded good.Will def go back"}
{"text":"The food was great when it finally arrived after my friend had had her meal for quite awhile.  The service was just wacky.  While sitting there I gathered it's mostly a takeout food place because packages were going out the door at a steady pace, yet if you dine in prepare to wait and have your meals arrive randomly at different times.  God forbid if you show up with like 6 or 8 people. Just start eating, don't wait for the others food to arrive.  Like I said though, the actual food was really good"}
{"text":"While the customer service was ok, the place was noisy when I first walked in with other customers talking really loudly.  THAT was really annoying coming from someone from New York!  The presentation of the take-out food was certainly NOT appealing! It was greasy, and had everything but the kitchen sink mixed in with my fried rice! Definitely was not tasty.  I do NOT recommend this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant used to be one of my go-to take out places (their Massaman curry is really delicious), however, this time I chose to order the Panang curry and unfortunately what I received was absolutely terrible!! It must have been 4 cups of pure oil - no sauce at all! I tried to mix it in, thinking perhaps the sauce separated but it was a lost cause. I had to throw the whole thing out. Really disappointed, not sure I will ever order from there again if this is deemed acceptable to give to customers!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars because the quality of their food is actually very good -- that should be stated straight away. Good food.   My issue with this place, however, is the portions. I came here last week for lunch with some coworkers and ordered the Chicken Panang Curry, which was delicious as previously indicated. However, when the small dish containing my curry was set down before me, I was worried, not only because the dish itself was small, but because I knew immediately that the amount of chicken in the dish would be even smaller. Most of the space in the dish was filled with vegetables, and while the green beens in the dish were great, I was just wishing that there was a bit more chicken to be had.  The small-portioned-curry problem is a chronic one with Thai lunch places in my experience, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it lying down, and I won't give 4 stars where I don't think they're due -- give me more chicken, I say!!   All in all, I'd probably come back. My coworkers all ordered different versions of the Pad Thai, which appeared to be much more generously portioned...perhaps I should just rethink my order. I love curry so much, though! Oh well, maybe next time I'll try to find a curry that isn't so vegetable-rich. Live and learn, I guess!"}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I didn't think I'd receive very good service by the looks of this place when I first got here on a lunch break. It was super packed and I knew I needed to eat pretty fast since I needed to get back to work asap. I was greeted and sat immediately, and ordered the yellow curry lunch special. They serve a complimentary soup (tom yum) for all meals I guess, since I got one.. but the entree came out ridiculously fast. It was running on fast-food time, but the food tasted like it took a while.. quite tasty! It hit all of the curry flavors of spicy and sweet very nicely. The price was decent and I even had delicious leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Great food! I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before going to the movies on Mill and I'm so happy I did. The food was great, the portion size was good as well. My waitress was very attentive and pleasant. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If I had reviewed Thai Elephant a few months ago, this place would have received 4 stars for sure.   Why did they lose a star? - They had great discounts for delivery (10%) and pick up (20%), but they REMOVED the delivery discount and reduced the pick up discount. - Their delivery used to be super fast, I live about three blocks away (I know, I know, I'm lazy) and it used to be delivered in under 30 minutes most of the time. The last two times, it's taken an hour and an HOUR AND A HALF. (This was after they gave me an ETA of 45 minutes both times).  Still, their food is tasty, their vegetarian selection is vast, and their standard steamed rice is purple rice which is a really nice touch for me. (You still pay extra, but I'd much rather pay extra for purple rice than white rice).  That said, there is nothing major to differentiate them between their competitor on the strip (Friendly Thai)."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery to our hotel room at the suggestion of the front desk staff. The order was delivered straight to our room in a timely manner. Everything was hot and as we ordered it. Even though it was delivered it was extremely well packed and everything was hot that was meant to be hot and the drinks were nice and cold. The quality of the food was excellent. The seafood was fresh tasting and well prepared and the spiciness was just right. We ordered it mild and I can't imagine what very hot would taste like. I'd drive an hour to pick up. It was great."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a couple of times and I would say this is the best Thai restaurant in Chandler.   Great food,  good staff and decently priced.  Your dish cannot go wrong whether it is rice,  noodles or curry..!  You will not be disappointed.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to meet friends at and have a pleasant dinner/lunch. The food is phenomenal and the staff is very friendly. They also have a pretty good cocktail menu."}
{"text":"Tried a new appetizer that elevated this place. The chicken satay is crazy good. Four skewers of perfectly cooked chicken breast with grill marks dipped in their peanut sauce and served with more of the sauce on the side. A unique white oil sauce that was slightly sweet was also included all for $6.95. The chicken fried rice remains top notch as well and using some sticky rice in the dish is unique."}
{"text":"Who would have thunk that a decent Thai restaurant flowers in the middle of the Arizona desert. Walking by this place the day before, I noticed how crowded it was, even though it was at the tail end of the lunch hour. So the next day, I arrived at 11:40, thinking that I had beat out the lunch crowd. Not so. In fact 3 or 4 groups marched into an already near filled restaurant as I approached. Fortunately since I was dining solo, it took 2 minutes to seat me. Lunch was served with a complimentary broth with a hint of coconut which was satisfying. I bench marked the food by ordering the seafood pad thai spicy. It was very good, although I thought it could have used a little more nam pla to kick up the fishiness a bit. Not everyone would agree with that.  There were a decent amount of fish (not overcooked!) , scallops, shrimp and squid. And the spiciness index was moderate and not debilitating. The noodles came with a small veggie spring roll that was a small version of a chinese takeout egg roll: hard and dry and forgetable.  In spite of that, it hit the spot and deserves a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Praise be to Amber W.   I was a thai food beginner, then she introduced yuphas. That was my whole world--then she told me about thai elephant. My belief after eating at yuphas was that fried rice could be executed no more skillfully than yupha her(him?)self did it. But thai elephant has kicked it up yet another notch.   I get the drunken fried rice, add egg, which includes typical fried rice but adds jalapeno and probably something else I'm forgetting. It delivers a savory and delectable punch that leaves me reeling with delight. By the time I get back to work, I feel a sensation that only the most brain-nullifying postcoital stupor could deliver.   Now I have had a crappy day but that feeling gnawing at my insides is a longing, a *desperation* for thai elephant and the thrills that that only drunken fried rice can impart. Drunken, indeed, for I am in love."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place! I love their curries, specially the red curry. I am a frequent visitor and have tried vegetarian plus the meat options.  They have lots of options on the menu and all dishes come with a choice of tofu/chicken/beef/pork/seafood.   My first vote goes to Red/Green/Yellow/Panang curries. The veggies are awesome, and consistency of the curries is just right..not too thick, not too watery...and sooooo yummy!   These are some of my second-favorites: Spicy eggplant,  Thai BBQ chicken,  Imperial veggies, Hawaiian Lover,  Thai elephant fried rice,  Drunken fried rice, Pineapple fried rice, Madness duck, Ruby curry fish  I will keep adding to the list as I try more dishes :)   The prices are affordable, portions are generous, and the place is not super classy but pretty neat and clean. Whenever I crave for thai food, Thai elephant is my first and last choice. I stopped going to other thai places in Tempe after discovering this one. Love it!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out."}
{"text":"service - great, fast, nice and consistent. split our check, no prob, knew answers to questions about what goes in their sauces without having to go to the kitchen and ask, and high tailed it when we realized we had to rush out the door to make our show time. also had our table reserved (really, with a sign and everything) and ready to go when we walked in at our reservation time. (take that, wild thaiger)  location - right in the heart of downtown. walking distance to phx symphony hall (which was why we chose it as our pre-show dining spot) and nestled among the businesses so i'm sure is hopping come noon.  ambiance - intimate and on the casual side but with nice touches like dark wood accents. i would have preferred the flat screen in the corner playing news be off, along with the volume (it was dinner time, after all, not a rushed business lunch) and some music instead, but it was only a mild annoyance.  food - i loved my yellow curry. it was sweet and savory and spicy (not hot spicy, but flavorful spicy) and fresh and delicious. portions were huge, and well priced. i wish i could recall the name of the entree my friend got, but it came out with three - yes, three -- chicken breasts! my leftovers were enough for two more meals. a great menu that would fly with kids and less adventurous diners and with thai food appreciators.  misc - hours could be longer. i'm sure it brings in more $$ as a lunch spot, but i would come to dinner more often if they were open later. and they close from like 3 to 5. no full bar - beer and wine only.  overall: very pleased, wish i had come over a year ago when i first heard about it. oh wait, i tried twice and was twice thwarted by their hours!"}
{"text":"I like the chicken, it is prepared soft and tender instead of rubbery.  The blanket shrimp is my favorite app.. but wishing they will add stuffed chicken wings and pork belly with Thai vegetable and rice noodle, my old favorites from LA."}
{"text":"Now, to say this is in my regular rotation is somewhat of a fib.  I don't go here often, I save it for those special \"I-really-want-to-treat-myself\" lunches.  Maybe when there are co-workers visiting from out of town or when I'm going with a good friend for a sit-down-and-chat lunch, not a grab-and-go lunch.  Although, you can call it in or get take out if you want.  This is food that I want to sit down, pay attention, and enjoy.  My favorite is the Panang (Peanut Curry) with Tofu and Veggies, medium or mild, depending on the day.  I like spicy, but I also like to taste my food and try to prevent my nose from running too much.  It comes with the delicious Jasmine Rice, a spring roll, and a small cup of soup to start.  If I'm trying to be good, I save half for the next day.  If not, I could eat the whole thing - easy!  Also, it is very hard not to get a Thai Iced Tea while I am here.  I am a huge iced tea fan in general (unsweetened, with lemon), but when there is a beverage as creamy and wonderful as this, my willpower can instantly fall to zero.   It is a pretty tight fit with all of the tables in there and it can get a little loud.  However, the servers are nice and they don't linger.  It is amazing how they try to be as speedy as they can so that they can get everyone seated, yet I never feel rushed.  If I want a long, leisurely lunch, I can have that, the difference is that it will be because I decided to, and not because they took to long.  Thai Elephant is a winner in my book!  After my meal, while walking back to the office, my first thought is always \"Wow, that was good!\" and then next comes \"I wonder when I'll get an excuse to go back . . .\""}
{"text":"I have been there twice and we absolutely be back. The Green Curry and Pad Thai are both delicious. Prices are average but certainly not too high. If I had one complaint it would be that the Thai Hot isnt very hot. The staff is actually Thai and the service was on point both times. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Good food. Lots of choices. Service was good too! It is a great hole in the wall place to find. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Just three words: red fish curry. It should be up in a hall of fame somewhere; behind a gold plated frame. Some say i went over three words, you know what i say to those people? Stop hatin, cause Thai Elephant stands tall and not just with Thai cuisine, but all restaurants."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant has made its way onto my  \"Special Friday Lunch\" rotation -- an honored list of my favorite places for takeout  and get me out of the office lunch spots -- and I couldn't be happier.  A coworker told me about the place, and after trying trying their yellow curry, I was hooked.   Now, I'm no connoisseur of curry, but I know what I like and I know what my taste buds like, and this curry was faaan-tastic. I ordered it mild because my taste buds are a tad sensitive, but that didn't take away from the robust flavors. The simple ingredients of the dish melded together beautifully to create a spectacularly savory meal.  And, it was quite the portion for a lunch item.  I had to save half of it, which I was hoping to have for dinner, but accidentally left in the work fridge.   I'm already thinking about when I'll order from Thai Elephant again, and maybe the next time I'll venture outside my curry comfort zone to try some other menu items.  But, then again, why deny myself the joy of their curry!"}
{"text":"Bland. While the decor is lovely and the customer service was above average, the food was just not impressive. I was disappointed, because the menu left much to desire. If you want some seriously great Thai food, try the Pink Pepper in Mesa."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times previously, but tonight's service was awesome! The ladies were super friendly and more than accommodating.   We ordered the spring roll appetizer which was larger than I anticipated. I'm not a fan of peanut sauce so I ate my half of the order without sauce, which made it a little bland. Next time I will order the sauce that came with my main dish. For the main meal, I ordered the Siamese Basil which was delicious. I am sensitive to spicy food so I ordered a 2, which was a mistake. I should have at least ordered a 3 at this place.   I will be back again, l'll just need to make a couple of adjustments to my order."}
{"text":"Love this place. But tonight the cook was off.  My Siam suki was overcooked and my boyfriends pad see ew was bland."}
{"text":"Thus far the best Thai food I have come across here in Arizona.  I have now visited a few times and have enjoyed the Chicken Panang Curry, Tom Kha Soup, and Drunken Noodles with Tofu.  I have found the \"spiciness\" scale to be accurate and tend to go for medium, but went for hot today being a little chilly and rainy out.  Their ingredients are fresh, the vegetables still have some bite to them, the chicken was tender and the tofu was delicious!  Also if you have a taste for it, the Thai Iced Tea is a very nice complement to their dishes.  I have only been here for dinner, but the portions were generous and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.  Be prepared if you order a \"bowl\" of soup because it is definitely a bowl that is meant to be shared.  The plating was well done and the dishes are fresh, hot, colorful, flavorful, and haven't disappointed me.  The service has been strong every time.  The decor is trying to be contemporary, but still has a comfy feel to it and most importantly clean.  I do agree that the decor with the Thai theme, but attempting to be a little more \"crowd pleasing\" (for lack of a better term) with the rock music and televisions make it a little... odd ambiance wise.  I look forward to going back and trying some of their other offerings and perhaps even the happy hour for some apps!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tom Kha soup and the papaya salad. I thought the soup had good taste but the spiciness was lacking. The papaya salad was just bland and had absolutely no kick to it despite my telling them I wanted it to be 7/10 on the heat level. Papaya salad that is not spicy isn't good unless it's made with a lot of flavor. Not the case here.  The atmosphere was good. I thought the layout and lighting was really good and made for a comfortable dining experience. What they need is to get a waiter that knows Thai food and then to deliver on the spiciness they promised."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. In just a few minutes, my Pad Thai & Yellow Curry were ready for my take-out. Walked in and the staff were so friendly. And I love that THAI Elephant stays open past 9pm! Thank Goodness!!! Thank you THAI Basil for the tasty meal."}
{"text":"Come here only for the yellow chicken curry.  I get that shit double thai hot.  Even with double thai hot.... it isn't always that hot.  I could go hotter.    They do a good job at not overpowering the taste of the curry with the spices.  Lots of times places won't make the curry hot enough for me OR it'll overpower the actual taste of the food and all I will taste is spices.  They manage to make that shit pretty spicy without losing the flavor.  Very important.  I eat curry all over the place and this spot is hands down my favorite."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch twice recently and it's delicious! I had the drunken chicken rice and yellow curry lunch specials. Recommend both, yummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered pad thai and couldn't believe it! it was laden with sugar and salt so much so that I almost puked!  They couldn't adjust the sugar or salt content since their sauce was pre-made.  How can a Thai place screw up pad thai?  AND I asked for chopsticks but they forgot so i sat there for five minutes while my friend chomped on her dish.  So I ordered pad z u to go since by that time, my friend was done and I took it to go.  Alas, it was again too sweet and too salty.  It was the worst experience, what a disappointment! Do not waste your time!"}
{"text":"Very Tasty. Good spices and super-friendly staff.  Good for a conversation or a larger group."}
{"text":"Very good service. I enjoy it here. The Tofu Pad Thai on medium is a little too hot for me. This is a nice place with nice people."}
{"text":"I've since been back several times, this place deserves three stars rather than my original two. I'd even give it 3.5 if that were an option. It's decent thai food. It's not the best, it's not the worst, and typically the service is friendly."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've last visited Thai Elephant. I was excited about going back a few nights ago.  Walking in the place smelled like a mixture of paint and cleaning products. I mentioned to my husband that I felt a headache coming on due to the smell.  We all ordered some sort of curry.  It was rather delicious, but unfortunately hours later my Panang curry didn't agree with me.  I guess if we have the opportunity to return I'll go back to my usual Pad Thai, which if memory serves me, is pretty good at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Three of us arrived for happy hour, got a table immediately and were very well taken care of. We started with a round of asian beers, and thai iced teas. Delicious. I ordered the thai veggie rolls and green curry with chicken. both very delicious. that plum sauce was a nice little touch with the spring rolls. My boyfriend devoured the calamari. My friend, Matt, ordered the vegetarian pineapple fried rice. SOOO GOOD. the tofu was the perfect consistency and the spices were amazing. The thairamisu was....interesting. good, but i think i'll go with the coconut ice cream next time. :)  For a dinner, two apps, three beers, a thai iced tea, and the thairamisu (plus the tip) we were looking at about $45- good effin deal. ((thank yooouuuuuu happy hour!))"}
{"text":"Holy Elephant Balls, Buddha! This place is incurrydible!!! Okay, okay I'll stop.  So my wife and I decided to hook up for lunch.  She works downtown so I decided to head down that way and pick her up.  I suggested Thai Elephant because I had never been, and she raved about the Pad Thai she had ordered a couple weeks ago.  It's located on Adams just West of Central Ave., and parking is scarce.  Make sure to have some change for the meter!  I knew I was at home when I saw the \"People Love Us On Yelp\" sticker on their door.  It was about 1 pm so the lunch crowd wasn't in FULL effect.  There were about 10 empty tables in which we had our pick. We sat by the window.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken (a la medium), and I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken (a la medium).  A round of Thai Tea was also added to the bill.  Our food came out in about 4 minutes, which came as a shocker! Yes, I said shocker... I was pleasantly surprised!  The moment I slammed my chompers onto the emerald dripping chicken, I became green with envy. Envious of all the people who have eaten here in the past and had such a precious secret hidden up their sleeves.  I sniffled a bit, but not from emotion.  It was the green curry and its beautiful spices stroking my mucus glands in just the right way.  A bit of rice and a sip of the Thai Tea (I'll get into in a second) and I was right back on track.  The Thai Tea. Ooohhhh, the Thai Tea!  It was $2.50 and twice as large as the ones I order from The Street.  It was like being chosen by Ganghis Khan to sit alongside him in Xanadu and drink the Milk of Paradise (Rush Reference).  It was sweet, as you would expect paradise to be, and creamy. I began to float out of my chair and harpies wiped my nose as I sipped the golden brown goblet of goodness.  Service was Spectacular Food was Fabulous Portions were Phenomenal  Dare I say it? 5 Big Ones, Mr. Elephant... and I shall return!"}
{"text":"There are times i wish we had a Thaitown or there was a cluster of really good Thai restaurants within a 5 mile drive of me but sadly most Thai places in metro Phoenix are just not that good with exception of a few gems. One gem is Thai Elephant. This review is based solely on the service I received ordering take out and the food itself.  I'm usually against ordering take out at a new establishment simply because it doesn't allow you to properly judge the place. Some places food just don't do well with takeout... like dim sum. So it's best to try out a place to get the full taste before coming back to take out home. Thai Elephant proved that its food was take out capable. It's been cold lately so I had a hankering for some curry to warm me up. I was ordering enough food for three people. I ordered some Tom Kha (coconut based soup), a seafood yellow curry, a chicken panang curry (red curry) and some Tofu Pad Pik King (stir fry green bean, bell pepper and spicy chili paste). The three entrees were all ordered HOT, and the Tom Kha was Thai HOT.  Take out service was usual, was given a menu to peruse, the hostess was patient and answered my questions and gave recommendations. The overall appearance of the restaurant was that it was somewhat largish, and tastefully decorated. This is not dirty kitchen Thai in anyway unlike the really good ones in Thaitown but the menu was quite extensive and prices were moderate too.   Food-wise this is one of the better Thai restaurants around. The yellow curry was delicious, I couldn't get enough of it, I kept on slurping the sauce. The Tom Kha was excellent that they did not kid with the spicy factor, loved it! It wasn't salty, no msg used, and the ingredients were fresh! My parents are hard to please when it comes to Thai especially since many of their close friends are Thai so they know what Thai food should taste like, so to hear them tell me that they want to buy from Thai Elephant in the future is proof of how they liked it.   Overall, Thai Elephant is a winner and a place that I'd like to come back to and have dinner at with friends. I loved what I ordered and I'm sure whoever I'm with, will too! If you're ever in Tempe, I recommend you stop by Thai Elephant if you're ever craving Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Particularly if you're eating vegetarian. I always order the coconut rice and panang curry. I also enjoy the cold rolls. Basically, just this order will feed me 3 meals. I am always happy when I order in. Also, I've never eaten in the restaurant! I 100% suggest ordering in from this place, fo sho."}
{"text":"Delicious spicy fresh food. The staff is always friendly. I visited during happy hour and had the chicken satay and golden shrimp both items are so good. We ordered the green and red curry for dinner which is so flavorful."}
{"text":"We love coming here for takeout and casual date nights! The location is convenient, and the service is wonderful. And for Thai food, very delicious!   I enjoy their tofu fresh rolls. The rolls are large and because of all the veggies, quite light! We typically order a curry and noodle dish when we go. I think they have a great Green Curry and Red Curry, and their Pad Thai is flavorful and comes with a LOT of noodles! Of their other noodle dishes, the Drunken Noodle has a lot of sauce and is a good one to share. We always end up with plenty of leftovers!"}
{"text":"Good place to go before the Gammage Theater. Quick and easy to park.  Good Thai food"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was fantastic.  The happy hour priced beers went along great with the dragon fried rice (spicy fried rice) and the green curry chicken.  Got some good tips also on how to get more authentic dishes as opposed to the Americanized versions we are used to."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends.  Lots of parking in the back which is really great! It was a nice day so they had the back door open. You can enter from the front or the back door. Service was very good. Staff was so nice. The place is decorated very nicely as well. Lunch was good, the lunch items come with a type of broth, and an eggroll as well. We got yellow curry with tofu and green curry with chicken. Both were very good.  The potatoes were cooked just right. That can really determine if it is good or not.  That kept refilling my friends tea(hot) which he loved. I got the Thai Ice Tea. Great! The bathroom in this place could of used a bit of a scrub down. The door handle was disgusting,really coated in everyone touching it.  During this cold and flu season I always think about that."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go from here the other night because I was craving Thai food and absolutely LOVED what I ordered! BONUS: They are open on Sunday nights! Not all Thai places are open on Sundays so this made my day!   I ordered a cup of their Tom Kha soup with chicken and always get a side of Jasmine rice to pour it over {makes it last a lot longer and fills you up!}. It was SO delicious and definitely competes with my fav spot in town. For my entree, I ordered the Pad Z U with beef and it may just be one of my new fav Thai dishes. It is made with the wide rice noodles and has a sauce very similar to Pad Thai. I LOVED the veggies in it and trust me, they did not skimp on the beef! The beef tasted fresh and lean, not chewy at all. The wide noodles are such a nice change and I think they will be a regular in my Thai food favorites rotation!   The best part - the portions were HUGE so I was able to stretch it out between 2 dinners and a lunch! Yes, please! I will absolutely be back to Thai Elephant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner instead of eating at our hotel. It was a great choice! Both our meals were very good and plenty of food. My hubby had pad Thai (sp?)and I had a meal that had green beans, and peppers with a red chili sauce with added chicken. (Sorry I cannot remember the name of it.) I asked mine to be more on the mild side and it was a bit spicy but very tolerable. Hubby had his medium and he said it could have been a bit spicier but still thought it was very good. We would both go back!"}
{"text":"I have become a Thai Foodie since recently and this restaurant is one of the best the valley has to offer with so many good selections on the lunch menu. It was hard for me to choice once selection but I narrowed it down... My food came out fast, just as I expected during lunch rush. I was completely satisfied with my selection of Thai Fried rice with egg roll on the side. I was so happy with my food and will come back to Thai Elephant again for more delicious food! I love finding good eats!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in tempe in my opinion! I order here at least once a week! They put smiley faces on their drinks and dishes labeling them which is adorable. I tell everyone I know who wants a good thai place to go here. Their peanut sauce is soo good!!! I LOVE IT"}
{"text":"G/f and I stopped in last week for happy hour specials. Service was friendly but a bit slow for how not-busy they were. Atmosphere is modern and a bit upscale. We ordered fried calamari and vegetarian spring rolls for an appetizer. They were, to be honest, so-so. The spring rolls were 90% breading and 10% spicy delicious something I wish they'd put more of in the roll. Go to Oregano's down the street for superior calamari. I had a Thaitini, which was fruity and not-too-strong. A good or bad thing, depending on your mood and palate, but I actually wish it had been a bit stronger. The g/f had the \"ginger binger\" which was actually my fav. thing we got. A ginger beer mixed with rum and/or vodka...what an idea! All in all, a good enough happy hour sampling session...I would go back w/ g/f for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"One of those places that can not possibly serve bad food...! Lunch, specifically, is very nice, quick and affordable... All their curries as well as entrees are equally good and you can ogfcourse adjust the level of spice as in all Thai places... ( that's something I don't like but serves good for those who don't eat spicy food)... Thai coffee is one of my favourites too..."}
{"text":"Get the Khao Soi!   Food: We ordered the Panang Curry and the (DELICIOUS) Khao soi. While the Panang was also good, I found the peanuts in the sauce was very overpowering. It almost didn't taste like curry, more like the peanut sauce you get to dip for chicken skewers. Now by all means that stuff is delicious, but it was not what I expected when I ordered curry. The Khao soi on the otherhand was hands down my favourite! The flavours were so rich yet light. It too was a bit overpowering in terms of coconut milk but I personally love it.   This is actually the second time I've been here. The first time we also ordered pineapple fried rice and a beef dish. From my memory, they were all fine but did not stand out.  Restaurant: Small but quaint. It doesn't have much seating but also doesn't seem to get as busy as other places. Great if you don't want to wait in line for some other Thai places nearby and still get some good food.  Service: The lady serving us was very quick and efficient. I was thinking of docking a star because she gave us the wrong meat in our Panang curry at first but before we even realized it, she whipped back around and said she would replace it for us. The wait was not long at all even after the mix up. I'd say expect 20 minutes or so for your food, very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.  On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.  Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).  Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish \"spicy,\" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.  I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"We sadly had to find a new Thai place nearby when Thai Rama closed to get our Massaman curry fix.  We ordered takeout and they were really super friendly and the food was ready to go and hot!  The curry was excellent!  Possibly better than Thai Rama.  We also ordered the sticky rice with mango which didn't turn out to be as good as Thai Rama's version but the curry more than makes up for it and who can eat dessert after all that food anyway!  This is so close to us so it's definitely become a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Very clean and spacious.  Widely varied menu.  Good happy hour prices.  The food was at best mediocre.  The fried calamari was way over cooked and dry, didn't taste fresh.  The fish cakes were rubbery and chewy.  The \"Tiger on Fire\" was okay, but the meat could have been much more tender.  The veggies that came with it were spot on, though.  Prices are good, especially for the size of portions.  Really good service.  Mostly it's the food that brought the score down."}
{"text":"Very pretty back patio with tons of flowers. super-friendly service and creemore pints for $5.50!! Excellent soups. I recommend this little gem to everyone."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Always great food and friendly service. Lunch time can be busy, but 11-11:30 is quick and easy!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Was greeted at the door immediately was seated. A couple ppl in the dinning area enjoying their meals. Order a margarita was brought a martini. After asking if that was the correct drink she stated it was which I'm a bartender so I knew it was not. She stated she had made a mistake and would change it right away. Ordered the fried was. Was given nicely seasoned mushy rice. Fried rice means it's fried not just white rice with soy sauce. Told the waitress I didn't want it. I was still charged for it. They lady began arguing with me about why she still has to charge me. Food cost and small business can't afford to throw away shrimp. WTF does that have to do with how poorly it was cooked and why do you feel like it's my fault. She said they will remake But honestly I just didn't want it. Won't be back to this restaurant and I don't recommend it whatsoever."}
{"text":"I had a conference in Phoenix and this place was right up the street from my hotel, and boy am I glad it was!    The spring rolls were good, not the best I've ever had, but really tasty.  And my main course was excellent...I had the Drunken Noodle with Shrimp....fresh veggies, nice and spicy (they let you specify your spice level, I had medium) and the shrimp were tender and fresh.  Small, affordable wine list by the glass, it was the perfect addition to my meal.  I wish I would have had room for dessert...."}
{"text":"The pad thai was meh. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either and that's their signature dish."}
{"text":"Very nice place, fast service large portions and excellent food. I will definitely be back. I tried it for lunch and am planing on visiting again for dinner."}
{"text":"I am hungry and randomly I come here!! The service really friendly and the place is cozy :) Order beef salad Thai hot but it's not that spicy for me because I am Asian! If you white like my gf you better not order Thai hot loll #iamnotracist  Ohhh yeahhh...!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small little restaurant in a strip mall with some of the best food.  The curry is fantastic.  Everything here is amazing."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is an A+. My brother and I were right next to the Lady Gaga Concert that was starting soon, and they reassured our orders were going to be out ASAP and brought it out in the next 5 minutes.  We ordered the pad thai and this may be an unfair comparison to the pad thai I had in California but the these noodles were just downright rubbery. I'm not sure why I had to chew on the noodles the same way I chewed on burnt steak. We also ordered the Thai Elephant Platter which came with croquet, fried tofu, mini egg rolls, and 2 chicken satays with sweet soy sauce and peanut sauce. The appetizers were decent and the croquet was good."}
{"text":"food was pretty good. got the pad thai with shrimp and chicken panang. really liked the panang and quality of the chicken in it. bf is a pad thai dude and said that was pretty good, as well. what really made the experience better was the service of Nina. she's super funny, nice, and attentive. definitely will be back on my next visit from LA."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai restaurant.  They have a simple happy hour menu but the entrees are what you should come for.  This place can accommodate larger groups as it has a lot of space.  The staff is friendly and you'll have a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I tried the pad thai here since that's what I always get to gauge a Thai restaurant.  The dish was slightly bland, a bit too sweet and not much else.  I did not taste any lime or cilantro, or really anything that reminded me of Pad Thai..  The price is the same as any other Thai restaurant, but I think I'd prefer any other Thai restaurant..."}
{"text":"This Thai food is amazing and freshly made! The lunch hours are packed solid with local corporate crowds so be prepared for limited parking and longer than normal time with service. However the food is well worth the wait. Evenings are a bit easier or takeout eases the stomach. Prices are reasonable and the servings are generous. My favorite is still the green curry with any of the meat choices. Try the fry banana with coconut ice-cream if you want to share a delectable but simple desert.  I had another amazing meal at this restaurant. I'm guilty of loving the coconut  curry. This time I botched up the heat and had beef instead of chicken. The meat just melted in my mouth and the spice added just the right amount of heat. It's an extremely popular and well loved place. So definitely be prepared for s little wait during rush hours and popular work day crowds."}
{"text":"Very delicious Thai food! I have ordered food for pick up as well as recently sat down and ate at the restaurant and had very pleasant experiences with both. The pad thai is always delicious but the yellow curry is really the most delicious I have ever had. I recommend this restaurant to everyone and doubt you could order anything that is not incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"I went again on Friday and YUM!  I got the same ginger chicken and it was just as delicious as before.  I need to venture out and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Glad I made the trip downtown to check this place out.  I had the Drunken Noodles with tofu, spiced medium.  The medium was good but pretty mild; maybe next time I'll ask for a middle ground between medium and hot.  I noticed that outer edges of the tofu were fried but the sides were totally white and not fried.  I normally like total friedness but perhaps this was slightly healthier, so it's all good.    We split the Triangle Roti for dessert.  Technically it's shaped like a sphere but it is cut like a pizza so you do kind of end up with triangles.  At any rate, the shape is irrelevant; the main thing is that it's pure buttery sugary goodness.  So light and airy I probably could have eaten the whole thing, but managed to exercise a little restraint.  (I'm sure my jeans are thanking me for that!!)  The atmosphere is nothing special and it was kinda dead on Thursday night but other than that everything was perfect.  The service was excellent.  I'd definitely go back if I lived closer."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Thai Elephant, Friendly environment, tasty and affordable food, I'll definitely stop by again for happy hour to have  their delicious appetizers."}
{"text":"The Masaman Curry is the bomb - all the food here is excellent, the Thai tea and coffee were excellent, servers are friendly, the only concern I had was there were gnats in the booth we sat in. And my rice was a little mushy. But the quality of the curry and the flavors more than made up for all of that :-) we'll come back again to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible. The rice was soggy. The pad Thai noodles were also soggy. Definitely lost its touch from the last time we've been there. I guess the renovation knocked them off their game."}
{"text":"I ate here during a very slow time.  I will say the service was very good, but the food was very average.  With all the great Thai options in town this is one I will likely forget.  I probably wouldn't go back because of that reason, but if someone asked me to eat here, I'd still go."}
{"text":"I have gone to Thai Elephant twice over the past month.  The food is awesome, service is great.  The interesting thing is the atomsophere- they have ACDC playing and there are many TVs spread over the place.  The decorations and wall hanings match the Thai theme, but the I cannot get over the choice of music and all the TVs on.    If you're looking for great food and don't mind the bright lights and all the extrenal stimuli around you, this is a great place.  As for me, I don't find the restraunt's atmosphere relaxing.  Take out is perfect!"}
{"text":"This is the exact same thing as Thai Basil down the street.  However, Thai Elephant is more expensive, serves alcohol, and you can order just a cup of soup instead of an enormous bowl.  But don't get me wrong... both Thai Basil and Thai Elephant serve EXCELLENT food and the service is great."}
{"text":"Beware before you order take-out with this place. First of all, they didn't tell me about extra charges when I asked for modifications to my orders over the phone. That I would normally let go, even though it added several dollars to my bill. They gave me a cracked soup container and stacked the food in a ridiculous way so that when I got home, I had a car floor full of soup and no broth to drink."}
{"text":"Was nice to be able to sit out on the patio for dinner.  We arrived in time for happy hour so we tried the sweet potatoe appetizer.  I loved it and my friend didn't care that much for it.  She liked the dipping sauce but thought the potatoe had little flavor.    Got the tom kha soup and can't wait to have it again.  It was so so so good.  Also ordered the Pad Thai noodles with tofu and thought it was disgusting.  I sent it back and they took it off the bill.  Very eggy.  The only time I have had pad thai was at home when I made it.  Perhaps I just don't care for the restaurant variety of it."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is probably an American Thai place.  The food is mediocre tasting and quite a number of their thai dishes taste kind of sweet instead of spicy or sour.  I guess I would give them 3 stars cause its got good service and a nice selection of beer and wine and very nice ambience.  U can probably bring a date here and she would be happy.  Maybe when they improve their finger food and main dishes, they would get their 2 other stars, but for what they have now, 3 is a generous rating."}
{"text":"Prompt delivery, really yummy Khao Soi, despite a hair in it... :'/ pad thai was boring, flat tasting and lacking in any flavour, the pineapple fried rice is delicious, amazing rice and fresh fresh fresh veggies. Crappy pineapple bits, need to try the rice with chicken. .. Edit: stomach hurt for days after eating here. Same with my boyfriend. Not a great sign."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Lunch specials come with spring roll and soup. Service is fantastic. Definitely recommend the Siamese Basil dish with chicken!"}
{"text":"This place understands the meaning of Lunch \"Hour\".  Good service, great food!  I judge a Thai restaurant by how it handles Eggplant and Thai Elephant delivers - just for giggles order it \"Thai Spicy\" instead of tourist spicy!  It will take you to a whole new level.  Never had a dish here I didn't like.  Can't imagine what people are talking about with leftovers?  Leftovers are for Sissies.  Show the kitchen you loved their edible artwork - clean your plate!"}
{"text":"Ordered drunken noodles with seafood last night--was expecting wide rice noodles, but it came with the rice noodles typical of phad thai.  It was bursting in flavor, though and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Been there once before--can't remember exactly what I ordered, although I think we had spring roll appetizers, a curry dish, and perhaps phad thai.  Loved the food last time.  One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Phoenix.  Plan to try something not so staple next time, like Tiger Crying (had that dish at only 1 other Thai restaurant I've been to & loved it)."}
{"text":"We got Uber eats from there and was disappointed that they didn't add chopsticks in the Togo bag. I had the drunken noodles w/ medium spice, but it was barely spicy. My girlfriend got friend rice that was super dry and their was tomatoes instead of red peppers in her dish.   We will pick other Thai restaurants to order from now on."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Service is usually pretty quick as well. The Hawaiian chicken and the pad Thai were both really good. Portions are fairly large for lunch. Worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for Thai food"}
{"text":"My sons took me to eat here because they know I love spicy foods.  I have heard about Thai Elephant for many years but this was my very first visit.  I ordered the seafood fried rice thai hot, or #5!  It was very spicy, for me that is just perfect, but for my sons it would too much. The $2 happy hour Kirin on Draft is the best deal in town.  The parking lot was full however, and the patio was empty and hot when I went to smoke.  They told me the patio would be updated by fall in time for the nice weather which should be nice. Inside is nice and cool, and smells good so overall I was happy and would like to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent place for meal or drinks. Ive yet to order a dish that i have not enjoyed, but the green curry is my fav. Thai tea is blended just right. And, they have $2 draft Kirin beer. Yes please!"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous!  Out waiter was wonderful from the second we walked in the door until he chased after us after we forgot something at the table. We were just going to check out the menu unitl he mentioned it was happy hour and we couldn't resist.   My boyfriend had sweet and sour chicken. He has a really hard time finding one he loves because of his obsession with cucumbers in it. We were super excited to see cucumbers listed in the ingredients. He ordered Medium since it was our first time and some places are hotter than others. It wasn't too hot by any means, easily could have ordered hot.   I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered edemame and spring rolls (and picked at his dinner) plus a glass of wine.   I definitely give this place 5 stars and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"so, I visit downtown Phoenix for work once and awhile know outside the hours of 9-5 M-F everyone has pretty much punched out, fired up their car and took off to ... other parts unknown to me, just not downtown because the place is absolutely barren. . . options are at a minimum.   why will I be back at this place?   1. good reviews on here got be curious over other nearby places  2. i wanted it takeout to eat alone in my lonely hotel room because i'm a cranky anti-social guy sometimes.  3. the food was ready in 10 minutes   4. the staff was amazing and friendly to cranky cold anti-social people from the northeast  5. the yellow curry was delicious, more than enough and niceprice. Good amount of tofu, carrots probably a whole potato in there  6. they are open for lunch  7. I want to update this review when I've tried other dishes so conceivably this place could take a tumble down to an A-OK 3*** but that's still good because remember I'm a cranky reviewer"}
{"text":"Do not give this business your money credit cards. I have ordered from them before and had delivery. The woman said your charge today will be 22 and something change. The delivery guy came and the bill was 27 and change. I called and asked to speak to a manager. Two women said no manager here. I don't care if you want to pretend to not speak English I will not be going to giving my money here ever again. Then I speak to the girl who says she took the order and she said she's telling the truth and that she told me 27 something. Long story short I am calling my bank right now and getting it taken care of. What a crappy establishment! Never trust your money with them."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Panang. Employees are always very friendly and dinner portions are large. Definitely enough to split. Quality Thai restaurant that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is minutes from my house, so my roommates and I are there often when we need quick, delicious food. I usually get the drunken noodles with chicken, which are excellent, and have also had the pad thai and seasonal special of the pumpkin curry. Everything that I have had there has been amazing and the people are very friendly, but I think they could use more people on their staff! It seems like the employees are always overwhelmed and service can be a little slow. But overall, I would definitely recommend this place when looking for great Thai food."}
{"text":"I always order Pad Thai when I'm trying out a Thai restaurant for the first time.  That's the lithmus test for me.  We ordered Calamari, Seafood Pad Thai, and Green Curry with Squid and vegetables.   The Pad Thai didn't have the complex flavor that I'm used to  It wasn't too bad, but I've had better.   The calamari was overcooked to the point that it was chewy.  Green Curry with squid had good flavor.  I did like the fresh blanched veggies in there.  No KIDS MENU.  Overall, it was just A-OK."}
{"text":"3.5/4 out of 5  pretty decent no complaints.  i got take out from here  .pretty delicious.  a bit pricey for what it is.  but pretty satisfied.    nothing profound stood out to me... but a solid 4 on taste for the golden curry."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, not one dish on the menu has elephant in it, and even when you ask they don't have any off the menu.   Due to the lack of elephant I went with my new thai usual, Drunken noodles with tofu. (7.95) with soup and a veggie spring roll. The soup was good and very strong from copious amounts of ginger. My noodles were good, but they were the premade style noodle, the wide variety of vegetables and texture of tofu really made this dish shine, I really like the skinny green beans and thai basil.  The springroll was a bit cool and soggy, I think this is what we get for coming a bit late for lunch. The portion size was quite good, making the higher price acceptable.  There are a surprising amount of tables inside this small store front, and they can even accommodate larger groups as the many tables of 2 can be become tables for 2 4 6 8 or any number you can appreciate.  This is one of the few non chain places for lunch in the heart of down town, and its good too, give it a try, it can even work for a business lunch as it was not too loud and decent inside."}
{"text":"Tried it twice. First time was just OK, nothing really that great about it at all. Food was boring.  Second time. I was very unsatisfied. Got your typical Pad Thai, it was awful. The noodles were all in a big clump, the egg and onion tasted like bad oil or something weird. It was not appetizing at all the the eye or the mouth. It was just a big white MESS!!!!! The service was pretty lame too. I prefer it when the owners run the place not college kids! Needless to say, I won't be going back. I prefer Thal Basil over this place. Much better food and great service.  I would not bother with this place. There are better Thai places in Tempe!"}
{"text":"First off, I like Thai food fine, it's just not something I crave or seek out. I've been here twice and had good food both times.  This last time, I had Chicken Lo-Mein, mild spice level (#2 on the 5 scale).  It was tasty, but I could've done a #3 spice level.  I'll likely be back with my co-workers again, for a birthday celebration lunch."}
{"text":"Greatest Thai delivery. Haven't eaten in yet but will."}
{"text":"Why had I never been here before? I had dinner here after a serious WEEK of craving some good Thai food. The Elephant did not disappoint, I really enjoyed my visit.   The interior of the restaurant is tasteful, well-maintained and spacious. The layout sort of wraps around a semi-circle, with the bar keenly separated in the back, attached to a cozy patio. I'm the type of person that always notices the music playing in a store or restaurant. The music choice in here was pretty interesting; a good deal of '90s hip hop, including the famous Cops' theme song, Inner Circle's \"Bad Boys.\" Lots of volume and bass going on as well, it was really unexpected, but kind of awesome.   I usually try out a new restaurant by ordering something basic. I got the Pad Thai at the \"Hot\" level. They didn't go easy, their \"Hot\" level was nice and spicy. The food was delicious. Fresh, vibrant, and full of flavor. None of it was soggy or too salty. My partner in crime ordered the Spicy Eggplant, which also featured fresh, well-prepared ingredients. Eggplant is sort of hit or miss with me, but this was cooked to perfection.   The menu is extensive and has lots of interesting options. Including a dish called \"Crazy Beef Salad.\" I will absolutely be back to Thai Elephant very soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is generally for take out as there is only a few tables inside. We came with a group of friends on Saturday night and ordered the main dishes (shrimp pad Thai, basil fried rice with beef, beef khao soi, coconut shrimp, massaman curry with chicken and Thai ice tea). The best dishes would probably be the massaman curry with chicken and the pad Thai. They both had great flavour. Found portion wise was fairly small. The basil fried rice had way too much chopped onion. As for the khao soi I wished they served it with beef brisket rather than sliced beef. I would not recommend ordering the Thai ice tea here - way too much sugar and no ice it was like drinking syrup.."}
{"text":"I've eaten a ton of Thai food...no, like a TON of a Thai food, there is a place to get Thai on every corner in Chicago. I have to say, the flavor was very bland. Nothing that made it memorable. The service was great but again, the dishes were just bland."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry, YUMMY food was very good, ordered it spicy and it came about medium.  But the food was what I wanted and expected, service was good I asked for an opinion on the curry and the waiter happened to agree with everything I asked.  \"how about this is this good, YES he would reply\" made me wonder if he had tried it all.  Beer and wine are both served.  I liked this place and will return."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour. The service was a little slow, but the drinks were good, especially the cosmo and the elephantitis (seriously, this is what it's called). The happy hour menu isn't extensive, but the calamari is worth ordering as are the veggie rolls. The setting is nice and relaxed--no loud music, so you can have conversation."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to this place forever and finally had an opportunity to stop in. The atmosphere was beautiful and I had wished I could dine in but she said it was 7 minutes to lunch closing. The young girl at the counter was nice as I arrived but seemed bothered that I came in close to lunch being over. I proceeded to order take out. Ordered fresh rolls and happily asked for a recommendation for another appetizer -She suggested golden shrimp for 8.95. I figured at that price I would get fairly large shrimp in a decent sized container. What I got was shriveled up \"barely there\" tiny shrimp covered in greasy crusted fried batter all stuck together in a small container. MAYBE 7 pieces of shrimp...My total for two small appetizers was close to $16 ! I proceeded to get a refund for the shrimp as it was not at all worth the money spent. The young girl never even apologized or offered to ask if I would like something else. Never gave me eye contact- ran the credit - slapped down the return receipt and proceeded to walk away ( still no sorry or eye contact ). Due to her rudeness I definitely won't be supporting this local restaurant again. Get a clue - if you want a satisfied customer have better manners than that. I expected way more."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner here before seeing a show at the Herberger Theater down the street, and I have to say I am glad we stumbled across this place!  The service was great (friendly and attentive), and the food delicious.  I stuffed myself much fuller than I should have but couldn't stop eating because it was so good.  They customized an order for me because I didn't want bell peppers but wanted eggplant (yes, I'm picky) and wanted their special chili-garlic sauce that I saw on some of their menu items.  The food was awesome.  Spicy and D-lish.  Very reasonable prices.  Will definitely be back when we're in downtown."}
{"text":"I never give reviews because I like to try the place twice considering I'm from the serving industry, and sometimes you have a bad day and I get it, but I've never been so ignored and disrespected in my life. The minute I walked in asked for a booth they were rude and complaining in their language (Thai which I speak and I don't think they knew) then I sat down and waited for 5 minutes to even get a drink order, which she said it was because I was waited on two more (not an excuse greet and grab drinks within a minute of someone who gets seated DUH) and the food sucks and the servers were rude. I will never return or recommend this for anyone. I know good Thai considering I can cook it (I'm Thai) and this place is gross and has horrible service !"}
{"text":"51. The best seafood soup I have had...  and I've had a bunch!  Service was good, place is nice, but most importantly,  that soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Good atmosphere. We tried the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. Both were very good but the curry was especially excellent. Varying degrees of spice allowed for both of our meals to meet our comfort level. Will definitely be our first stop whenever we start to crave some good thai!"}
{"text":"Tried Thai Elephant today in my quest to find the best food spots in the area (new transplant).    While I have no real complaints about the restaurant, I thought it was only fair.  I thought the pre-meal soup was sub-par being overly sweet and not spicy or salty enough to balance out the sweetness.  I could do without the soup next time.    I ordered the Green Curry lunch special - with a 4 / 5 on the hot scale.  The curry was tasty and was my favorite thing about the entire meal, but some of the vegetables were chopped so large I had to cut them up to try to eat them; One section of eggplant was cut so large that the middle hadn't cooked through.  As for spiciness, the 4 was very mild (too mild). Overall though, a very solid curry.  The included eggroll was only OK, and as seems to be the trend, not nearly enough rice included to go around.  The service was efficient but not overly friendly or helpful, but they were fine.  Overall, I have no real complaints about Thai Elephant, I wouldn't object to going here, but I will not seek it out in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here last night due to a JustEat voucher ($15 off, min $30 order). Overall I was fairly satisfied. We ordered the \"dinner for two\" pre-built combo which was 2 spring rolls, the red curry chicken, the chicken pad thai, brown rice, and 2 canned pop. It's incredibly rare we see a pre-built combo that actually sounds decent, as they usually include the stuff people aren't as interested in.  The spring rolls were quite good, although pretty much the same as any other asian place. Not much else to say there.  The red curry chicken had a really nice sauce, although it was very liquidy. It would be a lot nicer if it was a creamier consistency and not soupy. Also, I really wish they gave you more of the sticky brown rice, because it was not a proportionate amount to main dishes. If we had known, we would have ordered a second rice container (so, one each) which would've been the right ratio. The actual red curry chicken dish was nice and would be a solid recommend if the sauce was thicker, rather than basically a bath of sauce.  The chicken pad thai was fine. I would order it again especially if in the mood for pad thai, but it wasn't anything to WOW over. I've had better pad thai. I do wish they provided more peanuts than that little container worth. Perhaps 2 containers for that amount of food. Although I do like how it was separated so that someone not into peanuts could avoid.  Speaking of amount of food? The portions of both chicken dishes were plentiful. Between both of us, there are plenty of leftovers, but no rice. Most places give you basically an entire \"main dish tupperware\" worth of sticky rice. Here it was a smaller styrofoam circle. Again, the proportion of rice to main dishes was off.  I was originally going to give it 4 stars, but given how I used a coupon, that skews things. If this was regular menu price, you're taking $34 with tax, plus tip if you have it delivered. I don't think this was worth $34 not because of the quantity, but because I've had better thai/asian for a bit less. We paid around $18 plus a $4 tip which was reasonable, but at regular menu price? I'd be pretty hesitant to order that same combo.  I know I'm stingy, but I'm just being honest. Maybe dining in woth their 'lunch specials' would be better. I would recommend trying this place still, but I'd also recommend more rice + more peanuts for the pad thai + a thicker sauce + maybe 10-15% cheaper."}
{"text":"Went there for take out this afternoon and I have to say i am impressed with the food. I ordered a Panang Chicken and a cup of Tom Kha soup w/Beef. I ordered them a 4 star spicy out of 5. The Tom Kha was a little spicier than i would have expected but very good flavor and was full off meat and mushrooms. I think had i ordered it at a 3 it would have been perfect as even at 4 it was very spicy but because of the other flavors I still wanted to finish it all. The Panang was good as well and just enough heat to my liking but others who don't want their tongues burning may be better at a 2 or 3 star. Again like with the soup there was plenty of meat and veggies as well as plenty of sauce which i love mixing with rice. When ordering for lunch the Panang also includes rice and a veggie egg roll which while not the best or biggest egg roll or the most rice are still a great deal for just under $8. With the total meal coming to $14 after tax i was very pleased and had enough left over for small meal or snack."}
{"text":"Reality is I should be giving  this place 4 stars.  HOWEVER, the yellow curry with mixed seafood I experienced here tonight was one of the best Thai curry dishes of my life.  It was a delicious generous portion with squid, shrimp and scallops cooked to perfection.  Typically in a Thai curry they overcook the squid and shrimp and make them chewy.  However, tonight it was amazing and these folks achieved curry nirvana.  I started my meal with a lycheetini which was delicious.  Had a glass of crisp chardonnay with the curry.  Left content.  Atmosphere was fine, nothing fancy.  Service was fine.  Prices were a steal.  Will I eat here again?  Tomorrow if possible is the answer.  this is my new Thai go to place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the green curry + vegetables/tofu lunch that I ordered here. The rice was cooked beautifully, the curry was DELICIOUS, plenty of veggies and the tofu was great. This was a take-out order, so I can't comment on the dining experience.  Also, portions were HUGE. I ate my fill for lunch, and still had about 1/3 of the meal leftover for later."}
{"text":"Good food,  Good ambience  The food here is delicious. I love the chicken tom yum soup , calamari and spring rolls. The prices are reasonable and service is good."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my most favorite foods of all times. And once I find a place I like, I return!   So after trying Thai Elephant about a year ago, I really enjoyed my food. I decided this was one of my new regular places.   Their Pad-Z-U was really good, I love this dish and usually ordered it. I also usually ordered the Eggplant and a rice dishs.  The last time I ordered my 3 dishes to go, and each dish tasted exactly the same, and they all tasted bland. I was really surprised, normally each dish has such great flavor and tasted different. I am not sure if it was just an unlucky day or if the quality of food has gone down.   But sorry Thai Elephant you lost me as a fan! Your recipes and food should always be as consistent as it can be."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here for the first time today and while not the best Thai curry ever, very good for what AZ has to offer. We did make the mistake of arriving at noon rather than 11:30 and it took 90 minutes for lunch. The young college age waitstaff were clearly overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Started with the hot pot seafood soup. Not good. The seafood itself wasn't bad but Tiff thought the broth tasted like dirty dish water with a hint of lemon dawn. We enjoyed the drunken noodles with shrimp and the pad thai was awesome. Saki was weird, too sweet. Service could've been better and the heat was set at about 90°. All in all It's a great place, just skip the soup!"}
{"text":"Thai Elephant was a surprise. When we first walked in, we expected routine cuisine. Instead, we discovered some mighty good Thai food.   I ordered the Siamese Basil with Chicken. Outstanding. The sauce was divine. C ordered a Green Curry with tofu, which was very good, but mine was more flavorful.  Ambiance: 3.5 stars Service: 3 stars Food: 4 stars"}
{"text":"When the service picks up, they will be better than Thai Basil--not in flavor or quality, but they have WAY more seating.  Menu (at least for lunch) has more variety than Thai Basil.  Nice decor, good portions, $7 for lunch.  The fourth star is conditional on service improvement."}
{"text":"Well, I did it again.  I made the mistake of taking my husband with me to Tempe on his empty stomach.  After our errand, there was the elephant in the car.  His blood was boiling, he tried to deny it, but you could cut the tension with a knife.  He was hungry.  And although I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, Thai Elephant was right there.    The restaurant was clean, staff was friendly, and the food was quick and tasty.  I tried the Elephant Garlic with chicken.  All the veggies were super fresh and still crisp, and the chicken had no suspicious looking or \"discard\" pieces in it, as Ryan C likes to say.  Although I'm not a connoisseur of Thai food, it more than adequately met my criteria to make me a fan!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the South Valley. Flavors are bold and complex. Decor is classy and intimate. Highly recommend the thai tea with boba, Green or Panang Curries, Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Tom Kha Soup. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The naming of Asian themed restaurants is in need of a serious makeover. I think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus; a potential fortune could be made here. Most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland (\"China Food\"), vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures (\"Mr. Yings' Happy China Meal\") or horrific puns (\"Pho Sure\"). Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food, even though that's not always the case (for example, \"China Food\" was actually pretty good).  So when I saw Thai Elephant, my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease (elephantiasis). Plus the fact that it's located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag. But a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so I pulled into the lot......  ......And was pleasantly surprised. This is actually pretty good Thai food. The inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected; there's the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme, but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting. A large screen TV was playing the Suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant. There are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs.  Still wary, I ordered the hot tea, Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai. All of these were above average: the Thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce. I may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in Chicken Pad Thai over the years, and this was definitely above average.   Although I was just here for dinner, I did see that they have a Happy Hour which runs from 5-7 pm.   All in all, it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant! I had the sweet and sour chicken and my husband had the pad thai. Both were really good and generous portions. The place is super casual but nicely decorated and seemed clean."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, food is always great, service is always great.  What more can I say?  Eat here.  I would say try a specific item, but honestly I haven't had one yet that was bad."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch and ordered the Basil Chicken. What I got for a reasonable price was fresh, tasty, and well-presented to boot. The spring roll was maybe a tad larger than what I prefer, but that's not a reflection on the taste. This place wasn't busy, but I think it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is good. Take out orders are ready quickly. I place orders for a few of us at the office and they allow me to pay with separate debit cards. The only reason for the 3 stars is because the spice level is never consistent. I like a little heat but like to still taste my food. Medium is my max heat level. They get it right sometimes but more often than not my medium is really hot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Tempe! The service is great and the food is fantastic. This is one of the few restaurants where my wife and I are not afraid to try new things. Tip: order the \"Swimming Rama\" with tofu and I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix hands down. I don't know what's up the food snob reviews. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is very charming and pleasant if you wish for a nice dinner night out. Treat yourself with their mouth watering coconut ice cream for dessert and any of their curries. Green curry is my favorite! One tip though is to be mindful of the times. They do close for part of the day and re-open."}
{"text":"Popped in as a drive-by while in town for work. I had high hopes because it was fairly busy and smelled good, but it was eh - nothing to write home about. I had the veggie roles to start and they were good. I then had chicken Pad Thai. It was just missing something; just one note. I kept adding spice, then the egg role sauce and so on. Very good portion size w lots of veggies, but just needed another level of flavor. Good and polite service."}
{"text":"christmas night.....and thank goodness they were open.  we orphans were done with holiday drinking and celebrating and not wanting to cook, we perused Yelp for thai places open on this wildly popular holiday and Thai Elephant arrived!  i ordered the Pad Se Yew with tofu. it was as expected....deeeelicious. i love the flat rice noodles and egg. they were just the right amount of texture and the tofu was very nicely cooked. the wife had one of the fish dishes at a Level 4 spiciness....hot damn! literally! my boca was en fuego! but it was delicious with the cruncy beans and mushrooms. we also had the masaman curry (also very hot but superbly rich and creamy) and a sweet potato appetizer. 41 bucks for all 4 plates.   delicious and fast."}
{"text":"I am visiting Phoenix/Tempe for a couple of days and found this place via Yelp. I got their shrimp appetizer, thai iced tea, and their Madness Duck. The food was great!!! They have a great menu and I will definitely be going back before I leave."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, and it arrived promptly within the 30 minutes they promised!  I got the:  - Fresh Rolls. Huge. Each one is the size of 3 normal fresh rolls. Not a ton of flavor in the roll itself, I wouldn't like to have some mint added in. But the peanut sauce was good, and I didn't go hungry.  - Pad See Yu. I love pad see yu, and this one didn't disappoint. Their spice level is extremely mild. But I assumed in advance and asked for extra chili sauce on the side which they were super willing to accommodate. Oh, and the portion was huge.  -  Coconut ice cream. They packaged this separately, and it was delivered in tact! It wasn't quite what I was expecting, had a fair bit of (fresh and really good) honey added to it. There was enough ice cream for a family of 4.   Overall, had a great experience and would definitely be up for eating there again if I have a Thai craving."}
{"text":"Loved my Pad Thai here!  There's so much chicken, tofu & onions. Very peanut creamy as well. So much of the flavors I crave.  Pad Thai is gluten free, the drunken noodles are not gluten free. I was very pleased the staff was familiar with what was gluten & what wasn't - usually Asian places don't know"}
{"text":"Hmm, how shall I begin... the restaurant is literally 2 mins away from my home, so I have ordered from them half a dozen times. For a restaurant on Queen, I think it's decent. They have huge portion lunch specials, but I think dinner's a bit over priced relative to the quality of the food they deliver. The crazy spicy noodle and spicy eggplant I have ordered before are super oily and the basil is really overpowering in both. The curry are decent though I can make better ones at home. The spring rolls and pad thai are alright, nothing that will blow your mind I guess~ I pretty much only go there for the lunch special and because it's super close to me"}
{"text":"Second trip failed to impress.  The service was better this time; though practically anything under an hour wait would have been an improvement.  Unfortunately, my main gripe with Thai Elephant remains the same: they are scared of spicy food.  I ordered Pad Kee Mao and specifically asked that it be Double Thai Hot (that is, as spicy as possible).  What I received 20 minutes later was what might only be described as mild.  It was a huge disappointment.   If my friends all insist on going here again, I may tag along.  But I'll do my best to steer them to something more exciting.  Thai food for grandmas."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beautiful interior and has excellent food! I got a curry (I believe it was Panang) and they give you rice to be able to eat it with too. The dish was delicious and I got what I paid for ~ absolutely delicious. It's a bit of a walk/bike away from ASU's Tempe campus, but so worth it for the quality of food you get there! Definitely give this place a try if you're a Thai food fanatic!!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Thai food, so I convinced a friend to try this place out with me. I ordered the yellow curry with tofu. The curry itself was delicious, probably the best yellow curry I've ever had. Just the perfect blend of salty and sweet, whereas most Thai places I've tried have been overly salty. Rated a star down because 25% of the potatoes were a bit undercooked. They definitely give you a lot of curry, enough for two or three meals. It reheats well (it's soup, after all) and gives you the most bang for your buck.  My friend had the pad thai with chicken. The spice system here is a bit on the Americanized side. Normally a 4/5 level of Thai spiciness would have me reaching for a glass of something, but their 4/5 is more comparable to a 2/5. Not even a little tingle in the mouth. Not a big deal for me since while my mouth likes spicy, the rest of me doesn't (TMI) but my friend was a bit disappointed. The chicken was really good, though, definitely not like the strangely shaped defrosted pieces you might find elsewhere.They also put some fried tofu bits in their pad thai, and strangely enough the tofu tasted a lot better than the tofu in my curry."}
{"text":"Worst Pad Thai I've ever had. Just horrid. REALLY expensive too. $14. I gave a $2 tip because I ordered it as Take Out. So $16 later for the worst Pad Thai ever. Ugh. Never again.   The only reason I'm giving this place two-stars and not one-star is because the service I received was pleasant and accommodating. Also, the decor was lovely."}
{"text":"Actually pretty great Thai food in the Phoenix metro area.  Highly recommend the Siamese Basil dish, very delicious, healthy and full of flavor.  The service is always consistent and fast, can't really go wrong here...wait...you can slightly go wrong, if you order the food at a spicy '#5', you may get eye-watering, gut-wrenching, call me back in 2 weeks hot or, on the other end of the spectrum, 'please pass the red-chile because this is barely touching my tastebuds' hot.  My recommendation, if you want to enjoy your food, order it at a #4 and add the hot stuff."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it took an hour. We were totally ok with the wait. The food came hot so that was a plus. Fried veggie spring rolls were very good. My husband ordered chicken pad Thai. I ordered the Thai fried rice with tofu. The flavor of the rice was good and the broccoli was tender. Over all, not thrilled. Every forkful had onions. I'm ok with some but they were everywhere. This is a matter of preference but I was a little disappointed. I would still recommend this restaurant. It's just not for me."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the best Thai restaurants in Phoneix. I frequently get the drunken noodle with chicken and it's always delicious! The portions are big especially for the price. The next day leftovers are even more spicy and delicious. The parking around here is terrible but luckily it's within close walking distance of the light rail.The restaurant is tiny and intimate with not many tables. However, the service is fvery fast (and friendly) so if it's busy you don't have to wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"Food is really good service for a party of 6 on a slow Sunday is deplorable. We didn't get offered drink refills, no one asked how the food was, food items not received. Sucks because we had to wait 30 mins for the place to reopen at 5p. Food was great again, but service was terribly embarrassing for the stars received."}
{"text":"Delicious! Got the Thai tea with pad Thai and drunken noodles. The portions are huge and packed with authentic flavor. The waitress was fast and attentive and the food came out promptly."}
{"text":"A small group of co-workers and I recently tried Thai Elephant for lunch one day. Wow, what a great find.  We're always looking for places that offer decent to good food at a reasonable price where we can get in and out quickly if need be.  Thai Elephant fit all three of those criteria.  Lunch cost about $10 each (that includes tip), so not bad at all, considering the portions were a good size.  When you order, the waitress asks how spicy you want your food...another check for Thai Elephant! I admit I am not a huge fan of super spicy food, so I asked for them to go pretty mild on the spices, and it came out perfectly for me. I ordered the Siamese Basil with chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was cooked very nicely and was still moist, which I prefer (I am not a fan of dry chicken at all). The vegetables and rice sides were good as well...I left perfectly content but not super full.  Thai Elephant is really small inside and the tables are practically on top of each other, so if you are claustrophobic or don't want people to potentially overhear your conversation, this isn't the place for you.  Service is fast and we were in and out in about 40 minutes.  Parking is available on the street, although sometimes finding a spot can be a challenge.  Great option for those of us that work downtown and are looking for a new, quick lunch joint."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food, near my airport hotel, really friendly staff. Recommended.   They have the 'usual' menu with a few house specialities."}
{"text":"I'm no Thai food expert, but I know I like chicken Pad Thai, and the proportion was enormous for a reasonable price, and unlike some Thai places, they were generous with the chicken too. My only only complaint was the 10 minutes it took to simply grab me a to-go box at the end. Other than that, good experience."}
{"text":"I was looking for Yummy Thai food.  This was not it.  I do not like to post negative reviews however this experience warrants it.  We ordered pork fried rice, pad Thai noodles with tofu, and red ruby curry fish. No taste.  Meh. Even with extra pepper.   My younger son is a picky eater and we asked for fried rice or noodles with nothing on it and they said they could not accommodate us on a special order. We would need to order an entree (which cost $10.95) and request some items to be deleted. I asked why couldn't they just give me $2 side and I would pay extra. They said cannot be done. No flexibility whatsoever.  Throughout the menu they nickel and dime you for many items. One example is ice tea If you ask with no ice then they charge you an extra 75 cents. However when I asked if they can accommodate my son, they said no.  Food was bland and very dry. I will not go back.  Not customer service oriented.  Sorry Thai Elephant. You need to be customer oriented. Peace out"}
{"text":"Ordered fried tofu and pineapple fried rice with shrimp. The tofu is a bit too heavy for the light and crispy fried tofu I'm accustomed to enjoying. The size of the order was plentiful. The pineapple fried rice has large shrimp and not the nasty small ones. This is why I gave four stars. The rice is a bit too sticky, and it's super spicy (even when you order it medium). Overall, given the generous portions and healthy-sized shrimp/meat, the place deserves four stars. Enjoy your meal (and order everything mild unless you want spicy red pepper flakes throughout your food).   I used the delivery option, and it worked well."}
{"text":"Get the Garlic Chicken, the Red Curry, or the Tom Kha soup.  Very good Thai place (maybe the best) in Tempe."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just steps down from my layover hotel in Phoenix.  When we are getting close to landing, my mouth starts to salivate thinking about this place.  I order Shrimp Garlic Elephant, for $12.  It is enough food for two, but I eat it all because I cannot help myself.  I love ordering to-go from here, and then going back to my hotel room to gorge myself while I watch Anderson Cooper 360."}
{"text":"Took my cousin, her hubby, and a friend there the other evening for dinner.   YUMMMM!!  is all I can say for what I had.    I ordered the seafood volcano.   I love the fact they don't add some kind of thickener to the sauce.   I loved the veggies and the shrimp.   Prepared perfect, and the seasoning in the sauce is something I wish I could duplicate.  I wanted to save some to take home, but it was sooo good I ate the whole thing.   Darn!  My mates had the drunk fried rice, the seafood ginger stinger and the imperial veggie dish.    I tasted them all.   I would definitely order the seafood ginger stinger and the imperial veggie dish when I return.   The server was attentive, efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  If you live I  the Queen West hood and you want some good Thai. You've found your spot.   Beware of the haters I this thread. They don't know what's good."}
{"text":"Got the Pad Z U twice from here. The first time I got it at a 2 out of 5 on the spicy scale. It wasn't spicy at all it was delicious but not spicy.   Then I go again and get a 4 again wasn't spicy at all but had more sauce on it then the previous. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai place in the Phoenix area; I just cannot get enough of Thai Elephant. The red curry is like heaven in a bowl! It has affordable prices and great selections. I like that you can have a quick meal if you are in a hurry and not shell out a ton a of money. Lunch there is amazing, as it includes soup and a spring roll. In Tempe and surrounding areas, this is the only way to eat Thai!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was friendly and quick. We ate the pineapple fried rice with pork (#85) and the pineapple coconut curry and both were excellent. Don't forget the thai iced tea!  Oh yeah, prices were reasonable. One entree can easily serve two people or provide good leftovers and ranged from $8-12."}
{"text":"Great place! Food and staff are wonderful. Would be nice if the news wasn't on tv so one could relax and unwind; escape for a minute !!!"}
{"text":"Was craving Thai, so we did it up. Ordered the glass noodle salad, Thai veggie rolls and fried rice with the $4 seafood add on. We ordered the fried rice with mild spice and it was very underwhelming, flavor wise. It tasted very plain and there wasnt even a hint of spice. We asked for \"mild,\" not the \"no spice\" option. We wanted some flavor, mild Thai food. Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"If you find yourself downtown and in the mood for Thai this place is great.  Small and cozy (although not much ambiance) it offers friendly service, good food and relatively cheap prices.  It is walking distance from downtown hotels, on the dash line and if you ever work on the weekends like I do, one of the few places that is open Sunday night for dinner.   Plus, its super friendly to solo dinners with its single TV that seems to always have on a romantic comedy to giggle at while dinning alone."}
{"text":"It is more like a 3.5 stars. This place is an OK place to have Thai food. It is not in downtown, but you can walk there in the summer. However, I would suggest that you order food \"to go.\" For dining in, I find the place too small, looking too much as a food court stand. Maybe it is just my impression, the prices are not very high, so maybe we have to balance somehow, but I don't enjoy dining in this place.  The food is good. It is not exceptional, not fantastic, but good enough. I would give 4 stars for the food alone so it would average at 3.5 stars. I have tried the curries and the Pad Thai and they are all good. I will order from this place in the future and update my review as I tried other dishes."}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried out this place the other night by placing a to-go order.  We both liked the food and were impressed with the spiciness of the dishes.  The meat was lean and the wide noodles were amazing, but I thought the veggies lacked freshness.  The customer service was good and the restaurant seemed quaint."}
{"text":"I've dined at Thai Elephant a few times, but more often than that, I've ordered food to go, and I have not been disappointed.  If you're considering Thai food, you cannot go wrong with this place.  As a matter of fact, I'd recommend going out of your way for food from Thai Elephant vs any other Thai in the Valley, even if it may be closer to home.  I highly recommend the Green Curry and the fresh rolls, although I haven't had anything from Thai Elephant that I didn't like.  I'm definitely a fan of this place and I'm craving it now just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"well this was my1st try at thai food! and il pass lol not my thing. i got the grilled chicken and it was like rubber and i took one bite and saved the rest for my wife and went and got some other food eleswhere, i could not eat it. but i bet it would be great if you like this kinda food"}
{"text":"this place is awful...  out of the 4 chefs, NONE of them were THAI.... strangely enough all the waitresses were Thai???  had the spicy thai eggplant and papaya salad..  thai papaya salad is supposed to be very tart with a strong taste of lime..i think they forgot this key ingredient... not even a hint of lime flavor although the green papaya was chopped nicely.  thai eggplant was ridonkulously BAD.  i had 3 measly pieces of eggplant in my dish.  the rest was overcooked meat and overcooked veggies.  overcooked broccoli is the worst... kind of loses it's nice green color and firm texture.  the sauce for the thai eggplant wasn't quite right either, and reminded me of the entree \"beef broccoli\" from a Chinese restaurant.  again, this place was BAD.... phuck phoenix, dude. i'm over it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times have been great.  It's not the greatest thai in the world, but i dont expect it to be.  The service is friendly, and efficient. The prices are very reasonable for lunch and dinner, with big portions always.  I had the shrimp pad thai on my first visit, and it was very tasty indeed.  this week, we had a peanut shrimp, and a tofu ruby curry. both very good, and too much for one meal, which i am happy to take home the leftovers for a midnight snack.  they have 4 beers on tap to choose from, and a great back patio when its nice outside. however, i like to sit at the front facing queen st w. great spot.  I definitely recommend thai elephant as a viable option for queen west dining. It wont be your favourite place in the world, but it will bring you back for more.  slan"}
{"text":"Have only gotten a few items here but they have all been yummy! My husband loves the madness duck and my favorite is pad z u! Take out is always fast too!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from Thai Elephant tonight and I was thoroughly impressed with a number of aspects:  1.  They were open late on a weeknight, particularly a MONDAY, when 98% of downtown looks like 'I Am Legend'.  2.  Portions are generous.  I ordered Pad Thai for dinner that will persevere to be my lunch for tomorrow.  An order of egg rolls comes in fives.  3.  Prices are reasonable.  I was expecting elevated prices to coincide with downtown rent and Monday convenience.  Chicken Pad Thai was $11 and the egg rolls $5.  Not bad considering that translates to two meals.  4.  Use of space is charming.  Classier than an upscale dive like like House of Nanking, but you can wear flip-flops there.  Looks and feels very Feng Shui'd out, dressed in red and walnut.    5.  Location is perfect, not only for my situation, but for other downtown denizens.  Its pretty much at Phoenix's 0,0, where all addresses radiate outward unto the gaping depths of the Valley starting from there.   6.  Most importantly, the food was delicious.  The noodles were moist and heavy while the chicken was light and tender.  I ordered 'medium' spice, but after the dish I was wanting more of a burn.  There was also a shortage of scallions in the dish.  I downed the few present in two small bites.  The veggie egg rolls were tasty, crunchy, and flaky -- almost like a fried spring roll.  I was impressed by the use of pumpkin inside.  The accompanying sweet and sour sauce was much milder that what you typically get beside an eggroll and was a nice pairing.    I cannot think of a reason not to go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"It was a cold Saturday night and I was craving some warm curry, and I remembered a while back Teresa S suggested I give Thai Elephant a try, so that's what I did!  I was already out and about and currently waiting on others, so I got out my Yelp app and looked them up, and saw I could place an order though Yelp, I checked out the menu and placed the order for pick up.  I ordered the Satay Chicken and Siam Masaman Curry. The Satay Chicken was perfectly grilled and was tender and juicy, and went great with peanut sauce,  I just love the peanut sauce, I could smoother everything in that! Oh soo good!  The Masaman curry I ordered medium heat and with chicken, and it was just what I had been craving.  The curry was sweet, creamy and spicy all the same time, the chicken and potatoes and carrots were tender, this was the perfect dish for a cold Sat night ( and for a Sunday brunch haha, gotta love leftovers).   Thank you Teresa for the suggestion I think I have found a new goto Thai place near me."}
{"text":"Great flavor, great service! Wish I lived here so I could visit more often! Try it... You won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Appetizer: Thai Veggie Rolls (spring rolls) Just as you would expect of a spring roll, deliciously flaky and tasty.  Entrée: Red Curry with Fried Tofu Big points for being able to make this dish without fish sauce, most thai restaurants make their curries with fish and/or oyster sauce. Serving was generous, that I'll be eating leftovers for days. The tofu was too fried, but was edible when soaked in the curry.   The curry comes with mushrooms, and I specifically asked for no mushrooms. The waitress asked, \"is it an allergy or preference?\" I really appreciated this because they were taking food allergies seriously. Unfortunately, I still had mushrooms in my food, and i just got an \"oh\" from the staff.  Major disappointment for me.   Overall, the food was delicious, service could have been attentive."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by Thai Elephant - and I love Evan B.'s comment about the lack of elephant on the menu.  It's a small place, so maybe they didn't have room to prep the pachyderm for Elephant with Basil.  But I digress...  Came here before a show at the Dodge and we were one of many tables doing the same.  The waitress asked us before we sat down if we were headed to a concert afterwards - gotta love the attentiveness from the get go.  The food came out quickly and was prepared well - huge portions of food and tons of veggies in just about everything.  Off topic - I've noticed that in AZ it seems that a lot of the Thai places put mixed veggies in every dish and just change up the carb, protein and sauce.  Not a bad thing per se, but just a little strange.  Case in point, my drunken noodles (usually chow fun noodles, onions, tomatoes and basil) had pad thai noodles with cabbage, carrots, broccoli, green beans and more.  It looked exactly like the plate of pad thai plus veggie mix.  Random, but it was tasty and I wasn't feeling like a snob ;)  I asked for my food \"Thai Hot\" and damn, it was just that.  I'm a bit of a spice queen, and this was the first place I've been where it's been as hot as promised.  Like lip-numbing goodness.  If you don't like it hot, take it easy here.  I don't know if I'd take a separate trip here unless I was already downtown, but it was worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Edimame and fresh rolls for an opener and they were delicious.  Thai tea and Siamese basil beef for dinner was just as spicy as I ordered it and very flavorful.   I am a Thai fan and this spot is very authentic as well as a very peasant atmosphere for business or casual dining. I will be back when visiting Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I was skeptical as I stood outside the Elephant reading their menu.  If nothing jumps out at me at a Thai place, I get worried.  I was also in an unbelievably bad mood, and I didn't need it exacerbated by a bad Thai experience.  Thankfully The Elephant came to the rescue.  I had the yellow curry and it was a great blend of heat and taste. I was initially annoyed at the lack of rice they gave me with my carryout order, but it turned out to be appropriate for the meal. It really made me want to go back and try the other stuff I hesitated on.  I got take out so I can't speak to the lunch experience inside - it did seem quite packed.  But if their service is up to par, I can highly recommend stopping in here for a bit when you're downtown. He who hesitates is lost."}
{"text":"I've never been to the restaurant but the delivery has been excellent. The curry Pad Thai is great and the delivery is pretty quick and the drivers are friendly. They also deliver quite far.  One warning regarding their website, it crashes the Safari browser for Mac. I tried to inform the owner of this last year and he said there was nothing unusual about the site. I had to go on a PC and download the menu in PDF form so I don't have to navigate to their site. It's a small thing but a little frustrating."}
{"text":"Not authentic at all. Anyone who's been to Thailand and had street food there will hands down say that this is far from genuine Thai food.   1. Nam tok \"beef salad\"- since when does salad mean stir-fry? Disgusting. More disgusting? the mite sized insect that I found scampering on a lettuce leaf in the dish. That sucker was fast, I wanted to take a photo for proof! Also poor cuts of meat used (maybe that makes it semi authentic that no piece was left unused?) 2. Thai ice tea- actually good 3. Sticky rice- it's hard to come by sticky rice not transformed into dessert, so I was impressed when they had it. They microwaved the hell out of it and it was a hot, dehydrated chewy flat rice cake.   When I told the waitress that it wasn't very good and that the nam tok  wasn't good and I thought it would be Thai style (which definitely wasn't that!!!) she said \"oooh sorry!\" and that's it.   No consolation prize.  I assume they're doing well by the benz that pulled up to drop off groceries, more like \"gross-eries\""}
{"text":"My roommate and I broke our strict diets today for a Thai craving and we were happy we did! The restaurant was really quiet tonight, as most downtown places usually are on Monday nights, so we got quick, friendly service. I ordered the swimming rama, which was beef in peanut sauce over steamed veggies. Yum! Very tasty, and would definitely order again. Roomie got pad pik sod, which was mixed vegetables and jalepenos with chicken. Watch out this one was spicy but sooo flavorful! He loves spicy food and his eyes were a little glassy through the meal, but by the end we were both members of the clean plate club. Our dining partners got yellow chicken curry and tom yum soup, which looked amazing as well.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is open and clean, if a bit sterile. Prices were reasonable about $10-15 for most plates. My entree was definitely enough for me to return, but everyone else's food looked so good too, I might have to try something new next time!..... but for now back to our diets :|"}
{"text":"This has become our go to place for Thai takeout. The service is fast and the portions are normally good for two servings. They usually include a complimentary dessert sampling or spring rolls which is great!  I have dined in a couple of times too. The place is quite small so if you are going on the weekend it's better to make a reservation. One thing to note is that they don't have a liquor license. I have tried their fried rice, noodle and curry dishes. All of them were really flavourful. The fried banana dessert with honey is quite delicious and different than what you get at other places. Overall the food is really tasty and portion sizes are generous compared to Pai and KSR. Definitely a must try if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Spicy. And ketchupy pad thai. It's definitely fast-food thai.  PASS."}
{"text":"Love this place. When I am in town, I stop here to get my Panang Curry fix. It's a big serving."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I love their paint job inside. Yes...it is nice and shimmery. Moving on to the food, it is great! I've tried about a dozen things on their menu and have enjoyed everything. It's hard to go wrong here. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"I arrived at 3:30 PM on Sunday afternoon.  There was one table just finishing their meal when I arrived.  The waitress met me at the register and asked where I would like to sit.  She advised me that the restaurant closes at 4 PM to change over to dinner service, so I had 30 minutes to complete my meal.  She asked what I wanted to drink and went to get my water.  On her return, I told her I would like Som Tom, no green beans, Thai hot, with an order of jasmine rice.  She asked my consideration as she did not have her pad and could I wait while she went to get it?  Away she went to retrieve her order book, and on her return, she asked me again what I wanted.  I repeated my order and she wrote it down.  Off to the kitchen she went, looking at her watch as she walked away.  The table seated next to me were finished with their meal.  One of the diners opened the folio, looked at the bill and whistled.  He pulled out a card and walked up to the register.  The waitress came and processed his sale.  As they were walking out, another couple entered the restaurant.  The waitress let them know they had about 25 minutes before the restaurant closed to change over from lunch to dinner, and they might want to consider ordering to go so they would not feel rushed.  They answered that they would do their best to be done by 4 pm, so she brought them to a table.  She presented their menus and asked what they would like to order.  One diner asked for some water and a moment to consider the choices.  The other said they were ready.  The waitress advised she would bring water as soon as they placed their orders.  Once this was done, she went to the kitchen.    On her return, she brought water for the other table.  She went to the back service area, by the door to the outdoor dining, where she took out her compact and proceeded to powder her nose.  After that, she reapplied her lipstick.  She went to the kitchen and returned with my salad.  It appears the kitchen prepares their papaya ahead of time and the green beans are incorporated into the salad then.  The chef picked out the larger pieces of green bean, but what remained was lots of small pieces of chopped up green bean in the salad.  Portion size was discouraging, about 1 cup of salad on top of 2 cups of chopped lettuce, and while there was no mention of carrots in the salad, there was more carrot than there was papaya.  Rice was about 3/4 of a cup and apparently near the bottom of the pan.  It was dry and sticky.  The spice on the salad rated a 2.  I asked the waitress for more chile and lime.  She told me they were out of lime, but I could have lemon instead.  I repeated the request for chile, advising that lemon would not be an adequate substitute.  She returned with some chili.  I sprinkled this on my salad, but it was of no benefit.   While Som Tom should have accents of fish sauce, lime, palm sugar and chile, I tasted no sweet or lime.  The chile was disappointing.    Probably the worst part of the experience was the dirty table next to mine.  It was never cleared while I was at the restaurant.    After bringing me the chile for my order, the waitress went to the back service area and again applied powder and lipstick, then she brought the order to the other table.  She did not clear the table next to mine, nor did she offer to refill my water, though I was at the bottom of the glass.  This place may, as I have heard, have great drink prices for happy hour and cheap munchies for the same, but the salad and rice I received were certainly not the focal point of the chef.  I am doubting I will try this place again, as it seems to be all about the Happy Hour crowd."}
{"text":"I've been back to Thai Elephant several times and still think it is a quality Thai place, however the stinginess on the rice is totally obnoxious to me.  They don't give you a enough to finish your meal, and then charge you for extra for more.  I am a strong believer in providing ample (enough) rice for all meals Asian and Thai Elephant doesn't agree with me on said statue.  If you are a rice lover, prepare to pay."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time. Consistently decent Thai food. Good customer service."}
{"text":"I loooooved the Phoenix location, so when it closed I was really disappointed and made a note to try this one to see if it could take it's place. Today I did. The place was packed with a lunch crowd as the one in Phoenix always was. Very busy, a bit loud.  I ordered the Golden Shrimp appetizer, and the Drunken Noodle with Chicken, both of which I frequently got at the other location. The breading on the shrimp was a bit too fried (not burnt but very dark) and greasy, the sweet dipping sauce was good and helped make up for that. I love flavorful food...the Drunken noodle was good, but the noodles and veggies were cooked a tad too long also and lacked the flavor I desire. This is being critical, cause once you get spoiled...you get spoiled! The food was good, but definitely not outstanding like the Phoenix location had been. I will probably go back here and try a few more dishes, but I will also be looking for that perfect/\"favorite\" Thai place as my go to. I don't think this is one I will crave! :)"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Drake looking for a casual Thai restaurant nearby. Just started walking East remembering one on my drive in.   It was just about empty when I was there (9pm). The woman who ran it was very friendly. Put me in the window table with the great view of folks walking by. Avocado salad and Shrimp Pad Thai were excellent - great taste and presentation. Would certainly go here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from their website.  At checkout, they have a promo code that allows 10% off your meal if you place it online.  This is great because it covers a small tip for the delivery guy!  We ordered:  FRESH ROLLS:  They were pretty good, peanut sauce is extra but we purchased it.  Not the best fresh rolls I have ever had but certainly not the worse.  One thing I didn't like is that there are 2 pieces that are just middle pieces, so the filling tends to fall out when you eat these ones.  PAD THAI:  Not the star of the evening, but I asked for no egg in the comments and they gave me no egg!  Huzzah.  It was very basic, lots of peppers as vegetables, and a solid choice.  CASHEW NUT:  I ordered a cashew nut tofu and I really enjoyed it.  The sauce is more soupy so you can really eat it over rice.  Very good flavors.  YELLOW CURRY:  Yummy.  This was really tasty.  It comes with brown rice which is a plus.  I liked the curry flavor itself, potatoes were cut a little big for me but that's just how they do it.  All in all, I will definitely order from here again.  It was a good price (they also have combos which make things cheaper).  Ordering online was super easy and I'd recommend it to anyone, wether you're doing pickup or delivery.  PS:  The food heats up really well and leftovers were great for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I love thai elephant everything about is nice and lean the pad thai chicken is perfect and delicious and the employees so polite and respectful definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"I made an order today, called back an hour later and they hadn't even started my order, and sounded like they had no plans to do so. Great place to order from if you really don't care if your food ever comes. Atrocious."}
{"text":"The food is quite good, if they can get the food out of the kitchen!  We recently went there with 6 people at lunch.  It took over 30 minutes for the food to come out of the kitchen, and there was a 15 minute wait between the first meal at the table and the last meal.  Then they charged us the 18% gratuity for having 6 people!!  That was just not right."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here, about a 5-10 min drive from the location (but the traffic is rather heavy too).  Ordered at 8.30pm.  Don't know how they did it so fast really... Delivery came at 9.00pm sharp!  Very fast as noted by other reviewers.  The pad thai was decent, but tasted rather a bit tomato-ey.  Also had the massamam curry and ginger stir fry.  All of the dishes punched a lot of flavour (unlike several other thai places).  That said, I wouldn't say any of the dishes were amazing in themselves.  It's a great delivery option that I would certainly use again."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Food is very tasty...lots of fried goodies on the appetizer menu. Curries and noodles are done right...noodles are not too greasy and the dishes can be made extra spicy but don't come that way so the kids can eat here too.  Delivery available from here through secondary services...and take out is usually ready in 15-20 min!"}
{"text":"The recent experiences I have have been disappointing.  Not only the food, but the service.  I hadn't been in awhile and thought I would give it another try.  I ended up asking waitress to take my order off of the bill and not one apology was given for the inadequate food or time we waited to try to resolve our issue.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Busy place. Decent prices. Good lunch specials. Average. The only reason they may deserve 4 stars...they have thai chili peppers. It's pretty small and noisy."}
{"text":"Just came home from a great meal at Thai Elephant.  We had only been to Thai Basil, many times, and since we pass this everytime we go there, this time we decided to stop at T.E. instead.  I am glad I did.  I wanted Thai because I woke up feeling a little cold coming on and love spicy food when I am feeling under the weather.  The restaurant is pretty big compared to Basil and not as warm, but it is perhaps a little more formal and classy.  They also serve alcohol, which includes Mai Tai's and Thai beer.   We both, my girlfriend and I, had very nice Jasmine tea.  The menu is big, maybe 30 dishes, and there is a separate lunch menu which is about the same size.  The average price is about $10 for dinner and the variety is great.  There are some cute typos on the menu, I think that is mark of authenticity, as is the waitress' not-so-great English.  We ordered pad-thai and a Masaman curry.  The pad thai was delicious, the chicken with it was very fresh and it always comes with tofu, which was better than most tofu I've had.  The Masaman (sweet nut) curry was delicious and spicy.  I had only had Basil's Masaman, and this was much better, more taste than just coconut milk (though Basil's is good too).  I would go to Basil for a cheaper meal, but this seems like a little more work went into the sauces and meat was better quality.  They have a nice happy hour with cheap dishes and drinks from 5-7pm."}
{"text":"The best Drunken Noodle I've ever had! I'll definitely make this a priority when visiting for work again!"}
{"text":"The service is very good and the girls are very sweet. The only complaint I have was my food was very salty and it wasn't spicy the way I asked for. I had the beef salad and beef soup without the noodles. My boyfriend's Fisherman's Grill was also very salty."}
{"text":"The s/o and I were craving Thai food, but didn't want to drive all the way to our usual spot (Chanpen Thai), so we ended up at Thai Elephant instead.  The crazy beef salad is different from any other Thai beef salad we've ever ordered, but in a good way. The beef was crunchy, and the flavors were less limey and more garlicky. At first I was disappointed at how little lettuce there was, but it ended up being a good ratio!   We got our usual: yellow curry with chicken for him, and pad see ew with beef for me. He loved his dish, though I found my pad see ew a bit dry, hardly spicy  (though I got a 4), and a bit lacking in egg. I did, however, like that they included cabbage, which differs from the typical pad  see ew that only has a few sprigs of broccoli in it. The portions were large (about 2.5 meals for me), which was great, but I dont think I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"2/5 thai?  see my review for sing high...again my fault for trying to have asian cuisine in phoenix.  it was your standard greasy thai fried rice. msg flavor. nuff said."}
{"text":"New to Thai food and I really like this place so far as I've tried it. The little crispy rolls were tasty. Good lunch specials. BF had the pad Thai with beef. Tasty! I had drunken noodles with chicken, also delicious. Went solo for dinner recently and got the chicken pad Thai and a Bangkok salad which was missing the spinach. That was just a big plate of big whole leaves of green leaf lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and sliced cucumber with a bland peanut dressing on the side. If there had been condiments on the table I'd probably have tried to fix that up a bit. I asked for a salad plate and cut up some into bite sized pieces to actually eat. Liked the noodles a lot. Big portion, nice ambience despite being in a strip mall and parking facing the glass front of the place. Good service, prices just fine, and I look forward to trying more dishes."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Wyndham hotel and this restaurant was within walking distance. It is also the only Asian restaurant I actually wanted to try here in Phoenix. I ordered the Drunken noodles and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was! I choose medium spicy and it came out just right. The portion size is huge and they weren't stingy about the vegetables or meat. My only complaint is that the meat tasted a bit overdone but overall I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Gets crowded at lunch time.  Good prices and tasty food.  All of your typical Thai entree selections.  I will definitely go back and I highly recommend this restaurant.   Yum !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Be ready to wait! And wait....and wait. So we were taken to our seat behind some random bush and never got to place our order. We waited for about 20 minutes and no one came so we just took off. Will never come back to be honest I don't know why we went there in the first place the last time we went the rice was undercooked two times"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite here with my girl Amanda before hitting up a concert downtown, and the food was so tasty we should have just skipped the concert and stayed at the restaurant!   I got the drunken noodle - ordered it mild (I believe you can order mild, medium or hot) and it still had the perfect amount of spice. Amanda got hers with grilled tofu - it was incredibly good! Top that dinner off with a Thai tea and you have yourself a nice little meal!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Thai when we're eating in. The Pad Thai is underwhelming, but the Thai Noodles, curries and eggplant dish are all great. And the spring rolls are the best."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch, dinner, or take out. I've always been pleased with the food that I have gotten, though the level of spicy varies from day to day. The prices are a little high for what it is but all in all it's great food all around. This has been my usual Thai place for a while and will probably continue to be until I find something better. Also, the Tom Kha is to die for."}
{"text":"We held our monthly dinner here this time.  The food was exceptional; however service was not on point, they missed a dish, screwed up the check and never offered refills of reg. Iced tea or water.  I highly recommend for food."}
{"text":"Came here friday evening after a long drive from california.  It was nice that they had a happy hour menu for the time we showed up.  We ordered the blanket shrimp as well as the golden shrimp and the calamari for appetizers.  They were crisp and crunchy and the sauces accompanied the food well.  I ordered the seafood siam manaman curry medium heat, and the amount of curry they provide was generous.  Also had large portions of fish and scallops which was nice.  Overall u wish it was spicier but that was on me, u got it 3 out of 5 on the hot scale.  We also ordered a mild Tom kha soup.  Again, wish it was spicier but I had made the choice tho.  Buy their mixed drink was watered down and I couldn't taste the liquor in it unfortunately... Service was fast, the servers were attentive and nice, decor was inviting.  The only knock tho was my dad stated there were flies flying around his feet and he visualized several of them as well, which is offputting  If not for that it would have been a definite 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Was used to going to Thai Basil for my Thai curry but decided to change it up. Didn't know what to expect but ordered red curry hoping it would be as good. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was even better. Very tasty and rich, and didn't skimp as much as other places on the meat portion. I really hope that it wasn't just a one time thing and that the quality is consistent every time because I'm definitely planning on coming back. Not exactly inexpensive, but if the quality and portions stay solid it will be worth it. The only complain is that our server didn't split the check when we asked her to."}
{"text":"Golden shrimp is to die for. Pad Thai is pretty spot on too. 3/5 spicey is just enough to get that nose just a tad runny. Splendid place. Prices were great especially happy hour and being in the middle of Tempe."}
{"text":"I go to this place mostly for the patio, which is excellent in a neighbourhood full of crowded patios with lineups. It's shaded and decorated with colourful flowers.   Their food is mid-range Canadian Thai. Similar to the Friendly Thai or other big chain. They have everything you'd expect to see at a thai restaurant, but nothing too special. Mango salad is very good, above average.  The service is quite good. Sometimes there's a language barrier depending on who's taking your order, but I've been enough times to know what is vegetarian and what isn't. The lady who is regularly there is really nice and attentive. She will ask the kitchen a question if she doesn't know the answer which is nice for people with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Tiny little place with slow kitchen when busy.  Darkish decor; still looks a bit like a bar from the earlier part of the 20th century.  Friendly help could be better organized.  Food is good but about a dollar or two more than Thai restaurants in less trendy areas.  Nothing we had stood out as outstadning, though the mango salad was very tasty.  Names of menu items listed in English; you need to read the descriptions if you are used to using the Thai names.  Selection is pretty much standard Thai restaurant fare; no unusual or regional dishes."}
{"text":"I don't usually like peanut sauce but tried it at Thai elephant and it was great. Nice location near the light rail."}
{"text":"Very good Thai reminds me of my favorite place back home... Chicken satay is awesome... My favorite dish is the Elephant garlic Beef... It's awesome and their soy sauce is not your typical Kimlan (even thought its in a Kimlan jar) and is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's embarrassing, but I order delivery from Thai Elephant at least twice a month. I would order it more often if not for my partner who can't understand how I can order the same thing all the time. Pad See Ew with tofu- delicious. Massaman curry/Yellow curry/Green curry with chicken- delicious. Mango salad- delicious. Why mess with perfection? Delivery is FAST and accurate. Never been to the eat-in location."}
{"text":"Yum! This lunch was on point. Today I ordered in a basil lunch special, fresh spring rolls, drunken chicken fried rice,and sweet and sour chicken. All of the food was great hot and fresh by the time it got to my door, the only thing that reduced my review by one star would be the sweet and sour chicken as it lacked the classic sweet flavors."}
{"text":"Unpalatable.   I am a spicy food connoisseur. I like it extra hot  to eye-watering. However:  My throat and stomach are extremely sore right now from the \"spicy\" dishes at this place. Dear Thai Elephant Sadists: When you are running a restaurant, you need to know that when a customer requests a dish made \"spicy,\" which is on your menu and not a special request, this is not an invitation to a staff joke where you dump two tablespoons of crushed red pepper directly into a single order. I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor, not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy. \"I'll show YOU what spicy means, DUBYA.\" Because I happen to be Asian, grew up on kimchee, and I can take it. Until today - this is just plain ridiculous. Who the FUCK would EVER eat it like this?? PLEASE see the photo I uploaded of this piece of broccoli with nothing but PURE CRUSHED CHILIS STUCK IN ITS BRANCHES.  If it's going to be super, ass-flaming spicy when you order it, they should tell you it's over-the-top and not intended for you to actually taste your food. I have been guzzling water and rinsing my mouth and it's going to be a few hours before I can even find something else to eat while my tastebuds and lips recover."}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai and the chicken satay skewers are awesome! My husband was also impressed with their mixed drink - I can't remember the name now! We ate on the patio (it was a nice night out) and the service was good. The inside seating area was also nice and not loud. If we are ever in the area again, we'd gladly return!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food in downtown Phoenix. Who knew? Great, friendly staff, and the owner is really engaged, helping deliver food, water, etc. The waiter recommended an amazing eggplant dish. On future visits, I will definitely try his other top recommended dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered their veggie dinner combo - veggie and tofu pad Thai, veggie spring rolls and substituted the second entree for veggie and tofu green curry. Delivered through UberEATS in 30 minutes and the food was tasty and authentic. For on the go or quick Thai meal, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Thai Elephant for 4 years. I am a big fan. Their food is fairly consistent.  Dishes I like.  Chu Choo Shrimp Red Curry Panang Curry Yellow Curry  This is pretty much all I eat there."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a legit, hidden gem that can get pretty busy over weekday lunches.  Be careful when asking for spice as their \"Thai Hot\" is no joke.  Great Fresh Rolls and Red Curry."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai with extra vegetables and spicy eggplant with beef. They added zucchini as extra vegetable to pad thai and by the time I got home it was soggy and watery, wrong vegetable to add. Eggplant was also full of wrong vegetables and lacks in taste.  They get 3 starts for quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Open seven days a week, this little thai restaurant is among many eateries in the West Queen West area.   Though I've rarely seen it busy, it would be a shame if this little place closed down. With a competitive lunch special starting from 11:30am to 3:30pm, it draws local business patrons in the area. On numerous visits, their staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy if you want to enjoy a nice quiet lunch or dinner.   Available for take-out and delivery, which I often do when visiting, Thai Elephant Cafe has a decent sized menu full of soups, curries and noodle dishes. Their Platter appetizer dish is big enough for two people, and I'd recommend their lemongrass coconut soup, N Panang (it's not a typo here, folks) Curry dish and Curry Pad Thai."}
{"text":"One tip, show up right at 11, or you might as well wait to eat till 1:00.  this place is PACKED, and it is packed for a reason.  AMAZING food.  I have been here a few times now and felt that it is time to give a review.  I am big on going to a place at least three times unless the first time was just horrible.  By far the BEST Pad Thai with Chicken I have ever had.  There is just the right amount of food. Not to little, and not to much.  The chicken was cooked just perfect.  Make sure to get a Thai tea, NO MATTER WHAT.  You may or may not like it on the first sip, and it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor, but it is delicious.  (tastes NOTHING like regular tea)  If you are in the mood for curry, then you cant go wrong with the red or yellow curry, both make my mouth water just thinking of them.  This place is a little slow on getting the orders out, but, it is because it is so busy that you cant really complain.  Just be patient if it is taking a little longer than normal because the food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars loosely... this place is gang busters... read the rest here... http://www.thaifoodaficionado.com/2012/07/thai-elephant-bistro-tempe-az.html"}
{"text":"The Thai food here used to be really good. What happened? I had the red curry chicken and it used to be fantastic but not anymore. So many vegetables, how can you even mix the rice in. It was bland and wasn't even spicy at all. Others who got the drunken noodles, they were bland, not really fried. Everything has gone downhill in the last two years after the cook left."}
{"text":"After waiting an agonizing hour for our food to arrive we were pleasantly greeted with delicious crispy veggie rolls, a nice (but certainly not 5 spicy) yellow chicken curry and a delightful beef salad. The 3 comes from the fact that the Pad Thai was dreadfully dry and flavorless... Eventually we resorted to pouring all of the leaked liquids from the other packages on top of the dry noodles to allow a very disappointed 16 year old to eat. Overall, eh.   We will likely try again, but with VERY specific instructions (e.g. add flavor and sauce)."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food- and we have eaten Thai all over the world.  It can compete with authentic Thai that we have eaten in NYC.  WE will certainly be back. The Tom Kha soup was excellent here!   We also enjoyed the Red Curry and a delish pad Thai.   The place is hip and clean and the service was above par. way to go, Thai elephant!"}
{"text":"Its my favorite Thai place in Tempe.  Sometimes there is a wait, but its always worth it.  My favorite is the Siamese Basil Chicken."}
{"text":"i would love love love love to explore the down town area...(and i mean south of roosevelt) if it wasn't so impossible to park. i guess there are plenty of parking lots, that is if you want to spend 10 dollars. sigh.  regardless of the poopy parking, the thai elephant is really good. the atmophere is small and authentically decorated.  i love the thai hut roof that they positioned over the cash register area. my beau and i split vegi rolls. they were crispy and delicious. he got the pad thai and i got the red curry. RECOMENDATION: if you have any tolerance to thai chili at all, get HOT. i was a pansy and ordered medium...and regretted it. yum yum yummy."}
{"text":"A very friendly and happy place to eat tasty Thai food.  The serving staff were splendid and lots of fun to talk to. Food was fresh - if a little lacking in finesse, but the proof was in the flavours.  We had various red and green curry's and some simple starters. It's not award winning stuff, but inexpensive, yummy and simple.  I suspect this is a firm favourite with students during term time and who could blame them? Drinks prices were average and the whole meal (with tips) came to around $25 a head. Great value!"}
{"text":"Thai Elephant has been calling my boyfriend's name since we moved downtown, so I finally caved last night. I haven't had Thai food in ages so this was going to be an experience.   Unfortunately, prior reviews had said that they were pretty much able to make their whole menu gluten free. False. Only the curry dishes, of which I'm not a fan, and the Pad Thai dish are safe. Everything else has a soy sauce base and they can't just \"86 the sauce.\"  The Pad Thai was good and it came out extremely fast. Literally, I blinked and he had it on the table. Note to customers: If you're a spicy-food-junkie the hot will literally burn your esophagus. You'll love it! I ordered medium and my body hurt long afterward. It's mild for me next time.     If you're in a hurry definitely a great place to eat and run! Also, don't skimp on the Thai Iced Tea. You'll be glad you didn't."}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp while staying at the Aloft Tempe hotel. After a long day of traveling and client work I didn't want to go out to get food (Aloft doesn't have room service....boo). I ordered the basil stir-fry with beef and an order of edamame. They have an annoying 18$ minimum so I ordered a perrier to meet the minimum. The food arrived later than the yelp24 app estimated, the perrier was warmish, the edamame was kinda warm and the basil stir-fry came with chicken.  CHICKEN!!! I thought to myself \"where's the beef?!?\" but the food was very warm, the food smelled okay and I was starving so I just ate it but I wasn't happy about it.  The total price came to a little over $25, which is a bit pricey for an incorrect order of thai food."}
{"text":"Love this place ... The food is delicious - the Pad Thai with chicken is bursting with flavor - there isn't a thing I've tried that I didn't like.   The mood is perfect - it's one of those little out of the way places that's amazing --- totally recommend !"}
{"text":"I have been to the Thai Elephant a few times now always really busy at dinner really friendly staff always smiling and asking if you needed anything else...  I have ordered the same thing each time the Drunken Noodles (Thai wide ride noodle sautéed with jalapeno, yellow onion, carrot, broccoli, cabbage, bell pepper and basil. Each time it was really good and I will be back to order it again."}
{"text":"Hit the spot. Gorgeously delicious, good helpings. Peanut sauce wasn't peanut goop, veggies crisp-fresh."}
{"text":"Decent food. Quick service. Staff could benefit from a little charm school.  Other than that, its a great \"quick\" place for lunch.  I have to give them a little extra credit -- they actually have fresh Thai hot chili peppers.  For that I am impressed.  Lunch seems to be just north of reasonable.  I'll go back for a lunch special.  I though the curry was pretty good.  Although, nothing beats Lana Thai in Livermore, CA.  That continues to be the most authentic oustanding Thai food I have had in my travels."}
{"text":"Consistent good quality food with fast service. A regular lunch place for myself and workers, which is in a convenient location. The place is busy and I can see why! Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant. The inside has a bistro feel to it, and isn't overly done with the gaudy traditional decor. The patio looks charming as well with the lights but it's too hot to sit out there during summer so we haven't experienced it. We probably eat here about 8-10 times a month. No joke we had take out like 3 times in one week once! My favorite dishes are the pineapple fried rice but I order without the mixed vegetables it comes with as I feel it takes away from the favors. I also love the beef pad Thai, and the teriyaki chicken of Siam. Staff is always very friendly, sometimes they mess up our orders i.e. Not leaving the veggies out or giving us white instead of brown rice with the chicken. None of which are usually a big deal."}
{"text":"I've come here many times and the food is very consistent. I usually get the curry pad Thai or pad prick king. The meal deals are also fairly well priced and the portions are big. Nice area too if you wanna go to bellwoods park or roam around queen west."}
{"text":"Had lunch their with a supplier. Nothing spectacular, nothing bad.  pad thai was average, \"3\" was a perfect medium spice level."}
{"text":"Wow.....stopped in for my first time here for lunch today.  Late lunch so it was not crowded.  I had the Fresh Spring Rolls....yum.....and the Pad Thai Shrimp/Chicken....level 3.  Delish.....service was quick...food was spot on and yes...I will come back."}
{"text":"Tried it out and I love duck truly I don't do much from here. I received a giant ball of spinach with some duck skin and fat but wait there's more I ordered 2 duck dishes and the other was a giant bowl of pineapple and duck skin. Don't ever go here i never will again."}
{"text":"8/01 Green curry w/ Tofu off of the lunch menu.  Soup was tasty, and curry dish arrived soon after.  Was satisfied with the dish, but it did not hold a candle to the green curry I had at the Phoenix location, or to any of the other restaurants I've had it, for that matter.  Enjoyed the tofu; it was the curry sauce that wasn't as great as the one I adored at the Phoenix branch.  One more thing, why add corn to the eggroll filling??  Not authentic.      May try other lunch items at a later date, but I think I'll just go to the Adams St. location, instead.  Tastier selections there, and better service too!"}
{"text":"Impressive dinner tonight!  However, it was a packed house, and it took over an hour for my Panang Curry to arrive.  While I was a part of a large group of about 14, our particular group had 6 people.  One tablemate's entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors' dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  I'll definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!!  Didi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, who'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that she'd either love or hate the Rama.  We were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it, anyway.  I hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-I hope that by next visit I can up the review back to five stars!!  Ooh, do try the coconut ice cream w/ embedded grated coconut!  Not as good as Yupha's homemade coconut ice cream, but still  quite delightful :)"}
{"text":"Although  I have never eaten in the store, this is without a doubt my favourite thai delivery in the city.  Delivery zone used to be strict, however they seem to have expanded over the last few months.  Moderately priced, but always more than enough food to go around.   Some of their staples include the Khoa Soi (Northern Style Curry Noodle Soup) and a fantastic green curry. The Mango salad is delicious- depending of course if the fruit is in season.   The Pad Thai is a solid choice and will never disappoint."}
{"text":"Me & my daughter have been searching high & low all over the valley for a good pad Thai, so far this is her favorite spot & we've been to 6 or 7 Thai restaurants in our quest.  I LOVE their drunken noodles with chicken,... Best flavor ever,. I never finish all my food but I licked the plate clean!!!    I've been there 3 or 4 times now, & the service is always very nice & accommodating.  The decor is very inviting & simple. Happy yummy food hunting!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is \"My neighborhood Thai restaurant\". They have amazing happy hour specials (and reverse happy hour later on), I love the chicken pad thai, love the spring rolls, love the thai iced tea.  I've never had bad service (and I've been a LOT). I've always found them to be friendly and quick."}
{"text":"You never know how good you have it until it is gone, right? Well rest assured Thai Elephant isn't going anywhere, but I didn't realize how good this place is until I was out of town and visited another Thai restaurant. I compared the massaman curry dishes between the two restaurants. Big mistake. It instantly made me homesick for Thai elephant. I go here often during the lunch hour. Arrive early as the line grows quickly out the door. The staff is efficient and friendly, making this a great choice if you are looking for a quick sit-down option over the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great tasty food. Not too many restaurants are able to make their food with the degree of hottest that I demand. However, this restaurant was able to deliver the food as I requested them to be. It is without question that I will return."}
{"text":"This place has extremely consistent food and a great menu. The wait staff isn't particularly friendly but will remember you from prior visits. Prices are pretty reasonable for the portions and quality. They do get extremely busy at lunch and I've waited my an entire lunch hour for my order before which is the only reason they aren't getting 5 stars. Overall very solid little Thai place in the heart of Tempe"}
{"text":"How I ordered:  Ordered delivery from an online delivery service. Food arrived exactly on time.   The food:   I got the dinner for two for my and my girlfriend. The dinner included spring rolls, chicken pad thai, red curry chicken, thai jasmine black rice, and two drinks.  The portions were huge, and they took care of the low spice level that I had requested.  It's Thai Fast Food, but great for what it is. We could barely put a dent in the food.   Would order again."}
{"text":"I was staying at the La Quinta down the street and saw this place pop up on my Yelp nearby so I figured I'd check it out.   My boyfriend and I placed a to go order since we were in a bit of a rush. I had the tofu pad Thai and he had the drunken fried rice. I actually liked his a lot more than mine. I felt mine was a bit bland on the spices but the tofu was cooked perfectly. I think next time I'd get the drunken noodles.  The service was very good though. Our order was ready by the time we got there which was only about 10 minutes and they made sure to include forks & chop sticks which is key for take outs."}
{"text":"I had the red curry with chicken and I really enjoyed it.  It was rather slow for a Friday night and the servers were kind of slowwww. Took about 10 minutes just to get our drink order and another 10 to get the actual drinks.  So my 4 star review is a generous one and based mostly on the food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious; the silver noodles were my favorite. The service was spotty, at best. Three young girls running a very busy Saturday night shift was not ideal. Long waits, lukewarm dishes, and you can forget about drink refills.   Keep the menu, hire more help."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is awesome!  A coworker introduced me and its crazy reasonable for thai food....at least at lunchtime it is.....delish...I get the masaman curry w/ chicken.  Lunch portions are decent as well.   Also try the bbq thai chicken....omg, wonderful and tasty!  Can get crowded, but worth the wait....although, I've never had to wait more than 5 min."}
{"text":"I was feeling peckish for some Thai food and decided to try this place out partially due to the location and partially due to the menu. The choices are quite extensive with some of the entrees having amusing names or elephant related names. Jingle jungle? Thaitalian spaghetti? I love it!  Elephantitis cocktail? It's kind of weird to name your mixed drink after a rare and debilitating disease but as long as I don't get elephantitis from drinking it I'll go with it!  I had the daily special, a mango curry, ordering it with seafood. I also tried the drunken noodles and the king of garlic.   The mango curry was a hefty portion of red curry sauce, vegetables, and seafood including fish, scallops, shrimp, and calamari. The scallops were rubbery tasting but the other seafood were cooked well. I was disappointed that I requested this dish hot but it tasted very mild to me, like a 2/10 in scale of spiciness. In general the curry was too sweet for me and it had more of a one dimensional taste compared to other dishes I tried.  The drunken noodles had a depth of flavor and a hint of smokiness which was great. It was a sizable portion as well.  The king of garlic was a mighty meal living up to its name. This is the stuff that vampires have nightmares about because of the amount of garlic they packed in this dish. It was a knock out punch of bold flavors, varied textures, and a hint of spiciness. The beef was tender and well seasoned. It was probably the best dish out of the few that I tried.  I had a Thai iced tea to go with my meal which was too sweet for my tastes. They serve it automatically with ice but in the menu it says they will charge you $.75 if you request it with low ice or no ice. Interesting.  I wasn't too impressed with my meal but I did enjoy the king of garlic so I'll be back to try some more off the menu. Overall 3.5/5."}
{"text":"So I have a friend who reads my reviews from Yelp when they are posted on Facebook. Almost after every review she instructs me to have Thai - I guess good Thai food is in short supply in Athens, GA. Looking at the Yelp listings, that is not the case here.   Out of my available options near work, I chose Thai Elephant. I had good reviews, and let's face it, who doesn't love an elephant? The parking was easy to get into and the store was packed - a good sign of good food. I enjoyed the deco with paper lanterns.  The soup was the first course and it was a good thing I wasn't blind folded. I would have thought some scallions and a hint of pepper dropped in the lemon-Joy dishwater. Yuck. Thankfully the Thai tea removed all hint of soup. It was $2.25 for the tea and what a treat! I ordered the lunch special of drunken noodle with chicken - it is Thai wide noodles sauteed with jalapeno, yellow onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, bell pepper and basil. I could definitely taste the basil and although I responded \"mild\" to the question of mild vs. spicy - I am not sure what the spicy would have tasted like YIKES! Definitely bring a hankie for the mild. If you have sinus issues, have that! I have to say of the Thai places I have had, this ranks up there is the best. For $7.95 for the lunch portion, it was a great size and worth the price.   I also liked the staff did not harass me during eating. They brought the soup, the tea and the food. Once they asked if it was good and I didn't see them again until time for the check. Now one lady asked if I wanted the check, a different lady brought the check (to which I gave my card), then the first lady returned with the bill (until I said someone already brought it) and a third lady came by to ask if I needed my check. I guess they are very diligent on the payment end. But the food was great, so I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good quality. But the prices are extremely high. I spent 30 dollars in total just on a mango salad and a bowl of curry rice. There is almost no room to sit and the size of the restaurant is very small. The staff are nice and friendly but the prices are just too high."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto (however I do not know that many) as their curries are really good: not very oily, they add lots of fresh veggies and tofu, and they are not too spicy. I have tried their Red, Green and Pineapple Curry and those are my favourite! Their Massaman Curry is also very good but it came with too much tofu in it, there was almost no curry sauce in it just tofu and potatoes. Their Pad Thai is also very good, but not the best I have tried. Little disappointing is their cold (fresh) rolls as they come with simple house sauce that is often used for fried spring rolls. I prefer peanut sauce that I usually ask but I have to pay extra $1.50. And their peanut sauce is not the best, even I make a better one at home. Just seems too bland and too sweet. One dish I would never take here again is their Curry Pad Thai - it seemed way too heavy and greasy, but if you are not afraid of that - then go ahead, it was very very flavourful."}
{"text":"A frequent place that I visit with co-workers for take out lunch.  Their lunch specials are 10$ + tax.    Pros: + large portions + generally tasty food  Cons: - sub par quality   Ambiance:  The place has around 10 tables and can seat around 30 people.  I never ate there so I will cannot say much for anything else.  Service: I always got takeout, the servers were friendly.   They accept credit card.   Food (3.5 stars): The lunch special comes with 1 spring roll (on occasion they give 2), and a choice of your main for 10$.   With my co-workers the most popular one is oodles of noodles.  It is tasty.   I would recommend this place if you are hungry and cravy thai food.  I do not think it is worth the price for dinner, but good for lunch special."}
{"text":"The delivery is fast and friendly, but the food just wasn't that good. I ordered the panang curry with shrimp and coconut rice which I got because they didn't have white rice. How curry can lack flavor is hard to believe, and the consistency of the rice was just unusual. l ate it anyway since I was starving after a long day of traveling. I also gave an extra star because I may have just ordered the wrong dish, plus the prices were fairly reasonable... and the online service was easy peasy."}
{"text":"For when you are hungry and want to eat a lot but are not necessarily looking for authenticity and quality. Not saying the food is bad but it is not like you are eating in Thailand or anything. One thing is for sure, the value is there because they heap lots of chicken, broth or noodles with everything. I really suggest they make their curry spicier so it becomes more close to what it should be."}
{"text":"Honestly, I like Thai but I'm not a super fan of Thai food and that is odd for me, because I do love every other kind of Asian cuisine. That being said, Thai Elephant was pretty good and definitely worth the visit, especially if you work downtown and want something different from bar food and sandwiches.   Well, my work brought me to downtown Phoenix last week, and my colleague and I were sitting in that building across the street where I noticed this place and said to myself \"ooo, let's have Thai for lunch\" because although I only just \"like\" Thai, I haven't had it in a while.    The place is pretty small and definitely gets packed during lunch hours. That's OK though, let's get close; let's get to know each other (honey badger don't care).   It was my colleague's first time having Thai so I told her to order the chicken Pad Thai because that is the quintessential Thai dish that is served in all Thai restaurants across the country. It is simple, not daunting or adventurous, and is able to be enjoyed by just about everyone. I wanted to try some new Thai so I ordered the Massaman.   The food came out very quickly and the wait staff during our entire time there was incredibly attentive. Our drinks must have been filled about four times. My colleague enjoyed everything pretty much equally, although she didn't finish everything. I thought the complimentary soup was too sweet and tangy for my tastes (part of why I only \"like\" Thai I guess). The fried rolls that came with our meals were kind of bland I thought. They were spiced enough, but there just wasn't anything in them to make my mouth say \"ohhh yeah\". My entree, the Massaman was pretty good, but again, a little too sweet. It was almost too coconutty (not a word, don't care, honey badger).   Overall though, I wasn't disappointed and was glad to take someone out to try something new. I tipped them pretty well simply because their service was so good and the staff was so friendly.   Like I said, if you are tired of the typical American fare of burgers and fries, check this place out."}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is my new favorite Thai restaurant in Tempe. To start off I got the thai sweet potatoes. The description said light-battered sweet potatoes with a house tamarind sauce. I thought it would be actual sweet potatoes, but it ended up being regular potatoes with the sweet dipping sauce. The description was a bit misleading, but it was delicious nonetheless.  For my entree I got the pad thai with tofu which was delicious! It really was the best pad thai i've ever eaten. My boyfriend got the green curry which he said was amazing as well.The service here was great too. The staff was very friendly and quick. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Asked for spicy massaman curry and server/ owner had no patience to take note! She just nodded. Curry was sugary! Also regrettably ordered coconut shrimp that had NO SALT! NO SALT! Avoid this place and go to khao san road instead!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new go to Thai restaurant! The Green Curry with chicken was delicious! The ambiance was very nice and the service was friendly. I am a frequent Thai food consumer and this place is on the top of my list now."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pad thai. I usually order for take out and service is consistently great."}
{"text":"My friend could not stop talking about Thai Elephant and insisted that we go, so we had a gaydate here tonight.   There was 6 of us, and we were seated right away and got a round of waters. It was happy hour, so I got a mud bath (bomb.com/tipsy), and another friend got the elephantitis which was also delish. We ordered the veggie tempura, blanket shrimp, and veggie egg rolls, which were also all really good. My first thought = I really like the plate presentation here.    Next. We get our meals. My friend sitting next to me got the beef chow mein which smelled delightful but since I've given up beef, didn't get a chance to try. Had a bit of my friend's pineapple fried rice (?) which was interesting, personally not my thing. There was also a curry dish and the ran dar (?) which I heard were good. I myself had the medium chicken pad thai (original I know). My friend wasn't kidding when he said they were pretty serious about their spices. I got the medium (mild - medium - spicy), which was pretty kickin'. And they also provided some sricha (?) for my Mexican friend who thought he could handle more hot but couldn't, haha. Anyways, my pad thai was out of this world. At first bite, I thought, is this what I wanted? And then I couldn't stop eating. It was delish. I have a box of leftovers in my fridge that I can't wait to eat later.   The service was great, although we got our water glasses refilled a MILLION times. Great servers! Very helpful with suggestions and deciphering the menu! Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This was the best Thai food I ever had Hands Down!  If it wasn't for the horrible soup they give you in the beginning, I would give it five stars. My friend also fell in love as well.  She got the Spicy Eggplant that she said was the best she ever had at a Thai Restaurant.  My drunken noodles with veggies and chicken was also very tasty.  I even liked their spring rolls and rice. I actually liked the mediocre service that they gave.  They didn't hound me for anything anddidn't ask if my food was good when my mouth was full of food.  They were always available if I needed anything though, which I thought was important.  The first time I went there a few months ago, I wasn't impressed.  I am so happy that I went there again.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the customer service is wonderful. Thai Elephant has a beautiful ambiance and it treats its guests with quality food. I totally enjoyed my visit!!"}
{"text":"Driving down University I spotted a new lunch destination, Thai Elephant. Always excited for new dining options I went there today with a coworker. The food was good and I learned that Thai Elephant is owned by the same family who runs Thai Basil just down the road. Their menu was quite large and although the lunch specials were decently priced we ventured off an had the Seafood Tofu. It was great, the portion was generous and they did not skimp on the seafood - there were mussels, octopus, shrimp and scallops. The tofu in the dish was awesome, fried to perfection and incredibly firm, this with crisp sugar snap peas, carrots and onions all served in a garlic brown sauce. We both had Thai tea (although I am not sure why I always order this ad Thai resturants, I don't like it - way to sweet) and it was a nice balance to the spiciness of the dish. I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes that were jumping out at me on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was good at first but now every time I order panang curry I get coconut soup for some reason.  They over charge for everything. The food was great for the first 4 orders but now it's just not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place has great delivery service!  While I have never eaten in the restaurant,  every time we order delivery from here it is fast and hot!   With Thai food I am not overly adventurous so I've only ordred a few dishes. Notable: The Pad Thai- it isn't overly sweet/ketchupy the way some places are, and the serving is quite large. The Pad si u is very VERY tasty.  It also has a good amount of meat to veg to noodle proportion. I would definitely recommend this dish. We've also tried a few other things (skewers, mango salad etc) that were also good, but afore mentioned were the best."}
{"text":"Really good food and fast! Nice intimate spot that's not too busy...at least when I was there."}
{"text":"This is one place I will not be going to again.  I am extremely disappointed in how they handled an issue we had in the restaurant.  About 2 months ago around 11:30 when we walked into the restaurant.  As soon as we walked in we were seated and given water and soups; typical of most Thai restaurants.  We ordered our food and with in 10-15 min our food was on the table.  Up to this point the service was fast and good.  We started to eat and most of us were enjoying our meals.  Half way through the meal my friend made a noise and the look on his face told us something was wrong.  He dropped his fork and reached into his mouth and pulled out a staple.  The staple wasn't your normal staple for stapling papers it was the kind used to shipping; you have probably seen them on boxes when you buy a piece of furniture that you need to put together.  If you have worked in a grocery store you would probably recognize the staple as the kind they use to staple the boxes closed on vegetables.  The staple was about 2 in long and with two 1 in end that had been turned down.  My friend said it poked him in the cheek as he bit down on it.  After he pulled the staple out he rinsed his mouth with water and checked for any cuts the staple may have caused.  Thankfully he didn't have any.  He called the waiter over and they looked at the staple and just said I don't know how that got in there and walked away.  About 5 min another person walked over and said your waiter notified me that you had an issue with your food.  So my friend explained what happen and again and this person had the same response and walked into the kitchen.  Another 5 min goes by when they came back to our table and said we don't know how that got into your food or where it came from.  They offered to take is plate and make another dish but my friend declined so the manager offered to comp his meal.  The reason this was a bad experience was instead of fessing up that it was their fault and communicating with us to let us know what was going on they would just walk away and then return to our table with no explanation.  They should have offered to give him a free meal for next time in addition to comping his meal and had better communication.  Honestly it is easy to see how the staple got into the food.  They were either opening produce boxes next to the stoves and when they did this one of the staples came off the top and landed in the pan.  The other way would be the staple was already in the box of veggies and when they dumped them on the cutting board to be cut it was in the mix and they didn't see it."}
{"text":"Always amazing hands down the best Thai in Phoenix. Th best spring rolls I've ever had, insane serving of curry perfect for leftovers and a healthy and hearty amount of veggies with incredible tofu!!! Literally nothing else compares."}
{"text":"This was my first tofu experience when I decided not eat meat anymore and I loved it. They have a huge menu. (better than Thai basil, sorry)"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I was not only impressed with the food, I was impressed with the customer service. Phil was our waiter and he was very attentive and helpful. He also chatted with us which is good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favourite little whole in the wall place to come have lunch.   It's quality food with amazing service and it doesn't create a dent in your wallet.  Their lunch menu it's yummy.  For $10 +tax, you get a spring roll and a filling dish to accompany it from their menu. Or just pick whatever you want.   Spicy means spicy which is a bonus."}
{"text":"I would rate it 3.5. But since their overall rating is 4, I rounded down. I went for lunch. They gave me a soup to start. It was a standard Thai sour soup. The broth was good but there was nothing else in it besides green onions. No other vegetables. I ordered the Thai BBQ chicken lunch special. It was different then what I expect when a Thai restaurant says Thai BBQ chicken. It really was more like two big pieces of chicken satay. Service was efficient but it was 2 and they looked ready to be done with lunch. It is fine for the price but definitely not a four star in my opinion."}
{"text":"I try to find the good in everything. I'm here visiting and had a craving for Thai food. This restaurant is right down the street from our hotel and it's one of the few places that are open in the evening in downtown Phoenix.  We each ordered the yellow curry with shrimp. It came with an abundant amount of shrimp. A couple of my fellow Chicagoans have given this place a negative review because of it's lack of authenicity. That may be the case, but it's downtown Phoenix. Chicago has about a billion Thai restaurants on Western Avenue alone and they are not all good. I guess my expectations weren't that high going in so I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently with a friend. The food was good quality. We picked up an order on a weekend due lunch. The staff was laid back and friendly. We both enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"The second-best yellow curry in the valley. Came in for lunch, received excellent service. But, my main priority is the food. The spice is spot-on, but it doesn't quite have the depth of flavor that Wild Thaiger's yellow curry has. Check it out for a speedy lunch if you want a break from the usual lunch humdrum."}
{"text":"Pretty darn great for a chain! We stopped by this restaurant late on a Saturday evening on our way to an event. The hours of operation are until 9pm. We walked through the doors at 8:50pm starving and asked the waiter if it would be okay to sit and eat. I presumed he wouldn't mind since the place was packed and it didn't look like it would clear before 9. The waiter smiled and said, no problem just give me a minute to wipe down a table. Brownie points for this place!!  He could have shown us the door but he gave us a table instead. We decided to skip appetizers which is unusual for us but we just wanted to have our entrees and head out. So we ordered, the hubs requested the spicy catfish and I, the panang with tofu. I have been craving panang for weeks. Boy the wait was worth it! The curry was so rich and spicy, I could have drank it up. The vegetables were cooked to perfection and the tofu had a great consistency. My husband raved about his meal while stuffing his mouth the night. \"So good,\" he kept saying, \"be sure to 'yelp' about this place!\" I tried a bit of the fish and it was pretty darn good. Though it was fried and had the look of fried chicken, it was not tough or crunchy. The fish was delicate and seemed to melt in your mouth. We were quite impressed with this place. The location was great too. Right in the heart of downtown about a block from the new Cityscape complex. We intend to make another visit real soon. Until we must savor the memories of our dinner."}
{"text":"If you want to try a new Thai place other than Thai basil, in Tempe. This is the place to go nice ambient interior. The staff is very friendly and attentive! Lighting is good for dim setting dinner scenery. Menu is very optional meaning that it has many choices to choose from. Very flavorful food, from Thai hot which is my favorite if you are a spicy lover of foods, or to even mild for those not adventurous! What I recommend is the papaya salad, make sure you get a side of sticky rice if available or steamed rice is ok too! And the pad Thai is wonderful too! Will come back again soon! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was one of my favorite places to go but after a certain time period,  their flavors changed.  I went to get green curry, didn't like how watered down it was and how it didnt have the ingredients it said it would have. Gave it another chance by getting Pad See Ew the next time, which is a pretty standard dish, and was also disappointed with that. Noodles were completely broken, bloated and no flavor to them besides the spice. I love spicy but disliked how it was the only flavor the dish had. The meats were all over cooked a d tough to chew. I'm looking for a new Thai place to eat :("}
{"text":"Very good food. Clean, good atmosphere. Came in for lunch first the time yesterday and definitely a busy place."}
{"text":"Gotta love a good panang curry! I think I'll try the massaman next time and update. :]  Watch out the medium is hot! Same as the thai basil a few streets over."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on 9/1/09 at 7pm - my first day on vacation by myself in Phoenix.  It's a cute little restaurant (there's no bar because it's so small).  Note, however, that the only parking available is on the street - which is metered until 8pm.  I didn't have any quarters, but the restaurant staff was very nice about making change for me so I could pay the meter.  The restaurant is also located right next door to the Phoenix Ambassador's office (check it out if you're visiting the area and want to know places to go, eat, etc.) so that is convenient.  I was in and out in a little under an hour, and I was taking my time.  The food is very delicious, and well priced.  I ordered garlic chicken and vegetables - very flavorful and a good size for the price (actually it was too much for just me to finish, so I had to take it home - I'm a 5'4 petite female).  One note on the take home containers - they are microwave safe!  They don't have the metal handles, which could be a nice thing for some.  Overall, I highly recomment this restaurant if you're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am no expert on Thai food but the food at the Thai Elephant is fantastic. I have been to this establishment so many times and have always been pleased. Good service, great pad thai, great drinks, quiet atmosphere; all-around winning combination. Keep up the great work Thai Elephant!   Keep singing,  -Jerron"}
{"text":"Went here on a sunny afternoon after a day in the park with a group of 8 people. Firstly - awesome back patio!!! Secondly great food and service. Overall a really pleasant experience! Generous portion sizes (for the curry dishes at least). Everyone was happy with their order.  Favourites amongst my group were: -  Basil fried rice, which  is sometime risky choice because I  usually find fried rice to greasy, but it was not greasy and was really flavourful. - Pineapple curry - delicious  - Yellow curry - yum"}
{"text":"If you love a place so much that you eat it for lunch two days in a row, and upon finishing your second lunch you question whether you should go there for dinner, or just wait for lunch tomorrow, the place deserves five stars.  As others have mentioned, they are a little pricier than other Thai places around the valley, but the lunch tofu dishes are $7.95 and come with an egg roll and vegan hot & sour soup, and it is well worth it.  I'm one of those fat kids in a skinny-ish body, because I will eat every last bite on the plate in front of me. Generally the portions at Thai places are so huge I feel like a whale after I leave, but Thai Elephant does a good job with their potion sizes (at least for lunch) leaving me satisfied but not feeling glutenous.   I need someone to provide me some damn control, because I have none :-p  Quick, friendly service. Clean, comfy interior. No complaints.   Try the Siamese Basil or Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Both are amazing. Unless you want to crap fire, I suggest getting nothing spicier than medium. Enjoy the visual!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I had in az since Thailand.  recommend old fashion curry and the pad Thai with tofu! Going to try more items!"}
{"text":"Curry...curry...curry. Hooray for curry!  I love coconuts and I love curry.  What a winning combination.    I think I must have had every combination of the massaman.  Chicken, pork, shrimp...  Just as soon as the plate is in front of me I immediately go to town on the sauce strictly because 1) I like it but more importantly 2) bring the liquid level down a notch just enough to dump some of the rice in it.  Then as soon as the rice absorbs the sauce I stir it up a bit and then I get down to business.  Once that's done I attack the eggroll...never touching it until the very end.  It is a ritual I hold dearly to my heart and I will not forsake it.    I usually go for medium spice, since I am not that much of a macho man even though at first glance I may appear like a cage fighter...Kidding, but yeah I am a wussy if it is too hot.  I have sadly walked away from meals before because it was too spicy.  Every visit has been excellent; don't know what else I can say.  I have tried the pad thai among other dishes, but the curry keeps pulling me back.  Why can't I quit you?  Oh yea...the parking situation \"it blows\" because it is downtown and on another note I would suggest to get there before 11:30 or after 1:00 to avoid the long wait times.  When I worked downtown I would hit this place right around 11:15 AM.  No waiting!  I have tried a few other places, particularly one in Gilbert and it does not come close.  Totally crushed me!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food that I've ever eaten!  I'm a creature of habit so the Chicken Pad Thai is almost all I'll ever order!  Amazing food!  Only thing is I wish it was a larger restaurant cause it gets packed fast and parking can be tough at times!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food that I've ever eaten!  I'm a creature of habit so the Chicken Pad Thai is almost all I'll ever order!  Amazing food!  Only thing is I wish it was a larger restaurant cause it gets packed fast!"}
{"text":"When I want pad Thai, this is where I go.   Always great service. Delicious food. Easy parking. What more could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews on Yelp,  very good.   Had the green papaya salad, great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top.   Had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty. I need more of that green papaya salad so I'll go back and try a few different things."}
{"text":"This Thai food is pretty decent. They have a wide variety of lunch specials that are all pretty good.  They let you choose what kind of meat you like and how hot/spicy you want the food. The soup they serve at the beginning is not much to taste.  It really doesn't add anything to the experience and it occasionally has tasted a bit soapy to me. I personally rate the Thai Panang curry the best, but I like the yellow curry, the pad thai and the drunken fried rice too. With a tip, and a drink, your lunch will be about $10."}
{"text":"Is there an option to give you zero star... I am so beyond disgusted with the way my friends were treated the other day.... For them to go back two days in a row shows you that they like the restaurant.. How dare the manager come over and ask them why they didn't tip the day before... The kicker is that they tipped 50% of their check... They were embarrassed in front of all the customers.... It is so disheartening that I will Not be going there again... I am disappointed and recommend that you don't ever go back to this establishment ... They do NOT treat their regular customers well.... You lost my business for ever and I will spread the word.."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fortuitous find!! We had grown accustom to mediocre Thai is Scottsdale, but happened upon Thai Elephant in Tempe on the Labor Day holiday. Wow! Food was fresh, veggies al dente, spice as requested ... just the best we've had in this region. BRAVO Thai Elephant!! We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"The fresh veggie rolls were complimented by a delicious sweet peanut sauce.  and my coconut shrimp curry was delicious. It had the perfect amount of spice and sweetness with the jumbo shrimp. Loved the peaceful environment and the servers were all very sweet. definitely would choose this over Thai basil."}
{"text":"Best pad thai, and king of garlic dishes in the valley! Reasonable prices.  Fabulous happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Just because it's full doesn't make it good.   When we first arrived this place as so full we barely had a place to stand. So we thought, \"this place must be good.\" While we waited, a server came over to take our order. Then about ten minutes later we were seated.   As the food came out we both had the same reaction. Meh. The soup was flavorless, the pad thai noodles  were undercooked the sauce in the red curry was watery, so much it was nearing bland. Which is unheard of in any Thai restaurant!    I won't be going back"}
{"text":"I just had a food delivery. The food came within 30 minutes. It was packed with utensils and chopped sticks. Napkins. All the sauces and entrees were packed tight. I ordered a cup of the Tom Kar soup medium spicy. The chicken was tender and very flavorful. I ordered sticky rice which I like to eat with soup. The sticky rice was perfect. Not mushy or crusty like some places. I also ordered an appetizer combo and Pad Thai. I started the appetizer which came with 3 large portions of different sauces. I plan to have the rest for dinner. And Maybe lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant and pleasant staff. The server forgot we ordered an appetizer, the fried tofu, and so he ended up comp-ing it, which in my opinion was very responsible and still created a pleasant dining experience. I ordered the eggplant with chicken. I've ordered this dish before in other Thai places and the last time I ordered it, it only had two pieces of eggplant! This wasn't the case here. There were many pieces and, in fact, I had to take the rest home. Plus, it was very good."}
{"text":"Pros: The food is really good. We got the Pad Thai and the Thai Elephant Fried Rice both with chicken and #3 on the spicy scale. The décor is nice and clean. Also the lunch special price is REALLY great, 2 meals plus Thai ice tea for $22 is a great deal.  Cons: We sat our selves and we were served soup and water immediately but it took them awhile to take our order. Then my boyfriend got his food a good 15 minutes before I got mine. That really pisses me off when one person gets their food first. We should be served at the same time so we can eat together. It sucks when one person is finished before the other and they have to wait for the other person to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Eat here at least once a week.. The drunken noodle is amazing.. So is the pad zu. The pad thai.. And the..... It's all great!!"}
{"text":"This is still my go to place for Thai food/delivery. Their red & green curries have also become favorites of mine! LOVE ordering out, or ordering in. Their service is great and the restaurant is well kept. Can't get enough of this place! Only caveat: I wish they had the brown rice that I like (haven't found it yet in Phoenix)"}
{"text":"There is an elephant in the room at Thai Elephant. That elephant is that it is over rated.  After hearing so many great things about it, we had to try it, so we went there for lunch today. We started with the fish cakes, which were some of the best I have had, the six of them were rich and complex in flavor and great sauce. Our main courses were Tom Yum with chicken and the drunken fried rice with tofu. The Tom Yum was good, but had a strange aftertaste and no cilantro. My drunken fried rice was flavorful, but missing bell peppers as the menu had promised. And the rice was steamed rice thrown in with veggies after they were stir fried, so not the consistency of stir fried rice at all. The lunch bill, with an appetizer and two courses was over $30. For that much, I hope to be knocked off my feet. Not to mention so many other Thai places that are better and cheaper. A really cool thing is the versatility of the menu, any course can be had with beef, pork, chicken, tofu or shrimp or seafood. The decor is nice, the staff is welcoming and friendly. Maybe I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times now and each and every time I have had a wonderful experience.  The presentations are artful and the food is simply delicious.  The daily lunch crowd adds to the warm and lively atmosphere in this small but comfortable downtown eatery.  I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back again.  I'm still having red curry flashbacks!  Uhm, uhm, uhmmmm."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC.  Service?  5 stars.  Friendly, efficient, anticipates needs, gracious.  Food?  5 stars. Delicious, came exactly as ordered, came quickly, portions were big, but we all ate every bite it was so good.  Decent selection of beers, comfortable small space.  I would eat here again and again if I lived in the area, but was just here for work.  I recommend this restaurant highly and without reservation."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place the some of the best crab puffs. This is my go to Thai place. Close to work and have great lunch specials along with refreshing Thai Tea.   I usually get the Yellow Curry or Pad Thai and because I am a weenie I opt for 0 spice. Both these options are more on the 'sweet side' when it has 0 spice.   But seriously, if you are a lover of crab puffs - I highly recommend Thai Elephant's crab puffs!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Khao Soi and it was horrible. The only thing I tasted was spice, yet on the menu it indicated that the spiciness level was \"nice\". Which would be fine, except the entire dish was extremely diluted. I'm so displeased right now it's not even funny. My friend got the mango stirfry with shrimp. He said that while the meal was probably cooked properly, the collection of ingredients should not be allowed in combination. Also, the brown rice that came with it had no flavour. The guy they hired to deliver the food forced us to give him tip also."}
{"text":"Good food, pick up order was ready on time. I ordered the red curry chicken  & duck curry. They were both good, plenty of food, big portions. The calamari was a bit dry, fried rolls were excellent.  I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"While my experience at Thai Elephant wasn't terrible, I have to say that after reading all of the glowing reviews, I was disappointed by the food and service. We went last night for dinner and it was packed - there was a Dbacks game, but it had already started by the time we arrived, so I'm not sure why it was so crowded. Strangely enough, even though every one of the 12 or so tables in the restaurant was occupied, there was only one server. I really can't stand when family-owned restaurants skimp on the number of servers (possibly to avoid paying another employee); it really makes the dining experience less enjoyable and even a little bit stressful. If the food were superb (like my favorite Thai place in Fremont, CA where the service is spread really thin but the outstanding food makes it worth it), we might have been less irritable, but it was really frustrating to wait 15 minutes to order and 5-10 just to flag the server down again with a simple request (e.g., asking for more water) when we didn't fall all over ourselves for the food.   For our entrees, we had the red curry with chicken and the drunken noodles with beef. The curry was ok, but it had way too much coconut milk flavor and not nearly enough of the other important curry flavors (tamarind, fish sauce, curry paste, garlic). It was also not as spicy as we ordered it, but this seems to be a common complaint. The drunken noodles were also just average. They were really under-seasoned and just tasted like thin rice noodles with a light chicken sauce. There was no kick or hint of signature Thai flavors. All this being said, the meat in both dishes was good quality, which cannot be said about the meat at the restaurant's counterpart, Thai Basil (at least at the Ahwatukee location we went to). Also, the dessert we had - black sticky rice with pumpkin custard - was phenomenal. It was savory and sweet at the same time, a flavor  combination that, in my opinion,  defines Thai food and was unfortunately not present in our entrees.   I still plan to come back to Thai Elephant and try some other entrees; I'm willing to give it another chance. If it doesn't end up being a great spot for dinner, it still might prove a great lunch place for standard Thai food at good prices."}
{"text":"A very solid Thai option on Queen West but nothing spectacular.  The staff tries hard but makes their fare share of mistakes (spilled water across the table, wrong orders, sent delivery for a pick-up order). All that aside they do it with a smile and that's completely fine with me.  I'll go back but I'm still looking for that go-to Thai place!"}
{"text":"There are a few Thai restaurants in this area, this one provides the worst customer service. My friend and I came here on a Monday evening, around 7:30pm, the restaurant was not crowded. The waitress let us to be seated, she left two menus on the table, but she never returned. We waited and waited, she walked by a few times but never stopped at our table. We've been waiting for about at least 20 minutes, eventually we decided to leave. When we walked out the door, she was on the phone and didn't even noticed. Oh well, thinking about my previous experience with this place, undercooked food, turtle speed service, I don't think I will come back here."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant instead of my usual go-to for Thai food, and I was pretty disappointed. I got two noodle dishes and a soup, and none of them had the delicious flavor that is what draws me to Thai food, they were all three pretty bland. The dish that I ordered \"Thai hot\" did have some spice to it, but it lacked any other flavor.   I seriously debated going through the condiments in my fridge to see if I had anything to pour on it to make it taste like something, and I NEVER do that with good Thai food. The portions were large which was kinda nice I guess, but I will not go back. If you want Thai food that actually has flavor in Tempe, go to Yupha's Thai Kitchen."}
{"text":"Cashew chicken is more like soup with chicken vegetables and cashew. Very bizarre take on this dish. Big portion.   Chicken pad Thai. It was mediocre for a mediocre dish."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and pleasantly surprised with this amazing restaurant. The hotel recommended it so we gave it a try. I ordered the ruby fish curry and since I had the choice of spiciness, I chose Thai hot. It was the best curry I had in my life. The fish was a whole sole filet, lightly fried to perfection and the curry was spicy but extremely flavorful. The atmosphere was relaxed and casual, perfect after a long work day. We had a large party and they were happy to provide separate checks. I also shared an order of veggie spring rolls with a friend and they were crispy and tasty. The portions were decent though I totally could have eaten more if more had been on my plate. I was spooning every last bit of the curry onto my rice even after I finished the fish. If I'm ever in Phoenix again, I would definitely visit Thai Elephant for as many meals as I can."}
{"text":"Good Thai cuisine, a little more than I like to spend at lunch time but I always have left overs for my next meal!  Seems very authentic.  Very clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This area of Tempe is draped in thai places, but this is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai place!  Pad Thai is excellent!  Drunken fried rice is awesome!  Yellow curry and panang curry are amazing!  Get there early for lunch if you want to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"This is the only Thai restaurant I have ever been to, and I enjoyed it. Good food and good service. I ordered the pad thai today and the thai iced tea (fantastic choice) my only mistake was that I ordered it more spicy than I usually like but thats my fault, just error on the side of milder than most places to be safe. All in all a good pace to check out."}
{"text":"I recommend the crispy catfish salad and duck red curry (chef's special) from here. The catfish is lightly battered and fried and paired really well with the mango salad. I wish they had limes instead of lemons though. The duck pieces in the curry are very generous (they put a lot of pineapple pieces too). Their dishes are family style size so you can share. I recommend their coconut ice cream for dessert (enough for two people).  Our chicken satay appetizer took a very long time because they burned it so maybe avoid ordering this one."}
{"text":"The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery last night. The food arrived on time but it was watery outside of the box. The food is fine but I woke up few times because of diarrhea during the night. I ordered papaya salad and coconut spicy soup."}
{"text":"Yummy food, super friendly staff, priced well.  Can't complain!"}
{"text":"Very good Peanut sauce and Curry chicken. I have stopped by a few times for carry out and have always loved  the food. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Wonderful Absolutely Wonderful. I had the Pad Thai w Chicken and Spring Rolls. They bring you complimentary soup which is a lil spicy and good. One Drawback is they have canned soda that they bring you. It gets a little busy during Lunch but they are in Downtown Phoenix. Thats what you expect. Try the Mango Cheesecake. Nice Big Slice at a Decent Price. Will always come back here."}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai,  golden shrimp,  and shrimp wontons.  The cooks follow directions and read your order.  The food is disgusting. Yuck everything was highly oily and heavy.  The pad Thai was mushy and greasy.  Will not order again."}
{"text":"Everything we got was delicious. The fresh rolls were like little salads wrapped in rice paper with a sweet peanuty sauce. The crab puffs were deliciously warm and creamy with a light sweet and sour. The Tom Kha was savory and filling with large pieces of mushrooms. The glass noodles were yummy. And my favorite was a mixed drink of Thai iced tea with coconut rum. So good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for American Thai food. No spice available even when I asked for it Thai hot. They don't have Thai chilis. Thats a bummer.  The Gra Prao is not on the menu but any Thai restaurant should make it, so I ordered it and it was pretty bad. Very soupy, hardly any basil, no spice at all and that was asked for Thai hot.  Won't be back. For real Thai in this town, try Royal Thai Grill or Cha Da Thai. Those are still the 2 best authentic thai places we have found since actually being in Thailand."}
{"text":"I really liked the massaman curry here but then the food poisoning.... errrr not so much.  Great service though!"}
{"text":"Some of the better Thai food I have had in Phoenix. The Panang curry, pad Thai and Thai basil are very authentic tasting and best of all it won't break your wallet. Very friendly staff, clean interior and quick service should make this a staple in your lunch routine. FYI be carful to make sure they are open when you are on the way as they close down for a few hours during the day."}
{"text":"Showed up before closing 30min but everything was a rush from beginning to end sit order eat and out which was my objective but did not need to be reminded every chance the waitress had!! Food was good and fast."}
{"text":"Pad Z U was delicious with plenty of vegetables. Decent prices and good lunch specials, highly recommend for anyone in the mood for some good Thai!"}
{"text":"Business switched names.  Now Five R Cha Thai.  Will do update review under their new name."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing but I gave them 3 stars on their customer service.  we ate at the restaurant and the lady at the front was always on her phone, we had to go up to her several times to ask for service.   we also called for delivery when are food arrived they didn't provide straws or utensils, as a restaurant you should check before delivery."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 and had fairly high expectations even though one in the party had been to Phoenix previously and vaguely remembered having a crappy meal here. But, I sided with Yelp and pushed the group on. I wish I hadn't.   Around the table, someone ordered the pork chop and found it pretty tasty but that was about as good a thing anyone else could say about their dish. I shared the Pad Thai with the doubter and it was a bland sticky mass of noodles with way too many large blocks of tofu. In short, it sucked. But, it did give me a better appreciation for Thai back home in Houston.  Service, on the other hand, was great. Orders came out quickly. And, it was reasonably priced. Just stay away from the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem in the West Queen West area during my lunch break. I was on a quest to find a great Thai place near where I work and I was not disappointed.  We ordered the Traditional Shrimp Pad Thai and my colleague ordered the Vegetarian Pad Thai.  The acidity, sweetness and blend of flavors were amazing and for the price that we paid, we got more than we bargained for!  The place was quaint, and the hostess was very nice. Unfortunately we did not have the time to sit and dine in the restaurant but the place looked very nice.  I am sure I will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food was great, you get a lot of your money.  The service was on top of things and was there when needed.   Great place to stop for a nice sit down lunch very peaceful inside."}
{"text":"There's nothing exactly wrong with Thai Elephant, but there is just too much good food to check out in this area to settle for \"good-enough\" food.  I love Thai food--even fast-food Thai.  Not quite hungry enough for a curry, we ordered some appetizers, soup, and salad.  A mango salad was quite good, and the standout here was, surprisingly, the calamari, which was very well done, and my friend really liked his beef salad.  The soup was okay, but included too few overcooked shrimp.    There were several nearly missed mistakes as our waitress had trouble making sense of our orders.  On top of that, we were the only customers in the restaurant and I found the service to be fairly slow, especially as we had an abundance of finished plates awkwardly piled on our table for longer than I'd have expected.  On a positive note, they do have a gorgeous backyard patio--so if you're craving some sunshine and a plate of calamari, it's a fine spot.  If you're a Thai fiend, there are much better options in the city."}
{"text":"Pretty busy for the area (went during lunch hour)   Solid.   Good for the area.     I got something off the lunch menu with a bunch of appetizers.    No complaints.  Easy parking."}
{"text":"Had a weird surprise in my chicken pad Thai: tofu?! They put tofu in my chicken pad Thai and I didn't see anywhere that they would tofu in it. I thought the pad Thai had lots of sugar and salt in it and tasted pretty heavy. It was a quick delivery and a very average pad Thai. I would give them another chance but if you have allergies, be extremely careful because they might put something you're allergic to (given that I had tofu in my order, who knows what they would put in other orders)"}
{"text":"Great customer service!!! Just ordered their homemade mango icecream and it was so fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Delivery tip: After 5pm Thai Elephant has an   In-house delivery driver, if you call them direct the delivery fee is only $3 compared to paying much more through 3rd party application services.  You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and not over priced like so many. The atmosphere is a bit odd and the wait staff can be hit or miss but all those things aside will definately go back again for some yummy Thai food."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food, although their meat is a tad bit on the bland side.  Their service was prompt and friendly though."}
{"text":"Thai elephant does not know how to prepare their food for delivery ! Door dash great! Thai elephant did not get order right at all ! Disappointing!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and really enjoyed my meal.   I ordered the elephant garlic lunch plate. It was definitely very garlicky, which I loved! Many times when I order something with garlic in the name, I am disappointed to find it not true to the name. This place lived up to it's name and that makes this garlic girl happy!   They ask you how spicy you want your meal. I went with medium. That was perfect for eating it there (with the exception of one really hot bite, yikes!). But I did have leftovers, thanks to the good size portion. The heat definitely intensifies in the leftovers!!! So unless you plan on finishing or sharing your meal, you may want to opt for slightly lower heat setting so that your leftovers don't knock your socks off.  I was not a fan of the soup they give you at the beginning. The service was just ok."}
{"text":"Whoever thinks this place serves good Thai food doesn't know what authentic/good Thai food is.  Putting tons of sugar in the food doesn't make it Thai food. The seafood wasn't very fresh last night but shall I forgive them considering the weather was very hot?  This place serves Orange chicken. Any place that serves orange chicken cannot be good because this is not an Asian dish and is a pure invention of Americans  Anyways, was recommended by a bunch of local coworkers.  Now at least I know who not to ask r/ food choices next time in town"}
{"text":"Working downtown leads me to many hits and misses for lunch.  Thai Elephant was a definitie HIT.  The place is small and cramped but the food service is quick and tasty.  When you have limited time that is really all I ask for.   All meals are served with a small cup of soup, crispy egg roll and a cup of rice.... you basically pick some sort of vegitable (they ask how spicy you would like it) and add either: chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp or seafood. Meals range between $7-$9.  I am looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place.  I arrived at 12:15pm on a Thursday and there was a line out the door.  After a short wait we were shown our table and served a small bowl of what tasted like Tom Yum broth.... nice little appetizer.    The menu was nice and had a lot of tasty-looking items along with a fairly large lunch menu, priced at $7.95 which gets you entree, rice, and egg roll.  You can substitute brown rice also for about a buck.  Our order was taken fairly quickly, but our food took forever to come out.  The place was packed and they were swamped, so I can understand, but if you are on a strict time schedule, this might be a problem for you.  My Drunken Fried Rice with chicken arrived looking great.  Plate was nice, presentation was attractive.  After one bite I was like, \"wow, this is really good\".  The fried rice plate was very good.  Chicken was perfectly cooked, very tender and moist, veggies were crisp and fresh, and the dish was spicy, but not overboard (note:  I ordered it \"spicy\").  Another huge bonus for those of us who don't consume milk products and love Thai Tea is the fact they have soy milk!  Awesome.  I'm anxious to try more dishes here, but if you're a fried rice fan, you are sure to appreciate this place and if you're a dairy-free Thai Tea fan, you're sure to love this place."}
{"text":"I was here a few days back with a group of 8 people and for the price the food is amazing.   We did get a shared platter for us to start then everyone ordered individual dishes. We ended up sharing just to see how amazing everything was. There was nothing on the menu that I would not recommend.   Their new stuffed chicken wings where amazing!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just left after eating the Pad Thai and it was very good. They do a crazy lunch business there, so the secret is out.  All in all though they did a great job with the food.  Service was a tiny bit slow, but I suspect that would be the same for any restaurant that busy."}
{"text":"On a search for the best green curry in all of Phoenix, Thai Elephant's green curry earned its place somewhere on the top of the list! The curry is a bit creamier than usual green curry (I think this is a good thing) and has more veggies too! What a win!   The drunken noodles are also fab and the portions are pleasantly enormous. Would also recommend the coconut ice cream! It can be served with fried bananas. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch the other day with a couple of friends. The food was really good, some of the best thai food I've had in phoenix. I got the drunken noodles and they had a bunch of delicious fresh vegetables and I ordered it medium spicy, and it really was a true medium spicy, not too weak and not too strong. The soup that comes with lunch is really weird... kind of sweet and kind of spicy.... not the best soup ever, so that knocked off a star, but other than that, I thought the food was very good. The prices were a little bit higher than at other Thai food places in the area, but I am willing to pay a bit more for better quality. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in Downtown, mostly because it's such a feel-good story. Thai Elephant was at the forefront of Downtown's dining Renaissance, opening in 2008 and quickly bucking trends and becoming a popular lunch destination that was also open for dinner and on weekends. Today, Downtown is a much bigger player in the Valley's restaurant scene and the newcomers owe a debt of gratitude to eateries like Thai Elephant, Hanny's and District American Kitchen and Wine Bar and the restaurateurs who weren't afraid to do Downtown. The food at Thai Elephant is dependable and cost-friendly (you and a date can get out of there for about 20 bucks before tip).  My favorite dish is Pad Thai but then again I'm not exactly a risk-taker when it comes to Asian fare. I also enjoy the soup that comes with every entree. The only downside is how quickly Thai Elephant tries to turn its tables. It's small and demand is high so it's unlikely the staff will let you enjoy a long post-meal conversation with your lovely. They are mostly friendly with their words but their eyes are usually saying, \"You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.\" Still, it's hard to make a list of the best Downtown restaurants that doesn't include Thai Elephant."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggrolls and pad thai. The good thing about this place is the portions are fairly large for the price you pay and they also deliver w/in a 3 mile radius. The pad thai was just ok, not spectacular. The eggrolls are just ok too. Not the worst pad thai, but not the best. I would still order from this place though because of the cost and because they deliver."}
{"text":"3.5 stars (half star deducted for bbq chicken)  most amazing pineapple fried rice of my life.  huge portions (enough for 2 lunches of leftovers), great staff, and huge menu.  mmmm for thai cravings!"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats and I wish I wouldve dined in! Both meals were delicious (drunken noodle & shrimp pad thai). They gave plenty of utensils and napkins. The dessert was so cute! I got the chocolate cake & ice cream. Yum! The ice cream was coconut. Im allergic to coconut and the menu did not specify that. It was the UberEats menu. My boyfriend does not like coconut ironically so we wasted the whole thing. :( I would suggest to add little descriptions to all the items missing one. The chocolate cake was perfect! I cant wait to try them in person!"}
{"text":"While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadn't been ringing and she didn't dial a number.   I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.   It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more \"sauce\" as the dish was a bit dry. Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal. Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Good service.  Food is pretty standard."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I love the Thai Chow Mein. Its delicious and the dish is packed with chicken and yummy vegetables. The service could be better and the plastic spoons taped to all the pens in the restaurant drive me crazy... Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the flavors of the dishes we ordered. The Khao Soi was on point and the beef in the Spicy beef salad was marinated well. The reason I'm giving only 4 stars is because you can't serve Thai food without the Thai condiments! Heads up, they don't have a license to serve alcohol so no enjoying a cold Beer Chang here."}
{"text":"I love the lunch special at Thai Elephant. During the week, from 11 - 3, all lunch orders are served with thai veggie rolls (yummy!!!), rice and soup (no soup if you carry out). My favorites so far have been the drunken noodles and the thaitalian spaghetti with tofu.   They definitely know how to do spicy, so know that if you ask for medium, it's going to be HOT! I like to stick with mild because it still has a good amount of spice and flavor without being burn-your-tongue hot.   One last, but important thing to mention about Thai Elephant is that they have the soft, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth mints to help you recover from the party that has just taken place in your mouth."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and enjoyed some not so typical menu items that made me want to try it again. Next time I am in Arizona, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This review is for the solo diner on her lunch break.  If you need a quiet place for conversation or a table for 3 or more, this might not be the best place for you.    About once a week I need about 45 minutes and a little bit of curry to get my head straight.  The Thai Elephant is only an elevator ride away from my office and it is tried and true....CONSISTANTLY wonderful in every way.  Though it is always crowded at lunch, there is always a table for one.  The lunch menu isn't too skimpy, but is limited enough to make the choosing easy.  The lunch prices are right.  A full meal including rice, a spring roll and soup WITH  a good tip is less than $12.  With prices like that, how can you afford not to!!  I always get the masaman curry.  It haver changes and is delicious every time. The wait staff is prompt and courteous and they always take good care of me. The place is clean and comfortable despite the crowds.  Again, I wouldn't come here for a lunch meeting or an office outing.  It is way too small for that.  I do recommend it for take out if you are the type to bring your curry to the offie!!  (Do it!  Your co-workers will LOVE you!  Everyone loves the smell of ethnic food in the work place!!)  Thanks Thai Elephant.  See you next week!"}
{"text":"The most bland and un-fresh thai food I have ever had. I should have known when I walked in for lunch and it was almost empty.   The decor of the place is nice, and the service was great.  However the food was bad. I got the vegetarian drunken noodles as recommended by the waitress. I swear by this, but if the water tastes good, crisp, clean, filtered, you know it will be good thai food. My second sign was that the water was tap.  The drunken noodles was bland, no basil leaves, and the tofu was store bought, soggy and falling apart.  The Sriracha sauce was not even in the right bottle, instead they transferred it into a little pot. Thought this was class, but when i tasted it, it was bitter and nothing like Sriracha.  I also had the vegetarian summer rolls. The rolls were good, but no basil leaves again. That's a staple thai spice! The peanut sauce was decent, but definitely tasted like it came out of a bottle.  The price was also on the expensive side. My noodles and summer rolls came out to about $20 for lunch.  One star for the nice friend service."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is great, service is good. I like Thai tea here. However, I and my friend have to wait a little long time than other customers came after us."}
{"text":"Amazing high quality food! Dinner portion was so large I couldn't finish the whole thing. I got the Spicy Eggplant dinner dish with rice & tofu. I told them I didn't want the tofu fried and they were able to accommodate me. I asked for level 5 in the Spiciness which is the spiciest you can get but when I was coughing from the spice they came right away with the water and gave me more rice. At first I thought the price was a bit high but the dish was so large it can serve 2!! Took lots of leftovers home. Service was great. Great qualify food and nice atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Thai Elephant is our hands down favorite Thai food in the valley. Our absolute favorite is their panang curry, the richest creamiest version we've found, full of moist tender chicken and spiced to perfection however you like it. As others have commented, the food presentation is Outstanding.  I regularly drive out from southeast Chandler 20 mins each way for takeout when the family wants Thai, passing probably 15-20 places along the way. The food is simply that good and the portions are monstrous.  Great stuff."}
{"text":"Really yummy! I haven't found a better Thai place in Tempe for lunch. I usually order the Duck Salad which never disappoints. I have also tried the ginger heaven, Hawaiian lover and the pad Thai. The hubby always gets some form of curry and he is always happy. Their chicken satay app is also a must order. Overall, great food, great for take out and great service. This is a staple lunch stop for us as we work in the area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I went from east to west, literally, of downtown Toronto to find a Thai restaurant that is open Sunday night... What a challenge!!! This however has led us to finding this cozy little restaurant.  The ambiance was good. The food was delicious. What a great find!!!  We ordered the starting platter which consists of mango salad, thai veggie wrap, chicken satay, spring rolls, and friend calamari (not so thai-like) *delightful*. Then we shared a lemon grass mushroom soup *yumza*. Main dish was chicken pad thai was quite ordinary, but that was what I was craving for. Wanted to order the mango sticky rice for dessert, but it was not available that night.  Everything was reasonably priced....I will definitely will return for more!!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip. Lucky me, Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel! This is a tiny little joint, maybe 20 tables. The menu is like a book, there is so much to choose from, rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers. My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah, it sounds trite, but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!) We had tons of leftovers, which we shared with a homey down the street, I hope he enjoyed it. Highly recommended, and if I'm ever back in town, I will visit again."}
{"text":"Glad I stumbled upon this place. There really aren't that many casual, unique restaurants downtown but this one, luckily, happened to catch my eye.  Real unassuming front, interior-  typical, gaudy Asian decorations BUT this place is MORE than your standard Thai food.  We were allowed to sit anywhere we'd like. Our server was immediately at our table. If anything, we had too much service! (Something I rarely ever complain about!)  Everything we ate had such fantastic balance in the flavor palate. It was a joy to taste so much delicious food.  I had the glass noodles with shrimp. Amazing.  The BF had the Drunken Noodles with chicken prepared spicy (you can request your desired level of spiciness). Since I didn't even get to sample any of his meal before he woofed it down, I'm going to assume he was well-satisfied with the dish.  Remember to leave room for dessert. So many Asian restaurants don't really offer dessert options BUT NOT Thai Elephant. They have quite a few delicious sounding sweet indulgences.   Next time I go I'm leaving room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was stellar. Good food at a decent price. We went back twice while we were in town. I would definitely be back again! Thanks yelp for helping me find this place."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm not well versed in Thai food but I do know awesome....... and they are awesome!!! The Tom Yum is killer and the prices are super on point! I feel like every time I order I get a great deal! Btw.... don't call ahead. Go in sit at the back bar and order a beer and then order.... great cheap beer and fantastic food!!!! I want some more Thai!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks on happy hour. I got the Pad Thai and veggie egg rolls. Both were great and the dinner portions are large enough to take home as an extra meal. I am also allergic to msg and find it hard to eat at some establishments. No msg here. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Tasty place! My roomie is always trying to indulge when it comes to food, and finally agreed to check out a locally owned Thai restaurant as I am completely boycotting Thai Basil (a story for another time) and so happy we chose to come here! A quaint and mellow atmosphere, and we came at happy hour. Drinks were reasonable, although we didn't get any. We chose the spring rolls, which were not bad but also nothing to write home about,  now if there was shrimp in them, that would be a different story! All in all, it was as a great experience and amazing food! Will definitely support this Thai restaurant opposed to those chains... choose local! Always! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great service and food was tasty. I had the red curry with chicken and my husband had the elephant garlic with shrimp - both hit the spot! Great, affordable happy hour appetizer specials too. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Still my favourite place to eat thai food. It is good, great prices and good service. It is not the fanciest place on Queen street but it is a good place to spend a good time and eat great food. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to dine in on a Friday night. My friend Karen W & I decided to meet up here for Thai food. Despite the fact that I already had Thai for lunch, most places that she wanted to try out almost never disappoint. Sure! Let's go!  The restaurant is well decorated. I love all of the paintings that they hang on the wall. I ordered the King of garlic with beef that comes with a side of Jasmine rice. If you love the taste of garlic, this dish is definitely heavenly. The beef is tender and completely covered with the taste of garlic (with garlic flakes all over it). I also tried a bite of the drunken noodles with shrimps. The portion was generous and noodles are tasty. Another dish I tried was the Pad Thai. It is just as delicious. When we finished the meal, I was so full that I rolled myself out the door.   Service is quick and friendly. If you are in the area looking for good Thai food with huge amount of selections, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Green papaya salad was good. Shrimp was a bit overcooked and cold, but service was nice."}
{"text":"Nice services. Their drunken noodle tastes like basic chow fun. The green curry is decent. The sea food dish is relatively fresh."}
{"text":"was craving Thai food and while my options are now abundant i figured i would check out Thai Elephant. heck it's not that far off the Dash line and the dash circles around my 'hood now so why not.  dinner for 2 reasonably priced and HOLY BASIL it was good. OK lame jokes aside. the food was very good. portions are enough to feed you twice and the flavors are off the charts. we split an order of Pad Z U, Pad (something i forgot) the Satay Chicken skewers and the vegetable rolls.  the tamarind dipping sauce for the satay...excellent. the Pad ZU excellent. slightly sweet and decently spicy (i got medium)  the dipping sauce for the vegetable rolls was a sweet peanut sauce. very tasty. the other pad dish was excellent as well. wish i could remember its name.  pricing is affordable. considering the portions it's perfect.  the dining area is quaint and very comfortable. but if you have more then 5 people it might be hard to get seating if the place is busy.  check it out, thumbs up."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I had the hottest meal of my life here.  At one point I literally thought I heard sirens and found myself zonning out on my conversation my mind instead wandering to where the nearest ER was and if my insurance would cover something like this.  Anyway,  it was a good thing.  A very good thing.   I love the panag and this place makes it the way I like it.  I usually get it Thai Hot which is their \"hottest\" spice level but this time, maybe the cooks had read some of the \"not hot enough\" flavored reviews on here, because he brought the heat.  Their Thai Iced-Tea is yummy.  It was my only saving grace.  I slowly sipped at when I felt tears welling in my eyes.    During lunch I'd say arrive early or just after lunch rush.  They have gotten better with their service from when they first opened several months ago.  When its packed you are going to wait though.  They offer this little bowl of hot seasoned water (soup?) before the meal which I think is nice.  Keeps you entertained while you wait for your food.  Also I love that they throw in a spring roll for dishes on their lunch menu.  Oh, the atmosphere in there is pretty nice for a spot tucked away in a strip mall.  Last time i was there they were playing some nice jazz.  The decor is earthy and warm.  One thing though, they could REALLY use a water feature.  Like a fountain or a fish tank.  Oh yeah, I don't think I'll be getting Thai Hot again. But I will most certainly be back."}

The dinner portion is big enough to save half for lunch the next day or for sharing IMO. Sometimes I get overtaken by the tastiness and grub it all down in one sitting though.  I'm so glad they have a downtown location as I really enjoy the Tempe location for lunch.  The thai tea here is also quite yummy and could double as desert."}
