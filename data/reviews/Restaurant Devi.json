{"text":"Extraordinary customer service shows they know what business they're in (Hospitality). Will return to explore more of this menu. The chef really knows sauces. So tasty and so subtle. This is a place to explore Indian cuisine. No wonder Devi is recommended by the major Montreal hotels. Devi features familiar Indian dishes but also diverges into regional fare. A good place to explore food and wine pairing. Our friends from India armed us with suggested dishes to try and we were delighted."}
{"text":"I took my family here the other night. All in all it was ok but not great. The service was good. The food was average but not great. I've been to Indian restaurants all over and have never been charged extra for rice? 4 dollars for a small bowl is just not right."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place with fantastic food!  Be prepared to take your time to enjoy every mouthful. It's an expensive place for dinner but worth it. Try the lunch special for a real treat. The staff is very friendly too.   Don't expect to get in and out quick. Just sit back and enjoy."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good, waiters and waitresses were nice, price wasn't too bad if you just stick to entrees (appetizers).  Naan, as always, is good.  Tried to get the lady server to try some of the food she hadn't had before, she declined.  4 out of 5 big globe lights."}
{"text":"We had a great meal. The restaurant excelled in all categories I.e. ambience, service, food, and location."}
{"text":"\"Devi\" is on the hip and popular Crescent Street. Going up a dozen steps, you enter a very lovely interior, beautifully decorated and accented with gorgeously carvel wooden doors, shutters and columns. The unusual arrangements of colorful lamp clusters hanging from the ceiling definitely add an element of understated pizzas to the elegant decor.   We snagged a table for two in the window, and promptly placed our order:  keema naan for appetizer; vegetable Jalfraze, Chana masala and a small rice to share for the main course, paired with red wine.  While waiting, we were served papadum with the usual green and red sauces, but this restaurant makes a lovely sin on the standard offering: their papadum is shaped into cones. Quite different.... Stands out.   Keema naan arrived, and it was superb: the meat was perfectly seasoned, fresh and moist; the dough was tasty, baked to crispy edges, but not dried out. A perfect start. Chana masala was good, very spicy, even a bit too much for me, the fire-eater. I can deal with that, but the consistency of the sauce was a bit too liquidy. Still, went quite well over rice. The stir-fried Jalfraze veggies were excellent: perfect mix of flavors and heat, with thicker sauce, and veggies still retaining their texture. We took our time to enjoy and savor the meal, sip our wine, and people-watch through the large bay window.   Satiated with a fantastic dinner, we ventured into the snowy and frigid Montreal streets.   One star off for a slow service: only three tables were occupied."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable atmosphere.  Their service was excellent.  The food exemplified the delicate and refined art of Indian cooking.  Each spice, and every morsel of food was vibrant with every bite, layers and bundles of flavours.  Fresh and alive Indian food!  If you enjoy Indian Food and are in Montreal, Devi is a must.  Specific Foods which I enjoyed: Nan, Aloo Gobi, Tadka Dal, Raita, Chai, Gulab Jamun, Saffron rice."}
{"text":"They has too much oil in their food.  Cocktails were worse. Too pricy.  Never coming back here.  Even the service was below average."}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was excellent, made exactly how I requested it.  They have a wide selection of both meat and vegetarian dishes.  Service was good, attentive but not annoying. Location is great and atmosphere is nice but not overly formal.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food. Great decor. Great service. Ordered butter chicken and paneer korma. Both were above average IMHO. Definitely a place to check out if in the area"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Best indian food I've ever had. Great service!!! Excellent taste! Thank you! Will come again for sure"}
{"text":"Great food. Had lamb vindaloo and my friend had lamb rogan Josh, so tasty that we had to come the next day before we leave the city! Must have the butter Nann, it has a special creamy sweet taste, heaven!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  We just happened to stop in and got delicious food and delightful service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our New Years Eve dinner here. The food and service were both fantastic."}
{"text":"I'lll start this review off with a warning that I'm not very familiar with Indian food, and Devi was one of the first I've tried, so I may be a bit biased in that respect. With that being said, this restaurant is one of my favourites in Montreal! Every time I've been here, I've left pleasantly (occasionally painfully) full with enough food packed away for the next day's lunch.  My meals here have been limited to weekday dinners and weekend lunches, and only very recently did I eat the lunch buffet for the first time. In my experience, the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet has the best value, especially the unlimited naan bread, which is pretty much my reason to live, but it lacks the presentation and selection that dinner has. And, of course, the food at dinner is fresher since it hasn't been sitting at the buffet table for a few hours waiting for someone to pick it up. Still, the lunch is a steal for its price, and it's great when you're in the mood for anything and everything all at once.  Dinner is a cosy, ambient affair. One detail that stands out for me is the gorgeous lighting - I almost want to steal one of those lamps! The service is attentive but quiet, which is nice when you're trying to hold a conversation at your table. Overall, I'll continue coming back to this charming and conveniently located restaurant.   Note: the free tea offer isn't available at lunch."}
{"text":"Here is a helpful hint. If you are Indian or a Pakistani or a Britisher please do yourself a favor and avoid this place. We ate here today and ordered three dishes. Butter chicken, Paneer Makhani and Dal Makhani. Dal Makhani was good. The other two dishes were made with the following recipe:   1.  Open jar of tomato soup 2. Fry some onions 3. Add chicken or paneer based on what has been requested 4.  Serve in a nice dish and charge $18.00  Oh and you want something with it? Naan or rice is not included.   Then we got charged for an extra naan and when I gently reminded the waiter, he would not take my answer until he went back and checked with the kitchen?  Really, some one who spends $80 for this lousy stuff will rip you off for $4.00?    Anyway we got past that and I left the customary tip even though the Indian in me was fuming. Well, I could not resist and asked the waiter as we were leaving to explain what happened?  You know his answer?   \"sir, 99 percent of people who come here are white people. If we cooked for Indians, we would go out of business\".   Hmm...I thought to myself, \"Really, and it never occurred to you when you saw an Indian family to ask us how we would like the spices\"?    Oh regardless of the spice level, please never ever...ever ..yever...yever put tomato soup in any Indian dish. Even if it is Indian tomato soup.   So, again my Indian, Pakistani or British friends...please walk on by and eat some good bar food available around the corner.   ...and my white friends...if you eat here, please don't come to me and say...\"we had this really awesome Indian food in Montreal\"... This ain't Indian food!  Got it?   Good !!!"}
{"text":"We found this near by restaurant and took a take out menu for a relaxed eat in evening but then decided to go out to the pleasant looking dining room. To our surprise the prices for Dining in were quite a bit hirer than the take out menu. Nonetheless the food was plentiful and quite tasty. The garlic nan was delicious. Not the best Indian food I've had but above average. But with so many options in Montreal not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Hard sell from the wait staff wasn't appreciated. The service was horribly slow, and we had to beg for our bill. I ultimately had to approach the apologetic bartender to close out our bill since it had been over a half hour since we first wanted our bill.  The food was ok, nothing special. A little overpriced for what you get too, but ultimately satisfying. The seasonings aren't exactly authentic either. The dal makhani basically tasted like Mexican chili but with lentils.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"I order a couple of times a year from this place. I am not expert of Indian food, but personally I love their food.  This time, the food was good as always. And I would rate 4 starts I was not disappointed about the changes they made to the menu: -I had to choose between a Naan and rice... I wanted both, so I had to pay for rice, which arrived in a quite small portion, not even big enough for one person. They used to provide both a Naan and a decent rice portion with each main dish. -No yogurt sauce anymore (sorry I don't know the actual name)  I will admit though, that the entr√©e were bigger than usual.  Still, all these changes came with a 20% price increase compared to last time... So I think I'll be shopping to see if I Can get more value for the money at other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was uniformly excellent. Appetizers and mains. Great naan. Had lamb jalfrezi and chicken chettinad. Both great. Channa masala was ok. Prices are high for Indian, but it has a real upscale feel a great downtown location and delicious food. 4 people at every well for just over $100 plus wine and tip. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. One of the few places it seems in Montreal you can get spicy food (thank goodness).  The lunch specials are great. You get a big plate of food. Usually it comes with soup, raw veggie salad, an appetizer, naan, rice, choice of entree, and dessert (plus dal makhani on weekends). The weekday lunch special has a different menu than the weekend one. When I went the weekend lunch special offered butter chicken, one of my favorite dishes.  I'm not sure if their specials change throughout the year, but there are also happy hour specials, so check it out!  The dinner (or \"regular\") menu has a lot of variety. It's a little expensive, but similarly priced to the other restaurants on Crescent Street. This is what you pay downtown, it seems!"}
{"text":"Well thought out decor It's the standard buffet fare. Best choice in the 'hood."}
{"text":"I'm torn with my review here. The ambience is nice, very authentic and the food was tasty.  The restaurant is pretty upscale, so the prices are high compared to portion size. However,  our server was too condescending for my taste. It was one of those Indian restaurants that don't love Indian people ( you know what I'm talking about). Since service is so important for me, I don't know if i would go back, but the food and ambience deserve their due credit."}
{"text":"After a few nights of amazing Quebec cuisine, it was time for a good soul warming Indian meal. The Devi was near our hotel and shared equally good reviews as another within our walking radius.  On a hot summer's night the fact that this Crescent St resto offered a deck won us over, the richly flavored food and charming attentive service of our waiter, Adam, made us glad we came. The the lamb kebabs were sumptuous and, if Colonel Saunders was there, he'd tell you himself that the garlic naan was finger licking good. Likely my stand out fav of the night was the daal makhani - a black lentil dish that is simmered for 8 hours of flavor-filled, stick-to-your ribs perfection. The night was so lovely we lingered on after dinner was complete enjoying a bottle of wine, the street views and chatting with other guests. The delightful scents wafting from other tables made me want to keep eating, save I was too full for another bite.  From my street view, the interior decor looked quite nice. If they could bring a little of that feeling to the terrace it would be even better. We will return on our next visit."}
{"text":"No other customers when other restaurants on the block were packed. Waiter loudly arguing with people on at least 3 phone calls. Waiter hasn't been directed to wear deodorant.  Mediocre food.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Craving an Indian snack, we stumbled across Devi on a particularly hot day in Montreal. Located on the shady side of very busy and popular Crescent street, we were concerned that we'd be the only people on the small patio and therefore felt we were taking our chances, but were determined to have Indian over pub food.   Having had some terrible service while visiting Montreal, I wasn't holding out for exceptional service here either. I was pleasantly surprised. The wait staff was very attentive and the appetizers we had were incredible and fresh. We ordered the samosas, vegetable skewers, the potato patties and spicy chicken mikka. All were very satisfying. The only disappointment was their lack of variety for Indian beer...the only available ones being on draught. We chose Heineken to compliment our afternoon snack.   Looking forward to trying a full dinner here next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Went to Devi for a mid afternoon snack and to escape the rain. Was pleasantly surprised at the modern interior and Indian decor. From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much but the inside is really well kept. The restaurant was playing olden day Bollywood music and added to the cute ambience of the place.   We ordered tomato soup and used the Yelp Check In deal to get free chai. Both items were excellent since they arrived hot to the table and were delicious! Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to order anything else since we weren't that hungry but I would definitely return to Devi for a full meal. We also saw the lunch buffet on display when we went and for $14.99, it sounds like a steal!"}
{"text":"Myself being Indian, I could say I will be the biggest critic! This place is cozy and has a positive vibe. I ordered the kebob meat platter to start, which was off the hook since it consisted of chicken, beef, goat & lamb. Main course ordered lamb biryani (rice), naan and kulcha (bread), butterchicken (chicken curry), daal makhni (lentil curry), saag (cooked spinach/rapini) and dahi (yogurt). Everything was fresh, hot and flavourful. Also, the server Sapan was so friendly and checked in regularly. If you dont mind spice and great Indian cuisine, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Pour 2, environ 52$ incluant vin  Bon choix mais limit√© comme buffet. Plats go√ªteux, relev√©s. Poulet au beurre, cari, bhaji. J'ai bien aim√©. Excellent service"}
{"text":"Food was okay, extremely bad service. Arrogant server, did not attended us properly.   Food variety was less and quality was bad compare to Indian standard   I will no go there again"}
{"text":"Le brunch √† volont√© du WE est vraiment top! Il y a un large choix de plats, tous aussi bons les uns que les autres! Pour 15$, √ßa vaut vraiment la peine! Vous pouvez aussi prendre en extra du caf√© (pour moins de 3$ il me semble) ou du lassi. Tr√®s bon service, ils nous ont m√™me mis le chauffage car nous avions froid! A essayer si ce n'est pas d√©j√† fait!"}
{"text":"Only decent Indian restaurant I've been to so far. It's expensive but the dishes are full of flavor when you take a first bite. I recommend ordering the manchurian cauliflower (appetizer), butter chicken, and any of the usual curries like lamb/chicken etc.  It's vegetarian friendly and service is friendly. They also have weird spices at the door that look like potpourri, I think it's to freshen your breath."}
{"text":"Best indian restaurant in Montreal.  It is on crescent and went with the style.  Nice decor and good looking. Paneer Makhani is out of the world. We really enjoyed the food and good ambience. It is on the pricey side but worth it if you are looking for good indian food."}
{"text":"Stay away! Worst service, terrible food and total rip off. So the sangria was weak...not sure it was even made with wine. The butter chicken tasted like Ragu. Totally not worth $5, much less $19! Then the waitress recommended the blonde Taj Mahal beer, but she brought out an amber beer. I told her i didn't order it, but she said i could try it and if i didn't like it she would bring the blonde. I took a sip and didn't want it. She brings back the same beer, saying the tap is broken on the blonde. I said ok, but i dont like that one. She says \"he already poured it and said he can't take it back.\" What? You bring the wrong beer and you don't want to own your mistake? I was never offered another drink snd she never came back to check on the food. I got the bill and there is a $4 charge for rice!!! Not special rice, mind you...plain rice. When she asked rice or naan, she never mentioned there was an extra charge. I have never been to an asian restaurant where you are served a stew and have to pay extra for rice! So I left a $1 tip. What does the server do? Throw the receipt at me!  This place is all about profit and not about food. Terrible experience....spend your money anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Went there on a quiet sunday evening. We ordered samosa (yes there was just one!) to begin with. It was dry and unseasoned and the salad was definitely just there to decorate (and apparently it had been there decorating for a few days). We then had lamb rogan josh and the butter chicken... I wondered if the chef had even ever been to India... Either he hasn't or the taste of people for indian food around here asked him to downplay the food. It was very bland, clearly he forgot his spices somewhere. The rice was overcooked. The only positive point was the naan, which was quite surprisingly good. Thanks for the naan, chef!  Not at all a good indian food (unless you don't know what indian food tastes like and enjoy blandness) and above all quite expensive for the quality served. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian restaurant in N.America. Excellent quality. The selection of wines was good and so were the vegetarian dishes I tried."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - I would have given more stars if it hadn't been for the rude attitude of the waitresses.  I have been there more than once - and each time the waitresses have shown some unfriendly body language or made disapproving facial expressions even at the simplest of requests (like asking for a spoon). Also one time one waitress indirectly demanded a tip."}
{"text":"We had a delightful dinner here. The costumer service was top notch, the ambiance was perfect for a date or a group of friends. Very beautifully decorated! The somosas were great and the cauliflower appetizer was also good, although it was heavily breaded. We didn't want both naan and basmati with our main dishes because we feared it would be too much food, but I regret not getting the rice. The naan was delicious but we got the eggplant and the yellow lentil dish. The later was very liquidy, almost soupy. The flavor was amazing though.  Overall, this was a great evening! I'd for sure check it out :-)"}
{"text":"By far, one of the best samosas I've ever eaten; their naan bread is simply delicious, and I've only tried two (plain and spinach) of the several kinds they offer. The tandoori chicken was fantastic, cooked to perfection in my honest opinion, and the portion was generous enough that you could easily share it.   One tip, don't disregard the little white sauce that accompanies your chicken, mixed with it and the vegetables make a superb flavor combination.   A must-return restaurant, there's just so many dishes to try out."}
{"text":"AbFab Indian food, lovely decor, LOVE the ceiling lanterns and the food even more. I'd have to say, so far, that in my not so humble opinion, this is the best Indian restaurant in the downtown area. Lamb patties, okra.... NOT the usual slimey okra, but believe it or not ,crispy and just delicious, you'll change your mind about the vegetable forever. Lamb with cumin, a potato dish, I can't remember the name, but it was a revelation, as I was not even aware potatoes were even consumed in India as accompaniments.Live and learn.  Spiced eggplant, ALWAYS order it, several varieties of naan, which one to pick: the plain is super , but the onion , garlic, and I've forgotten which others. Such a dilemma! I've been here several times already and I've NEVER been disappointed. This place is NOT cheap, but worth it,service always good."}
{"text":"I'm not an Indian foodie, even though one of my best friends is Indian and she brought to one of the best places in the city. Truth be told, I wasn't particularly excited to go there.   So, Devi has a list of lunch specials. You get a soup, salad, dessert and coffee. I chose the lamb Rogan Josh.   Remember when you were in school and you got a plate with your drink, meal, soup and dessert. Well this is similar, only much better, in all the ways. First, the food is obviously a million times better. Second, on your plate, which is nicely presented, you have your main course, a bowl of rice, a small salad and a rice pudding.   The lamb was actually very good. It wasn't too spicy for my taste. My boss bragged about their na'an bread and I got to say it was delicious. I think I ate an entire plate to myself.   Conclusion: Much better than I expected, considering I am not a fan of Indian food. I won't go back voluntarily, but if people want to go, I won't complain."}
{"text":"Having eaten at most of the Indian joints in Montreal, Devi restaurant deserves a mention for its authentic North Indian cuisine. The quality and the taste of the food served is by far the best in Montreal. I would recommend the foodies to try out Butter Chicken and Lamb Roganjosh which are my favourites here. The Naan bread served  is one of the best.   I frequently visit this place but I always order the same dishes. I shall try out new dishes next time :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch on Canada Day. Choices for their special lunch were excellent and presentation of food was superb. Rogan Josh, Shrimp Masala, Butter Chicken, Dal Makhani were very tasty. Naan bread served with lunch had a special taste also. Desserts- Gulab Jamun and Rasmali were nice too. Service was good as well and price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Si vous voulez manger de la bonne cuisine indienne je peux vous conseiller celui-ci car tout √©tait excellent et ce qui est bien c'est que c'est un buffet √† volont√© donc vous pouvez go√ªter √† tout :-)   J'enl√®ve une √©toile pour 2 petits d√©tails mais qui pour moi fait la diff√©rence, ils avaient mit la clim dans la salle alors que dehors il faisait froid et pour le check in qui nous faisait b√©n√©ficier d'un chai indien offert mais ils n'ont pas voulu nous l'offrir car c'√©tait dimanche et de plus dans le cadre de Montr√©al √† table.."}
{"text":"I would have given this one four stars if it wasn't expensive. But then again I am a student on a budget.  A bunch of my friends were visiting Montreal over a long weekend and we decided to try this one out. The decor was well done, the staff was friendly and the service was good.   The food was tastier compared to most of the other Indian Restaurants in Montreal but I have had better. However they do have a really good variety of starters and appetizers and their dishes will leave your taste palate well satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I really liked the interior decoration of the place. They also have special set deals that I really enjoyed. Wide selection, really difficult to choose something to eat. The only downside though is that it is fairly pricey. I would recommend this as a place to try, one of the better indian restaurants in montreal."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to go given some of the yelp reviews. However, it was raining and the restaurant is close to the apt we are staying at, and we are so glad we made the choice! We ordered the veggie samosas for an appetizer and thy were incredible...almost like a dessert. I had a blonde beer, my husband an IPA (though he says it didn't taste like an IPA). We both ordered vegetarian meals, rice and garlic naan. The server, Jeff, was very welcoming and provided service above and beyond what we experience in the states. We didn't finish our food simply because we were full and upon noticing, he checked to make sure we were satisfied with our choices. I will surely be returning!"}
{"text":"Sitting outdoors on Rue Crescent was delightful. The chicken tikka was well spiced. I'm used to it being creamier. The portion was plentiful with rice and naan each ordered on the side. I found the garlic naan pretty strong. If you're sensitive to that, get the regular. The service was quick and polite if not as friendly as the surrounding area that tends to go out of their way to please."}
{"text":"Had the food for delivery. We got the chicken tikka masala and tasted NOTHING like masala sauce more like a poorly made marinara sauce! We also got the mixed grill..salmon was fishy, meat tough- Even the Nan bread..looked good and was doughy and tasteless.  UGH this was SUCH a disappointment. The positives...online ordering and online payment- Montreal is WAY behind on the technology and Devi was amazing for this. SHAME that they food was horrible! Go to Le TAJ for amazing Indian food instead."}
{"text":"Randomly walked in because we saw it from across the street. Was really good and looking forward to trying the place in the city. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. I don't remember what we got not but it was all vegetarian and delicious. I even took a card, in case I came back to Montreal! Ha."}
{"text":"Lovely North Indian restaurant in one of my favorite neighborhoods of Montreal. Great menu features a little bit of everything.  We started our meal with some of the free,  cone-shaped pappads and the delicious green chutney. A little spicy, and very tasty. Then ordered the shrimp appetizer. Delicious, huge shrimp grilled then encrusted in more green chutney. Amazing!  For my entree I chose the goa fish curry--huge chunks of delicious salmon in a delicious watery curry sauce with plenty of onions and ginger. Perfect on a hot day. He ordered a lamb curry. We also had some white rice and plain naan on the side to go along our meal.  For dessert I treated myself to a huge slice of the caramel delice, which was huge and delicious, and very caramelly--it's a layered cake. He had the rasmalai which were two little discs in delicious sugary milky gravy and topped with crushed pistachios.  The outside patio is fun, especially when peaceful student protests go by and for otherwise lovely people watching on a hot, perfect, summer evening.  Great decor, I loved the glass bulb chandeliers. Lovely restroom facilities too."}
{"text":"Was there on friday night and the food was below average. You could see only oil in the paneer and shrimp. Ginger mojito was not well made. The person who served us seemed to be in a hurry. Would never come back. Wonder why it is 4 starred on YELP."}
{"text":"Meilleur resto indien qualit√©/prix!  Le midi il y'a un buffet avec plus de 15 de choix sans compter les desserts pour seulement 15$!!!Les plats √©tait excellent et sans parler de la qualit√© des aliments! J'ai vraiment ador√©, je recommande aux gens qui appr√©cient autant la cuisine indienne que moi!"}
{"text":"The lunch special is well worth the price tag. You get a salad, a small bowl of soup, your main dish, rice, naan and even dessert. Everything is brought out at the same time within 10-15 minutes of ordering. I would come back for lunch to this place and try out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant on Crescent street. The decor and ambiance is just phenomenal and makes it perfect for a casual dinner, date night or any event celebration. The service is excellent as well. We ordered a bunch of dishes : paneer chaat, Kababs, chicken, soup, kurkuri bhindi(crispy okra), Kadhai paneer, baigan bharta(eggplant) and various kinds of naan. Everything was delicious. The highlight of the meal was definitely Paneer chaat and Kurkuri Bhindi(crispy okra). Okra was perfectly crispy and seasoned and is an item that you don't usually find on most Indian restaurants menu. Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Over priced. Got my order wrong. Then got rude and blamed me for it. I ordered Togo before I left for work. The ordered came missing fries and tikka sauce. Ugh chicken, but no sauce?! That's the best part. But I had to go to work so I didn't call immediately. I got home and checked and saw they're opened for at least another hour so I called saying I'm missing the items. I was questioned multiple times why I called now and not at 2, I replied at least 4 times that I got home from work then called. The lady said she can deliver my missing items. The delivery man showed up and asked, \"Oh just woke up?\" And I said again, \"No, just got home from work\" WTF? NOT YOUR BUSINESS.  He followed with lecturing me to double check my order next time and try not calling so late! (THEY DONT EVEN CLOSE UNTIL 11! I called before 10!) here's a tip for you guys, make sure YOU double check the order and not be so rude to your customer when YOU make a mistake."}
{"text":"I called to make an order for my team and then was told to order it online. After doing that I got an email that the order was cancelled. I called the restaurant to find out what happened and was rudely yelled at. I then called the online service that took the order who also mentioned that the person at the restaurant yelled at them and told them the order was too big.   This is the first time I've ever encountered something like this. I won't be ordering from your restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very good food.. Lunch Thali was a deal.. Very filling and perfect for 1 person.. Good sizes.. I had the Seekh kabab, lamb roganjosh, dal makhani, rice, naan, ras malai.. All for ~$18 per person..Taste is good unlike Kashmir in Old Montreal.."}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped by Restaurant D√©vi on a Sunday evening and we gave a try to their tea, Samosa and Palak Naan (spinach bread) and we loved it! After trying the Maharaja Buffet a fortnight before, we can honestly say there is no comparison: the presentation, freshness and taste of the food at D√©vi is of great quality. The atmosphere of the place is also rich and welcoming. D√©vi was a nice discovery and we'll certainly go back in the future."}
{"text":"We loved this place!! The chicken tikka masala and dal makhani were awesome. Samosas, too, and naan. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place - it is WAY overpriced for what it provides. The food is decent but not excellent but everything is about twice the standard price."}
{"text":"Very good food. Can be customized for spicy like any restaurant but what makes this one different is that the medium spicy is not so much that you can't eat but enough so that you get some flavor out of it. A little kick if you will.  So why is it 5 stars?  In my opinion, it is the first Indian restaurant in North America to give a good Malai Kebab. So that's one star.  Everything is made fresh, and the servers are very friendly. Another star.  They have an outside seating as well, and I think the view from there of the streets are just gorgeous.  The food is again, very good. I ordered naan, garlic Naan, roti, and onion kulcha which were very good and very fresh. Can be made as crispy as you want. 4 stars now.  I also ordered Palak(Spinach) chicken medium spicy. Again it's just enough that you get a good kick and it's good for those who aren't used to spicy food. A medium spicy Palak Chicken is the way to go.   Last Star.  The inside is very authentic both French and Indian. The lighting and ambience is perfect at any table, and for those legal to drink (not me at 19, but you maybe) there is a bottle if you want it. Of course this restaurant is Bring Your Own Bottle if you'd like too.   This restaurant is a little upscale in my opinion. I am a student so I have to watch it. But for $29 the restaurant offers a good three-fer deal.   And a bonus star I'd say goes to the cleanliness of the washrooms and the down to earth professionalism of the staff.   Great place to eat and one of the best kebabs I've had to date. Eating here is a must if you come to Montreal. :)"}
{"text":"Place is located at one of the happening street and open till late. In appetizer, karari bhindi and bhati chicken is a must try...am a repeat visitor and always order at least these two dishes. Really love the taste and the way its cooked...however would rate the service as average. Also, didn't like Cauliflower Manchurian in appetizer"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to try.  Nothing to complain about.  Ambiance is nice, location is convenient being in the heart of the action in downtown,, waitress was awesome with an inviting smile every time she talked to us, food was delicious and cost was above average but definitely worth it.  We had the lamb, the tondoori chicken, the lamb curry, the shrimp briyani and everyone really liked their food.  Will definitely come back when were visiting Montreal again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good, although it is quite expensive compared to other Indian restaurants. One order can easily go up to $20, the portion is not large but enough for a nice dinner. Naan and rice are not included so you usually have to buy extras. The quality of the food is great though, we had some lamb and butter chicken and were very satisfied with the meal as well as the service."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food, and really good naan. Their portions are pretty large, so two people can actually share a 'special' (appetizer and entree) order. Their delivery, however, takes a while, and they must have a conversation about customer intake for their database, before they take the order (that's why it took 25 minutes to order, and add the 45 minute delivery time). Their chicken tandoori is not very impressive and pretty dry."}
{"text":"Disgusting service. Food came after an hour. Servers was extremely useless. Did not even ask how the food was or if we want anything else...!!  DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY..RATHER GO TO CASINO...!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard. The naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"The inside has a lovely ambiance, and the servers are great! However, it is rather expensive for sub-par and unauthentic quality. The dal makhani and lentil soup were fine, but my malai kofta was very dry, which it really shouldn't be, and the naan was wayy too oily. At this price point, you might as well go to Le Taj or Singh's for better Indian food..."}
{"text":"Not too shabby but a very disappointing chicken tikka masala wouldn't recommend. Ginger mojito was yummy but  a weak drink.  Naan was awesome. So was the chicken dish with coconut milk in it. Wouldn't come back just for that though Indian food seems to be much better back in the states."}
{"text":"Perfect for a great lunchtime meal and deal! I can only describe the restaurant's lunchtime special as a bigger version of a Bento Box. First you pick one of the main entr√©e options (vegetarian available) and the rest: daily appetizer, naan, rice, salad, soup and desert is included. I chose the salmon and it was moist and succulent pieces. Every part of the meal was delicious and even though the portions are not large, by the end of the meal you feel full and satisfied. This is a great way to get a taste of multiple dishes at once.  The restaraunt also offers daily food and drink specials. For our visit on Thursday, we had the bottle of wine for just $29. But overall I know we will return for the good food and great service. Our waiter was kind, knowledgeable and helpful. He was courteous in his translations of French to English. This made us tourists feel very welcome."}
