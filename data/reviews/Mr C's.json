{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine for 20 years. Their burgers are my favorite and for the same price as a fast food meal ($5-8) you can have much better food!  They have a good selection of desserts and the ladies who refill drinks are always super sweet (I leave them a little tip but I'm not sure if that's typical, maybe a good idea to drop a dollar or two, can't hurt!). The drive-thru can get a little busy but they always handle it at a quick pace and I've never gotten home to find a screwed up order. They always ALWAYS put two packets of ketchup in the box with each meal, even if you forget to ask!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast, not bad price for what you get. Enjoy the chicken. And burgers are great. Will not disapoint."}
{"text":"Yeah, Good food for the price. Daily specials and a lot of room."}
{"text":"Just not that great.  Plus they gave me a cup with a dead gnat in it.  When I walked in to get another, they gave me the same cup with the dead gnat in it.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers In the state.  Makes cook out taste like Burger King.  Not sure about the service though.  Drive through window was a quick stop between business meetings."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Terrible food!! No service! Small portions! I don't think people that have given this place high ratings have ever ate anywhere else before. I went once because of a friend. Never going back."}
{"text":"Mr C's is a great family restaurant! I go for their burgers and taters... Yum! Every once in a while I get the flounder and omg, the best ever!  I usually start arguing with myself about which one to eat as soon as I think of the name. lol. I love them both!  Ill be honest, I am a creature of habit I get the same thing every where I go. I seldom try anything new. I have heard that their chicken is great but I cant say for sure. I have, however tried their chicken livers and ooh la la... Tremendous! It must be a great restaurant or I would never have 3 favorites. Did I mention they have great prices,too?  Another home town place to keep the people coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I eat here very often. So much so that my parents jokingly call it my father's house  . But the food is good and the prices are very reasonable. Plus Ms. Jackie makes every visit a special one."}
{"text":"From out of town. Wanted to try something new. Price was right. Time it took to order and receive was quick.  Had the seafood platter...ehhh, it was fried food...what can I say. Everything was fried...fish, shrimp, fries, chicken...just kinda plain fried food.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is Concord's version of Charlotte's Showmars.  The food is always good in both taste and value."}
{"text":"My go to for lunch when I'm in Concord. The burgers are delicious, MUCH better than those big name chains. Similar to South 21 in Charlotte. Fries are consistently good too, a must for me."}
{"text":"I always get the grilled ham and cheese sandwich with fries. the sandwich has a grilled bun with American cheese mayonnaise and tomato.  Just really delicious.
I usually use the drive thru and they are really fast.
From the young lady taking my order to the young lady bringing my food out to my car are always very nice."}
{"text":"The flounder sandwich is delicious, great portion size and the tarter sauce is very good. Fries are frozen but still good. This place always is packed. Good food for decent prices! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Sunday's when the Chicken Coop is closed and I feel like driving to Concord for some delicious pollo frito, I go to Mr. C's.  My typical meal of choice is a three piece dinner or a two piece snack with taters and a roll. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and fried to a crispy golden brown.  The taters are just as delicious! Rolled in flour and fried, there's a slight crisp to them yet the center is tender. Sounds strange, but I eat the taters with their signature tarter sauce. (Don't knock it till you try it!) I've never had a burger here, but the chicken sandwich, calabash shrimp are good choices too. The food is always consistent, which explains why the drive thru is packed. If you're pressed for time, it might be easier to walk inside and order."}
{"text":"The chicken was dry. The seafood was a good portion but greasy. The restaurant had no personality. Very generic. Not worth a trip back for me"}
{"text":"Friendly staff...  zero ambiance... food is fair.  Had a hamburger that was bland. Chicken was dry. Fries were frozen. Taters were great though!!!  Kinda reminds me of middle school except for the great Taters. Price was low for the quantity!"}
{"text":"Mr. C's is our go to place for take out. They have the best fried chicken, chicken tenders, grilled chicken sandwich and they are famous for their wedges! We order from them frequently and have had several parties catered by them. 

With call in orders it's like playing roulette; you may get the surly old lady working the phones or the overly bubbly teen. Either way you end up with good food at a great price. 

Tip: get extra honey mustard for the wedges and their \"large\" drink is more like a medium size. Order the jumbo with light ice or two sips later it will be gone. A major problem when you get something to go. 

Happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"Mr. C's feels like home to me. I remember going here when I was super young, and even when I go back every now and then, the feeling of comfort is still there.

The food is yummy and affordable. Great for take out.

The staff is always friendly. 

I think one of my favorite things is the fact that they have a Sun Drop drink dispenser where most places would have a Coke or Pepsi one. It really is the little things, I guess."}
{"text":"Service is pretty quick. Ordering is pretty easy. Food is pretty bland. They have a Mrs. Pac-Man arcade game inside though if you're into that kind of thing. 
We had a 3 piece chicken and a shrimp plate. Everything was blah, coleslaw,  hush puppies, french fries all needed seasoning. Chicken needed seasoning. Probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Always exactly what you go for! Grease! Chicken salad is good and everything comes out quick. Wish there were more locations!"}
{"text":"Good prices health portions and I love the fried chicken"}
{"text":"I love Mr.Cs I grew up going there with family and every now and again I'll grab some takeout. The honey mustard is so good. The food is just your average cheap food but that's what you get, it's Mr Cs not a fancy place just your average burgers and chicken with wedges or fries"}
{"text":"My family and I were staying the night in Concord and looked for a place to eat for dinner.  I searched yelp and Mr. C's Restaurant sounded appealing from most of the reviews on Yelp.  

Normally, when placing your order in a drive-thru, your at the menu talking into the intercom, well not here.  You are placing your order when you get to the window and your asked to drive forward in a numbered spot.  We did not wait for very long, the service was surprisingly quick.  

My husband ordered the chicken breast fillet with potato wedges as a side.  I had the deluxe cheeseburger with salad. We were not enthused about the food.  He stated it was not appetizing, the meat was very dry.   I thought the salad was much better than the deluxe cheeseburger.  We were looking forward to eating here after reading the reviews."}
{"text":"Mr.C's is pretty good- grill cheese and fries are my fav and don't forget the cherry cheesecake or pecan pie !!! Mmmmmm - staff is always friendly - a lil pricey tho but overall Great!"}
{"text":"This is an after church, Sunday favorite for my family! We ate here today! The place is always packed, but don't let that steer you away. The friendly staff will get your order quick and the wait for the food is speedy too. While you eat, there are always a couple of waitresses that refill drinks and make sure your table is okay. They also have recently renovated the restaurant and it looks great! Super clean! This place is awesome and so is the food!"}
{"text":"I know what the reviews say in essence, but this place is PACKED every single day at lunch!  So despite the review averages, I had find out what goes on inside this place at lunch each day.  This day, not unlike any other, was packed with no available parking.  So I went with a 2 pc dinner, upgrading to two breasts, with the slaw and tater wedges.  The breasts are on the small side was my initial diagnosis.  More along the size of chicken thighs, but the golden crust left me hope anyway.  The skin had a nice flavor to it, and the white meat itself was really juicy but lacking any flavorful punch!  The potato wedges were good, but certainly nothing separating them from any others you've had elsewhere.  They serve Flounder and Popcorn Shrimp as well, and I did see several people with the flounder.  I have a thing though with ordering fish at a fast food style place such as this, so I won't be able to say how good it is or isn't.
All said, it isn't bad, but I certainly don't understand the mass of people you'll see here on any given day at lunch!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! They ALWAYS get my order right, and I'm the type that makes a lot of modifications to my order. FAST doesn't begin to describe the service, whether you eat in or take out.  Everything is good, from the Super C to the calabash shrimp. You can get their salads in a shell or without, but in a shell is best. Tater wedges are another favorite, as are the hushpuppies. Just writing this review is making my mouth water!"}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced and has a great ham sandwich with home fries that are seasoned just right and buttery soft on the inside. The decor is not up to date but has it's charm, lots of locals and a fast alternative to Christos on Branchview (which oddly enough is not on yelp)"}
{"text":"Husband and I drive by all the time and the place is packed, so we had to try. What a mistake! The kids at the counter are rude, the place is disgustingly filthy and the food is an absolute oily, tasteless, horrible mess. Their sweet tea is even old tasting. I can't even stand to drive by this place anymore - the smell used to be enticing, now it makes me want to vomit."}
{"text":"If you ever drive by Mr. C's and the parking lot isn't full, they're probably not open. There's a reason why this place is always packed: Mr. C's delivers a lot of bang for your buck. The Super C is a better burger than most fast food burgers, and with fries it's under $6! The newly-remodeled interior reminds me a little of Five Guys, but the bright and clean look is very inviting. The service is friendly, and they have great nightly specials. This is a great place for lunch, a quick dinner, or a delicious and gluttonous afternoon snack."}
{"text":"Something about those places named after a letter that just make you feel like they ought to be good. Unfortunately, this one wasn't that great. Not that there was anything especially wrong - it was just that I had hoped for more.

If it was named \"Cosmo's\" or something it probably would have been fine. But looking for something a little more interesting, I suppose.

Staff wasn't especially nice. In fact, I don't remember anything at all about them, and the menu also had nothing at all interesting on it. We might as well have gone to any other fast food place, because while there was nothing bad, there was also nothing memorable about the place."}
{"text":"Not bad. We just moved down the street. My dad was visiting from Cali and he loves fried chicken. He brought home some Mr. C's and since then we've been back twice. They have a nice weekend special that we get. I like their wing sauce and their wedges. The chicken itself is pretty good too. Definitely beats the typical chain chicken places in the area."}
{"text":"I gave Mr. C's a 5 star because it has been a family favorite since childhood. nothing better than a Mr. C burger with some taters (potato wedges for all you yankee transplants) and an ice cold Sundrop.

Not a fan of the chicken but everything else is yummy and filling. Kids love the huge chicken tender plate that is offered here. Always tell my friends to go here and order a bucket-o-taters (crispy).

Love me some Mr.C's"}
{"text":"Good fried chicken,  but they don't have enough side items to choose from.  Not thrilled with their mashed potatoes or coleslaw.  What Southern fried food place doesn't have okra?"}
{"text":"Let me tell you......my mom was in the concord area, and stopped to get me some chicken livers, because they are my favorite and they help with low iron too lol . Anyway when she got home with that chicken box OMG, it was love at first sauce I meant sight :) . I grabbed that Texas Pete hot sauce and went to town on those delicious crispy chicken livers . They were just as I remembered them to be, as a little girl :) . I love Mr. C's, and highly recommend them any day plus, they give you a lot for the price. I ate for like 2 days lol . 5 stars hands down can't wait to go back ugh lol ."}
{"text":"Food here is consistently fantastic. Everyone who works here is happy and always have smiles on their face.  So nice to be somewhere that the employees take pride in their jobs and workplace."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday and had the chicken dinner with slaw and mashed potatoes. It was very good. My wife had the fish and my son had a burger. We all left satisfied. It's always difficult to decide what to order."}
