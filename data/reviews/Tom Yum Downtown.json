{"text":"I got mine to go. Food quality is excellent.  However i got rice instead of noodles.  It was a long wait. Due to the superbowl being in town they should off hired more staff to serve."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service but expensive for what we ordered. $50 for lunch for 2 people was more than we expected."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant this horrible. I don't think these people know what Pho is. Broth didn't even taste like Pho. They put precooked meat into the soup which turns very hard and chewy. Portions are very small. I had to ask for all the condements which didn't even come with bean sprouts. My wife ordered the big seafood soup which looked like my 4 year old would not even be satisfied with the portions. I don't think I can give this place negative rating but I won't recommend it to anyone and will I never go there. This place has absolutely nothing to do with Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Slow service, mediocre food. 
Came in yesterday for late lunch, and spent about 50 minutes of our hour there waiting. Only one waiter on a busy Saturday. Got the chicken ginger and friend had noodles and a beer. Once good arrived I asked for seasoning, finished eating before the waiter even remembered to bring salt out. One drink refill and she forgot my friends water. No charge for the beer but that's the only good thing. Food was meh, I could make better pretend Thai at home for less cost and in 20 minutes. If your hungry pick a better place."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Renaissance across from this restaurant while visiting from Boston--my only regret is that I wished we had truer it sooner!  Great menu, excellent service, and a ton of dining options for all diet requirements.  I highly recommend this restaurant when in PHX!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great atmosphere. The food is delicious and the Tom Yum is out of this world."}
{"text":"Tom Yum- one of Downtown Phoenix's several Thai restaurants (why are there so many downtown?  I don't know).  The food is always solid (I really like the Massaman curry), the service is really hit or miss. The place is always busy and the waitresses all seem to be working hard, but it just takes way too long for lunch some days.  Like most downtown lunch patrons, I just can't take an hour+ for lunch.  So now that you've read my review, fair warning, food is good but you better budget some extra time."}
{"text":"I wished I had read the reviews before entering this place.   Traveling locally for work and the restaurant is close to the hotel.  Since I love Asian food, why not try this instead of room service? Big mistake.......the service is soooo slow.  They have one waitress working the entire restaurant and likely minimal help in the kitchen (saw 2 through the window).  I saw this table wait 5 mins before they were able to flag her down to get utensils for the 3 people at the table after they got their food. Not only did they waited a long time for food, everyone at the table was too polite to start so they ended up just staring at the food.   Waited 25 mins for my order of pad Thai.  A bit ridiculous.   They had a steady flow of customer during the evening but while i was waiting, a few tables did ask the waitress where their food was as they had been waiting for awhile.

Food was mediocre.   Not amazing but not bad either.   

Menu also had pho option which is Vietnamese.  I like that but didn't try it since it felt odd ordering Vietnamese at a Thai restaurant. 

Would I come back? Only if I call in my order in advance.  There's other options in the area and it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Definitely negative star. Waitress is very rude, food is not even good. When we ask to get our check, she didn't  even bother to ask if it's  seperate or together. I ask her to make it separate and she responded, we all came in group so meaning check is together. She can't  make it separate, i was really upset. She came back and gave us separate check anyway after being so rude. Guess what she charged us a 20% gratuity each even we are only party of 4. I undestand you can charged gratuity for party of 6 or 8 if im not mistaken. LIFEVANTAGE DISTRIBUTORS PLEASE DONT EAT AT THIS. SERVICE IS VERY POOR AND WAITRESS IS VERY RUDE...."}
{"text":"A clean place with great food.  The homemade thai green sauce was exceptional.  We ate the Pho as a twist to the vietnamese version.  It was as we ordered and expected.  I will eat here again.  Staff was engauging and energetic."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was great! Went there for lunch and dinner three days in a row. Green curry was good, the eggplant was amazing!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because we were sick of the food offerings available at comicon, and boy are we glad we did! I ordered the vegetables in peanut sauce, and it was amazing! My mate ordered vegetable delight with tofu and hot and sour soup, we also had the vegetable rolls.... Everything was excellent, and we hope to eat here again before comicon is over! A wonderful respite from the tasteless burgers and fries one usually encounters at such events."}
{"text":"Very good food - love the broccoli and black pepper lunch special.  Pretty good price point for downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great Thai food located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix. We ordered the Pad Woo Sen (she said it was the top 3 best she's ever had), Tom Yum and the Thai Iced Tea. All were great, perfect level of spice at 3 on the Tom Yum. Service was great, very quick and attentive. No problem and we will be back."}
{"text":"Had the Tiger's Cry salad for lunch. Mediocre. Limp lettuce that seemed to have sat out. Swimming in dressing, and a tiny portion for $11. Complimentary cabbage/tofu soup was lukewarm. Left wanting Five Guys across the street. Sad!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in a while. Great food and great service. Had spring rolls, Panang curry, and broccoli noodle. I was pleasantly happy with the quality of food, location, music and service."}
{"text":"When my family comes to town we always look forward to eating the salmon salad. It's really good!!!!!! After ordering i was quite surprised she said it'll take 30min to deliver! I was extremely hungry and was watching he clock. . . and they actually came on time.  I ordered a lot of dishes with tofu and was delighted that they did not mess up the order."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here since this restaurant is only a few blocks away from work so I've tried a few items on their menu. For the most part food is usually good but I find that several dishes share the same sort of taste. Not bad but I'd like to taste some variety in flavors from one thing to the next."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop in here for dinner while staying a couple days at the Renaissance across the street. My husband and the kids had never tried Thai food so giving it a try was a necessity. It was an empty house which had me a bit worried since we usually look for the busiest place when traveling out of town, but I am so glad we stopped. The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive, which made the food that was already great, exceptional. This is definitely a place we will be visiting whenever we are back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tried the Massaman curry- spicy hot, with tofu and brown rice. It was everything I had hoped it would be. However the service, although pleasant, was extremely slow for a Tuesday afternoon. One would hope that ordering the lunch special would allow you a quick meal that lasts less than an hour. From serving waters, taking our orders, bringing us the food and finally even ringing up our checks, every step was painfully slow. Since I actually enjoyed the food, I will give them the benefit of the doubt,  and probably will return. (Not sure if they are a new establishment that just needs to work out the kinks, or were short staffed when I visited, or had an usually large volume from the convention center attendees. ..)"}
{"text":"We were in downtown Phoenix for the Matsuri Japanese festival and walked here for lunch. The three of us had wonderful meals that were brought out quickly, were hot and very tasty! I love Pad Thai, so I always have that and it was excellent here. We'll be going back for sure! :-)"}
{"text":"This was great Thai food! The special homemade garlic sauce was incredible. I had the spicy green beans and I couldn't get enough."}
{"text":"Tom YUM!  This restaurant was near my hotel the Monday after the Superbowl.  I was there at 2:00 pm, an odd hour for lunch.  The restaurant was trashed when I entered with tons of un-bussed tables.  I didn't think much of the restaurant being trashed because the entire downtown was a mess post Superbowl.  

The waitstaff appeared stressed out but they were very polite.  I ordered the lunch Pad Thai with shrimp and it was delicious.  The shrimp were very fresh and plentiful.  The sauce had a very good flavor with a medium spice level as requested.  The lunch came with soup that didn't look like much but was very tasty.  The soup was a spicy broth with a few tofu pieces.  A small spring roll came with the lunch as well.  It wasn't freshly fried but it was hot, so I'll give them a pass.

Less than $11.00 for this yummy lunch, sold!  I will return."}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the 1st time today.  Like most reviewers already pointed out, the service was slow when the place was busy.  I am Asian, so I am already used to terrible services.  Service is not the reason I give them one star.  It is for their fraudulent business practices. They included 20% tip in my bill automatically and sent me a credit card receipt with tip line on it again.  Of course I wrote 0 on the tip line, but when I was leaving, I found other customers put another 20% on the tip line, so effectively they were getting 40% tip for their slow service.  Unless of course they saw me being an Asian, they just figured they had to include tip on my bill.  I have been to many restaurants, and this was only the 2nd time a tip was automatically added to my bill for one person.  Like many reviewers said, this is an average restaurant in a great location.  If you feel you have to come here, please pay attention to your bills otherwise you may be paying 40% for the tip."}
{"text":"Service was good. Nice atmosphere. I loved the pot stickers. I'm still not sure how I feel about the pad Thai, however. It wasn't a bad dish, but its flavor wasn't what I was expecting...I'm Not sure how to describe it. I'd probably eat here again, but I'd try something else...like the soup. I'll check in again if I do make it back this weekend."}
{"text":"Upon arrival I ordered a Thai Iced Tea. Holy cow! This is awesome! Especially if you like orange creamsicles. Also before ordering was give a type of Amuse Bouche of soup- yum! 
Main course is spivey yellow curry, and wow! It is spicy!!!

Meal was very filling and portions were perfect. What would have made this place a full 5 star experience would have been more attentive staff. Perhaps they were overwhelmed by today's customers. 

I will be back still"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, paid cash. Delivery came really quickly, food was delicious! Highly recommend pad Thai with duck, really good stuff."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! The best orange chicken I have ever eaten. All of our dishes were superb!
Excellent service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always delicious food. Be careful with spiciness levels - sometimes medium is more like hot and other times it is just right."}
{"text":"Soggy and poorly seasoned food. Wait staff is slow, looks annoyed, and very unattentive. Save your money and go a block over to the Thai Basil restaurant, so much better."}
{"text":"Hello Followers:  

We ate at Tom Yum last night prior to a Phoenix Symphony show.  I am writing this review based on our first time here and the two dishes we ordered.  

For an appetizer were ordered the summer wraps.  These were the fresh wraps in rice paper with lettuce, carrots, noodles and shrimp.  
First about the wraps:  The filling was adequate with regard to the lettuce and carrots.  Honestly, I did not see any noodles in them.  You get two wraps cut in half, (you are served four 1/2 wraps) each about three inches long.  The shrimp in the wraps was very, very scant.  I felt they used only two shrimp to make both wraps.  They cut the shrimp length-wise twice, so the shrimp flavor was barely there.  A disappointment.  The peanut dipping sauce was nice and thick.  The sweet vinegar dipping sauce had a nice flavor and was also just thick enough to drizzle into the wrap.
Negative about the wraps:  Who every rolled the rice wraps we were served overlapped the rice wrap on each end of the wrap too much.  In other words, there should have been filling all the way to the end with just the bare minimum of the rice wrap overlapping (and this was not the case).  There was so much overlapping rice wrap on the ends we could not chew it!  Therefore, we found ourselves cutting off the end of the wraps knowing it was too tough to chew, resulting in us wasting about one inch of the wrap on each of them.  

Entree we ordered was the shrimp pad thai.  The portion was enough for two people to share.  The shrimp (six in total) were a good size - - - not the small shrimp you sometimes get served in Thai restaurants.  
The meal came out steaming hot, the noodles were cooked properly (not mushy), the scallions were fresh.  
But, there did not appear to be any cooked egg in the dish which is typical of pad thai dishes.  The biggest complaint we have is that the dish had an overtone of \"fishy\" flavor.  Not shrimp fishy flavor, but \"fish\" fishy flavor which should not have been. 
I don't know if when the cook made the dish they added fish sauce and obviously too much of it OR if ingredients such as the fresh scallions were cut on a board where fresh fish had been and the board had not been wiped down, hence the fishy flavor wound up in our entree. 
The fishy taste was not subtle, but rather in every bite you could taste it.  A disappointment to say the least.  
If we would have had more time we would have sent it back for a new dish, but we could not be late for the Symphony which was several blocks away from the restaurant.  
Also, usually there are peanuts on top of the completed pad thai dish, and at Tom Yum's it was not served this way.

The Thai iced tea was a nice size and had good portions of tea and milk, etcetera.  On a hot night it was a treat.

Therefore, due to the chewy wraps with little shrimp in them, and due to the fishy-tasting shrimp pad thai, I am only giving Tom Yum two stars."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special with Phad Thai noodles. Meh, not great. Meat was tough and the noodles were stuck together with glue or something. Slow service from the kitchen during lunch hours and the price wasn't worth the quality. Keep walking."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for some pho! Went there and was really disappointed. The broth was not very tasty. It was really bland. They also didn't bring out the condiments like lime, chili peppers, etc which was a big reason why the soup was not as appetizing as i wished it was. If you're in the mood for pho don't go to this place."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here.  Food was decent.  Waitresses were pleasant.  But the guy who brought the food and gave the bill was rude. I think he is the owner or one in charge.  Charged us for the wrong amount (of course more).  When he was informed be looked unhappy.  He took the bill and brought it back and told us that he had given us the 'discount', to reflect the correct amount in a rude way.  When we were paying the bill, the person implicitly told me that tip has not been included.  Really?  Suffice to say, we will NOT be going back to that restaurant.  Terrible manners."}
{"text":"My boss Dean thinks this place is terrible, but I love it. We are currently waiting for our check, and I'm listening to him read bad reviews of this place, so in order to end this negativity, I am posting this review for him to read."}
{"text":"When ordering a curry I ask which dish is the least sweet and I was recommended green curry! It turns out to be the sweetest curry dish I have had in Phoenix area. I complain to my waitress. She was nicely apologizing about that but she says the sweet is for American people. She said may be next time I should order some other dish I told her next time I will not be coming back and will opt for a more authentic Thai restaurant! She didn't offer to re cook the dish to make it right! Also it's a 12 dollars curry dish, if I want some Americanized Thai food I won't be paying that much!"}
{"text":"Nice little place downtown. The service was quick and the prices (lunch) very reasonable. I ordered drunken noodles with chicken. The food is quite tasty. I was asked how spicy I wanted it (on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the hottest) and I asked the server how hot was 5? She told me it was very hot. So I ordered 4 (liking spicy food) and it really wasn't very hot at all. Just a few added red pepper flakes. Had a little spice but definitely not a 4. I would go back and ask for extra 5. LOL"}
{"text":"Went there late on Saturday ... spring rolls are very good and totally fresh.  However, they need to work on logistics ... bringing me my spring rolls well before my wife got any of her food wasn't very swift, nor was forgetting the edamame after we reminded our waiter twice.  Still, the food is good, and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the summer rolls and pat Thai. The summer rolls sauces came with two options: peanut and and sweet sauce. The sweet sauce was basically ALL sugar, wow! The peanut sauce was basically just like dipping into a jar of peanuts. Summer roll peanut sauce should be a peanut sauce base not just peanut butter."}
{"text":"Besides the jack-hammer right outside their front door, this place was great. I had the sweet and sour with vegan chicken and it was great. The sweet and sour sauce was fantastic, the veggies were fresh and tasty and the vegan chicken was really good. Plus fountain soda- for some reason it just tastes better then the can.

My spouse had the Pad Thai and it was probably the best I've had before, there was a lot of sauce and the noodles were perfect.

Really friendly service and it looked like a full dessert menu, although we were too full and already had to-go boxes.

Highly recommend, cannot think of one thing I'd change. 5"}
{"text":"Good food, solid choice for curry downtown."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was pretty slow. Their Thai iced tea was quite good. Their definition of spicy is definitely american, not Thai (ie,not spicy). Overall not a bad meal but be prepared to wait, especially if they're busy."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Refreshing Thai tea. As part of their hot sauces they had a \"Thai salsa\" that was amazing!! The owner even gave us some to go!!  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Phoenix, I had the beef stew noodle soup and tofu pad Thai. They were both delicious and portions were big! the service there was pretty friendly as well. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Had the red curry chicken and tofu soup. If you are in downtown Phoenix this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"After circling the immediate area for somewhere to eat for what seemed to be hours, we settled on Tom Yum because it was decently packed which could have meant decent food but there were a couple tables open.

Mind you this was just earlier, the eve of Superbowl and the town has been in utter chaos with the 1 million Superbowl visitors that have come into the area. 

It seemed one server was obviously frantic and trying to service a lot of the tables while the other 3 just coasted around with no sense of urgency. 

Our orders were taken and you could tell the fellow was flustered but doing his best. The menu didn't include a few items that we had been accustomed to seeing on Thai menus. We settled on chicken fried rice, beef pad see ewe and a bowl of tom kah--we did have to make small modifications to our entrees. 

What we noticed however is that the tables weren't being served in any real order. And it was our server who appeared to be responsible for most of the tables while the others kind of floated about. 

Many tables waited for very unreasonably long periods of time.. so long that a few had gotten up to leave. 

We waited. And waited. And waited. An hour plus and still no food.  We asked about our order to one of the floating girls and she said she would check on it. Another 15 minutes drifted and she came back with chicken pad see wew. \"Sorry we ran out of beef so we made you chicken instead is that OK\" well no it isn't okay. First off we should have been given the option, secondly it should have been decades ago when they knew there was no beef available. She said I'm sorry there's nothing I can do the kitchen ran out of beef. 

Again we should have been notified of our options well in advance rather than them shoving us a plate of chicken..

I'm so disenchanted by our experience that I am still in shock."}
{"text":"Because the place we had originally planned to go to for Friday night dinner was closed at that time, we found this restaurant after walking around a bit in the downtown area and it's a good thing we did. It was not busy at that time so we were seated immediately and after ordering, we did not have to wait long for our food to arrive. The food was good and reasonably priced, considering the downtown location. Service was friendly and the restaurant itself had a pleasant quiet atmosphere and a tasteful, subdued Asian theme. Finding a nearby place to is the only problem I could find for this restaurant, but that is the case for nearly every establishment in this downtown area."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch while n town. Casual little joint w attentive service and reasonable prices. Glad I gave it a try. I am spoiled w amazing Thai in my hometown, so was pleasantly surprised w their namesake soup. They have a seafood option that many do not, and they asked me my preferred level of heat...which I normally have to negotiate at some more old school venues. The potstickers were okay, nice presentation. I would have liked them a little more crispy and they really need better chopsticks. Their menu is expansive and even has Pho, which by rule I only try at authentic Vietnamese joints...once burned, twice shy ya know. I walked from hotel so I have no idea how the parking situation is."}
{"text":"This place is good enough for your after clubbing hangover hunger, no frills no thrills place, grab a seat order chow down and you will be good, had the fried noodles which is ok but a little dash of soy sauce it's good enough."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I had panang curry, summer rolls, and Thai iced yea. Delicious! I'm in town for work but I'd come back if I lived here."}
{"text":"I recommend garlic and blackpepper chicken. The three fish flavors also not bad. The shrimp royal deep fried is good. I didnt however like the house fried rice. It's a nicer and cleaner asian restaurant plus its cool to see the train pass by."}
{"text":"No. Just. Plain. No.
I had a class downtown that started early, so the lunch break was earlier than most places opened. The sign on the door at Tom Yum claims they open at 10. To me, that means prep work has been done, and the kitchen is ready to take orders by 10. Maybe 10:10, on a bad day. I walked in at 10:20. The young lady behind the counter seemed put off to have me there, and said they weren't able to do everything on the menu, as they just opened. My order was simple. An order of chicken satay, and a bowl of tom ka gai. She took the order, took my money (which I stupidly left a decent tip on), THEN told me it would be 45 minutes to an hour for my to-go order to be ready. I was incredulous. This is downtown Phoenix. Most of the people who would be here for lunch get a total of 30 minutes, *maybe* an hour for lunch...no one can wait 45 minutes to an hour before getting the food!
I asked her to refund my card - I would find somewhere else to eat. She didn't know how to do that. I asked her to call over the manager. There was none. Just her, and two men in the kitchen who also claimed to not know what to do. I asked her to call the owner. She went to the kitchen, and when she came back, told me my food would be ready within 10 minutes. WHAT? Somehow, my demanding my card be refunded enabled my food to cook in a fraction of the time? I should remember this magical trick everyplace I go that expects me to wait longer than I deem reasonable!
Anyway - I get my food and take it back to the classroom to eat. The chicken satay was painfully dry and bland. No amount of peanut sauce, hot sauce and cucumber could fix it. After two bites, I threw away the remainder. The soup was okay. If someone else bought it and brought it to me, I would be more than willing to eat the soup again. Short of that happening - the next time I will be in this spot is when it's the new restaurant in this space, after Tom Yum is out of business."}
{"text":"Great food! A little pricey but worth it! The waitress was really nice and I got the orange chicken and it tasted fresh and the spring rolls were absolutely amazing! The sauce really made it!"}
{"text":"There is a reason that the place is empty. Had duck curry mostly chewy fatty duck skin.  It was awful.  After tax it was almost $18.00. Go ahead and skip this place.  This was recommended by the wait staff as best dish on menu.   Blah"}
{"text":"We just ordered take out, but it was tasty and efficient. We ordered, walked over to cvs, and then came back and it was ready. Lunch prices are great, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time at Tom Yum.  Arrived at 1 PM on a Sunday and the place was empty. All of downtown was empty for Labor Day weekend. 

The menus here are put together more like a cheap, fast food place rather than finer dining. It wasn't visually friendly and took us a while to navigate. 

Our daughter got Yellow Curry with Tofu. She's not vegetarian but likes tofu. My wife got Beef Pad Thai while I ordered Royal Shrimp Supreme. 

The shrimp was kinda weird. It came in a rich tamarind sauce but aside from some steamed broccoli and carrots, it was just shrimp. The Pad Thai was also in a strange sauce. Not horrible but not great. 

The whole bill (water for drinks) came to $42 plus tip. Too high for the meal. Probably won't go back since there are so many good Thai restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I ordered chow mien noodles for dinner and was pretty satisfied with my meal. It was a ton of food so I had leftovers for lunch the next day and enough for an after work snack too. For the price I paid it was a great amount of food and good flavor. They brought our food out to us within 10 minutes of walking into the restaurant, which is very important to me when I'm hungry. 
Overall, it was a yummy meal close to where I live at a good price."}
{"text":"The Fish Two Oceans is wonderful - two large perfectly cooked fillets, one steamed and the other fried (but not a bit greasy) with two sauces on the side.  For spicy dishes, you can choose mild, medium, hot, Thai hot, or Thai super hot!"}
{"text":"Tom Yum soup was aweful...so bad that had to send it back. Their broccoli delight was sub par at best. Can't remember last time having such poor quality food."}
{"text":"Good selection, you can chose whatever type of dish you want and which protein.  Good food! Service was decent. Although they did not split our check, or ask us, and handed it all to the only male coworker there with us which was strange and we ended up just having to all put our cards down together"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for lunch today. Service was good and quick. I got Chicken Pad Thai and he got Drunken Noodles with Chicken. It was a lunch special price so that was about $2 off and you got soup (dine-in only) and an egg roll with the entree. We both loved everything. The flavor was great, the spice was good (I could have had spicier but no complaints) and the portions were huge. Good last minute choice to come here and will hopefully be back whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to this place they weren't very welcoming the 2nd and 3rd time was better. The food is amazing I ordered the broccoli drunk in noodle w/ salmon. It was so awesome and the veggie noodle pot is great too."}
{"text":"I ordered the Orange chicken and soup.  The soup was just good - I wanted a little more punch (either a bit more sour or a bit more heat or both).  It was definitely made in house which was good.  The chicken was very good.  I had it delivered and they delivered the chicken, rice and sauce in separate containers.  His kept the chicken from getting soggy which was a great way to get takeout.  Flavor was good and the portion very generous."}
{"text":"Clean place, I ordered their wontons and Coconot milk seafood soup. This placw was one of the best Thai foods I have tried.  Very ncie crew. 
Just remember their soups dont come with rice so try to order a large size. If not you will walk over to your hotel room hangry lol"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. Chicken pad Thai and bowl of shrimp tomyum. Although huge serving, pad Thai was bland. Lacks flavor and dry to my liking. Shrimp tom yum however was delicious !"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it was delicious. I got the shrimp pad thai and it was quite filling. I got mild spicy and it was a good level of spice for me. I especially loved their iced thai tea! We also got the golden rings and crab ragoon. They were pretty decent; although, the crab ragoon was a bit too cream cheesey to my tastes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place after Comic Con. The place is fairly small and had about 15 other patrons inside. Our drinks, appetizer and food came out pretty quickly and so did the check. 

After we finished our food, we'd planned on eating dessert. Unfortunately I counted the time it took for our waitress to come back over and check on us. It was OVER 30 minutes! So why didn't we just leave? Well my boyfriend had a very Ghandi like approach to things so he says to me we're not in a hurry. So I grin and bear it because crazy girlfriends are not in style ever.

Finally, a lady who looks like the manager comes by and asks if we're okay and my boyfriend tells her we wanted to order dessert. So our original waitress gets a menu off of the next table and hands it to my boyfriend. When we were ready to order dessert, she was M.I.A again. 

I know people exaggerate about time spent and I admit to the judge and jury I have no patience BUT we actually waited 30 minutes. So here we are waiting for our dessert. 

Anyhow we only tried a hot pot soup which was alright and some potstickers which were delicious. So the food I would say is pretty good, but the service Geezus! Again Um still waiting on a damn dessert and this place is zombie dead! The food is way over priced and to top it off with the service I won't be back."}
{"text":"So good. The portion was great and the taste was awesome. We had about 4 dishes which includes tom yum soup, 2 meet dish and the pad thai (i know super basic). Everything was delicious and the waiter are supper friendly."}
{"text":"I just left Thai Basil after throwing away $17 on a disgusting meal. I didn't eat but maybe 2 bites!!! I ate here at Tom Yum yesterday for lunch and it was amazing!!! I am here again to get some really good Thai! If you are in downtown Phoenix this is the place to go. I will say the service is a little slow, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not really sure if I would eat here again. Service was good but the food is questionable. The pad Thai I ordered was blah....I've had really tasty pad Thai but Tom Yum did not impress me.  They will ask how spicy you want your dish and I asked for mild. Instead my dish was so spicy it was difficult to enjoy. If you do not like spicy, please request your dish with little or none. I did enjoy the sticky rice and mango dessert, but this would not make me return to this restaurant for another meal."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a co-worker for a quick lunch outing.  First experience was pretty good.  Only disappointment was the lunch soup that is served was cold, not making any excuses, but we did arrive late (1pm), but still should have been hot.

Thought I would give it another shot with a second visit, this was a little bit better.  Food was good and hot, but my order was delayed a bit.  For a few minutes I felt like I was being ignored until 2 of the staff noticed I wasn't eating, and that's when they promptly checked on my order.

Despite these small things, I think I may be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Not spicy, very greasy, overpriced. Also, they do not answer their phone. I tried to call them several times and never got through. I ordered pad Thai with chicken at a 3/5. It was more like a 0 or 1,  I kick whatsoever. So once that disappointment passed, the fact that the noodles were really greasy got to me. I don't think it was sauce, if it was, then their sauce is gross for their pad Thai."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I ordered carry out through the yelp app, it said 45-60 min and dude showed up at my door in like 15. Satay was fantastic, wrapped in foil inside the box still too hot to eat! Got the pad se ew as a main course and it was dine-in quality, steaming hot and delicious. Whole meal with delivery charge and tip was $25."}
{"text":"Tomyum soup delicious as were the summer rolls ! 
Very good svc also - convenient to downtown hotels and very fast to get food  out !"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch, there was really no one there. Service was fast, food was fast, yellow curry was so good. A little pricey for a lunch special, at about $25 for 2 meals and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"I am on a business trip and have tasted for Thai food. I called them up and ordered appetizer platter and duck in red curry sauce. It was very delicious for a tired and weary soul  that needed nourishment. They said food will be in 30 minutes but it arrived sooner than expected. Delivery guy was friendly and courteous. Will order again from them when I come back here."}
{"text":"I will visit again!  

This place has a lot of tasty options. 

I had the vegetables that included bamboo shoots and carrots. They were tasty and spicy along with the Jasmine rice.  

The service was efficient and friendly. 

The location is in walking distance for me.  There are metered parking spots nearby."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Pad Thai is bland and greasy.  Go to the Vegan House next door instead. They're faster, nicer, friendlier & have better quality food."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix!  Had the opportunity to dine at Tom Yum and had an excellent meal.  I'm a frequent traveler to Thailand so my standard is very high.  The Som Tum is aroi mak mak!  This restaurant is under new ownership as of April 2017 so if you haven't been here since it's definitely worth it!  I had a great conversation with the owner and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pad Thai. I have only ever ordered take out, but my order is always ready when I'm told and the waitstaff is super friendly when I go to pick up my order."}
{"text":"Average Thai restaurant at a great location - the key reason these guy are still in business. 

I have been to this place couple of time , primarily because it's close to my work. I like their Hawaiian fried rice and Panang curry. I never liked their noodles though. 

The reason for low rating is primarily due to their management and service. Service is horrible and most of time you would find two waitress for 25 tables. If you would like a soda refill, better ask for it while 2/3 full. :)

Also, if you are with kids, try and skip this place. There is no kids menu. Overall a decent place to eat , but I would avoid it next time because of my continued bad experience  with the service."}
{"text":"I just ordered fried rice with shrimp that was  over cooked  and the shrimp smelled. and tasted like  fish .   The only good thing was my Thai ice tea. I almost forgot the delivery guy first words were \" no tip was included \". REALLY!!"}
{"text":"Venturing out with Norm R in attempt to get in some pre-expiration Groupon dining at one of my downtown favorites, but finding it closed up tight by 7:30 on a Friday night we had to venture elsewhere and were fortunate to stumble into the former wonderfully named \"All Thai'd Up\", now \"Tom Yum\" (I don't know if different owners), and found it a comfortable place worth returning to and look forward to doing so. 
 I had the Tom Yum Hot & Sour made mild, with chicken and myriad other vegetables, and spices. On first glance I feared it would not prove a sufficiently meal to satisfy my then ravenous hunger, but it proved the perfect portion to comfortably fill without excess, though I could have eagerly savored an extra pint or liter of the well-flavored, perfectly balance blend of flavors in that delightful broth.  Add Tom Yum to your list of downtown dining destinations. I think you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for lunch time Thai food in downtown phoenix.  I had the Green Curry with Salmon and it was fresh, well-seasoned and moderately priced.  The portions are a good size for the money.  Our lunch group goes once or twice a month and we are always extremely pleased.  Good job, Tom Yum!"}
{"text":"My s/o locked me out of the house today, so to make up for it, he let me buy him dinner! We got take out so we could come home and eat while watching Frasier, and the food was ready for pickup right when they said it would be. Parking downtown is always a hassle, but we found a good set of spots a short walk away at Washington and Central that seem to usually have a space or two (but shhh don't tell!) 

My s/o ordered the medium yellow curry with bbq pork--it had nice spices, but wasn't spicy at ALL and didn't have much stuff in it, though it did come with more than enough rice. I got the clay pot shrimp--LOTS of shrimp which was awesome, and the glass noodles were well flavored. Could've been a little more saucy, but the ginger was on point! The Thai beef salad was nothing special, but still yummy. Not the best Thai in town (that honor remains with chanpen Thai), but hits the spot."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. Pad sew was pretty meh. My friend's pad thai was overly sweet and was clearly using a ketchup base. The pad kee mao was decent but nothing impressive. Service got the job done. Personally, I'd head over to Thai Basil instead."}
{"text":"Slow service. No water is provided. The food is flavorless. I ordered drunken noodles. I couldn't find one piece of complete noodle.  How can they present  a dish like this? Donn't come here!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I walked out of restaurant. Oh yeah...that was ten minutes ago.  The service was terrible!  I waited over 15 minutes while others were seated and orders taken. I waited 10 minutes too long. I sacrificed service for convenience because it was right across the hotel. Never again. I'll walk a few extra minutes to Thai Basil which by the way has already taken my order and served my first dish."}
{"text":"Incredibly nice host. The ambient is relaxing (soothing music) and outside is the busy streets of downtown Phoenix. The space is very clean and well decorated in relation to the type of food that is served. When craving Thai food, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Been around the several states trying Thai food, including San Fran. This place has the most flavorful green curry I've ever had. Spicy bamboo is very good as well. Thai tea is great of course. Indoor atmosphere is calming and relaxing service is good and friendly. Best Thai in phoenix."}
{"text":"I was in town for work meetings and decided to try this place on my lunch. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and a small vegetarian Tom yum soup. The food was greasy and they added to much eggs on to the fried rice. The smell of the egg and grease was way too much. The Tom yum soup was watered down and the flavors were missing. The waitress checked on me few times. I didn't even eat half of my food, way to greasy. The manager came and ask if I was done, I replied with yes. She noticed I didn't finish near half the food, and asked if it tasted good. I said yes didn't want to offend anyone, but I should have addressed to her what the problem was. I decided to write this review, because shortly after my stomach hated me. I almost forgot to mention the shrimp tasted dirty, and I could even eat more than 2. Very disappointing experience!!"}
{"text":"I eat at Tom Yum at least once a week. I do it because of the food. Sure, their service can be bad and slow. It's normally when they are very crowded or understaffed. It's rare to come in here at 12noon and get a table. Most of the time, the seats are filled. Really, the slow service does not bother me. They are always nice, I've never seen them be rude. They may take your order fast and move on in, but that's during the lunch rush. 

Anyway, back to the food. Their soup they give you as a starter (it's free) is delicious. I always gobble it up. I love the following: Tom Yum soup, broccoli noodle, pad thai, yellow curry, massaman curry, thai fried rice, and sweet potato appetizer. The broccoli and eggplant dishes are also great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Tasty veggie rolls and a solid spicy eggplant. Not very busy mid afternoon on a Thursday. I'm guessing it gets more busy later. Takeout would be a great option but the decor is very pleasant. 
They have green iced tea to go along with a large menu of Thai selections."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Food was good, a little expensive ($16) for lunch, but service was terrible. Waitress rolled her eyes cause my friend asked for explanation on a particular plate, never came to refill our drinks and worst of all, added her own tip of $5 to our bill!  Wow..."}
{"text":"This is the downtown location of Tom Yum.  I am used to going to the Surprise location.  Decided to give it a try since The Wild Thaiger is not very good at all to me. Started off with the soup from the lunch special.  Thumbs down on it.  I do not like the tomato based stuff.  I really like the clear clean broth that they serve at the Surprise location. Was told by the waitress the owner prefers that this location serves this type of soup. Um no bueno. Other than that the Pad Thai Chicken was pretty good. The presentation is a little different.  The bean sprouts were in the noodle.  There was not much of the green onion or the peanut.  And the Spice was not spicy enough but thats ok I always like extra on side because you never know what is spicy to the cook. Same egg rolls.  Service is good.  Just miss our regular girls from other location.  I will get used I guess.  I will come back.  I did enjoy my lunch here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Don't have well trained staff. They didn't give us any menu to look at when the hostess/waitress sat us down. We didn't get our water for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles with shrimp hit the spot. Super fresh and tasty. Love, love, loved the fresh basil!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for quick dinner pick-up and had a major issue with our grubhub app order. Wouldn't recommend using the app. As for the restaurant--large portions and tasty food. If you are gluten free--they are not able to confirm that the pad thai is a safe option, so I stuck with the curries."}
{"text":"We're from out of town visiting for the weekend. Decided to walk around and see what there was for food. We wanted something other than \"traditional American\". So we found Thai. The people here were really nice. Got our food out quickly. And it was a great price. The lady even offered us the lunch since it was cheaper. What great service!

Only dislike I had was when we walked in we asked the guy if there was room for us. (We had just flown in from California, haven't eaten anything and were starving) and he said it would be just a couple minutes. In my eyes a couple means 2-3. Nope. It took almost 15 minutes. But I guess that's not really their fault. We did come at lunch and there were 6 of us. But just be honest about the wait time is all I ask"}
{"text":"I was just placed on hold for 10 minutes to place a delivery order. When i called back and finally got through i was told that a dellivery order would rake an hour. I said that would be fine but then it followed with she did not have time to take my order at this time and hung up on me. Now I love Thai food as much as the next but I would recommend this place work on their customer service as I have never experienced anything like this. Dont bother if the customer service is like this.m"}
{"text":"Delicious soup and Pad Thai. Great experience and fast service. My Pad Thai lunch special came with soup and a spring roll for $8.69."}
{"text":"We are Diamondback Season ticket holders and always struggle to find a good place for lunch or dinner close to the ballpark.  We happened to pass this restaurant on the way to another restaurant and decided to give it a try.  Boy am I glad we did!  Excellent Thai restaurant.  Service is fast and the staff is very friendly.  The food is perfectly prepared and they get the spice level exactly right.  Prices are reasonable.  Thrilled to have found this gem -"}
{"text":"I had lunch here this afternoon. Food was good. Service was nice and fast and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I refrained from going to Tom Yum for so long because I love yelp and this place didn't have great reviews and to be honest, I'm kind of sad I didn't come to this place sooner! I had the veggie tom yum pho and my husband had the Pad Thai with chicken and both were delicious. And the woman who waited on us couldn't have been nicer!"}
{"text":"For as many Thai restaurants in downtown Phoenix you'd think they'd be nicer to their customers.  But no!!!!!   Rude, rude, rude.  Repeatedly treated like I'm bothering them and they are too busy.  And don't even try to phone in an order--they will make you hold forever. 

Even if the food were better I'm done doing business with them as a regular downtown luncher.  If I want Thai, I'll try their competition."}
{"text":"Great pad thai! Thai tea was one of the best I've had! Service is really fast. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and easy for take out! Always friendly and the food is great! Use to eat at their location in Surprise all the time and was excited to find that they had a location in the city."}
{"text":"Tired of the sports bars and pricey places in the vicinity of Symphony Hall? This place is for you. An extensive colorful menu with plenty of photographs and descriptions did not make my decision easy, so I decided to go with the restaurant's namesake Tom Yum soup and ordered the Mixed Seafood version with medium heat. Fragrant with lemon grass and spices, it was a pleasure to bend over the bowl with each spoonful, esp. since it was a rare chilly day in Phoenix. Each spoonful pulled out some sea treasure like a piece of chunky and flakey white fish, an oyster, a shrimp, etc. However, I was hoping for the flames in the center of a ring shaped bowl that I've had at other Thai restaurants, but here they only offer that for the larger size, so that was disappointing. My friend's orange chicken at 11.00 with no vegetables seemed pricey, but the light batter was especially crisp without being heavily coated--maybe they use some cornstarch or rice flour instead of just regular flour--don't know, but we didn't leave a crumb. Only one small cup of rice with meal--was it for the chicken dish or the soup? Not sure, but think one a piece would have been appropriate. Friend had the Singha Thai bottled beer for $4.75 bec. was told it was a darker beer than the other choices, but it wasn't--was super light so obviously the server hadn't a clue about giving beer advice, so they should print descriptions. Very plain interior, more like a diner, no music, on the way in we had to walk by 3 homeless people on two street corners, one stretched out on the pavement. While we were dining, one of them came in and was chattering to himself and started talking to another couple. We were asked by the manager (?) if we wanted to be relocated, but we were into our meal at that point...."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday night, and had a good meal. The restaurant was fairly empty, so we had great service. We had the chow mein, panang curry and wonton soup. All items were really good and fresh. Only reason for four stars instead of five is we had to ask a few times for some time, like sugar, but very minor. Definitely worth a drop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Waited over half an hour for my food after my lunch companion had hers and food had still not come.  Tried to ask waitress about it and she said \"I only take orders\".  Went to counter and said I needed dish to go as I needed to get back to work.  Finally got my \"green curry chicken\" which was missing several of the ingredients promised on the menu, including the reason I ordered it-the eggplant!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, when your hungry and come.across a dish like orange chicken with fried rice and brocolli oh and dont forget the spring rolls, when you bite into the flavors of each one combine with ranch soy sauce and lemon juice, your left with the most amazingly satisfaction taste!! everrrrrrr!!!!!! Wow... okay wow serving size was still awesome."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from my appointment, and I decided to forego eating a frozen dinner at home.
I walked in and was greeted by the waitress who took my order, and I will admit that I made the mistake of NOT telling her that it was for takeout, but in all honesty, she didn't seem too friendly, but I simply overlooked that.

I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken, which was $14 dollars and a soft drink. The food was VERY greasy and just seemed to be lackluster in all honesty, and the chicken tasted a bit gummy.
I really don't see myself in any hurry to rush back to spend again $18 dollar's on so-so food. (I tipped 30%, which is why the total is $18) . 

No hard feelings guys."}
{"text":"Soup is great as is the yellow chicken curry. Not sure why someone complained about water - maybe confused with another restaurant. We got plenty of water!"}
{"text":"Not Vegetarian or Vegan friendly. 

I'm basing this review on 3 bad experiences I had out of about 6 times I've  eaten there/take out.
 First of all I want to mention that I always check the ingredients in the menu and ask questions. I also let them know I'm vegan. I liked this restaurant because they have vegan options, unfortunately the waiters or the kitchen doesn't make an effort to ensure their vegan options are served that way.

 The first time I took out food I ordered the drunken noodles. Somehow they threw an egg in there. No big deal I just took it back and they made another one.

The second time they messed up,  I ate there. I let them know I was vegan and my friend was vegetarian. I ordered the wonton soup which the menu lists as \"Scallions, sprout, broccoli, carrot, snow pea in a clear broth\". It doesn't say the wontons have chicken in them. The waitress didn't mention this either as I was ordering. I bit into chicken. I was upset, they made something else for me.

The third time I went there they had tofu soup as an appetizer. I asked the waitress if it was vegan, she said yes. I stir it around and it had egg. I ordered pho with vegetables. I told her, I don't eat meat, to make things clear because she wasn't understanding. I was almost finished with my pho when I noticed shredded chicken on the bottom of the plate. I asked to speak to the manager who wasn't there. The girl on charge told me, \"Its ok, its ok I won't charge\". She also said that next time I order I should tell the waitress to tell the kitchen not to use the same spoon they use for the chicken to serve the pho broth.  

First of all its not about the money, its about not caring about your customers dietary restrictions. If I order vegetable soup, that's what I expect. Not chicken pieces, not beef pieces, not anything else but what I order. Also I shouldn't have to tell the waitress how to do their job. If you have vegetarian options it's the restaurants job to ensure they are served that way. Using the same spoon to serve broth is cross contamination. I will not come back"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I love the chicken pad Thai. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Interesting mix of Thai and other Asian foods. This is the first Thai restaurant I have been to that serves sweet and sour chicken! Menu is good with a good selection of soup, noodle dishes, wok dishes, and rice dishes.

I got the Pad Thai with shrimp. Asked for medium spiciness, and it was completely without spice. I asked them to bring me the sweet chili sauce, which made a big difference. Even with that, it was not spicy enough. Maybe they spice it for Americans who don't like Thai food. I food was pretty good. There was something sticky on the noodles that I'm not used to, but it was okay. Pretty good amount of shrimp too.

Small beer selection, but adequate. Prices are okay. You pick how you want the food prepared (wok , Over rice, or noodles) and then the price is based on the type of meat. $10 for chicken, Pork, etc., Up to $15 for more expensive meat.

Service was excellent. Very friendly staff. Food was prepared very quickly.

Would have given higher marks, but the food really was not great."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Husband had the fish dish and I had the pho.  So good, so spicy.  Fast friendly service.  Reasonably priced.  Walking distance from court house.  Excellent."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Phx from New York. We stumbled upon the Tom Yum on our way back from the convention. I ordered the coconut soup and  my friend had the chicken fried rice and chicken satay. We both thought that the service was great and fast, the food was  delicious . I recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It has a great atmosphere right downtown, Amazing food and awesome pricing!"}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with my experience here. The wait time was short, the service was good, & the food was amazing. The soup did not look appetizing but it was flavorful. I had the drunken noodle with chicken & I loved it. The pad Thai looked really good too. The dumplings were also delicious. I would definitely go here again. The staff was also very friendly & funny."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Friendly service!  They were short handed and the owner apologized for the delay. Definitely worth it. Tom Yum soup Thai hot was amazing. Summer rolls are BIG!  Calamari, delicious!"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF ORDERING TAKE OUT THROUGH YELP WITH THIS RESTAURANT.

I am from California and was on a business trip to Downtown Phoenix and my group was hungry and craving Asian food and this was the nearest Asian restaurant to our hotel. We ordered for pick up/take out from Yelp and it took my credit card information. I thought this would just be for order and pick up confirmation but when I went to pick up my food, they asked for my credit card again. I did not notice the double charge until I arrived home, back in California. 

I called in asking to speak to the manager and the woman that I spoke with said that she was unsure if her manager would come in that day so I left my number with them and it's been three days with no call back. 

Also my previous experience: when I was there, the cashier who rang me up also said, \"will they be letting you out for a lunch break tomorrow? Because tomorrow I am off and when it gets busy, they call me and i don't like that.\" 
Well, thanks for your awesome, positive attitude! 

I refuse to give service to this restaurant and will be warning anyone I know who will be staying in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Across the street from our hotel and they were open after 8pm on a Sunday night, ordered a couple of dishes to go, Fried Rice, Chow Mein and Orange chicken were good, nothing really standout special, price for 4 people was about $60.00 so it was not a cheap meal but it was ok and kept up from going hungry overnight."}
{"text":"Good food, quick delivery, but was a little pricey for what it was.  I would likely not order again."}
{"text":"Think this place has undergone a few name changes over the years and this last incarnation is the best. Service is still really slow, but polite and portion size is great. Most Americans are used to being doted on whilst eating out and I'm relieved to not have someone asking how I'm doing every 30 seconds. Chicken Pad Thai was great and will definitely be going there again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'd love to give a rating based on food quality, but after being seated, my family and I waited for over 10 minutes without service.  This was at the end of lunch, and the restruant was less than half-full.  Too bad.  We left without acknowledgement from the wait staff."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go quick and delicious food! It's not that expensive and have quality food, the staff was very nice, I would recommend there Thai tea!"}
{"text":"I regretfully downgrade the rating back to a 2 star again. Apparently service drops drastically when the business is busy. I'm so disappointed I'm not even going to bother writing a review."}
{"text":"Service really good, but food was way too salty to eat. The waitress was super nice and quick to replace.  Overall a quick place to eat."}
