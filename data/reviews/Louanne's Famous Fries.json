{"text":"Can't say anything wrong about this place. I'm not a poutine person probably only reason it's not 5star lol because it wasn't bad at all! I shared a MINI with my 2 sons (yeah they're THAT big! Lol) I will Def go back 1-2x atleast to give it a proper review ;) plus I just moved nearby #Acton next I will try a poutine (my wife is a poutine lover, and a peameal sandwich for sure) staff so friendly, trailer super cute yes I agree it's a win/win I been stalking it online for 3mths since I moved here lol driving by everytime like \"I'm gon get you soon\" lol glad I did will come again and bring friends."}
{"text":"We ordered fries and poutine, and my wife couldn't eat the fries because they were too salty.  I am happy with their response and will eat there again."}
{"text":"Had these yummy fries for the first time this weekend! Was missing Newfoundland and the fries dressing and gravy was so good it was a quick fix.  Very friendly ladies working there.  Cute little spot."}
{"text":"Portions are huge and tasty. No lo-cal stuff so come hungry. Peameal sandwich is amazing. Very friendly servers."}
{"text":"My parents are always raving about this place so decided to try it out. I wasn't disappointment. The nice young girl working was so friendly and personable. My husband had steak on a bun and the large poutine. My daughter and I split peameal bacon on a bun. The bacon was cooked perfectly. Only wish I had asked for the bun to be toasted. Something I prefer with bacon sandwiches. I had a few of the fries. They were good. A little brown but not over cooked. I think changing the oil in the dryer more often would remedy this. Gravy was very tasty. Used shredded cheese instead of curds for poutine but still yummy. My husband has a huge appetite but couldn't finish his poutine which is a first. The large fries are that big!! Overall pretty good. Total bill was $25. We ate on the run however there were some cute pink picnic tables we could have sat at."}
{"text":"Cute little random pink trailer on the side of the road. Totally worth it.
We shared a medium poutine--I cannot fathom how big a large would be. I think I'm going to remember this Poutine for a long, long time. It was that good. Oh yeah, and cash only."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, Amazing fries and poutine done right.  The gravy is second to none, best chips around. Melissa the co-owner is amazing and very friendly. You definitely gotta try this place out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good prices, big portions, fantastic service! A hidden gem that you've gotta check out!"}
{"text":"My favourite poutine place ever! I don't think anything I could type here would do this place justice! The food is amazing, the owner/cook is amazing! I normally get their regular poutine and my boyfriend gets the Newfie poutine with meat and stuffing (strange combination in my opinion lol) he said it's amazing! We did make the mistake of ordering a large size once and we were so full afterwards I could hardly move! I'm patiently waiting to go back as they are only open during summer months but you gotta eat here!"}
