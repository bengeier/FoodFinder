{"text":"We have been going to Phoenix for sometime now, but only recently learned of Joes Farm Grill. We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Good food and the manager there rocks. She walked around and made it a point to talk to everyone. The building however can get a little crowded but it's a hotspot for Gilbert so it's to be expected. Overall it's a cute place to take the family!"}
{"text":"I don't have anything negative to say about Joe's Farm Grill, they offer plenty of healthy choices, the food is not greasy and I LOVE their sweet potato fries. My first time there I wasn't sure whether I was in a restaurant or fast food joint, then I was surprised to find out you can enjoy nature by having your meal outside where there are plenty of seats, shaded trees and chirping birds. Although, I wouldn't sit out there in the heat when summer crawls back again. This is a great spot to even take professional pictures. Once I was there eating when a bridal party walked in to take pics. It was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Delicious. The apple fritters are amazing. Best pancakes (besides my dad's), and really good burgers. Garlic fries are wonderful. Everything is great here. They are a part of my birthday trifecta, with $10 towards your meal on your birthday! I've been going here for years and I always bring out of towners here."}
{"text":"Excellent Ahi Sandwich w/ the wasabi mayo, Fontina Burger, Grilled BBQ Chicken pizza...and those garlic fries. French fries finished in olive oil and minced garlic (with a dusting of Romano cheese). Better than any chili-cheese fries you can find in TX/OK. Sure, great Mexican food can be had in the Valley, but we'll definitely return to Joe's on our next visit.  Fresh, inventively prepared fare with casual outside/inside dining areas. Almost as good as the Thanksgiving dinner we shared with family a couple of days before!"}
{"text":"I choose to go here for my Birthday because I wanted to try out a couple of their Food Network featured items (the fontina burger and onion rings). I was SUPER disappointed to learn that they were all out of onion rings!!! I mean really??? One of your featured food items?? The burger was delicious however I don't think I will be back again as I fear they could be out again. Also we ate outside and there were a ridiculous amount of flies which also kind of ruined the experience."}
{"text":"We always thought the Farm Grill was great, but were very disappointed this trip! Whom ever sold them on the idea of the drinks offered at the fountain, really did them a disservice! The need to go back to offering adult selections like Coke or Dr Pepper again instead of the crappy flavors like \"Tractor Cola\". It tasted awful, so both my wife and I tried a couple of others. They were all terrible. I settled for water, and my wife drank the root beer, which was tolerable!  We liked the do over in tables and atmosphere, but did the burgers shrink, or was our disappointment in the drinks just putting us in a crappy mood!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and dogs, grilled thin crust pizza, sandwiches and more. You can't beat some of the unique twists that Joe's puts on common fare. Especially when they are using their own farm fresh produce. Casual and comfortable atmosphere as well.   Full review and more pictures: http://blog.phosyzzle.com/2011/03/02/joes-farm-grill/"}
{"text":"Average food now more expensive and less than average taste.  Avoid the $3.00 new horrible tasting healthy soda. One star for being able to sit outside."}
{"text":"Scenery is very nice food not so nice ordered bacon wasnt fully cooked ordered toast wasnt toasted ordered sliced tomatoes w basil got a little cup with mostly juice and a few tomato cubes in a cup about 1 oz no basil and unseasoned eggs. maybe just an off day for the cook hopefully it will b bettet next time."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich, it was surprisingly bland, and a little dry. My sister had a salad that wasn't great. I was with a whole table full of family and all were underwhelmed.  I had heard that is was so great... I would say, ehhh."}
{"text":"This is the best food ever. Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Zuchini and sweet potato fries are amazing. The best portobello mushroom burger and best regular burger. Fontina Burger all the way. Joe grows his own ingredients mostly and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Highly highly recommended. Great atmosphere and you can also walk around the place for fun. When you sit outside and eat, it seems like you're in a whole other village."}
{"text":"So I intended to go for a skillet, but opted for the \"breakfast burger\" when I saw that there was a farm fresh fried egg on top of the burger patty.  The burger itself was delicious and juicy and the egg was lucious and cooked perfectly. I had some of my friend's veggie omelet, which was good as well.  But, seating is limited indoors and for this CA girl, the 98-degree heat in the shade was just too much for me to fully enjoy everything.    I'm also always on the look out for family-friendly spots.  While my toddler loved running around in the grassy areas, I was disappointed when I found that there wasn't a changing station in the bathrooms.  Really? You have weather durable high chairs, a kids menu, but no changing station?  Please differentiate yourself from a picnic at a public park and install some."}
{"text":"If you see a long line... just keep driving.  It will not move fast.  This place has good food but the service is so slow!  Got in line at 11:30 and didn't sit down with our food until 12:45.  Granted it was a Saturday, but over an hour wait is a little ridiculous if you ask me."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cool... BUT, let's just say... \"common food,  done uncommonly well ... with common household pests\" might have been an appropriate slogan today.  the flies were incessant, even indoors.  this diminished what would have been a very enjoyable lunch!   i was constantly swatting away at the flies.  the farm burger and zucchini slices are amazing though.  i'll just get it to go next time."}
{"text":"After writing my first review, the manager reached out to me and sent me a gift certificate for the poor quality burgers we received. He also asked when the food was purchased. This showed me the manager cares about the quality of their food and wants to ensure it doesn't happen again. I have been back several times since and the quality was spectacular, their usual norm.   Don't forget, you get a free meal on your birthday.  I love Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"My sister introduced us to Joe's Farm Grill, it's right by her house.  We've been here for breakfast and dinner and the food is delish!  What makes it so great is that everything they make is fresh from their farm, the restaurant sits on the actual farm.  Everything on the menu is good, my favorite is the Fontina Burger and when I order it with the beet salad instead of fries.  I also love their sweet potato fries and their breakfast is also great.  The prices and serving sizes are reasonable you never leave this place feeling stuffed and heavy.  I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"There's much to love about Joe's. Quality is consistent, service is efficient, and the food is good, simple, and fresh. This is not the cheapest place to have lunch, but it's the best, and I'm all about their farm-in-the-city philosophy.  Here are my highlights:  1. The pesto chicken sandwich. I order it without the bun, so it comes heaped with crisp dark lettuce, tomato, fresh sauteed mushrooms, and enough (house-made!) pesto to cover every bite.  2. The sweet potato fries with spicy-sweet pineapple dipping sauce. Never have healthy sweet potatoes tasted almost unhealthily delicious.  3. The onion rings. Thick cut with rosemary herb panko makes them unique.  As a side note, the HUGE tree next to the outdoor seating area is spectacular."}
{"text":"The line is a little long... but worth the wait !!! Amazing food and my kids can run around outside with me worrying about them bothering other customers"}
{"text":"Great food! One of my favorites on the east side of the valley. Just make sure your schedule allows a longer than normal sitting."}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place is amazing. A lil $$, but really a cool place to bring out of towners...."}
{"text":"If you've never been here, the place can be quite hard to find. I drove by a couple times and then finally pulled in and just parked and walked around until we found the place. It's a bit hidden. As far as ordering, we told the lady what we wanted and paid, making small talk with the cashier and I told her this was our first time here (in hopes of her giving us a little knowledge on how they run things). She just kinda gave me a blank stare and nodded. Let me just say - if you've never been here, it's a little confusing how they do things. She handed me my empty cup after I told her what I wanted to drink and I just stood there looking around for a drinking station when finally I had to ask her where it was which then she finally thought it was a good idea to let me know it was outside? I also asked her if my sandwich came with cheese and such which she responded with \"umm I don't know. I think?\" And that was her final answer, she didn't bother to try and find out for me which then I had to ask \"well can you find out??\" A bit ridiculous... so for newcomers- just know that everything is located outside as far as drinks, condiments, napkins, bathrooms, etc. other than the unknowledgeable careless cashier, I must say the food is very good! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and both were delicious which is why I'm giving 4 stars. The manager also came around to each guest asking how everything was which is a huge plus. Just need a little work on the cashiers!"}
{"text":"By far, one of my favorite places to eat in the East Valley! The food is always delicious, and the veggies are so fresh! The milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know how it is that I've been here a million times and have yet to review it.  I usually come for lunch or dinner and have enjoyed burgers, hot dogs, chili dogs, fries and salads on several occasions.  Their dark chocolate shake is really thick and rich.  But I recently came for brunch, and while the line was LONG and I had to wait in it for about 30 minutes before ordering, the meat and potatoes scramble was definitely worth it!  Lots of outdoor seating makes for a really fun picnic-type atmosphere that is as family-friendly as it gets.  Anyway, there are 135 other reviews on this place, so the bottom line is: just try it!  It's good!"}
{"text":"This place is right by our house... Amazing food. Tastes like they pulled it fresh outta their farm the same morning!  Literally you can taste the dirt in the food... And it's great!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. their fried green beans are a must have. Also, if you want to try something really different, they have a Grilled Peanut Butter & Banana Split sandwhich that is pretty freaking amazing.  The burgers are super juicy and are automatically done as medium i believe. You have to request if you want it rarer or more done. The workers have all been pretty amazing and the outside sitting area is pretty great. It can get VERY busy so be prepared for a possible wait. Especially on their fish fry fridays!! But definitely go and try them out!!"}
{"text":"Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with sautéed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I love going to eat here. I really like the outdoor and indoor dining areas. All the food I have ordered has not disappointed me at all. Their onion rings are to die for and I am not a fan of onion rings at all.  I love the different flavors of lemonade. I like how they have a lot of options on the menu. I would recommend this place to any and everyone."}
{"text":"This place has the whole package: Tasty Great Ambiance Somewhere between well priced and pricey, but it is easy to pay the price because the food is \"real\" Great place to hang"}
{"text":"It's a great concept, and a cute restaurant, but the food is really fast-food at sit-down prices.   I had a burger, and it was incredibly dry (and I never even tasted the cheese).  The fries, onion rings, and shakes were great, but given the cost, they better have been! We tried to sit outside, and the instant we brought our food out, we were absolutely swarmed by flies - so we gave up, and went inside."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and heard great things about this place. Upon arrival, the menu looked great but to our disappointment the food was just so so. The fries were cold, burgers were pedestrian at best and the hot dog we received was cold and a major disappointment. Staff was friendly enough. We had high hopes. Not going to return to joes farm grill. However the coffee shop next door is excellent! Dang joes!?!!"}
{"text":"Not much really needs to be said about this iconic Gilbert eatery. We first heard about it several years ago when we moved to the valley and saw them featured on Food Network. We've been fans ever since. Everything I've had is delicious (the Fontina Burger is always a favorite). Staff is friendly & helpful. Just be sure to give yourself some time as it seems to maintain steady business, and seating at peak times is limited (but the rustic outdoor seating under the very large shade trees is always fine, even in summer). And by all means, be sure to stop in on your birthday for your free $10 dining credit (bring a copy of a birth certificate for kids' birthdays). Save time for a stroll around the farm after you fill up on the fresh food, and be sure to check out the coffee shop (I think they won Cupcake Wars on Food Network - delicious!)."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Not bad, but also not anything memorable. What keeps us coming back to this place is their unique dining atmosphere. Its a fun place to go if you've never been. It's also a good place to bring out-of-towners."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because JFG is one of a kind. Great food of all varieties done with fresh flavors and a cool setting! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"OMG.  This place is awesome!  At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting into as I drove from Tempe out to the country-esque suburb known as Gilbert for dinner, but as soon as I saw the neon signage and gravel parking lot for Joe's Farm Grill with picnic tables outside and the line out the door, I knew I hit the jackpot.    As I stood waiting in line and trying to figure out the system of ordering for JFG (it's not confusing at all.  you just order like normal.), I saw posters up of Guy Fieri, the guy (no pun intended) from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network.  Apparently, he had been there to tape a show on JFG and feature their onion rings (which i then promptly ordered, which were not only good, but HUMONGOUS).  In all honesty, though, I liked the sweet potato fries better than the onion rings.  Anyway, I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with a side of cole slaw, the onion rings, and a vanilla shake while my friends ordered burgers and sweet potato fries.  Everything was DELISH!  The price was also perfect, and the people were totally friendly.    What makes JFG great in addition to everything else is their attention to detail like their focus on local ingredients.  I'm a big fan of supporting local agriculture (including fruits, veggies, and meats), so it's great that JFG supports it, too, to the extent that they can.  I noticed that at the bottom of the menu, it said: Spring 2010, so I'm assuming that the menu changes seasonally based on the farm goods available.  JFG also tries to not use prepared foods much, so they create their own sauces and bread their own onion rings.  Joe's Farm Grill is everything that other restaurants should strive to become, and I HIGHLY recommend you go.  They also have what appears to be a killer breakfast menu, so I might have to try that out in the NEAR future.  Note: If you notice that no condiments or drinks were given to you on your tray or filled in your cup, don't do what my friends and I did and stand there looking for them.  You have to walk out the door."}
{"text":"Came here with the fam here for the first time from my bro's recommendation.  It was great.  The Ahi Tuna Sandwich was super delicious.  My bro had the Fontina Burger and said that was great too.  I order the BBQ pulled pork and that was OK...probably can get the same at any BBQ joint (probably won't order that again...nothing special). The regular fries were just regular...if you come might as well upgrade to garlic or sweet potato fries.  We also got the salmon salad and that was good.  Set up was nice, always a line, but moves quicker than I thought.  There's seating inside and outside...luckily it was cloudy today so it wasn't too bad.  Probably would only come here in the evening or not come during the summer.  Service was great and nice.  Will come again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Joe's farm girl, the food is good and the atmosphere is great. They have some of the best fries I've had pretty much anywhere. They also server my favorite rootbeer brand, Hires. Which tends to be a real pain to find anywhere. The staff is friendly as well. Definitely somewhere I enjoy going when I've got the urge for some good food."}
{"text":"We love this place! We do like the remodel and the food is always delicious. One thing of note is the uptick in pricing. Lunch for 2 people ran us close to 40 dollars, we know the price of ingredients/beef, etc has increased and we appreciate the freshness of the ingredients, however the prices have raised by 2 or 3 dollars within the last year or two, so it seems. Other than that this place is great for the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place. Kid friendly, amazing food and atmosphere. Still trying to figure out what's going on in the bathrooms, though. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to get away and \"feel\" like you do not live in the desert. Their food is top notch and the staff is always friendly and awesome. This place is a must visit if you like to travel and see cool food joints and enjoy some great food. (Make sure you visit the bathrooms for an awesome throwback/vintage experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal in the farm. Burgers were tasty, onion rings just right, milk shake was thick! Long line, but it moved quickly and there was water and shade to make the April AZ sun tolerable. We went to college with Steve and Paul so it gave us a chance to reminisce."}
{"text":"Good food but nothing to drive 20 miles for.  Guy Fieri helped bring a lot of business here and now their prices show it.  I dropped $17 on a burger, fries and chocolate shake.  Not bad for once a year but I can think of better ways to spend nearly $20 on a meal.  This is a small establishment with walk-up ordering and call your number when finished just in case anyone was expecting something more fancy.    Don't leave without getting the garlic fries.  Practically worth the entire meal itself."}
{"text":"The food is very good here.  Very casual and laid back with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great place for pulled pork. Coming from Texas, I had reservations about this place. I ordered the ribs and my wife had the pulled pork. Great food.  Everything was fresh and service was quick. No embarrassments here, bring your best friend, soul mate or who ever. They will love the place. Thanks"}
{"text":"Every year Joe does a customer appreciation meal which brings out long lines that are worth it. Delicious hamburgers and plenty of outside seating to enjoy, especially during the spring and winter months. Beautiful gigantic trees provide plenty of shade. Kid's meals include a sucker."}
{"text":"After doing a bit of googling in search for a place with delicious french fries, I came across Joe's Farm Grill. I visited their website and liked what I saw (I love a menu with pictures). So after some more researching, my boyfriend and I decided to give this place a go. The surrounding area was filled with trees and there was lots of green to be seen, which is nice seeing as Arizona is full of all things brown. The building was practically made out of windows, which I also love, and it had a very inviting look to it. After browsing the menu I decided on the Fontina burger with their garlic fries. My boyfriend got the Farm burger with a fresh beet salad. We took a seat outside and waited for our food. The food didn't take very long to come up and I liked what I saw. Even better, I liked how it tasted. I couldn't wait to dive into the garlic fries. They were delicious. My boyfriend thought there was too much garlic on them, but I didn't mind.  The Fontina burger had roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, field greens, pesto sauce, and fontina cheese on it. My juicy burger tasted amazing. As for my boyfriend's Farm burger and beet salad, he enjoyed those as well.  Overall, it was a great experience and the place had a great atmosphere. If I happen to be in that area again, I'll surely stop by and try something else on their menu, but I won't be going out of my way to get there. It's a bit of a journey for a burger joint."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once. The food that my guest and I tried was itself very good. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and it was a monster. The onion rings on the burger, however, were to thick as a burger topping; I had to take them off and eat them separately. The food ordering process is a bit strange; you wait in line, and place your order at a window.  The bad: we started our dinner outside, on the back patio. This turned out to be a huge mistake. We lasted less than five minutes, of being eaten alive by flies, before retreating inside. Okay, the place is located on a farm, that's understandable. The problem is that the inside dining area wasn't any better. Why have an inside area, at all, if you're just going to leave all of the doors open? We went out for a nice dinner, having heard great things about the food, but the heat and the flies had us packing up our food and taking it home after minutes. All in all, a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by her yesterday after a hike and boy was it good!  I am a little skeptical about Triple-D restaurants, but this one was great! Had the fontina burger and bbq pizza, everything was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So, yeah! This place is awesome in so many different levels. Not only was the breakfast delicious.... but the property is beautiful on top of having an awesome all around vibe! We've heard the burgers here are good too so we'll have to definitely go back to try their lunch menu and the other restaurants on the property too. A must go to I must say : )"}
{"text":"Everything at this place is wonderful.  Honestly though, if I haven't come by recently then I can't avoid ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  All fresh ingredients.  Just be ready for a line if you come during rush hours."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST CHICKEN FARM sand which pair that with the Beet Salad and the meal is perfect! I recommend this place to all my family that comes into town and friends, for a great food.. Cannot be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything at this place is amazing! All grain fed meats and locally grown organic produce, fun, quirky atmosphere and even Guy Fieri recommended! Great place to bring the family or for a dinner for two."}
{"text":"Always enjoy dropping into Joes.  I do love the ribs.  Had just about everything on the menu and couldn't complain"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place.  I live in California but everytime that we go visit my Mother in law in AZ, visiting Joe's Farm Grill is always the highlight.  I love their burgers,  the pizza is great, not to mention the amazing fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"Food is amazing every time. I get the fontina burger almost every time. I don't like mushrooms on anything besides a pizza. But this just fits. Southwest burger good and BBQ pizza is too."}
{"text":"We came in to get lunch and it was totally chill! They were really nice and the food came out really quick. I really enjoyed their meal and it was quite appetizing. They kept the place clean and there wasn't anything that was out of order. It was a great lunch!!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome spot to eat! Once we saw they were on triple D we had to try it. The seared ahi tuna salad/ sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The vibe is so cool. Food is fresh and delicious. Unique dishes."}
{"text":"Its a pretty cool place, I went there for breakfast one morning it was nice sitting outside.... I definitely prefer this place to you typical indoor breakfast places"}
{"text":"I feasted TODAY!!! Wow. Joe's restaurants never cease to amaze me ... the freshness, the attention to detail....even the \"out-there\" Barbie and GI Joe themed restrooms are a must-see. I had the Chicken Pesto sandwich with panko crusted zucchini slices for lunch...the sandwich was topped with roasted red peppers and mushrooms, and I ordered the multi grain bun which was so dense yet moist and flavorful! A few of their menu items were featured on the Food Network's Diners Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri .... and gotta say, every item looks exactly the way they showed it on tv. Impressed? Indeed. I'll be back FO SHO."}
{"text":"I love their Tuna Burger, asian slaw, and fried (fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings... etc etc) items. Oh, and their milkshake is also to die for.  I would go as often as I could as long as it's not over 90 degrees outside. I didn't enjoy the long wait to order in the heat. Service is really nice and pretty fast. I got my ordered messed up a couple times before, but they usually took care of that right away and always with an apology and a smile.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The new expanded indoor seating is great and recommended.  It's a zoo outside.  Leave it for the large Gilbert families.   Food: The new pork tenderloin sandwich is great.  It will do the job for any Midwesterner. They still offer the best of their original menu too.  Fries were bland and undercooked.  The onion rings had skin left on them under the breading. The \"Tractor Soda\" is horrible.  Bad idea, bad taste.  Even the Kalil fountain was better.  The line was out the door and across the front, halfway to the parking lot.  How about some table service?"}
{"text":"Went there again the other day to try the Tuna that I saw on Guy Fieris diners drive ins and dives.  It was horribly overcooked and tasteless. We also ordered a burger with I believe Fontina. Terrible and hard as a rock.  I think it might have been because they were so busy but I had to change my review because anytime you spend $25 on a meal you should not have to be eating dry or overcooked food!"}
{"text":"Joe's is one of our places, yo! Reliably good food every time. I've tried their breakfast tacos and the garden burger. It's free on your birthday, too."}
{"text":"Not sure what Guy saw in this place.  It was a hit and a miss for us.  Some folks probably like it more than others, some don't.  Not so much in the quality of items just in the preparation. Both times we went it fell short.  There's a lot on the menu, give it a try see what you think.  I'm not saying don't go, just don't get your hopes up to high. Some of the items we had were Wedge Salad, Fontina Burger, Grilled Cheese, Pepperoni Pizza, Onion Rings, Chocolate Malt, Strawberry Lemonade.  If nothing else sit outside and enjoy the nice atmosphere with friends and family."}
{"text":"The hubby and I drove to Queen Creek to visit some friends and they took us the this place. LOVE it! It's so cool that it has such a family friendly atmosphere: dogs running around, kids climbing trees, picnic tables with high chairs. It's cafeteria style, so there usually a long line around lunchtime on the weekends. Don't let that deter you because it moves pretty fast. You order at the window and they give you a buzzer when your food is ready to be picked up at the next window.  The food is fresh and really really good! The sweet potato fries came out very crispy, sweet and moist inside. I hat the onion rings with a crunchy corn meal batter. The buffalo chicken sandwich is really good too. The bun is a soft sweet roll and it comes with this dressing that had huge chunks of blue cheese. Amazing. Everyone's food was awesome. I will definitely come back when I am on the East side of town!"}
{"text":"love the casual picnic ambienc"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times and after this last time I finally decided to write a review.   Atmosphere is definitely a good casual setting. Very spacious, love the bench seating, outdoor seating, etc. Also really enjoy the garden that you can take a stroll around.   Now to the food. the first time I came I loved loved the garlic fries! However, this last time, I bought an actual side of it (not just the upgrade) and it was sitting in a pool of oil. That was a bit disturbing, but nevertheless, they were still good! (until you get to the bottom)  The fontina burger was great! Must try. The BBQ chicken was ok. The cheese and ingredients that it's made of is good and a good combo, but the crust was too burnt for my taste (and I like crispy). Ahi tuna sandwich was a disappointment. It looked decent, just based on looks, but wasn't as tasty and tender as it could have been. I felt like the wasabi mayo didn't have enough taste. The chicken pesto made up for the ahi tuna.   I did also go there for the customer appreciation day, which was definitely a bonus in their book! The burger and regular fries were very good and for free, even better!   My sister got the fried zucchini slices. She absolutely loved them. I thought they were decent. Their onion rings and zucchini are done well in terms of good crispyness on the outside and good on the inside too.   Oh yes, I'm not sure if this is part of the actual restaurant, but the self service farmers market across from the building next door is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's Farm Grill many times.  Usually, it's when I'm in the area showing homes to clients.  It's always been a big hit with my clients who see it as a great change from the usual fast food restaurants their children want to eat at for lunch.  Joe's has some delicious food items for adults and children alike. They have plenty of comfortable seating inside, or if you'd prefer, you can eat outside under a big tree. I just don't recommend the outside seating when it's 112 degrees here in the valley. Before you leave, and even if you don't have to, check out the bathrooms.  There are old claymation movies playing in there which is very nostalgic.  Plus the bathrooms are clean! Go Joe's."}
{"text":"The food was great, the atmosphere is fun and the people who work there are the best.   They have awesome customer service. My wife ordered fish and when our order was ready they informed me that her meal was overcooked and it would take a little longer. We were happy to wait and I was impressed that they didn't serve us the overcooked fish. When her food was done, I picked it up and they gave me a gift card with the price of her dish on it. This was not the first time we've eaten there but it was the first time our order was not perfect and not only did they fix it, they paid for it.   It was a great experience and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill for dinner tonight. No lines? That's unbelievable. Usually there is a line out the door and around the corner. This place is that good! It was our lucky day. This place was premiered on diners, dive ins and dives. If you never visited its a must. If you haven't been here in awhile, come treat yourself and bring your friends and family. :-)"}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a hidden gem. I had driven by it before ever going in, and I was intrigued by the outside. We finally went in on Easter Sunday. It was pretty busy but the long line moved quickly. We didn't have much contact with employees other than when we placed our order, but the girl that helped us was very friendly. The food was pretty good and the landscaping outside with the picnic tables and giant trees is perfect for a casual Sunday lunch date."}
{"text":"Great place, love the food- the onion rings are amazing!  I love the area, you can take the kids right next door to the community garden, which is beautiful to a farm girl like me. I only wish I lived closer so that I could be a regular!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! Whenever someone comes to visit me this is the spot I take them.  The set up is great and the food is even better. Think of Joe's Farm Grill like a gourmet burger joint that pleases everyone. I am not even really a burger kind of girl. The dark chocolate milkshake is to die for. Last time I went I had the Presto Chicken Sandwich. It was so tender and juicy I polished of the plate in no time. Breakfast is really good too and the waffles are a must. I love that there is a lot of sitting outside and big trees to keep you shaded. Every time is a a good time at Joe's."}
{"text":"the best in everything-food, service, athmosphere, location and price. it sholud be the ultimate landmark of Gilbert, AZ."}
{"text":"First off. We love joes real BBQ.  Anybody that asks for a great place to eat or when people come to visit we take them there.  On the other hand this is our first trip to the farm grill and we are very disappointed with the food.  Burger was made wrong, but they did fix and remake with out question.  But the burgers were terrible. No flavor at all.     I must say that the staff was very friendly tho.   I can say we will always go to the real BBQ but never again to farm grill."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great with friends people and the farm around it. The setup is unique and that's another part of why I sorta like it. To be honest I don't really like any of the food there so the three stars is based on atmosphere and setup."}
{"text":"Great food! Garlic fries are the best. Great burgers, pizza, shakes, everything is recommended at Joes!"}
{"text":"There is no better way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning in March than sitting outside in the shade eating good food in a lovely atmosphere.This place is so fun! I even like using the restroom, it's a treat in itself. However it wasn't as clean as I'd hoped but the place was so busy I'll let them slide on that one. My family ordered the March special, all the items featured on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" for $31, it was so much food and very good. Loved the onion rings. I will try the date shake next time."}
{"text":"I was in Gilbert visiting an old friend a few weeks ago. While there, I asked around for a good place to eat. The answer, almost unanimously, was Joe's Farm Grill.   Man, oh, man were they right! It was 100% amazing!   The atmosphere there was that of an old farm in the 50s. Very vintage. I loved the huge tree in the back. Damn, that thing is big, but perfect for sitting under.  I ordered the farm burger with sweet potato fries. Very good! Probably the best burger I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked, and had a great flavor. I even slid a few sweet potato fries under the bun. Yummy!  Yeah, if you're ever going to go to Gilbert, Arizona... go to Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive!  Great food and neat atmosphere.  The grilled peanut butter banana split sandwhich was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of those places you need to experience. The lunch rush is a little bit of a hassle but more than worth it if you are looking for authentic american classics. Joe's onion rings are big circles of happiness so don't hold back on them!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  Great place to go with Friends."}
{"text":"Been here too many times to count. Food is always good, which explains why the line can get extremely long at times. Outside dining area is much better after the renovation. Only reason it's not a 5 star review is we have had to stop coming as much due to the increasing size of the line."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fabulous place! LOVE the setting and the ambiance there. The food is delicious, and it is so fresh! The service was so friendly, and we can tell that they really care about their customers. Over two visits, we have had:   - Fontina burger  - French fries  - Onion rings  - Fried zucchini  - BBQ chicken salad  ...and everything was fabulous! We will definitely be returning when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Since moving to Arizona, two years ago, we have eaten at Joe's many times.  We moved into a new house last year, and ran to Joe's to eat and break up the backbreaking.  My wife and I were both blown away by the food, and decided to make a trip back the next day for more.  Any time we have visitors, we always take them to Joe's, and almost always create new fans.  Some menu items of interest are the Ahi burger, the 4B (Barbeque bacon blue-cheese burger), and the garlic fries.  We have only been for breakfast twice, but the first time had the bacon and blue cheese pancakes.  I have never had a better breakfast.  The combination sounds weird, but the sweetness of the pancake and the syrup were an amazing contrast to the blue cheese and the salty bacon."}
{"text":"It was delicious--until I got food poisoning. I took a huge bite out of a scrumptious burger and it wasn't until I looked down for a second bite that I realized it was still moo-ing. I told them it was too rare and they said \"this is how we always cook them.\" So I gave the back end of the burger another go, but I just couldn't do it. They took it back and made me a new one, but by then the damage had been done.  I'm still giving them 3 stars because their butter pecan shake was amazing and the rest of the food in my party was great. I would go back, but I'll be cutting open the burger first next time, or just ordering something that doesn't involve beef."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Gilbert.  Very long lines during the weekends, so make sure you plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Friendly place for great traditional American food! Inside and outside eating areas. Fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Breakfast is awesome. They have really good pancakes and waffles. Lunches are also great. I love the fontina burger. The garlic fries are yum. The beet salad is tasty. The panko onion rings are crunchy and flavorful. It is a great place to eat outdoors during the spring and fall, and on cooler early mornings in the summer. The price is worth it when you consider the obvious quality of what you are getting on your plate. My only complaint is that the quality of their beverages (Coke products...blech) and their condiments (specifically the mayo and ranch dressing) don't match the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I was headed out in this direction and was looking for something quick for dinner. Looked up triple D locations and saw this place. My first impression was that I wonder if it's any good. My second impression was, I don't remember watching this on TV. Did not matter as it would have been a place to try anyway.  So before heading out we looked at the menu and wrote down what we wanted. We were driving from Phoenix and I didn't want to eat cold food. I called and placed the order and said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. Well when we drove up we were shocked to see a long line.  I went in trying to figure out what was going on. I saw the window that was for pick up and went is this where I pick up my order? It sure was. I was happy I called ahead and had paid for it in advance and was on my way. I saw the line for food and it was pretty long. I can't imagine the wait.   Finally at the destination we sat and ate. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and onion rings that were featured on the show as well as a burger. The pizza was pretty good and the onion rings. The first thing that came to my mind was it reminded me of another place I went to that was featured on triple D. Taylor's Refresher in Napa. It has that sort of feel to it.   Over all it was good, but a long way to go just for food. If we're ever there again we'll place another take out order. Saves the wait time and just as fresh as waiting in lien for it to cook."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and eaten a good variety here.  The best thing I've had is the Fontina burger with garlic fries.  That is amazing,  as well as the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  I can see driving to Gilbert, AZ from Ventura County just to re-experience this delightful dining experience.  Flavor, flavor, flavor!  On our way back from our New Orleans road trip we detoured and took a chance on Joe's and it was well worth it.    We are bringing the kids next time so watch out!  By the way the G.I Joe's showcased were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Excellent food for a good price. Would highly recommend to anyone for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Fresh, local ingredients. Nothing outlandish on the menu, but everything I tried was prepared to perfection.  The Chicken Mushroom Scramble is so flavorful and the skillet potatoes were a perfect accompaniment. The Veggie Omelet is packed with fresh veggies expertly prepared to maximize flavor. The Apple Fritters are out of this world! Al fresco dining under massive mature shade trees was the cherry on top. I'll be returning with the family soon. Thanks Joes!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious with friendly staff. I live around the corner and stop by about once a week.  Their burgers are some of the best around and there grilled pizza has a very unique and satisfying flavor.  Also a big fan of Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"We live in Agritopia and walk to Joe's frequently. The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had, and my wife is all over the fontina burger and sweet potato fries. You really can't go wrong with any burger, but I love the farm chicken sandwich. A lot of people like the BBQ chicken pizza and oddly enough the beet salad is really good, and even though my wife and kids are haters about the beet salad, I order it virtually every time. If you want a cool, unique vibe, with unbelievable food and a great outdoor setting for kids to run around and play...you can't beat this this place! Side note: everyone else in Gilbert knows this place kills it so from October-April plan on waiting about 30 in lone to order if you show between 5:45-7:00pm."}
{"text":"My wife loves this restaurant.  Fresh food from the farm and local businesses. I enjoy the outdoor seating. Would be great if the dirt parking lot gets paved."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is a great little restaurant that has really fresh food.  My husband and I went for a late lunch/early dinner around 3:00 which was a great time because it was not too busy.  I ordered the veggie burger with fries, my husband ordered a cheeseburger with mushrooms and fries, and we also ordered onion rings to share because we had heard a lot of great things about them.  We ordered way too much food, but I would do it again in a heartbeat.  My veggie burger had great flavor (it was a little spicy which I loved) and was grilled perfectly so that it was nice and crispy on the outside.  The fries were crispy and tasted great.  The onion rings were also crispy and fabulous!  My husband said that his hamburger was really good, but that the mushrooms on it were the best mushrooms he has had in a while.  One item we would change is the ranch dressing that we used with the onion rings.  The ranch was watery and not very flavorful.  If we could change one thing we would make the ranch dressing better.  With that being said, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Saw it on Diners, Dives and Drive Ins or something like that, lol. Regardless of how I got there I'm sooo glad I did. This was one of the 2 best places I ate at during my two years in Phoenix. I've only had one dish - every time I go I can't order anything but this - the Ahi Tuna with spicy asian slaw and wasabi mayonnaise spread is simply to die for. Its messy, it will not stay within its borders but who cares - I'll slop that stuff off the table if I have too. The shakes are awesome and I always seem to get their onion rings even though they're not big fat ones, they slice them thin and fry them crispy. Still good! Once you drive up you'll know you're in for an experience. Fruit trees, and the farm where they grow everything you're about to eat - I still haven't figured how they grow the Tuna but its so dam good I don;t even care where they get it from. Look them up on that dives, diners, and whatever it is show and you'll see a plethora of good eats that'll make you drive right over if you're ever in town."}
{"text":"I have been coming back here several times since I moved to AZ. It is family friendly and very clean. I tried Ahi-tuna sandwich, Joe BBQ burger and Grilled chicken sandwich. The Ahi-tuna sandwich is pretty decent! It is served with special dressing. The burger and the other sandwich are average quality. As the consumer, I like Joe Farms Grill because it serves the decent quality veggies and provides you the heathy choice; you can choose the side when you purchase burger or sandwich. Also, it is budget friendly dining area because it is designed as the self service restaurant(no waitress/waiter)"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Gilbert and we decided to hit up Joe's, which is all the rage in the East Valley.  Simply put: Great food, though they should stop deifying themselves at the expense of Guy Fieri.  I get it.  Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives went there.  I don't need books and television loops reminding me.  The place is like a neighborhood hangout in the summer, with families strewn across an endless sea of benches and outdoor tables.  It's definitely one of the things to appreciate about Gilbert."}
{"text":"I got myself a double dog with fries and strawberry shake with the gf! This place is the bees knees! Simple great tasting food! We sat outside which was beautiful! The self serve condiments are cool. Great place to eat. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Get the sweet potato fries and a burger. You will not be disappointed. Of course, there's something on the menu for everyone. My girlfriend loves the ahi tuna salad; it's not exactly my style, but it is damn good nonetheless. If you're planning on popping in at peak lunch or dinner time, expect a line, but it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, garden-fresh food that never disappoints! We recently visited (for our 2nd time) with some friends who were visiting from Pennsylvania.  At 2:30 pm, there was no line, a known rarity for this place.  If you do have to wait, know that it's worth it!  Most of the seating is outside on picnic tables, all placed under the branches of fruit trees, providing the perfect amount of shade.  This February 1st afternoon, the sun was shining brightly with temperatures in the low 70's - perfect weather to dine outside! We ordered the BBQ Sampler Platter, Ahi Tuna Sandwich and Cheeseburger.  All of it was absolutely perfect! The onion rings were crispy and flavored with the just-right amount of herbs.  The ahi tuna was cooked to perfection, topped with a delicious Asian slaw.  The BBQ was sweet and spicy, and left all of us wishing there was more.  Overall, it's the perfect place to eat, especially when the weather is nice.  (Don't worry, there's seating inside if you need it.  And don't forget to check out the neat décor in the bathroom!)"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have never had a disappointing meal, a little bit pricey yes but i have never had anything that i would not order again and again. Everything is fresh and the menu has a good selection even for the kids. If you go you even have to check out the rest room."}
{"text":"I would not know anything about this place if it wasn't for my cousin.  He introduced me to it about a year and a half ago and we make the drive just to go.  They have a great selection of food on the menu and have classic american dishes.  I usually get the BBQ Chicken Pizza and after I am done I just want another one.  They have great french fries and sweet potato fries.  One of the best things about this place is that it is on a farm (hence the name) so all the food is grown and cooked on the property.  The space is clean and somewhat chic, but not pretentious by any means.  They also have picnic styled benches outside that are great when the weather permits.   Recommendation:  To anyone that likes american styled food and wants to eat like a champ."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. Had the grilled veggie pizza. They had to be the freshest veggies ever. Soooo good"}
{"text":"Great menu options and everything tasted so fresh!!  I loved eating on the picnic tables outside under the beautiful trees...in this great AZ weather, it was delightful to let the kids run about a bit, watch the sunset and eat with a gorgeous view of the farm.  I will definitly be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE JOE'S!! Food is delicious, and you get up to $10 free ON your birthday! No club sign-up crapo, just show ID. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The one thing that stands out about this place is atmosphere. The owner, Joe Johnston grew up in this building as it was his childhood home, and you can tell he still cares about the place. Always clean, very friendly, wonderful atmosphere. I talked to him personally at one of their customer appreciation days, he is one of the entrepreneurs in Arizona I would say. The burgers are nothing special, hence the four star rating, but the fries and pizza and milkshakes are a must when I go here. The line is usually out the door and around the building, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"So this place actually makes organic food. You can tell that it's legit because they are on a farm! I have friends that will drive from Tempe or Phoenix just for this food.   If you're in the mood for delicious food off of the grill definitely get the ribs. You will be. Dry happy that you did! Also their fruit and veggies are delicious."}
{"text":"Went with my family of five today for lunch. Waited in line for 30 minutes and spent $65 on lunch. Food was good, not great. 3 of our 5 orders wrong. Seared tuna salad was well done and dry. Took it back to the pick up window and they told me that they would remake it. I thought I would get a new salad, but just got a paper bowl with a seared piece of tuna in it. BBQ bacon blue cheese burger had no blue cheese or BBQ sauce. Grilled chicken sandwich had no red peppers. Staff was nice when we told them about the tuna, but seemed to get increasingly annoyed when we pointed out the other errors.   The onion rings were good.  At least they have that going for them.   Quality to price ratio was horrible. Had much better food that was about the same price at Top Golf just down the road the day before.   Another highly overrated DDD restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews i saw. Which almost all of them were 4 stars. The atmosphere was cute...especially if you have children who like to run around. I found the food to be okay. Nothing special, and really overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Placed an order over an hour ago so that I can pick it up on my way home from work (they get really busy so I rather have it ready to go). I get here and they haven't even made my food yet. They tell me it will be a few minutes and yet I've been waiting for  25 minutes. I've waited longer than some of the people here tonight, and they're still getting their food before me. Very, very disappointed in the service tonight!   I love the food here and it's near my house, but it's these types of things that make me never want to return again, not to mention they were not very friendly or apologetic about the situation either! I hope Joe sees this."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the expectations.  Bottom line is, that it is bar food; burgers, hot dogs, etc.  However, they make this food lively.  The natural spin on this food is refreshing.  Onion rings are spectacular. The atmosphere is very inviting.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The outdoor seating under the fruit trees is great.  There is also outdoor misters to cool it down a bit in the summer.  The outdoor condiment area is awesome (I need that set up at my house).  A section of land like this is rare to find around the Phoenix area. This places gives you a sense you are not in a huge city.  The food is amazing, bbq pork is the way to go.  Get one of their malts on the out for your drive home"}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere the food and the service are all spectacular! I got the BBQ chicken grilled fired pizza as featured on diners drive ins and dives and it was really good! It was cooked perfectly and the blue cheese on it makes a good flavor and I'm not a huge blue cheese fan. They also give you $10 free for your birthday which is so fun! Defiantly a great place to go!"}
{"text":"We were excited about trying this place out but we have to say that we were pretty underwhelmed.  It's a neat place to visit but the food was nothing special.  The fontina burger was ok, but it could have been seasoned a little better...the flavor just wasn't there.  The garlic fries were extremely salty.  The date shake was actually pretty tasty, but all and all we'd say it wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  i could eat here all the time.  i always go for lunch with friends or for dinner with family.  great for kids.  there is grass for the kids to run around on.  it is like going on a picnic at the park but with great food.  we go about once a month! well maybe more!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever had... BBQ chicken pizza was great and Rachel's burger was excellent. The best onion rings I have ever eaten.  Here's a beginner tip, try the strawberry lemonade. How good is the food here? Sometimes we travel up from Tucson just for a taste. Also every time we ate in Phoenix we make sure and stop. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We're definitely impressed. Had a natural all beef hot dog with low and slow barbecued pulled pork. Amazing. And the tiger shrimp are just f***ing ridiculous. Delicious."}
{"text":"This place is casual, perfect place for the hipsters. I got the Cesar salad and zucchini rounds! I cannot say enough good....it's so delicious!!! This is a place I will continue to visit, it looks and taste fresh!"}
{"text":"Flavorful food from quality ingredients.  Charming atmosphere. Back to the basics with a new age touch. Enjoyed the ahi sandwich & BBQ combo platter. Next time will have to try the fantastic looking shakes!"}
{"text":"I have been to Joes Farm Grill several times and its always good! They have good burgers and its a fun environment. Great place for families."}
{"text":"We live in the west suburbs of Phoenix but try to hit up Joe's any chance we get. Great atmosphere with kids, delicious burgers, kids always eat every last bite, mud sundae is a great end to this pit stop. I usually split my meal, it's a lot of food."}
{"text":"Love Joe's.  What a great hang out! I love the outdoor area the best.  The picnic tables are so casual and I want to hang out there for hours, especially on a cool night.  The kids feel so free out there.  I give the fun atmosphere 5 stars.  I give the food 4 stars. Had the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. Sounded great on the menu.  I didn't want to be disappointed, but I couldn't help it.  The tuna was kinda dry. Wasn't happy about it.  Liked the coleslaw.  Onion rings were really good. Really nice  seasoning and the crispy crunchy coating was great.  Shakes were a bit runny but a good taste overall."}
{"text":"The setting is fantastic, I can't think of any better place to hang while eating. That being said the food is not as great as the setting, the food is to expensive and ok. I've had things I like and others that I don't care for. JFG does grow a lot of their own food and that is a major plus but the food doesn't bring me back.  Also don't get BBQ here is isn't nearly as great as Joes real BBQ"}
{"text":"I don't get it!! My husband, daughter and I went to eat at Joe's because we saw a menu in the Hotel where we were staying nearby.  The Menu mentioned that the TV show DINERS DRIVE-INS AND DIVES had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious!  I called ahead for directions and was greeted with an attitude when I explained that we were from out of town, staying at a hotel that has their menu and needed directions to get there.  I assumed since the menu was in the hotel room that the employees at Joe's  would know how to direct someone to get there from the hotel.  After I explained several times the cross streets and the name of the hotel where we were staying, explained that we were just north of the 202 freeway etc and was just about to give up, the girl finally was able to give me directions.  Was that an omen of things to come??  The first irritation that we encountered was standing in line and trying to decide what we should order while there was only ONE cashier.   So when we did reach the window to place our order we could practically feel the irritation of the people waiting behind us while we tried to ask a few questions about the menu.  Feeling pressure to hurry up by the impatient look on the cashiers face we ordered a variety of things for the three of us.  The Fontina Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and Fresh Beet Salad.  With the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would taste something we liked, but the only adjective that we could come up with for everything was BLAH.   I am not exaggerating....we were all hungry and we are not picky eaters, but we just couldn't get a good bite of anything.  Also when I placed our order I asked for side orders of the onions rings and sweet potato fries but the cashier rang up full orders which I didn't realize since my husband paid the bill not knowing it should have been less.  Our bill for the 3 of us was equal to what we would pay at a restaurant with someone serving us!!  I wouldn't mind so much if the food tasted good but......   TheFONTINA BURGER was cooked very well done (I ordered it medium/well).  It had a very slight smear of pesto (so slight that I couldn't even taste it) with a few small pieces of mushy grilled pepper and the fontina cheese.  The burger was so unremarkable that I can't even remember if there were \"greens\" on it our not.  I would describe this burger as DRY and BLAH. The ONION RINGS had such a crunchy exterior that it actually hurt our mouths to bite into them.  Besides that, the onion pieces were so thin you could hardly taste the onion.  It was like eating a basket full of crunchy fried breading. The SWEET POTATO FRIES and the WHITE POTATO FRIES were also just BLAH....how can you mess up fries??  After some serious thought we decided it had to be the type of oil that they were fried in.  It was just tasteless.  Even salt and ketchup couldn't help these fries!   The BBQ PORK SANDWICH was just okay as was the COLESLAW.  Not really much to say about them.   The BEET SALAD tasted like dirt.  My daughter and I both love beets but neither of us could take more than one bite of this salad. The PICKLES that they put on top of everything are just gross.  What they heck is wrong with just a dill pickle?  Why the sweet and sour wierd flavor combo??  There is only one DRINK MACHINE and CONDIMENT BAR and it is OUTSIDE!  So to fill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and stand in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything.  Irritating!  More irriation came in the form of the FLIES swarming our table which made for a very frustrating time of swatting them off of our food between bites.   We were all hungry but none of us finished our meal because we were just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite.  We even tried to doctor stuff up by dipping our fries in the bbq sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just couldn't fix any of it!  We left feeling ripped off, vowed to never return and decided we deserved to stop for an ice cream someplace on our way back to the hotel to get that IRRITATING, BLAH, SWEET and SOUR, DIRT flavor out of our mouths.  PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS would be my recommdendation to the staff of this place because everything really adds up or takes away from the dining experience.  We were overcharged, irritated by the set up, atmosphere and flies and we were still hungry when we left!    I am submitting this review because I don't want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the FOOD NETWORK show hype the way we were.  The only reason I gave two stars is because I like the \"farm fresh concept\" and wanted to give the place credit for that."}
{"text":"I live down the street from Joe's and eat there frequently for breakfast and lunch.  Breakfast tacos = HEAVEN.... Curry chicken salad sandwich = BLISS....and the Garlic Fries = DE-FREAKING-LICIOUS!!!  Everything on the menu showcases care and incredible flavor.  Don't forget to go next door to the Coffee Shop and try a cupcake and/or coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos are great. This is a great location. I love the outdoor seating. We usually have the kids bring a football or something to keep them busy outside while the adults get a chance to talk. The cafe is great too for a quick breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is truly straight off the farm. It is so fresh and you can actually see where they grow the food.   It takes a bit to get your food, that's because you use them prep and actually make your food, instead of it being pre-made processed crap.   I will defiantly becoming back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was B+.  If you get the ribs, you'll have a lot to eat for $15, but the thing that made me give them only 2 stars was their service.  I asked the girl at the food window where I could find some ranch.  She said, \"Outside\" and rolled her eyes like I should have already know that.  Later, after having the ribs, my wife asked the same girl if they had any toothpicks.  She answered \"Outside\" and rolled her eyes at my wife.  Some blonde girls aren't cut out to be friendly to customers."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I think my favorite thing I have had here is the the hot dog with pulled pork. YUM. The onion rings are very good as well. The atmosphere is nice and casual. If you have little ones with you they can play outside while you sit at the picnic tables. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is great.  I may be a little biased as I'm in walking distance, but the food is fresh and very tasty.  I have had both the breakfast and dinner items (i've tried several) and I've never been disappointed.  It's great to sit outside in the 75 degree weather.  From the gourmet pallet to the kid in all of us, Joe's will hit this spot."}
{"text":"Superb experience. Get there early and don't miss the hand squeezed OJ and apple fritters."}
{"text":"came here tonight and was not impressed at all. I knew it was on that TV show so I made the hour drive from Scottsdale just to try this place. it was a huge let down. they messed up our order twice and we had no compensation. for a place that is supposedly \"farm fresh\" the vegetables sure didn't taste like it... especially the lettuce as it was old and wilted. when they finally brought out the correct burger it was lukewarm and very mediocre. the meat just didn't taste all that great( although I have had some pretty amazing burgers so that might just be me). I would go as far as to say that my gym, the dc ranch village, makes a better burger than this place.a friend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which they forgot to bring out at first. he is not a small eater and he threw it out after a couple bites. the sweet potato fries were okay but nothing special. the regular fries were pretty good, very salty and reminded me of McDonald's fries. after they finally brought out the beet salad( after bringing out a random side salad that did not taste good at all) it was good but not great. they were out of a lot of condiments as well. the only thing that really stood out to me was the medjool date shake. that thing was freaking amazing! it had these delicious chunks of dates in it. if you like dates then you will enjoy this shake. I would come back just for a shake. another plus was the manager( I'm assuming? a nice blonde lady) came around and asked us if everything was alright multiple times. although she should of comped something after we told her they messed up our order multiple times. most likely will not be back unless it's for a milkshake."}
{"text":"Great food ... but crazy amount of flies last time we went.  It's been awhile so maybe they fixed the problem ... but its hard to enjoy your food while swatting flies."}
{"text":"Good food. The Asian chicken salad ws tasty. Lots of seating outside but the flies almost ran us out of there.  Will sit inside next time!"}
{"text":"Long line but great food. Always friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but a little pricey. Love the atmosphere. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We come here often and have been since it opened.  I love the 4B burger (bacon, blue cheese, bbq sauce and onion ring), the chicken pesto sandwich is to die for as well!  I love how fresh everything is and that they get most of their veggies on site in their garden.  The BBQ pizza is also good, as well as their shakes, malts and sundaes.  We always bring company here especially when the weather is nice because you can sit outside and bring your (leashed) dog too :).  Plus, they give you $10 towards your meal on your birthday!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow - the garlic fries alone were worth the trip!  Definitely a 5/5.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza, which was pretty good.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't in the same league as others that I've had.  Maybe I just like a different style.  I'd give that a 3.5/5.  My wife had the ahi tuna burger and rated it a 4/5.  She also had a milkshake and sweet potato fries and said they were both a 5/5."}
{"text":"Another favorite for its homegrown and fresh ingredients. Great family place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere and company! Thanks to Guy Fieri for pointing this one out!"}
{"text":"Went after wanting to try this place for a long time. After going, I don't see what the fuss is about.  For growing and farming their own food, prices are extremely excessive. For 2 burgers, and 2 kids meals, it was $40. I had the 4B burger (bbq sauce, bacon, bleu cheese). It was a good size burger, but fairly dry. Fries were average. After this experience, I think I'll sick to their bbq joint."}
{"text":"Tasty! I am not a fan of eggs, so being invited out for breakfast can be tricky. However, their waffles are great! Not too soft and not too crispy. You can order them with fruit and with/without whip cream. Their syrup isn't too sweet either. My friend's green eggs and ham dish did look reaaall good. Bonus points for selling Naked juice. Lunch/Dinner was even better. Their Ahi Tuna sandwich is soooo good. I haven't tasted anything since that measures up. Very light and great flavor. I especially liked their choice of buns! Fried zucchini should be sold everywhere. They have my favorite marinara sauce. AND I always hate marinara sauce. Go try..NOW!"}
{"text":"Easter breakfast was fantastic!!  Fresh, delicious and great setting!  One negative, the wait in line was long and I didn't understand the ONE person taking orders seemed very inefficient.  However, I did overhear that it was by design to keep the cooks getting the food out in a reasonable time.  Once we ordered, the food, 6 meals, was out in less that 15 mins.  We stood in line for nearly 40 minutes. The pancakes were amazing, the four cheese omelet, was scrumptious! Definitely will drive 1 hour each way from my home to go back to try the lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Don't love their farm burger but their fontina burger is TO DIE FOR. SO GOOD. Their shakes are really good as well. However the bathrooms are kind of strange, the lines can be long, and their pizzas are a bit greasy."}
{"text":"This place is good. I love the outdoor seating. Dogs playing in the dog play areas. Farm view. Great food. Lots of seating."}
{"text":"we love this place, great food, they have gluten free, fries (yummy)  actually best fries in town,   shakes are yummy, beet salad, burgers, what can i say.  yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been going since it opened. I go after I take the dogs to Cosmo dog park down the street...  The grilled Peanut Butter, chocalte chip, strawberry is yummy..You get your dinner & dessert in 1 item!!!  The sweet potato fries are better the Delux.  The salads are really good & filing The cheese pizza is great The 4B burger is what a fewof my friends hae gotten & love it!!! The place is great if your in or near Gilbert. You can sit in or out, its dog friendly outside, you can walk around & see were your veggies just came from, & you can enjoy a cup o joe afterwards....They also have Farmers Markets....   Well my Bday was friday & @ Joes your meal is free..I didnt get to go Friday, but went saturday after the dog park & they honored my free dinner....kinda cool"}
{"text":"Great menu choices, delicious food, fun and comfortable atmosphere, and extremely nice employees! I highly recommend eating here. There is also a very nice cat who hangs out outside :)"}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill.  I went again last month for my birthday lunch.  Once again I got the BBQ bacon bleu burger and it did not disappoint.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My daughter always gets the veggie burger and she raves about it.  My boyfriend always gets the ribs and there's never anything left but bones when he's through so I know he enjoys them.    Be prepared to wait in line, but don't be intimidated if you see the line out the door because it does move pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  this food is consistently good.  I do not like the feeling inside the restaurant, but if  it is a nice day, their outdoor tables are great!"}
{"text":"Not really my kind of place but the ladies like it. Always busy they have a lot of fans. Portions are fairly small so big eaters will need to order extras. Prices a bit high for this kind of place its a order at the counter and take out but lots of inside and outside seating"}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit when in AZ!  Great food & fun family environment!  Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit this place after reading the reviews - I ordered the shrimp, Sonoran dogs, and the baby back ribs.  The shrimp was excellent, and this item would be what I recommend people getting.  The Sonoran dogs were fine, grilled bun is an added touch.  But where I think this place really disappointed is the baby back ribs - I would say they were downright lousy.  They were so dry and black that I went back up to the cashier and asked \"is this how your ribs normally are like?\" and the response I got was, \"yes this is because the sauce is on the side\".  I'm a patron of other bbq places in the valley (little ms bbq, famous daves, and even joes bbq) and I'll say hands down this is the worst I've ever had.  I would have been better off buying ribs at the grocery store for $20 and throwing them in the microwave under a wet paper towel in a brown paper bag.  Do yourself a favor and skip this item if you visit."}
{"text":"I always enjoy dining at Joe's Farm Grill. The quality of ingredients is obvious. My personal favorites are the Fontina Burger and the Chicken Pesto Sandwich. The beef and chicken are flavorful and not dry. If the weather permits, eat outside. I do like eating indoors, but it's hard to find a seat sometimes, and the flies fly in every time someone opens the outside doors."}
{"text":"My hubs and I went here for our anniversary and it was great! Inexpensive and a fun atmosphere is what we wanted and that's what we got. Absolutely delicious food! Definitely will go back when we visit phoenix again!"}
{"text":"The bbq bacon burger was perfect! The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I had to post a review after watching a regular (in her 80's and wheelchair bound) woman come in after me. The staff new her like a mother  and waited on her like they should. Itwas nice to see the great service. Everyone that worked today was on it!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for breakfast. Suppose eating outside with the smell of manure and those pesky flies add to the experience of having a meal at the farm."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming here. My absolute favorite thing to eat is the Ahi Tuna sandwich, but I've never had a bad meal. Today though, the staff was just above and beyond awesome.  My husband and I came for lunch, and though they wete pretty busy, the line moved quickly. During the wait in line, we saw that there was sweet potato pie available. We ordered it, only to find out that they were out when our order was ready, and it was going to be awhile. They offered to replace it with cheesecake or a refund, and we chose a refund. They were very friendly and accomodating, and gave us a buzzer to come get cash from them when they had it. When they had it all ready, they said they felt bad about inconveniencing us, and could they make us a shake? Honestly, there was no inconvenience in time, and they got us the refund fairly quickly, but I was still so happy with the customer service! We had the best chocolate shake ever! I am just so impressed because I feel like this level of service is so few and far between at places, and its the reason I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I want to start off my saying , we've have always enjoyed coming here. And will continue to come here . My favorite time to come is around the winter time here in Arizona."}
{"text":"I loved it! It's so great to know that not only I am supporting local business, but that it's also a local farm!! On top of that...IT'S DELICIOUS.  The coffee shop right attached to it is an absolute must.  the breakfast items are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Arrived @ 10:50am.   We wanted lunch. So we asked an employee when we arrived if they serve lunch at 11am. We were told yes.   We got in line anticipating at least a 10 minute wait and we were right. So it's after 11:00.   They refused to take our lunch order because they said people behind us in line still wanted breakfast. Well, nobody asked us about what we wanted when we were in line. It's after 11:00 no lunch.   We left pissed. FU Joe."}
{"text":"Mmmm Food was awesome. Loved the restaurant. Friendly people. You order at counter and they have lot of choices.  Will go again when II'm back in area."}
{"text":"Oops, I started this review back in March 2012 and never finished it. At this point, my gf and I have been here about 4 times and will make it a point to come here every time we are in the greater Phoenix area. Gilbert is a cool little town with great food options, our favorite being this place. We have never been here for lunch though, just for breakfast, but next time we go I think we'll have to try it. Our favorite thing on the breakfast menu are the breakfast tacos. I get mine with bacon and my gf gets hers with sausage.  Everything about these tacos is perfect and I especially love the salsa verde. The farm beans on the side are so flavorful, I could have eaten just these! One time we split an order of the apple fritters, which we couldn't finish during breakfast so took with us hiking later that day. Even  The coffee was excellent as well and I can't wait to go back at some point and get a burger or something for lunch. There's always a bit of a line, but it goes really fast and is well worth the wait. It's too bad that this place is a 6 hour drive from southern california, otherwise we'd go there a lot more!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  But the place feels like it needs a good hosing down. Dirty tables, filthy carpet flooring, flies in the dining room, and it smells like a herd of little boys after recess.  The drink station was dirty, straw and fork dispensers filthy...you get the picture.  I know this place gets used HARD by young families, but it's past time to give her good thorough cleaning."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Very affordable.  Delicious food and big serving sizes... Fun bathrooms! Whoda thought!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and great ambiance...just don't like the long line. Avg we've waited in line was 20 minutes and another 10-15min wait for the food. If I am in a hurry with little ones, they can't wait that long so I end up going somewhere else...although I would prefer to come here. Can they redesign the cashier to 2 windows? However, the food is incredible and fresh...and the shakes are amazing!!! Outdoor seating is so fun and refreshing and they serve Dad's rootbeer! My favorite is the ahi sandwhich!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, and it's pretty good.  Fairly standard fare (pancakes, omelettes, etc).  They pride themselves on fresh local ingredients, and you can definitely tell.  It doesn't have that \"processed\" taste that you get at the ubiquitous chains in the Gilbert area.  A tad on the pricey side, but I suppose it's justified given the fresh/organic ingredients (and I'm cheap).    The orange juice is ridiculously overpriced though - $4 for a smallish cup!  Didn't taste that special either.  Save your cash for more of the solid foods.  I like the bathrooms too.  They were playing some weird puppet movie in the bathroom.  How fitting and cool.  Will return for lunch or dinner sometime.  The pizzas and burgers look tasty!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! You must try their onion rings."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill! Food is very fresh and several items are locally grown from Agritopia. The prices are reasonable. There's usually a lunchtime rush, so you may be standing in line for a while around lunchtime, other than that, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came back this weekend after a trip to a farm festival in the area. I have gone vegan since my last review so here is a new update.  Vegans: Eating here is limited. All bread items, including pizza crust, contain dairy or eggs. The buns, I get it. But pizza crust? I don't understand why restaurants feel the need to add milk or eggs to the pizza dough. It doesn't add anything. And I was hoping to try the veggie pizza sans cheese, but no dice. The good thing about being a vegan and eating here is they have an allergen folder, that has the list of ingredients in all of their items. Which was nice. The girl who took our order was super sweet and gave me some options. Which basically includes all of the salads, without meat or cheese, and any of the vinaigrette dressing options.  I opted for the portabello farm salad which was a mixture of fresh veggies (beets, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, carrots, corn) on top of lettuce with a sliced portabello on top. I got the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The good thing about the salads here is you can tell the veggies are really fresh. Everything tasted really good. But the salads are huge!! Which is good because they are expensive. My salad was $10 and I barely finished half of it. So I took it home to eat for lunch today. I also got the sweet potato fries with the pineapple and serrano dipping sauce. Those were also awesome. So you can eat here as a vegan, you choices are just limited. But the cashiers are willing to help find you options, which is nice.  Now for non vegans: My sister got the farm burger with mushrooms added and said it was the best burger shes ever had. My mom had the barbeque pork sandwich and loved that as well. My husband had the portabello burger. The food here is really good. All fresh and delicious.   Suggestions for Joe's: How about looking into some dairy/egg free bread and pizza crust options? Maybe some wheat bread options as well? I would love to come back here and have something other than a salad. Pretty please??"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but there are flies all over the place.  And it takes a super long time to get your food. It's really crowded and busy, making it difficult to find seating.  But clearly it's worth it because everyone goes!  I like that all the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Always great food....never had a compliant. If the line is long that's a good sign. It's worth the wait. Keep it up Joe's!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Gilbert to eat for a family. It is casual, the food is great and has a great outdoor dinning area where the kids can play. It is always busy which is a fantastic sign. It was on diners drive-in and dives and you can definitely see why."}
{"text":"Always delish! We had burgers and I love the flavor and use of veggies grown right on the farm. I'm a local that prefers to support local businesses and JFG never disappoints on good food!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite dinner stop in the east valley. The hamburger and condiments really do taste farm fresh. $10 off on your birthday is what got us there the first time, but the food and laid back environment keep us coming back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were super excited to try this restaurant after seeing it on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. Unfortunately, the day we chose to go to the restaurant, the pizza maker was not working. I wanted to get the BBQ Chicken pizza but I settled for the BBQ Blue cheese burger instead (with sweet potato fries). The burger was great and you could tell the vegetables were fresh. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant in hopes to have that pizza!"}
{"text":"I am so happy for Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, because I would never have found this place without it. I live so far away in Tempe, so I made the drive one day with my girlfriend after she told me all about it. I am so happy I made the trek, because the food was very very good. The place is straight up retro with GI Joes in cases in the bathroom along with Thunderbirds playing on a TV.   The food is great. I personally recommend the BBQ ribs. The full rack comes with cole slaw, french fries, and 2 pieces of garlic flat bread. The rack comes cut in half, with 6 or so ribs per section. What I also recommend is to ask for a side of buffalo sauce. I pour the sauce over the ribs to make them extra spicy (don't knock it until you try it, it tastes great). I would also recommend the Fontina burger and the chicken fingers.   There is more than enough seating inside and outside. Outside seating includes 2 patios along with park type picnic tables. The place is very dog friendly, and expect to see some dogs enjoying themselves just as much as the people.  If it wasn't for the long drive from Tempe, I would go to Joe's much much more."}
{"text":"Really fun place wit GREAT food!! We went here initially because it was featured on Food Network's \"DDD\" and now we go back regularly because because the food is fantastic and the service is aways friendly and efficient. Food that tops the list for us are the fontina burger, the pulled pork sandwich, the fresh beet salad, and all of the grilled pizzas (the veggie pizza is so fresh tasting). The grounds are beautiful and offers a calming atmosphere; almost zen-like. During the cooler months, we like to take a stroll through the garden after brunch/lunch/dinner. Joe's is high on our list of places to take visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Joe's BBQ, and Joe's Farm Grill is okay, but not the best.    First, the physical facility, while quaint and has some nice history behind it, is just uncomfortable and very oddly organized (drink stations outside, other things inside).  The trash cans suck royally.  While I can appreciate the effort to drive recycling, having a trash can that has shapes for everything is just dumb.  It results in piles of trash near the entry of them and not good for when you take a tray full of garbage to the can only to have to find a place to set it down to sort.  Food -- good.  I think the burger and the pizza are probably my favorite here.  Oddly you'd expecte more carryover from Joe's BBQ as far as BBQ options, but there isn't -- didn't bother me though.  Sweet potatoe fries are great as is the dipping sauce that comes with it.  Shakes when in season with fresh berries are yum.  Desserts sound better than they are, so I'd pass and head to Nielson's if you want a dessert instead.  As a place for larger groups it stinks -- tables are crowded and small.  If you want to sit outside that may be fine, but the huge trees sometimes attract unwanted insects :-).  Overall okay if you are in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"We went to Joe's while we were visiting family in AZ.  The atmosphere is great!!  there is limited indoor seating and extensive outdoor seating that is shaded.  The burgers were awesome.  The sweet potato fries and onion rings are a must when you go here.  They have a great kids menu, my son's pizza was delicious.  Really big portions!  We went with a party of 6 and everyone was satisfied with the menu and their meals."}
{"text":"I can only give 3 stars due to the amount of flys and bugs that we constantly had to wave away from our food, and we even stayed inside. The food is more than 5 stars, and it does seem they are trying their best to combat the flys....  Maybe their food is just that good that even the flys come from all over the valley to dine!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fresh food restaurants I've ever been to! I've never had the breakfast here until 2 weeks ago when I brought my dad and uncle and we all got the waffles and ribs. Never heard or even thought about this combination for breakfast but we went for it anyway and loved it! Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town. The food is always super good. Line can be very long at lunch time."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings as I write this review as half of our order was very good without any complaints but the other part was nothing to write home about.  My wife ordered the veggie burger while I ordered the baby back ribs.  The ribs were good but her burger was burnt to a crisp, almost to a point where it was bitter and inedible.  We returned the order and they offered to make another one, however it was inconvenient as we were not able to enjoy the meal as a family while she waited for her food to get done again.  The fries were loaded with salt, perhaps to compensate for the bland burger.  The restaurant itself was very busy so my suggestion to the management/owners would be to focus on quality before quantity.  I can not comment on service as most of it was self service. The stroll across the street to the farm was nice.  We enjoyed looking at many plants/fruit trees and herbs."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to take your family and sit on the grassy area, food was good, everyone was so friendly I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"WOW Incredible BBQ Chicken pizza and Great Milkshakes Neat unigue enviornment something different!!!"}
{"text":"I love that place!  I had the sweet potato pancakes and they were superb.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that the food is so good, it takes me forever to decide what to order!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a welcoming atmosphere. The portions are big, enough to take home left overs. I recommend their onion rings and sweet potato fries. Their burgers are huge, but I'm not complaining    The only down fall are the flies that roam around the restaurant. The company really needs to control that problem because getting them away takes a lot of work and ruins the dinner for most people."}
{"text":"Luv, luv, luv this restaurant!  Fresh food, great atmosphere, friendly service!  Luv the choice of seating in this very clean and colorful establishment!  We visit every time we are in town, especially when they proudly display their \"March Madness\".  Thanks to Guy Fieri for highlighting Joe's Grill on DDD!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill in Agritopia is Amazing.  I've been there Twice now.  A bit of a Drive East, but worth it for the food and atmosphere. Today we had the 4B burger, Farm burger and the homemade caramel pecan shake.  My 4B burger was outstanding with just the right texture and flavor.  I dipped it in the ranch dip they have and it was awesome.  My gal loved her Farm burger as well and said that the Beef was delicious and could tell it was fresh and the grill flavor was great.  Then the Shake... it's like a creamy delicious piece of Pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. Joe's is at this old farm land site and has these quaint gardens around the Grill surrounded by the Farm fields and the Neighborhoods of Agritopia. If you're in the not in the East Valley then I definitely suggest it's worth the drive.  If you're in the East Valley and haven't been, get off you're tush."}
{"text":"Only been once, we had an excellent burger and chicken sandwich. Very fun atmosphere and a beautiful setting if you want to sit outside. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"love this place always  use the Beaver mustard bottle with your burger!"}
{"text":"The Ahi Tuna sandwich was phenomenal. If you really like garlic get the garlic fries. I highly recommend Joe's. All 4 of us were very happy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They never disappoint me. Food is fresh. Burgers are awesome. One good this about this place is that its really family oriented. My son loves to play out side on their patio."}
{"text":"Excellent food... super fresh. Saw on Triple D so decided to give it a try and it was worth the hype! Large menu, lots of indoor and outdoor seating, friendly staff, and great location! A must-try if you're in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go on a nice day.  Even if the weather isn't good, its still a great place to go.  There isn't a whole lot of seating inside, but there is enough for a good amount of people.  However I don't think Joe wants us to eat inside :)  .    What I really like about this place is their setup.  It's different than anything that you have seen before, and just for that it becomes an enjoyable place.    There food is good too,  now I have only eaten there once, so I can only comment on the food I had (the Pulled Pork Sandwich).  It was actually really good.  From other places, ordering the same thing, you sometimes get so much bbq sauce that you cant taste the pork.  Not at Joes Farm Grill :) Their normal fries are good, but next time I will have to try the other varieties.    Overall, Good Food, Great Atmosphere and I will go back.  I recommend anyone to go there if you are in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"We decided to swing by Joe's Farm Grill for lunch on a Saturday, after seeing it featured on DDD. Funny, it was literally down the street from where I used to live...I had driven by it many times, and never noticed it.  Joe's is situated in a unique futuristic-like building, next to a little cafe/coffee shop on the same property. Once inside Joe's, we were able to order pretty quickly despite the crowd. I had bbq chicken pizza, which was fantastic! My fiance had one of their burgers, which I had a few bites of. Both meals were very tasty, fresh, and light. Although it was a little on the spendy side, it was worth it because everything was obviously fresh and healthier than your average eatery.  We really enjoyed our lunch and checking out the grounds, and I hate to complain, but I did have 2 questions. First, the restroom set-up was strange (only 1 restroom, in which you have to wait in line for outside), and you have to go outside to get drink refills...next to the lone restroom (which was strange to me). Just a funky set-up. But otherwise, the visit was great, and we will be back for another meal and visit to their coffee shop."}
{"text":"Long lines but worth the wait!  Have the tuna burger and a great expresso milkshake...picnic table and really good service staff."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The place was awesome. Great ambiance and incredibly fresh tasty food. The place has a really cool vibe and was super charming. The orange trees were blossoming so it felt like a warm night in So Cal, w/o the Smog.   I had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of slaw and the table shared a standard portion of rosemary onion rings. The food was great!!! My buddies had the burger w/brie cheese (I think) and they liked it too.  If you want good food, at happening spot where the locals go, this is the place."}
{"text":"Can I just plus one for a places already adored by yelp?   For a perfect winter day in az, this is the perfect out door place. I had several things on he menu because it was fat day.   Two hot dog combo: Sonora dog and BBQ dog.   Sonora was excellent, though mine didn't come with bacon. Baked camp beans piled high on kosher beef with cheese and jalapeños. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and an especially good lobster role fried to perfection. Second was a pulled pork: exactly as it sounds. Pork was a tad dried out, but not big deal.   The day we went, they were running Super Bowl specials. Seattle special (go hawks) was a seared salmon sandwich. This is the first place we had salmon that was 1. Pacific and 2. Not cooked to oblivion leaving behind gum textured fish swimming in its own oil. Absolutely fantastic.   Lastly, there was a shake with ground up chocolate covered espresso beans. Best shake I have had.   Again, go hawks. I could think of a no more annoying fan base than Bostonians drowning on about the \"pah-trah-aits\"."}
{"text":"There's a new GM in town. She comes out and announces the specials that have always been on the screens, but she personally invites you to try them. It's fun and delicious."}
{"text":"It's clean; the food is well cooked, the atmosphere is trendy and quaint.  It's in a great location for locals."}
{"text":"Did a project at agritopia and decided to eat here. The food was really good but it was pricey....but hey it is organic and local. Would come back."}
{"text":"What a great place!  We hit Joe's last week one evening when the temperature was downright pleasant for outdoor dining.  I had the Sonoran dogs, which were great, the bacon could have been crisper for my liking, but a very well done dog!  My wife had the buffalo chicken, and loved it.  We had a kids grilled pepperoni pizza that my toddler refused to eat ( instead going for the star of the meal my garlic fires).  I can say the kids pizza was quite good!  Oh and the milkshakes, oh the milkshakes!!  So yummy and delicious.  The setting was great, the service was excellent, and the food was crafted by people who cared about what they were serving.  I can't wait for the temperature to drop so we can go back!!"}
{"text":"This sustainable restaurant is located in a very nice rural area. Got the double Sonoran/Carolina dog combo. Very tasty. If you come on a weekend night expect a hefty wait. The prices are decent, but definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part.  The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly (definitely family oriented, with a lot of outdoor seating).  Out of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome (although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste).   The only downside is that this place is always packed  (or at least the two times that I have been here).  It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door.  Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into (sort of wish they had an express line for desserts).   Oh, and check out their restroom for a weird/funny surprise."}
{"text":"Flies EVERYWHERE! Great food but it's ruined the instant you get it because there are flies CONSTANTLY landing on your food. They have a serious fly problem. My advice is get it to go because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Great fresh food nice people fun atmosphere. Weekends are incredibly busy, if you're a first timer go during the week or pack a crossword."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say....I have tried so many items here and they have all been fresh and amazingly delicious! Great relaxed atmosphere, wonderful place to bring kiddos and just hang out with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place! My old reliables are the Portabella Farm Salad with green goddess dressing (YUM) and the Fontina Burger with garlic fries (YUMMMM). The salmon plate is also really good (that coleslaw tho.) I really need to try some other things on the menu but it's so hard to break away from my faves!   I love taking a little turn around the farm afterwards. This place is such a treasure to our city."}
{"text":"Finally fresh food that's fast and fairly affordable! I've been lucky to eat at Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert in the past, which has given me pretty high expectations of any of Joe's food ventures. The Farm Grill did not disappoint.   I ordered the Jumbo Fried Shrimp and the hubs got the Farm Burger. My basket came filled with ginormous jumbo tiger shrimp fried to perfection, homemade cocktail sauce, coleslaw, fries, and garlic flat bread. I'm not big on slaw, but Joe's was good. Very fresh. The shrimp and cocktail sauce were absolutely delicious as well as the garlic flat bread. I substituted the fries for garlic fries and I thought that I had reached heaven.   Hubby's Farm Burger was THE freshest, juiciest burger that I've ever tasted. Add a little of Joe's BBQ sauce and you're good to go.   I loved the pneumatic condiment dispensers, I thought it was the bees knees.   I cannot wait to go back to Joe's for my next food adventure. I would (and have) recommend it to my friends and any body out there who is looking for food that is fresh, local, and just plain divine."}
{"text":"I am so appreciating that I live close to this restaurant! I came here yesterday and then I decided to start from the first one on the menu until I finish them all! Amazing !"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her free birthday meal. She got breakfast tacos and loved them. I got a Belgian waffle with a side of bacon and skillet potatoes. Best waffle I've ever had!!!!! So sweet & fluffy. I'm a picky eater too. The root beer is amazing too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST strawberry lemonade! Cute little place to go to for lunch/dinner, date night, or just because!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times, and the food is good. But recently the fly problem has been out of control! The sheer number of flies buzzing around you and your food ruins it. Sitting inside vs. outside didn't seem to make a difference. We had to keep waving our hands around and even keep our food moving to keep them off of us and our food.  I know it's a \"farm\" grill, and farms have lots of flies, but can't they do something more about it? Whatever they are doing isn't working.  We will probably only pick up food here in the future, but may not even do that. For all the flies we saw, how many didn't we see back in the food preparation area?"}
{"text":"I adore this place!  Never even heard of Agritopia or Joe's Farm Grill, I was taken to this sweet, little hideaway on a sunny Saturday afternoon. The drive out is fun because you see lots of farmland, which is a nice scene away from the desert landscape. Tucked away on some very rich farmland, Joe's building is so futuristic and well-built into this ocmmunity that I could not stop just admiring the structure itself.  A pretty popular place for families on a Saturday afternoon, the line to roder was a bit long but worth it. Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives visited a few years back, and all of Guy's favs are highlighted on the menu. Flatscreens and projectors have slides of all the best foods to roder while you're waiting. The also sell YooWoo, so naturally I give this place 5 stars.   I orded the BBQ Pork Sandich and my friends ordered a pizza and the onion rings.  THE ONIION RINGS ARE CAPITOL K KRUNCHY. And you must order them. With everything grown locally, basically a stone's throw away from Joe's, the food was so fresh and well made. A tad pricey but worth it.   I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is always a treat. Their salads, burgers, pizzas, and milkshakes are always made well and are wonderfully satisfying. I usually go for the Ahi Salad, which is perfectly crisp and refreshing. As a bonus, they have a very friendly orange and black cat there that is a pro at hospitality, I'm always sure to save her a piece of ahi for being so sweet."}
{"text":"Went down to Phoenix to visit my in-laws and I suggested this establishment because both of them grew up on farms. We had read the reviews and decided on a late lunch, meaning nearly 2 on a Wednesday afternoon. There was no real wait to speak of, nothing like I expected and nothing more than I typically find in some of our favorite spots back home. My wife got a huge Thai chicken salad easily enough for two to share, father in-law was pleased with the shrimp plate, mother in-law had the bbq pork and also could have shared I felt it would have been a good size. My kids had grilled cheese and corn dog basket, one had sweet potato fries and they were tasty, the other regular fries, I had the veggie burger which is a huge patty of black beans and other veggies with onion rings, I went home stuffed!   Wide range of fountain drinks and some bottles of soda and water when you walk in, but the fresh squeezed lemonade is a must in the hot Phoenix sun, or the tasty chocolate milkshake will do as well.   Behind the main entrance we found a nice patio with plenty of shade, and a nice cafeteria style setting.   The neighboring coffee shop had plenty of sweets (unfortunately we spoiled that by having a milkshake) and coffee options. Again can't speak to the sweets but the coffee was good, nothing special but a nice little cup of joe after a good meal."}
{"text":"When I first moved here 7 years ago, many of my coworkers raved about this place called \"Joes Farm Grill\", so I went after a few months of prodding. I've lived all over the country, and grew up in Texas, so I'm used to a good grill. This place feels like family and is very touristy, but overall, I have to say waiting in the line was not worth all the hype. I brought my parents here when they came to visit and they were impressed with the ambiance, but not the food as much. Because there are so few local places to eat in Gilbert, I think that's what makes it so popular. I also have to say, I was VERY disappointed to see a news crew when a political candidate came into town to speak there. Truthfully, I think it was rather alienating and politics should remain separate. I think Joes BBQ deserves the 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast food in Gilbert. Their omelettes are humongous and their biscuits and gravy are amazing. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but that is to be expected in a smaller establishment. Little pricey but nice ambiance and friendly staff. Will definitely be visiting here again."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Love coming here during nice weather months where you can sit under a huge tree with shades...kinda like a nice picnic afternoon.  I usually get their chicken tenders with fries!  This is the best and juiciest tenders I've ever had.  It's panko fried tenders, so not too greasy.  Also had their burgers, fried zucchinis, salads, ahi sandwich...all delish!  Don't get the bbq stuff here.  Since I'm comparing it to their other resturant, Joes bbq, it's dry and doesn't taste as fresh.  To top it all their milkshakes are soooo good!  Especially the strawberry one.  You can taste small chunks of strawberries, which I love!  Plan on waiting in line during the busy lunch and dinner hours...especially on the weekends.  It's all worth the drive and wait!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid greasy, american-style burgers & fries, but don't be afraid of Joe's Farm Grill. Yes, they have onion rings, fries, and burgers, but they are so much better than what you are picturing. Nothing tastes old and stale. It all comes out hot and fresh. The building itself is pretty interesting, considering it used to be a home, then it was converted into a business. Be prepared to wait in line, because this place is always busy for lunch and dinner. Finding a spot to sit isn't too hard, but it is another place that has a 'cafeteria style' seating arrangement. I had a grilled cheese the last time I visited, and onion rings. Yummy. I know it's hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but you would be surprised- this one was delicious. I was happy to see that Joe's was on television too. This place really deserves the popularity. The staff is friendly too. Thanks Joe. :-)"}
{"text":"Great location and setting in the middle of suburban sprawl. Love the choices and freshness of the ingredients. Been two times when visiting the Phoenix area. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat!!!! their garlic fries are to die for & they have the best chicken tenders i have ever had!!!!! i honestly wish they had one in ahwatukee because i would go there everyday!!  The only downside is during certain times, the lines are way too long! they either need to make ordering for efficient or have more cash registers."}
{"text":"Simple food made great with quality ingredients. Ahi tuna sandwich, sweet potato fries, fried green beans with garlic butter and a milk shake is a MUST!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came hire for the first time. The line was long to get in, the food was well worth the wait. I would recommend ordering the cheesecake first. The cheesecake was what I would say is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, they have amazing food and amazing service. Really great energy"}
{"text":"first the soda/drink fountain is outside,and when you walk in no signs or anything to tell you where to place and order,menus are in a basket next to the \"ordering window\" small drinks cups so you have to go back over and over again for drinks,overprices food that is not that good,will not good back for this type of food or the price of it"}
{"text":"Even though you will more than likely have to stand in a decent line to order, it's always worth the wait! The food is great, the outdoor grassy area with large picnic tables are so charming, and it is so pet and kid friendly!  Love the burgers and pizza! Have heard awesome things about the bbq too! So much fun for my nieces to run around after eating. There will more than likely be an abundance of kids playing together as it's almost like picnicking at a park when you come here for lunch.  Overall such a unique, delicious and charming place, bravo!"}
{"text":"The line is usually long, but the service is friendly and the food is amazing!!  Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a great place to take a family and eat outside, picnic style!  The BBQ pork sandwich is HUGE and was probably the best I've had and the garlic fries were amazing!  One of us had the shrimp and said it was some of the best shrimp he's ever had!  Between the atmosphere and the food, this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Who doesnt love this place??   Been coming back over and over for years.....GOOD JOB!!!   Deep fried green beans are the best!!!"}
{"text":"My brother and sister in law suggested we go here for an amazing burger...delicious and definitely not an ordinary ole burger. I had the onion rings and sweet potato pie, both were wonderful. The onion rings seemed slightly overcooked but otherwise good. Shakes are great and atmosphere was perfect for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to dinner at Joes. We have been here several time and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  However, this time was not so good. My daughter order the bbq sampler. The ribs were cold and the chicken was over cooked and soggy. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich. That was cooked nicely and good but my sweet potatoe fry's  were cold and not crispy at all. We have had better times at Joe's.  We will give them a pass and try again to see if they can do better next time."}
{"text":"Every time I have eaten here I've been completely satisfied.  Their food is amazing.  my favorite has to be the ribs, but everything is spot on. Service is great,  and the atmosphere is laid back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab breakfast in the East valley. The lunch is great too. However, those blueberry pancakes can't be beat! It's always busy and once you eat there, you'll know why. I love Joe's!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, the menu is diverse...enough, and the line moves very quickly. The food was definitely worth the wait. They had old school sodas, signage and a family feel. I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Drove across the valley to go here today and was disappointed.  Got the rib's and BBQ pork for lunch. The BBQ pork was good but not amazing like i had heard form so many people. But the rib's were dry and had way to much black pepper in the sauce for my taste. Maybe I just got a bad batch of rib's on an off day, I dunno. Also the line took forever and they only had one person working the window.  Over all not worth the drive from Ahwatukee. Should have went to their other restaurant Joe's Real BBQ."}
{"text":"Best food ever, for a great price! Owner always comes out and says hello, love this place!"}
{"text":"VERY cool and tasty place. Went for lunch and unfortunately they were still serving breakfast but it was delicious regardless. Waffles and ribs and breakfast tacos were ordered and devoured. Atmosphere is so fun and family friendly."}
{"text":"Had the pecan pesto chicken sandwich, the meat was so bland! The worse was spending $10 on that ..came w some cold fries, we ordered fried zucchini nothing special about it"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. The burgers are fantastic, big fan of the barbecue bacon bleu burger. Don't forget to hit them up on your birthday for ten bucks off your meal."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers here! They also have a really good breakfast. This a stand in line cafeteria style restaurant. Limited indoor seating but plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Don't order the fried zucchini slices, you can't taste the zucchini at all, it is basically just eating panko."}
{"text":"We love this place!  They are generally always busy so plan on a wait.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  During the summer the misters are on outside but it's still hot.  The food is awesome!!!  We have never had the same thing twice and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Super tasty and fresh. I love the outside environment and that they are dog friendly. The food is AMAZING yet simple. The seared tuna sandwhich and garden salad are my favorite. Chocolate milkshakes are delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Usually love Joe's Farm Grill, not so much this visit.  Ordered the onion rings, they were so over cooked they were inedible. (Is that a word?  It is now). Would have complained however, we took our food to go.  Most likely will never order them again."}
{"text":"Nice family environment, FREE food on birthdays Over all good service. Just not my favorite place to eat. If your looking for relaxed fast food it's good. I only go when it's a family birthday."}
{"text":"Not real impressed.   Our first visit and we certainly expected more.   Burgers are good, along with the onion rings.   Salad are of good proportion but dressing are not good at all.   Very watered down and no flavor.   Same with some of the condiments.  We like ranch with fried zuccini.  The ranch was so watered down that it had no taste.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"What a treat.  We made the trip out to Tempe for Spring training and researched the restaurants on DDD.  Didn't have much time and could only try one place and settled on Joe's.  What a treat!  I had the BBQ Bacon Blue Cheee Burger...Amazing.  My DH had the BBQ chicken Pizza.  Both were nicely flavored, not overwhelming but done perfectly.  We had a few sides...Baked Potato Fries and Onion rings.  Tasty.  Not overly greasy and great flavor.  We sat outside under lovely fragrant citrus trees as the sun set.  If it wasn't for the idiot children climbing the trees and throwing the lovely fruit against anything they could find...it would have been perfect a perfect night. But Kudos to the staff for stepping in and doing the job of the horrible parents .  They were asked not to climb the trees and told they could only take fruit they could reach.  After wandering around the property and snapping a few pictures we made our way back for some rice pudding and hot fudge sundae.  Had 2 bites of the rice pudding just to try it but not impressed.  Overly seasoned with cinnamon, but not bad.  The toasted pecans on the ice cream were magnificent and the chocolate sauce wasn't amazing, but something about it hit the spot and we enjoyed it.  I wouldn't go back for dessert, but the atmostphere & menu has made it's way into my top 10 restaurants of all time.  I'd almost drive 5 hours again just for dinner.  But we'll be back next year.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been to Joe's farm grill a few times now, and every time I fall in love with their food. No complaints here, good burgers, good fries and good chocolate shakes."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place... especially the free meal on my birthday each year :) You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great selection of fan favorite foods. The milk shakes are thick and rich. The line can get long during the dinner rush, but I think that is a testament to the quality. Good things are worth the wait. I enjoyed the BBQ pulled pork."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great, and super fresh! Nothing beats the atmosphere either! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stayed in Gilbert this past weekend and after reading other Yelp reviews Joe's Farm Grill was in my list for food to be had while there.  The menu is large so our large party all easily found something they liked.  I had the ahi tuna sandwich with a side salad and it was DELICIOUS.  The tuna was cooked perfectly and the side salad was fresh and was not your standard iceburg lettuce salad.  Two other members of the party got the Farm Burger which looked bomb (I had a bite of one and it WAS).  It was 110°+ and all of the indoor seats were taken (a busy eatery to me is always a good sign) so we had to sit out back at one of the many picnic tables.  It was located under a large tree which provided shade and there was a breeze so when eating the delicious food I heard no complaining and had zero complaints myself (EXCEPT, I checked out the breakfast menu and wanted to return to try the breakfast tacos but sadly I could not)...until next time"}
{"text":"Food is good and they have some creative twist on traditional grill food. It may take some time to get through the line, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Price:  200% of what you'd expect to pay.  We had 5 people and the bill was about $75.  Pretty stunning.  Service:  Excellent, and the entire process makes you feel like the feeding cattle that you are.  The rope lines for ordering, and the self-service condiment bar are reminders that you can help yourself, although we will charge you more than retail price.  I'm not sure why Guy Fieri thought this was a good place to go, since families could never afford to eat at prices like this.  Taste:  is very good, and the portions will keep you longing for more.  I don't know why restaurants keep trying to mimic a Scottsdale-like theme and a Scottsdale-like price.  Please listen-- we don't need fancy places with sky-high prices that keep working-man families away.  We need low-priced, good food with college-kid-type prices.  Please let the Scottsdale-type prices die."}
{"text":"Loving this local spot. Fresh food, family business and super kid friendly. Always take my out of town guests here!!!"}
{"text":"I think the food was good, just pricey but very large potions. Perhaps smaller portions, cheaper menu?"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing, but I've had better Asian chicken salad. I love the fact of supporting local businessed and getting your produce straight from your local farm! Thanks for the awesome service too! I'll be back when I'm craving a juicy fresh burger and that amazing side of pineapple dip for my sweet potato fries! Thank you Joe's Farm Grill!!!"}
{"text":"Had BBQ Sampler, Fontina Burger w/ beet salad. It cost me $26. Everything was extremely mediocre. Ribs were too smoky, the breaded chicken smothered in BBQ sauce tastes ok, and the pulled pork was nothing to write home about. The fontina burger was meh, you could only taste the pesto and the mushrooms. Beet salad wasn't very good, it was pretty ok. The best thing that I had was the 3 onion rings that came with my BBQ sampler. If I come here again, I'll get an order of onion rings and a milkshake.    Great ambience w/ picnic tables, outdoor seating, and misters."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat and enjoy local ingredients.  Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is super casual!  It's in a beautiful location of Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for an organic, unique, and historical restaurant? Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit.  Joes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients.  Joes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit.   First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else.  The most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice.  I enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want."}
{"text":"This is the kinda place you drive 30+ mins to go to.   Was that a good opener? I thought so. Anyway, I made a new friend in Gilbert and I live in Uptown Phx but wanted to go to her hood to hang out and save her the drive. So I looked up some good places to eat via Mouth by Southwest and low and behold I found this gem and knew I had to go.  We both got Fontina Burgers, which were amazing. She had the tasty onion rings as a side and I got myself some Asian slaw, both were awesome. I loved my strawberry lemonade more than most people should like any beverage.   I've been trying to get my friend to move up to Phx, where all the action is, but there's one thing she's got that we don't: Joe's Farm Grill. That should be her claim to fame down there. I will be visiting her more often and can't wait to try more things on the menu. Next up, BBQ Chicken Pizza?"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!!! This place is always packed do that speaks for itself. Make sure you grab a milkshake on your way out."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 or 3 times, and the big reason is that I live about 5 minutes from Joe's. To be honest, I have to say this up front. DON'T BUY THE HYPE!!! There are some people who go on here and gush about this place like its the second coming (and seeing how the area is like the bible belt of the phoenix area, its something they are used to). The food is good, but never great. I can name a number of places i have had better burgers, fries, sandwiches, etc. all in the east valley. The big kick is that it is all fresh, but it doesn't have that \"oh wow\" fresh taste that i've gotten from other \"fresh\" restaurants.  The food is not bad though, I enjoy it though the price doesn't justify average food when you can drive a block or two down and get an In N Out burger for 2 bucks. The \"old house\" decor is also fairly fun and unique and do give points for that. I would recommend going to Joe's BBQ well before recommending Joe's farm grill."}
{"text":"This place has the best bbq chicken pizza and garlic fries! The only downfall is that it is so far away from Tempe. I have yet to find a better place to eat at a reasonable price. You must try it and I promise you won't regret it! Can't wait to see you again joe's farm grill!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. But, they really must rethink their coffee sevice system. It does not work when they are busy. Which is most of the time."}
{"text":"Joe's is:  * dog and kid friendly * super cute with a great outdoor area  * good, fresh food for you.  Their chicken is antibiotic and hormone free and they grow many of their own veggies * busy, but not crowded I've eaten at both Joe's locations, and I prefer this one."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill more and more with each visit. It's one of those places where I find everything I get delicious, and I am constantly craving.  They tend to be busy, but it's well worth the wait, I promise. There's a very relaxed atmosphere with seating inside and out. The outside seating is especially nice if you have kids (like my cousins) who enjoy running all over the place and doing what kids do best- adding a little extra excitement to any family outing.  When it comes to the food.. where do I begin.. burgers are slabs of thick patties grilled to juicy perfection on a toasted bun. Their Southwest Burger is my personal favorite. It has a nice little kick, but I added some of the hot sauce available at the drink/condiment station because I like my food to the point of unbearably spicy (it's a curse, really.)  Pizzas are the bomb. Crusts are thin, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and covered in a mound of sauce, cheese, and toppings. In my attempts to be healthy I get their vegetable one, and even my picky sisters will eat it because it's just that good. Only odd thing I'll mention is they sprinkle fresh basil on top, which causes me to get migraines from a strange allergy, so if you suffer from the same weird disease I have be sure to ask they omit the garnish.  I am dying for their grilled wedge salad as I write this. I've heard of wedge salads before, but this one is grilled and that makes all the difference. It's plain, simple, and divine. Be sure to squeeze the lemon over it for that extra tangy-ness to cut away from the richness of the dressing and bacon.  Thai Chicken Salad was on point. Only I didn't realize it was garnished with basil leaves until it was too late, and there was no way to successfully separate the basil leaves from the rest of my salad. I don't have that kind of patience. Once again, if you dislike fresh basil, ask for it's removal. It would've been perfect had I done that.  Last thing I'll write a review on is their Medjool Date Shake. Personally, it's one of my favorite shakes. I've never heard of such a thing until I went here, and I enjoyed it so much I now try to fashion my smoothies after it (once again, my healthy attempts). It's not so thick that I have to give my cheeks a workout just to get it up the straw, but not so think that I feel like I'm drinking milk. My dad is weird about textures and wasn't a fan of the pieces of dates in the shake, but I thought it made the shake better. Just personal preference.   They do free meals on your birthday if you show them your license or kids' birth certificate. Best deal ever,.  This concludes my raving of Joe's Farm Grill, for tonight at least."}
{"text":"Great spot to sit and enjoy the outdoors while having dinner with family/friends. food is great a wide selection for any taste buds."}
{"text":"Unique, fun, delicious and affordable food in a cozy setting. The portobello mushroom sandwich was unbelievably tender and filling and the kids meals offered far more options than I would have expected. A+ all around!"}
{"text":"Great food by one of the nicest folks I have ever had the joy to meet.  My husband is a scooter aficionado as is Joe, and that's how we came to eat here.  Not only is the food delicious, we have never been mistreated by the staff.  We have even ventured into other establishments owned by Joe and had the same wonderful experience.  Yummy yum yum."}
{"text":"I had high expectations with the line out the door. Maybe the other food is good but the lamb burger was completely dried out, the Greek sauce on top was a joke it was disgusting with huge chunks of onion and no flavor, the bun was flavorless as well maybe skip their specialties and stick with the common menu."}
{"text":"A local gem down on the farm! Ahi tuna sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"Food is good, but overpriced for what you get. It's basically an outside cafeteria...which is okay if you're aren't paying top prices."}
{"text":"Cute and nice environment. Seating in inside and out. Employees are friendly and upbeat. Food is Great! Fontina burger -Excellent! Garlic Fries - Amazing but not worth $5.00, Butter Pecan Shake - the best shake I ever tasted but pricey as well at $4.49 for about 8 to 10 ounces.  Today, My party consisted of 3. My 2 toddlers and I, the bill was $31.54. My order consisted of: 2 grill cheese meal substituted regular fried for  garlic fries ($2.00 extra) on one, Ahi Tuna sandwich and one diet coke. 29.26 plus tax 2.28. Although it was delicious once again, wont be a regular spot as I eat out on a Regular. Wish they has Specials!  Enjoy as you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The cashier refused to take our lunch order when we were in line and showed up at 11am. We waited 22 minutes in line for her to take our order and she refused until 12 more people ordered breakfast.  We told the manager and all he said was I can get burgers started for you. Not worth it....if they can't do what they promise! I wouldn't give this 1 star!"}
{"text":"Always good food, and beautiful grounds-- at every season!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I got a hamburger and fries. The fries are the kind you find in the frozen section of a grocery store and weren't that great. Neither was the burger. The next time I went I got a pulled pork samdwhich and still wasn't impressed. They were just lacking good flavors and were mostly just bland. The interior was nice though and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Joe's has a fun outdoor venue where families can bring kids and let them run around a little in the grass.  The burgers are great and we've liked the chicken and pizza as well."}
{"text":"Great venue and burgers. We dat outside and ate in the picnic tables.  They also gave us a free dessert that day... excellent experience if youre in the Gilbert area!"}
{"text":"Best food this side of town. Everything is amazing. My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich with their ice tea. All there food is gotten there or local. Fresher food than the grocery store."}
{"text":"$2.75 for 12 oz cup of coffee because it's a special blend got to be kidding me. Hipsters will buy anything. Overall the food is decent and well priced outside of the cup of gold they sell for $2.75. Best features is the seating outside. Note the people this place attracts can't control their kids, couldn't survive if their cell phone died, or will not last the first three days in a zombie apocalypse. Makes a nice breakfast turn into a should I have come here."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. The cool architecture and amazing lawn with picnic tables for eating give the perfect casual vibe. Great place for a large family or a group to meet. I've tried several menu items and while the food is made well and tastes good, I've never found anything I absolutely have to come back for. And since there is usually a wait, I wish I could find that one item to be excited about ordering. Still, I would recommend trying Joes Farm Grill."}
{"text":"Experienced Joe's Farm Grill after seeing the mention on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Glad I went and experienced what this establishment offers.  I had the ahi tuna sandwich and sweet potato fries!  Their breakfast is also amazing!  Diners can eat for free on their birthday, with proof of identity!  Indoors or out, its a great tresure tucked in a corner of Gilbert, where Agritopia is the word of the day, everyday!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hype around this place. Yes it was on TV, but so what?   Each time I go I am disappointed by something. For example, the salmon is typically undercooked and lacking seasoning. I love salmon so I tried it a few times hoping it would improve, but it didn't. Last time, instead of salmon I ordered a grilled wedge salad. It was covered in oil which made it inedible.   They also almost always mess something up in our take out order. Usually it is something small like giving us regular fries instead of garlic fries, but hey, we pay extra for the garlic! It is frustrating.    In my opinion, the food at the Coffee Shop next door is much better."}
{"text":"I love Joes Farm Grill for its family-friendly vibe. The food is pretty good and the outdoor seating is mostly comfortable. Parents love it became kids can play outside while eating. Their sodas are innovative with unusual flavors. I wish they had some nonsweet options, though. I come here fairly often with my kids and grand kids."}
{"text":"We went to Joe's Farm Grill to celebrate my daughter's 22nd birthday. We wanted to try something different and fun. It was easy to find (although a good 30 minute drive for us) and when we arrived for lunch there was a line out the door. Menus were conveniently located as you wait in the line however and the line moved fairly quickly which we were happy about. Turns out it was worth the wait! We all ordered something different and everything that we had was really delicious. Fontina hamburger- yum! Sweet potatoe fries- major yum! Fried zuchinni and green beans- loved! The pizza is also delicious and the ingrediants in the chicken salad were so fresh and crisp- nothing but oohs and aahs from the crowd of us. The lemonade (both regualr and strawberry are huge and so delicious as well). We had enough leftovers to feed us at dinnertime and my daughter's meal was free as it was her birthday- that was a very pleasant surprise. We sat outside on a picnic table under a huge old tree that gave us shade and a perfect view of the farm in the distance. We strolled the farm afterwards and had a thoroughly enjoyable lunch! Nothing but praise for this place."}
{"text":"Fun to hang out, just wish the menu reflected more of a farm to table style.  The meat is not grassfed/ pasture raised - huge bummer!  No organic chicken, food fried in vegetable/canola oil.  There's also little to no gluten Free options!  I just think the quality of the ingredients could be  A LOT better.  Not recommended for celiacs."}
{"text":"Tried Joes on a recommendation from friends. Definitely a delicious lunch. Love the BBQ! I would return."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Long lines and on weekend nights long wait times.  Usually worth it.  My favorites so far are the fontina burger and the pizzas.  The fries are also quite good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Joe's! Best burger I've had in Arizona. I always order the Fontina burger with the garlic fries. Soooo amazing. I also enjoy all the outdoor space, as does my dog :). Be warned, the line can get very long and out the door. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Joe's Farm Grill on a recent outing to Arizona.  The food is very good and I love the outdoor seating area.  I got the BBQ pulled pork which is very good when mixed with the included coleslaw.  The fries were excellent, cooked to perfection and retaining the potato flavor that so many other fries are lacking.  The prices are decent and I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and I needed to try Joe's Farm Grill after I saw it on DDD. We tried the Cheeseburger and Onion Rings. I think the burger was the best burger I have ever eaten, it had that great char-grilled flavor that I love in a burger and the size was more than I could eat. They also have a condiment bar with more choices than I could even imagine. The onion rings were the best I have ever eaten also. They had a great breading with a hint of Rosemary..yummy! Everybody's food around us looked great too..I doubt there is a bad item on the menu. It's so good we were contiplating driving out of our way to hit it before we went to the airport. Well worth a trip, you will return!"}
{"text":"This place consummated with the Golden Goose being featured on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. It's overrated. If you think this place is worth standing in line and waiting for your food for an hour on the weekend, then you easily fall for hype. The inside is really small and couldn't be any louder, it also has scattered outside picnic tables. After you order you get to wait in another line to get a drink on a single fountain area. The food is above average. I think the salads are borderline bad. I realize it's all organic and local, I've been to plenty of places like that, and most of them are far better."}
{"text":"The food here is beyond amazing which is why I was so excited to bring my husband and kids here. What completely ruined our experience was the fact that we were standing in line for over an hour when the line was out the door and they only had one teller functioning. With two small children our experience turned into a complete nightmare. Why on earth would you only have one teller open (who closed her window for 5 min so yes they weren't taking any orders for 5 minutes)?! It is completely beyond me. The service just was so awful that it doesn't justify the food being as good as it is. Someone needs to seriously reevaluate the service standards for this place. Such a shame."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Joe's Farm. Went there because Diners Drive-ins and Dives like alot of people. The Ahi sandwhich they featured on the show was amazing!!!!!!! I didn't care for the onion rings so much. It was a little expensive but I guess if you take into account I ordred Ahi it was not so bad."}
{"text":"Redemption. Just like the what the USA Olympic basketball team did at the recent games, Joe's Farm Grill redeemed themselves today.       I just had to give them one more chance. Maybe I caught them on a bad day when I went there in June. I was initially going to go to El Taco Loco to give them a try but alas they were already closed. So I made my way back up Higley and I thought I'd give Joe another chance.      I ordered the Farm Burger with cheddar and grilled onions which came with regular fries and the requisite chocolate shake. The burger this time came out nice and juicy with the grilled (they should be called caramelized) onions giving it the finishing touch. Also this time I noticed that the pickles had a kinda sweet kinda dill flavor to them. Very interesting in a really tasty way. The fries, like the sweet potato fries I had earlier, came out crisp on the outside and tender and pipng hot inside. And the shake, oh the shake. It's sooo good!   So to you, Joe's Farm Grill, you have redemmed yourselves and I hereby put you in my \"What do I want to eat\" rotation."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time I wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. I ended up only ordering a shake. I went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). I was not impressed. I'm not sure what was weird about. The sauce? The cheese? I've had way better pizzas. Loved the milkshake. I give it two stars because my husband likes it and I have to tolerate it for him."}
{"text":"Eh!  I think people are easily pleased when they are in a quaint, picturesque, or just out of the ordinary environment.  This place is especially fun to take out of towners to in the spring or fall - summers not so much.  We live a couple miles away and have been here 6 or 8 times.  Last time we went everyone was pretty pleased with their meal, but that was a first.  We would come more often if the food lived up to the hype and price.    I'm a little suspicious of some of the reviews here.  \"The burgers and fries are out of this world\"!?  Riiiiight.   Make sure to visit the restrooms.  Kind of a Joe signature touch at this and his other places."}
{"text":"I found this place using Yelp for my iPhone when down in Gilbert last week for work. I was very excited to check it out after the great reviews, but have to admit I wasn't overly impressed. Got there mid afternoon during the week and had to sit outside, something I wasn't looking forward to being it was 110 degrees out. Biz partner and I each got the bacon & blue burgers and a drink. $24 total...I wouldn't really call that cheap. The buffers were large and tasty, fries were better than average, but extraordinary. Layout is a little weird, as you can enter from the front and rear of the restaurant, but the soda machines and condiments are all located outside. I'm from Wisconsin and this place reminded me of the custard stands back home. Nothing I'd really give 5 stars for, though."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Onions are amazing. Order is big enough for 3. Great family place or a casual date night."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Plenty of seating and the line moves fast.  Every single item is very fresh-I love the beet salad and the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Everything I have tasted though is amazing as well.  We always take our out of town guests here and they love it."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Hardly ever come here anymore, thanks Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Ever since Guy Fieri came here the line is out the door.  Good for them, bad for me.  Tonight was the standard BBQ Blue Burger and onion rings.  Easily my favorite burger here.  Can't go wrong with the other stuff however.  I do miss the chili fries.  They used to be on the menu but have not been for a few years, except during hot dog month.  Come and enjoy. Be ready to stand in line during prime hours. Or head over to the other great restaurants on the property."}
{"text":"It's worth the hype. Trust me.  I tried the Fontina burger, I believe, featured in that TV show. It was quite tasty. My girlfriend had the chicken strips, also tasty. Their strawberry lemonade is amazing.  The bathrooms are interesting, check them out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gluten free place for Barbeque.  I like the sliced brickett and ribs the best. Their sauce is gluten free and if you ask they will prepared your meal to meat gluten free standards. The line can be long when they are busy. Their take out is fast when you don't want to eat it.  The atmosphere is fun also. My grandkids loved the tractor inside."}
{"text":"I like the casual outdoor picnic style environment.  The chicken sandwich and ahi tuna are worth the trip out here.  If you come here on a Friday around 7pm, you might have to wait in line for 30-45 minutes."}
{"text":"Love Joe's Farm Grill!  Best food in Gilbert, AZ.  The customer services is outstanding."}
{"text":"Wow - the food was fantastic - my daughter was so excited that the veggie burger was Vegan, and it was incredible.  The atmosphere was wonderful - lots of comfortable outside eating areas.  The only downside was a long line, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is over priced for what is being served, I got a BBQ chicken salad that was $10 lacked flavor everything is served in plastic and baskets lined in tin foil, very carnival food looking. Got my kid a plain hotdog, $6 over charred he spit it out, the special was a pork tenderloin sandwich which had no seasoning to their batter wife did not finish it. To top it off cashier girls were snooty and one went out of her way to let me know that I placed my empty tray in the wrong spot. If you enjoy sitting on old park benches on the dirt and paying $40 for Mediocre food have at it"}
{"text":"This place is just adorable! Great for families. The food is A+,  facilities are clean and the staff is friendly.  Severing sizes are plenty for two with a wide variety on the  menu to please everyone.  I usually get the shrimp and coleslaw platter, the shrimp are huge and the coleslaw is delicious.  We've been to Joe's about 15 times or more and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I live across the street from Joe's Farm Grill.  The food is all natural.  A lot of it grown right there in Agritopia.  The Ahi Tuna burger is awsome!  I highly recommmend this place."}
{"text":"Ahhh, disappointed with this visit. Half the fruit that came with my side of fruit was rotten. These grapes were right on top in plain view and they served them, other fruit under ended up being bad too. When I mentioned them the girl was looking at me like, what's the big deal, no apology, no offer for decent fruit. We also paid .75 extra for extra garlic on our garlic fries and we got less than normal! Then I had to ask for cocktail and lemon that should have went with my shrimp and the girl begrudgingly got the cocktail sauce for me but said they were out of lemons. Then one minute later I see other orders coming out with a lemon. Now since I'm complaining, the doors needed a good wiping down And looked gross. My hubby refuses to come back."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast here but both times I was very pleased! Classic rustic vibe and the food was great! Comfortable home style pancakes were very yummy and the egg scramble I got had lots of yummy cheeses and meats that impressed me. I'll certainly be back but this time I'll sit inside because the flies were driving me crazy."}
{"text":"I live in Agritopia, so I am a very frequent patron of Joe's Farm Grill. The Fontina burger is my fav, and the veggie pizza is my husbands fave. My only 2 gripes are that the place is always packed. The best time to go is about an hour before closing. By that time the line has died down. The second thing is the flies . . . but given that the place sits on a FARM, there's not much that can be done about that. We usually sit inside to avoid the flying critters. Overall a wonderful, family friendly place to eat. Supporting local is my thing, so I love that!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Awesome atmosphere great for the kids and as far as the food goes I love the giant shrimp basket and the farm burger. Gives you feeling of being out in the country even though your surrounded by sub divisions and freeways"}
{"text":"A nice urban farming restaurant where you can get $10 worth of free food on your birthdays! I love the burgers there and the dessert!"}
{"text":"I have yet to go here without there being a long line/wait... but I suppose that should tell you something about the place, right?  They have a great, fresh menu and I love the seasonal salads!  My daughter is addicted to their chicken strips though I tasted them once and felt they were a bit bland.  The service is good and well organized for such a busy place. The portions are generous and prices are fair.  I always plan on tasting more of what is on their extensive menu, but I end up getting hung up on the salads and never make it much further. :)"}
{"text":"Have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here multiple times. Never been disappointed. I usually get the Ahi Tuna sandwich for lunch and dinner at times and Joes big breakfast for breakfast. Both are good. Look forward to trying more on the menu. It's a great atmosphere for families. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! I am already trying to find excuses to return and I live 2 hours away! Me, my fiancée, our friend and his 3 year old daughter came here for Easter breakfast.  Now, this is a vegan and a three year old trying to find a place with a common palate on Easter at 11am with no reservations.  Mission impossible.  Our friend suggested this gem and we rushed over. The layout is darling! A farmhouse looking building where you wait in line, order your food then find a seat at one ou their picnic tables and wait for your buzzer to alert you. The place was busy since it was a holiday, but we still ordered and received our food within 40 minutes of parking! The menu was diverse! Date shakes, home made onion rings, ribs, burgers, pizzas, salads and lamb! There was a lot of opportunity to personalize your food with topping and sauces as well.  We sat at a picnic table surrounded by grass, trees and a farm was in sight. It was beyond charming! I ordered the veggie burger (made in-house from beans and 10 veggies) and sweet potato fries. C got baby back ribs and Cole slaw. We were both very happy with our selections! My burger tasted craft made and a unique melody of flavors! One of the best I have ever had! The portions were big and we were ravenous! If I am within 30 minutes of Joe's, you can bet I will be stopping by!"}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere. Lots of seating. Good food!! Clean. If you love barbecue this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Pretty inconsistent IMO. The first time food was awesome, second time it was very greasy. Also, pretty expensive. 27 bucks for 2 burgers and sodas is a little steep for a non sit down restaurant that isn't in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Joes farm grill is so delicious. They have a good variety of choices for anyone's palette. They have such a great and fun environment too! Whenever we have visitors from out of town we are sure to take them to Joe's. Their food is fresh and tastey. They use fresh ingredients for everything and really nailed down fresh squeezed lemonade and strawberry lemonade.  You can't beat their fontina burger. Plus on your birthday you get $10 free towards your meal. Totally worth going. It's for sure one of favorite Locally owned Gilbert restaurants."}
{"text":"A very neat place but it seems to mostly get by on the reputation built up over the years.  Take out orders are hit or miss.  We go often because of the atmosphere more than the food."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go!  Very family friendly.    Love the food, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Used to eat here often, especially since it has outdoor seating and is family friendly. The Fontina Burger and Tuna Burger were our favorites. We stopped going here after we saw that Joe's hosted a fundraiser for a local Tea Party candidate that featured none other than the Queen of Mean herself--Sarah Palin. So this may bolster Joe's reputation for those of you who love Right-Wing politics, but for us, it was a huge turn-off. We would rather spend our money on local businesses who put their funds into Progressive candidates or simply back into the community."}
{"text":"Joe's is one of my favorites, and I always bring my out-of-state visitors here.  Great outdoor atmosphere and phenomenal food.  Make time to walk around and see the gardens or visit the farmer's market while you're here.  I'd come more often if the line to get in wasn't always so long."}
{"text":"Great food , fast  service and the coolest tree on the planet ."}
{"text":"The location is great, with cool outdoor eating and a neat dining room. I've had several of the burgers here which I'd rate about average. They are big and messy and soggy, but very tasty. Honestly though, it's hard to screw up a giant piece of tasty cow loaded up with all kinds of baddies. I've had the pulled pork sandwich, it was NOT Joe's BBQ quality so don't bother. The sauce was watery and my soaked bun was basically just thrown away. The onion rings are good. The hot dogs are the small variety and nothing special. I think the kind I got were topped with a bland chili but they don't look like they have them anymore. We enjoyed the breakfast, and my wife loves the bbq chicken pizza. I'm of the opinion that bbq chicken should never be on a pizza so I can't give any points for that."}
{"text":"I mean, it's ok but nothing to write home about like the other reviews say. It's a little greasy, a little over priced for what it is but it's got a good vibe. Great place to take a first date or to chill with a bunch of friends. It's just ok though :/ I give it a \"meh\""}
{"text":"We love to eat at Joe's.  The food is great and fresh from the garden.  The kids really like the kids meals too.  Our favorites are the barbeque chicken pizza and the onion rings.  The outdoor seating is so nice, but there is enough indoor space too if you don't want to eat outside (they just recently remodeled too).   It can get pretty crowded, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Pros: Cool place with a very unique atmosphere. Food was good, not great. We had the Fontina Burger and the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, fries and beet salad.   Cons: Long drive unless you live way out in east Gilbert. The wait was WAY too long for no reason. The line was long but nothing crazy. There was only one cashier even though there were two windows. This was at 12:30 pm on a Tuesday so you'd think they'd at least have 2 cashiers going at that busy time.   Bottom line: It took us 30 minutes to drive there from Elliot and 48th, we waited in line for another 30 minutes and our food came within 10 minutes. While the food was good, you can definitely find something as good if not better much closer to a central location, like the Farm or House of Tricks, which is very similar but with much better service."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick bite to eat . Had the fontina burger and garlic fries . Service was friendly and efficient. Food came fast and it was delicious. I think I could eat 2 orders of the garlic fries , they're grubbin. The ambiance is nice outside with a picnic / country feel . Don't miss the bathrooms , they're a trip LOL"}
{"text":"Love this place! My family goes here every sunday. Dog friendly and professional staff!"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ chicken salad here. I know what. You're thinking, right, \"oh it's just a salad, nothing to get excited about\". Well strap in because it was exciting, and delicious! Their veggies are so fresh (I liked the sweet corn in there) and the chicken was nice and tender, with their BBQ sauce which was also really good. My husband got the BBQ chicken pizza that Guy ate when he visited and really enjoyed it as well. It was also nice to sit outside and eat there, it felt like we were back home in Wisconsin instead of sitting in the middle of the desert! We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Um... This place is awesome! We have been here multiple times and we never get bad service or bad food! However i would be careful because about 3 trees outside have scorpion warnings and my cousins says they saw one."}
{"text":"There's a lot of hype about this place. My opinion is that it doesn't quite live up to it.  The atmosphere is awesome. There is plenty of space, unique decor, pretty landscaping, etc. It's a nice place to be.   But a nice place to eat? Maybe not so much. Don't arrive hungry, because you'll most likely be waiting in a long line - just to order. This seems to have gotten worse, even just recently. The past 2-3 times I've been, the wait has been over an hour. It's definitely frustrating.   And then there's the price. It's pretty expensive for what it is. Count on at least $12 a person. Probably more like $15, especially if you drink something other than water.   Now, I'd be fine with the wait AND the price if I felt like the food was worth it. But I've yet to be blown away by anything on the menu here. I actually usually have a difficult time ordering because there are only a couple things that even sound appetizing. I'm usually reasonably happy with what I get, but never to the point that I felt it was worth the time and money. And most of the people I've gone with who have gotten burgers have said they were good, but nothing special.  The one thing I LOVE there is the fried zucchini! If it was possible to run in and grab an order of these real quick I'd be stopping at Joe's a lot more often.   So, Joe's doesn't really do it for me. If you still want to give it a try, I'd recommend checking out the menu online first and making sure there's something that sounds REALLY good to you, because that meal will cost you time and money!"}
{"text":"Would love to give 5 stars because I love Joe's. But after coming here countless times for breakfast and lunch I finally had a less than favorable experience. I wanted to substitute sausage for fruit (vegetarian alert) I had already done this several times with no issue. But it was not an option that day, I was only able to switch sausage for some other kind of meat or pancake. Not sure why it wouldn't be okay considering the side of fruit is the same price/maybe even less than a side of meat. Anyway, I still love Joe's but see this as an unnecessary problem if you want to keep a customer happy. I plan to come back but will keep in mind fruit instead of meat is not a fair trade."}
{"text":"I really like their food! My least favorite was the waffles and ribs! They are really careful when you tell them you have allergies. I'm allergic to dairy so when they made mine they changed gloves. It's also a nice atmosphere. You can eat inside or outside and you get $10 for your birthday!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I drive from the north valley with my family to sit outside and enjoy the pizza... burger... or even a shake."}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's Farm Grill several times and is usually pretty decent but my last experience was awful and I will not return. First problem.. my wife always gets a pizza, we stood in a long line and she was decided on what she wants. . We get to order and was told no pizza available. Ok she has to figure out something else while people are waiting behind us. She orders a salad, I order a burger. Next problem.. there is a 3 year old that was just rolling around on the floor now STANDING on the counter where people pick up their food. Lovely. Next problem... I notice several people that were behind us in line have received their order. I go ask what's the hold up and was literally told \"we forgot your burger\".  It's finally made and rudely shoved at me as if I am being impatient. Lastly.. as I am eating outside the next table has a dog standing on top of the table. I love dogs and all but not where I eat. On top of the table.. really? Wow.  I will not ever be back."}
{"text":"Went again yesterday for lunch.  It's the place that a lot of friends want to go so I just shut up and tag along.  Still think it's just okay but am upping it a star for the incredible management.  After my previous review, I was contacted by the manager and he not only comped my meal but sent  a giftcard for a future visit.  How cool is that?  Now if I can only find something I like.    So, on this visit I tried the chicken breast sandwich with pesto.  It was good - very good.  The bun is soft and fresh, the breast is plump and juicy (wow, sounding a tad steamy there, so I'll take it down a notch) and the onion rings (which I tried for the first time after 20+ visits) did not disappoint.  We also got the baked potato fries.  Yummy.  Thanks Anthony for your generosity.  I got the gift card after I got back from lunch so I'll be visiting again soon.  You rock!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I actually enjoy the experience and the environs (check out the bathrooms!) more than the food, but the food is great, and many of their ingredients are grown right there!"}
{"text":"Ate the ahi tuna burger, wellllllll worth it. By far the best fish burger I ever had! Very pleased :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. I make my sister take me here every time I'm in town visiting her."}
{"text":"Used to be a 5-star joint as the food is wonderful- especially the garlic fries.  But now, they have this organic tractor soda selection on tap, and it's horrible.  Where is my Coke?  Why replace the best with the most eclectic and tasteless drinks around?  Not worth a special trip here anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Visited from California... wish we had something like this place here. Got the fontina burger one day and the BBQ Chicken pizza the next. The \"grilled\" pizza has an awesome charred taste.  Wish I could have tried the apple fritters but I walked up to the counter at 11:01 and they had stopped serving breakfast. They should really serve those all day long."}
{"text":"We try to stop here every time we are in the Mesa area.  It is one of those must-do places if you have friends who have been not been there.  They screwed up my last order, but corrected it without question or complaint.  Good food and good times!  You have to endure a line, but it goes fast."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not great. The price was outrageous for a burger joint. $60 for 3 people; burgers, fried zucchini and sodas."}
{"text":"We stopped by thinking it would be good as it is always busy.  It was a big disappointment.  Unfriendly cashier to begin with.  My husband's burger tasted funny and he did not ask for a refund.  They kept arguing that their food is fresh.  It was not!  Very pricey and we will never go back or recommend it to anyone.  Very bad customer service.  I guess they don't care.  Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"Tough menu.  A lot of choices, so I was vacillating a lot.  I finally decided on the Ahi Tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries.  I also ordered the beet salad just to try it.  I liked everything.  Including the onion rings the hubbie ordered.  This would be the place I would go for onion rings.  Very tasty.  We sat outside. Not sure if it would be enjoyable in summer, but mid-Feb, with it finally hitting the upper 70s, it was wonderful.  Several people were there w/ dogs because it is really a picnic area.  We will go back.  I want to try the ahi salad...maybe stick w/ the ahi sandwich.  I think it will be the way to go when I'm craving a burger.  W/o a doubt, if you go, you HAVE to check out the bathrooms."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the 5 star reviews, I came here with high expectation but left very \"Meh\".  I'm thinking this is a summer type place and I went in the winter or maybe they just had an off day. I don't quite understand the ravving about the interior of the place as it reminded me of a nicer McDonalds that was full of people and dirty tables (the staff was working hard to clean up but a lot of customers). Not bad but nothing special.  I ordered grilled salmon + asparagus with a side caesar salad and vegetable of the day. Then they said they were out of that salad and the vegetables. So I requested a side salad and fruit. Then they said they were out of fruit, so I was left ordering the sweet potato fries (they cost extra $) and the side salad.   The Asparagus was decent.  The \"Grilled\" Salmon was unlike most grilled salmon I eat which had no grilling marks (they don't add to flavor but not what I was hoping for from a place with Grill in the name) and had some sort of breading or coating it that took away from the flavor of the fish. That combined with the fact that is was over-cooked for salmon made it a very mediocre fish. No doubt I'm being nitpicky here but I expect more from a place rated so highly on yelp.  The side salad was also mediocre and on the smallest plate you could fit the salad on.   The sweet potato fries were actually really good and the best part of my meal. Had I actually wanted fry's at that time, I'd have loved them.   My Dad had the BBQ Pork Sandwich that literally says \"lots of sauce\" in the description of it and it was very lightly coated in BBQ sauce requiring him to add a lot more to give it that \"lots of sauce\" taste.  There were 4 of us going in with high hopes and we all felt the same about it. There is potential there but I think the kitchen needs some QC work to make this an actual Yelp 4-star meal."}
{"text":"First, paper plates , second, there are kids prepping food in the back, all that said, don't understand what Tha big whoop is about this place. I drove 79 miles from Tucson to Gilbert, and defenatly not worth the drive, the food at best is average, a Tasty Freeze with a little better food. I'm sorry, but if your on Yelp giving this place four and five stars, you should not be reviewing food, the food is edible and ok, certainly not worth all this fuss, a waste of a 79 mile drive.  If you like average food, then go ahead and go there, if you have an exceptional palate and know what real quality, well presented and taste, you will be disapointed. JB"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers I have ever had. The Fontina Burger is to die for and even the fries are fantastic.  The pizzas are fresh, crisp and very flavorful. The Fried Green Beans are also a favorite of mine, but only indulge if you have unconditionally loving friends and family around because it will give you garlic breath that could take the paint off of walls.  My husband likes the more traditional Farm Burger, Jumbo Fried Shrimp and Onion Rings. You really can't go wrong with anything you get here. The food is high quality, fantastic flavor, giant portions and the prices are great! My husband and I frequented this place on a weekly basis while we lived in the area for 2 years. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"My family and I had the privilege of attending a private pre-launch (my mom went to high school with one of the owners) and it was one helluva drive for us, but worth it nonetheless.  Diner food is what to get here; for ribs go to Joe's Real BBQ.  Burgers are amazing, chicken pesto sandwich was perfect, tender and juicy.  Neat little place.  Too bad it is such a far drive for me."}
{"text":"Great food, the constant lines prove it. Best items,  the grilled cheese add bacon, farm burger and shrimp basket!"}
{"text":"Have now managed to make it out for breakfast a couple of times and we were much pleased. The portions are good sized and the food delicious. There are so many choices that it will be impossible to describe here, suffice to say that everything was wonderful.  Not to mention the lovely park like private feeling picnic spots all around the building that really make my morning!  Huzzah! For breakfast at Joe's Farm Grill!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place watching diners, drive ins, and dives and when I moved out here my wife and I had to try it. We got the Fontina Cheese Burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The pesto chicken sandwich was delicious if you love pesto. The onion rings were the best I've ever had. You must go if you live in the area. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"we went here for prom night and i was very disappointed to learn that the pizza was broken smh. please fix that asap as possible. i ended up getting a chicken sandwich and dang, dem bois huuuge. it was a lot of food for a good price. service was super nice and our server i think was named cyrus was phenomenal. solid place with a solid 4/5 cause them pizzas was broke"}
{"text":"Love their BBQ...never disappoints!!! I would gladly refer anyone and its definitely a place for our of towners to visit."}
{"text":"Joe's offers some extremely delicious items. Some of the ones I've tried include the Fontina Burger, jumbo shrimp, and Southwest Burger.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five due to some so-so menu items and a preference for a different type of ordering and seating."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. It is inconsistent thus the three stars. I think sitting amongst the trees and out of the stucco is the finest feature of Joe's Farm Grill. It is fun to watch the children scampering about. Oh yeah, the food. ... Sometimes dry, sometimes burned, sometimes delicious, always pricey.  Wouldn't recommend for out of town visitors. They are not as impressed with trees and quasi secluded suburbs."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill. The location and ambiance is so great with it being on a produce farm, and although I haven't tried the onsite Cafe, I know it has rave reviews as well. The menu at Joe's has a great assortment of really tasty food and the breakfast and lunch items I've tried (breakfast tacos, huevos, bbq chicken pizza, chicken sandwich, just to name a few) have never disappointed.   The one downfall is that because there is the indoor-outdoor setup where people are constantly bustling in and out and leaving doors open, there tends to be quite a few flies inside at certain times of the year. Not unbearable, but a little annoying.  All in all, it's a great place to take family and friends, especially out-of-towners, and is very child-friendly."}
{"text":"We love the food here. Almost everything on the menu is excellent and the food is always fresh. The line is just way too long on the weekends, but it is worth the wait. The only problem I don't like are the number of flies hovering over your food as you eat."}
{"text":"If you order a hamburger make sure you ask for it \"well done\" when you place your order.  I was there last night and ordered a fontina burger and two children's burgers.  I was unpleasantly surprised to find they were  raw inside!  Especially upsetting for a parent with two small kids.  I promptly took them back and asked for cooked ones.  They agreed to recook them but said that they cook all their burgers \"medium rare\" so if I wanted it cooked completely I need to specify it when ordering.  I've been eating burgers a long time and have never experienced this before. This was by far the most undercooked burger I've ever seen.  Usually ground beef is always cooked thoroughly due to increased risk of hamful bacteria such as e.coli.  This is of particular concern for small children and the elderly.  It would make more sense to, at the very least, cook children's burgers well done as their gold standard. Makes no sense to set up small children for deadly illness."}
{"text":"Once upon a time pre-foodnetwork coverage I'm sure this place was good. But now the line is longer than the one waiting for Splash Mountain and at the end of this line there's  just mediocre food. At least at splash mountain you can scam your way through the front with renting out a wheelchair. I suspect they have  a tactic for this long line I waited for an hour and by the time I ordered I was super hungry my family and I  ordered the BBQ pulled pork ,farmer burger, onion rings, banana pudding milkshake. We practically inhaled the food not because it was exceptional but because we were hungry!!!!!  It's alright but for promoting  the \"fresh ingredients\" I couldn't taste the difference, well not enough to wait an hour and drive 20 min.My boyfriend said \"the highlight of our trip was the freshly squeezed lemonade.\"I mostly enjoyed the setting it was quaint. All in all  their food is alright nothing wow."}
{"text":"I realize that there are a plethora of positive reviews on this place already but I feel the need to add our family to the list of fans.  My wife and I came here on Saturday afternoon after doing some shopping in the area.  Having heard about this place while watching \"Triple D\" we had a feeling it would be popular.  We arrived at 4pm and they were busy.  It only got busier while we were there too.    We ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza, BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and a Regular Cheeseburger.  We also tried the onion rings and garlic fries.  Everything we ate was awesome!  Not just good but awesome.  Here are the standout points for me.  1) Fresh ingredients matter!  They use locally grown produce in their food and it shows.  You just can't replicate the flavors when the food is frozen and/or processed.  2) Reasonable pricing.  We ordered 3 entrees and 2 drinks and the bill was less than $40.  Works for me!  3) Great setting.  Starting with a retro looking building and adding in a farm setting you have a great place to enjoy a meal.  Large trees behind the building provide ample shade for the picnic tables too.  For the winter time they have heaters on the patio too.  So in summary, we loved it.  We will definitely be back.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We stopped to eat here. Not a real sir down restaurant. You have to walk through a line to order your food. It wasn't very impressed with me stay here in"}
{"text":"Miss eating here. Yummy food! and always fresh since they have there own veggie garden"}
{"text":"Excellent as always. I tried the onion rings this time and they were crazy good! The wedge salad is my all time favorite. I love the casual feel of the place and appreciate the freshness and elevation of the food."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is one of my family's favorite spots to eat. Great views of the Superstition Mountains, love walking around the beautiful area, and the food never disappoints. Ever. Love their southwest burger and can't wait until they bring back the banana split entree. It's always hard to choose what to eat when coming here because everything is so delicious and fresh. Highly recommend Joe's."}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews I am willing to try this place one more time because the first time I gotta say, my wife and I were not impressed.  We both had the Waffle and meat breakfast and a fruit (bowl).  A customer had to actually point out where to order because I was being ignored by all of their employees.  The fruit bowl for $2.49 consisted of a total of 6 or 7 small pieces of fruit and looked rather rediculous.  I wouldn't even mind paying a bit more for more fruit served in a larger food tray.  The waffle was tasty but they could definitely give you 2 because it cost $7 for 1 eight inch waffle, kind of silly.  There was also no available portion cups to dispense my syrup.  I was still pretty hungry when I left and usually when you spend $25 for breakfast for 2, you usually leave pretty satisfied.  The employees were pretty rude and unhelpful and look at you funny when you ask where things are.  Maybe if things were labeled and more obvious, such looks would be warranted.  After we were finished eating we wandered over to the farm stand to check out the fresh fruit and figs that were advertised on an A-frame sign on the street but to our dismay, there was no fruit (or figs) in the farmstand, in fact it was closed.  We tried to go to the Coffee house part of the restaurant but when we were walking up a Gilbert fire truck pulled up and paramedics rushed in so maybe next time....or not.  We will try lunch next time, definitely....."}
{"text":"Yummy, great atmosphere, exceptional staff and clean clean clean! Well worth the 48 mile drive from North Phoenix. Check this out and try the hand breaded chicken fingers delicious!"}
{"text":"It was delicious! We had the burger and BBQ plate.. everything was great.. my daughter ordered a strawberry lemonade, while it was good, it was a bit overpriced. The atmosphere is wonderful, defibuait outside if it's in the 70s!"}
{"text":"I still remember the first time I went to Joe's Farm Grill.  It was a mild May evening and we decided to eat outside. The idea of farm fresh foods really appealed to me.  I am always beyond satisfied with my meal.  I don't think there has been a time that I have been there that I didn't order a barbecue chicken pizza.  I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas, but this one is just amazing.  I'm pretty sure the bbq sauce they use, is the same one they use at Joe's Real BBQ.  The enormous tree behind the Farm Grill is sick and we always crack jokes about the sign about falling and scorpions.  The line can be a little long, but they are quick at the order window and it is definitely worth the wait.  Don't forget to try them for breakfast as well, mmm breakfast tacos...  Do yourself a favor and walk off that delicious meal through the farm and sneak a grape (when they are in season) that grow on the arbors and fences.  Enjoy and remember to eat local"}
{"text":"Oh what a happy day.   This place has everything (if you oversee that it's in f!#@$g Gilbert, AZ lol)  The farm salad with thai dressing was OK but I'm positive that next time I'll have the fresh beet salad.  But this is out of the subject.   The Fontina burger is delicious, period! Full flavor cheese, perfect meat, nothing not to love about this burger. (I didn't eat the bun since I'm trying to skip some carbs but it looked great).  The onion rings are the best I've ever tried. Not that I'm a big fan of onion rings but this ones are a mandatory dish.  The place is family orientated, nice and modern decor, the bathrooms are interesting, btw. They have some weird decor (I won't spoil it, check it out by yourself).   The price is pretty decent (if you oversee the gas to drive to f!@$#g Gilbert, AZ lol).  A great place that worth the trip.  I'll be back soon.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We never go to Phoenix without making a trip to Joe's Farm Grill. You won't regret the experience. The setting is beautiful and the food has NEVER disappointed. Children can run around and play but it is not annoying to us, who don't have small children. The atmosphere is just so peaceful. We love their burgers, salads and shakes. I think they make the best lemonade in the entire state. Please make a point to try Joe's and experience something very special."}
{"text":"A surprisingly warm & welcoming local place. From the moment we walked in the staff was courteous, inviting and helpful. The ordering process, menu and seating has a \"food trucky\" feel to it. I say that as a compliment, imagine a really nice food truck converted in to a free standing restaurant, that's Joe's. I only ordered simple bacon/eggs, the bacon was good and eggs were very good. I know, it's just bacon/eggs but we all know plenty of restaurants that can ruin that.  My kids had the french toast & pancakes, they all enjoyed it.  Overall, a great place for laid back dining with kids. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Joes farm grill used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I went today for the first time since they remodeled and I hated it. They took out all the drinks and replaced them with coconut water and some healthy soda they created. Also, they took out the self serve sauce station to get ketchup BBQ  sauce etc... now they have waitress/ food runners that you have to ask for stuff but they just bring you your food and never come back to help. May never go back now"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. I love the outdoor seating. The only downside was how busy this place can get. Plus large portions but can be priced a little high."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! The Farm-feel outside and classic diner style inside coupled with super fresh, tasty lunch. I really enjoyed it! :) I had the bacon-blue burger with a side of sweet potato fries and it was delicious! Everything was colorful and fresh. I will def make a return visit."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've eaten at. Every meal has been absolutely excellent and tastes fresh! My personal favorite is the seared Ahi tuna sandwich. My only complaint is that there is always a long line to order, but that just speaks to how popular this place is. Highly recommend Joe's!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Their fried zucchini has no equal! If you're able to make it in before 11, Joe's big breakfast is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Joe's is solid. It has a nice menu with lots of choices and the food tastes good. But Joe's lacks in service and value.  It is too expensive for what you get. They run out of items every time we visit and it takes too long for the food to come out. They can't seem to regulate their staff to busyness ratio. We keep giving them chances, but they always come up short in delivery."}
{"text":"Fresh and simple!  Taste's great!  Worth the drive!  The burgers are like the ones you make at home!  I had the sweet potato fries, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this BBQ!! It never seems to disappoint! So many options and there is homemade root beer!! The only thing downside is that the little cups for BBQ sauce are paper and they fall apart after a little while of having sauce in them."}
{"text":"Busy like always but quick service and love not having to tip a server to just have some great food! Had Fish specials today but I've been looking forward to their burgers!  Still love this place and my kids love it!  Hope they will be here forever!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute!  It's a little interesting how it's looks like a cafeteria though.  However, I like the idea of it being on a farm.  I had the bbq pork sandwich and the meat was amazing.  They loaded it on as well.  The cole slaw was disappointing though because it had absolutely no flavor.  I don't like much mayo in my slaw but it still wasn't flavorful enough.  The sweet potato fries were so very good.  They are nice and crispy.  The sauce that came with it was a little too sweet for me so I made my own garlic aioli sauce to dip.  Using mayo, the garlic from my garlic fries and a package of lemon juice they provide.  I really like the idea of the packaged lemon juice since I heard slices of lemon wedges can be really unsanitary.  I also tried the bbq bacon blue burger and it was tasty.  All ingredients are Joe's are really fresh.  I didn't know this but I could have substituted (probably for more $$$ though) my slaw with any fries.  Also, the burger comes with plain fries and you can substitutes garlic or sweet fries as well.  I got a side order of sweet potato fries and it was way too much food!"}
{"text":"I love most of Joe's restaurants and concepts. But I'm afraid Joe's Farm Grill is average at best. The food is moderately good. It's higher priced and the wait is forever.   You'll wait in a single file line and then order from someone behind a glass window. The options are pretty self explanatory. It's a grill. So, you've got burgers, fries and the like. There's also some flat breads that are pretty good.   The setting is pretty cool. You're on a big property with tables outside underneath a really cool, huge tree that shades pretty much everything even when the sun is at its highest point. The bathrooms are all individually themed with cartoons or old tv shows playing in them.   The redeeming factors are the setting and the fact that some of the food is sourced from Joe's farm that's right next door.   So, if you're cool with having an overpriced, decent meal that you had to wait to get for an hour or so then this is your place. But I only go here if I have friends that are doing an event (like a birthday) and they've picked this place."}
{"text":"So delicious! You can't beat the atmosphere either. Local businesses rock!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe to it. It has a throw back look and feel. It has both indoor and outdoor eating. They have trees and picnic tables that give the place an almost \"campy\" feel. The food is a bit pricey, but delicious! It's  definitely a trendy place and great place to bring out-of -town guests."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I'm even reviewing this. Over a thousand reviews already. Look, if you haven't tried it, you're missing out. I highly recommend it for anyone in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"love the Ahi tuna sandwich and the garlic fries.. and the unique restrooms they have."}
{"text":"Breakfast is awesome too! Those flatbreads are amazing. I always order breakfast to go and eat at work.. so far had the chicken mushroom scramble and the veggie omelet. Really loved the veggie omelet. Both times with potatoes. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Quality of food - Service - Price is decent - Farm fresh ingredients from their garden - Atmosphere (outdoor picnic style with a beautiful view) - Farmers market (their own grown stuff!)  Cons: - Flys - Small parking lot"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and coffee. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Good food. High prices..  Breakfast and Lunch"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast on the weekends! We went on a Saturday morning. Great atmosphere and the food was insanely good! Highly recommend joes big breakfast! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype! The first time I went I liked it,  but it was chilly and not busy. The second time it was as Sunday and it was packed! Fortunately, we got the last table! They were  pushing the food out but it wasn't as good as the first time.  I have had bbq ribs I liked better! You order at the counter and have to pick it up, most places have a runner. I don't mind picking it up but other people are breathing all over your food, possibly touching it and you pay prices of a sit down restaurant!  The iced tea had stuff growing and floating in it. Not normal and yuck! See pics! The tree in back is awesome! !"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing hamburgers. Amazing garlic fries. Amazing shakes, fried zucchini, and onion rings. I can go on, or you can read the other five hundreds reviews on this place, its even been featured on Food Network.  Joe's Farm Grill is a great, original, retro, family-friendly restaurant serving fresh organic quality food.  Beautiful outdoor picnic area type seating surrounded by large mature trees, even an outdoor soda machine and condiment station, which is great since so many of us Arizonans just love eating and being outside!. Surprisingly enough, it is not nearly as crowded as I thought it would be. Its not exactly close to home, but there are a few places I always like to swing by when I am in the area- and best believe this is one of them."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give a six star rating, I would consider it in this case.   I've eaten at Joe's Farm Grill a few times over the course of the last few years. I've reached the conclusion that this is one of the best burgers in America. The onion rings are also stellar.   The sweet potato fries and ahi sandwich are solid picks, but not quite in the same stratosphere. Overall, the great strength of Joe's is that there is a unique take on everything."}
{"text":"So delicious! Looks like a cafeteria style which turned me off when we arrived but the food is amazing. My husband and I went for lunch, there was a line but it moved quickly. The staff was very friendly and the owner was walking around giving suggestions and then making sure everyone's food was good. The garlic fries were to die for. Not too garlicky or oily they were perfect. We got a garlic burger so I was worried about the fries being overload but I am so glad the staff talked us into them because they worked perfect with the burger. The burger was one of the best we've had, definitely recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I ate moving to Arizona a few mos back.. This is a hidden secret!!! Love the fried zucchini, the flat breads, the burgers and the fresh squeezed lemonade!! This place has a relaxed ambiance to it, except the tree outdoors warning of falling scorpions. They could also get the flies under control outdoors where you eat, not fun to deal with. Otherwise the place is amazing, fresh yummy ,healthy food!!!! Try it!!!!! Dont forget to peak at their very interesting decor in the restroom.. lol"}
{"text":"This really is the best lunch place in Gilbert/Mesa if you aren't afraid of a line. Plenty of outside seating and a very cool vibe. The food is fresh and local. Really enjoyable place to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The wait can be a bit long, but it is WELL WORTH IT!!  I love their chicken caesar salad, bbq burger, onion rings and this list goes on. everything I've had here has been great.  on an odd side note, their bathrooms are pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time today after numerous recommendations and I have to say, I was very pleased! Ordered the Farm Burger, Fries, and a Strawberry Lemonade, all to share between me and my mom which proved to be more than enough food. To my surprise, instead of fries which usually come complimentary with the burger, we received onion rings and I wasn't about to complain (onion rings are an additional $2.50 with a burger). To be completely honest,  there was nothing extraordinary about the burger. It came with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side. It was a good burger, satisfying and filling, but nothing more. The onion rings on the other hand stood out and were none like I've had: extremely hott and fresh, not too oily, and the onion was plump and juicy, none of that half withered crap. The best part of the meal was definitely the strawberry lemonade! It had a perfect balance of lemon and strawberry and tasted so fresh. On top of that,  it wasn't too sweet and was large enough for two people to share. I'd recommend Joe's to anyone in Arizona looking for a decent burger, cool location, family-friendly dining experience, and delicious drinks!!"}
{"text":"Tired of the same old Ahwatukee restaurants, we decided to give Joe's Farm Grill in Gilbert a try.  We actually couldn't decide on Joe's Farm Grill or Joe's Real BBQ, but ultimately picked Farm Grill because I was craving fries and the BBQ joint does not serve them...  When we arrived, there was a line to order, however it moved pretty quickly.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and although initially I wanted fries, I opted for the onion rings at the last minute.  Both were excellent.  I rarely order a chicken sandwich because usually a grilled chicken sandwich from a restaurant is inedible, but here the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I was not disappointed.  The onion rings were great too.    My man ordered the double dogs with chili - two chili dogs - they looked really good!  He also had fries that I shared.  :)  We sat outside since we were lucky enough to have 80-ish degrees in the middle of a Phoenix summer.  It was so nice!  The sounds and the smells of the Farm reminded me of BBQs and picnics I enjoyed as a child in Illinois and made me realize it was probably time for a visit again.  :)  Next time we are going to give Joe's Real BBQ  a try!"}
{"text":"Boom Shakalaka I love This Place. Eaten there over 25 times never had a bad meal. Try it trust me"}
{"text":"This place has always been a cool spot to go to.  We have been going for years and it has been a staple of great food and service.  The atmosphere of the place is awesome.  Love the huge trees everywhere and when the weather is nice it's great to sit out there and enjoy your meal and the company.  Can't go wrong going here."}
{"text":"Normally this would be a 5 star but this time my burger was over cooked. It said it's cooked pink but it wasn't. Other then that the new sodas are really good and the fries are fantastic. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love Joe's farm grill! The BBQ burger is my favorite! Joe's is known for their BBQ sauce and once you taste it you will know why. My only critique of this restaurant is I wish they had more in door seating. Most of it is outside and in the summer it's almost unbearable to sit out doors."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna sandwich was amazing.  Perfectly cooked super flavorful and a great price.  I wish it wasn't so far from Ahwatukee because I love their food.  My wife got the bacon, blue burger and it was outstanding as well.  My daughter got the BBQ chicken salad and she is very finicky but was very happy with the salad.  Worth the drive.  The manager was also super friendly and hustling to clean up spaces as guests finished their food.  Enjoyed the community picnic tables, allowed us to enjoy the great spring weather and great conversation with a couple from Texas."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The food's ok. It's counter service, so nothing special there. Everything I've ever had there has been fine, but I always feel like I'm paying 50% more than it's worth.  Try the ahi tuna sandwich, though. It's almost reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the last 8 years and do not plan on stopping. The food and service here are always top of the line. It truly is worth all of the hype that it received from Guy Fieri!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The veggie burger is amazing. Try the sweet potato fries...the pineapple jalapeño dipping sauce that comes with them is to die for! Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and my toddler. We had amazing food for a great price. We got lucky and it wasn't packed. I love that they grow most of their food themselves. We walked around after in the Agritopia community gardens and is was so nice. I wish I could visit more often."}
{"text":"Thank you for offering a vegan item. I hope to see more vegan variety in the future from Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"We came to Joe's for a quick snack/lunch.  We anticipated eating a big dinner so we didn't order much.  We just had an order of onion rings and the chili cheese fries.  Onion rings - hella crispy, not soggy, had a good taste.  Chili Cheese Fries - chili was really good and when well with the fries.   Ambiance - love all of the outdoor seating and all of the glass kinda makes you feel like you are outside.  I'd come back again so I can try some real food and the Coffee Shop next door."}
{"text":"It is especially fun on a nice day to go to Joe's Farm Grill.  Sometimes the line is really long.  That's because the burgers are great.  Make sure to try the onion rings.  Great place if you have kids with the wiggles.   Families can choose to  eat outside at one of many picnic tables under a huge, shady tree.  There is also indoor seating.  Take a walk to look at what's growing at Agratopia gardens out back."}
{"text":"I don't know what the big deal is about with regard to this place... Everything on this menu is just \"ok...\"  Well except for the onion rings... those were better than average... otherwise it isn't really worth the wait in line...    Also... in terms of the line... THEY HAVE ONE PERSON TAKING ORDERS!!!  The line is huge, and they have 2-3 registers...  They could easily make it go more quickly if they were organized... but it appears they like to make their customers wait for mediocre food...    The shame, is that a lot of things on their menu sound and look good... but the flavor isn't there overall, or it has a TGIF Friday's kind of vibe to it...  Just having farm fresh ingredients isn't enough JOE!  Where's the flavor?  Where's the technique?    I had their famous burger, it was thin and in need of seasoning...  My fiancee had the BBQ Pork Sandwich... which tasted like chain BBQ...  Not a \"bad\" meal, but definitely not worth all the hype... or the line... or the price tag...    Overall, it should be three stars, but I'm giving it two because it doesn't live up to its own hype!  If you're gonna talk the talk, you need to walk the walk!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the almost hour long wait, in line, is not worth it... It would be a 5 star review if it wasn't such an inconvenience of a wait.. the prices are a little high also but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, an extra star for the outdoor patio and atmosphere in general.  The outdoor patio is awesome.  A lot of space and room for kids to run, huge trees, and an inviting atmosphere.  Weather was perfect.    The ordering system and process is a mess.  Two small windows and a lot of people behind to take orders while the lines wrapped around.  Could be more efficient.  If you wanted to add something to your order, you have to go to the pick up window and she will yell and allow you to skip the line at the first window.    Salmon wasn't good - slightly over-cooked so they quickly swapped it out for the ahi which was cooked perfectly.  The kids did not like the cheese pizza.  We did not try the traditional burgers although they looked good, so maybe next time."}
{"text":"Must have come on a bad day. My wife got the grilled wedge salad. It was not grilled, they forgot the bacon and left the lettuce core on it.  Burgers were ok not great. A bit overcooked. 2.50 for onion ring upgrade and you get four rings. They really need to do something about the flies, there were thousands.  Lots of swatting going on. Saw a maggot on our table, not surprising.  At least we can say we tried it. Too 'back to nature' for me."}
{"text":"This place is like a breath of fresh air tucked away in the land of Agritopia of Gilbert. I love this place mainly for its:  1. Picnic tables outside 2. Its a perfect place to take an informal date, kids night out, or solo 3. The menu has some variety although the burgers are its main staple 4. Its got a coffee shop, bistro right next door. It's a completely different yet the same vibe. The younger folk generally hang out here. Great coffee. 5. They appreciate our country's VETS! On Vet appreciation night :-)"}
{"text":"Looks like a long line but it goes fast.  Great place for breakfast with the family."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the service was terrible! 45 minutes in line just for a couple of (pretty tasty) burgers and fries. There was a line out the door at 11 on a saturday morning, and they only had one window open. You could see from the line that the cooks were often standing and doing nothing because they were only taking one order at a time. Overall, 2 stars for the service, 4 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Love love love Joe's! Decided to try the indoor/outdoor restaurant located near Agritopia in Gilbert after it was featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives, and it did not disappoint! Everything is extremely fresh, and the staff always friendly. The burgers are delicious & the milkshakes too! They've got a menu to please everyone. Will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! We come here all the time during the winter and spring--just a little too hot to sit outside during the summer!"}
{"text":"The garlic fries are AMAZING!  The food is always fresh & unique!  The staff never disappoints with their friendliness and willingness to provide you with the best dining experience!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is what my mom said when we brought her here, \"I have to be honest, when we pulled up I thought 'W-T-F,' but now I'm mad you've never brought me here before!\"  My favorite things are the Date Shakes and the seared ahi tuna sandwich. Everything here is so fresh- the produce, the atmosphere, the decor. I love that they use produce from their backyard! There are always rotating specials too.  This is something else I appreciate about the staff- they always offer HELPFUL advice. I feel like they're honest and sincere with their suggestions and have not steered me wrong yet!"}
{"text":"First time and definitely won't be the last!  Their veggie pizza is amazing! The owner Sumer ( I think she's an owner or manger ) was very sweet to my boyfriend and me. Always smiling and interacting with her customers. If you haven't been here yet go! You will not regret it! Only thing if you get lemonade get the strawberry lemonade the regular one is tart unless you like that ( I do, my boyfriend doesn't ) Also their milkshakes are okay. But defiantly come!(:"}
{"text":"This place is a total joy that I didn't even mind waiting in the long line that other Yelpers have mentioned. Granted, I wasn't starving when I arrived and we were catching up with friends while in line so our wait didn't seem THAT long. But there's still a line so be prepared to wait. Once we got to the counter and ordered our food arrived fairly quickly. The food really does taste amazingly fresh. It's a little pricier than your average burger joint but this place has a unique appeal to it with it's farm fresh food. My hubster loved the sonoran hot dog and we tried the grilled PBJ which was pretty darn good. Their garlic fries are to die for - I should have probably ordered more of those to take home. We even tried a strawberry milkshake - a total treat for us since we hate wasting calories on beverages - but this one was worth the splurge.   The place itself is really cute with picnic tables under giant trees. We went on a Friday evening so it was really nice to just relax and enjoy our meals outside. We do plan on going back though it is quite a trip for us from North Phoenix. But trust me, we will find a way!"}
{"text":"First, I am not from the East Valley.  Second, Josh K's review is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.  He must be trying to get something for free out of Joe's or he has NO taste for food.  With that said...  This is quite possibly my favorite restaurant anywhere.  The BBQ chicken pizza is awesome.  The Bleu Bacon BBQ burger is the single best hamburger I've ever eaten.  The BBQ sauce with the bleu cheese is SO good.  Their BBQ chicken salad is phenomenal.  And, if you come for breakfast, their blueberry pancakes will knock your socks off!!!  I can not recommend this place more highly, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity!!! I come here every year for my birthday and I get $10 off my total. I ordered a pulled pork barbecue sandwich with french fries and coleslaw on my birthday in February. It was delicious especially with the garlic sauce. I don't know how the sauce gets a green color but i love it!! I highly recommend this place to anyone!! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool...my friend used to live in agritopia (the neighborhood that this restaurant is in)...and when i was over at her place we were trying to figure out where to go for dinner...she suggested we go here and i was like y not it sounded fine...so we get in the car and it was 30 seconds and we were there...it is situated in this little orchard/park/garden like area...so cute and very farm like...but without the bad smells and animals... You walk in and grab a menu and wait in line...this place was packed...you have to wait in line to order your food...they have an awesome menu...first of all their bbq chicken pizza is delicious!!! Its handmade and they but sprinkles of blue cheese or gorganzola cheese on top...yummy they have this bbq pulled pork sandwich...umm fabulous...the garlic fries and sweet potato fries i would give up my left arm for...they have these amazing shakes and malts and they have a flavor of the week or month i forget which one...you can get the staple flavors like chocolate, vanilla and strawberry too...it is all just reat food...so u order and they give you a little buzzer and you wait for your food...its open seating inside and outside...if u go with a group secure a table first because this place has been packed everytime i go...you dispense your own condiments and drinks...it is just so cute...this place has done something very very right...i wish it werent out in gilbert...but what can you do? I love this place and if im out that way im going to stop by...try it...its worth the drive...its great for families with kids...the kids csn play outside and its casual..."}
{"text":"Very good food and nice grounds.  Had BBQ. Bacon burger and it was a 10.  Onion rings and sweet potato fries good too.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"A well deserving 5 stars! I love this place. The view, the quality of the food, the workers, the soda, the pickles. Everything perfect! I didn't take a picture of my food because I was starving and picked the fork up immediately upon receiving it.   Between the four of us we ordered a kids cheeseburger with fries, a grilled salmon Cesar Salad, the farmhouse chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese garlic fries (bomb.com). The pepper jack cheese is extremely spicy because it has ghost peppers in it. The lady behind the register warned us so that was fine. Lastly, I ordered the grilled salmon plate with grilled asparagus, beet salad and cauliflower. Everything was excellent. We dined in silence .... you know what that means   The set up is .... you walk up to the counter, order your meals, get a buzzer and a drink cup if you order it and grab a seat. They'll bring your food out to you. The restrooms are outside. There's plenty, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Super family and friends friendly. I'll definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is a great place to go with your family! You place your order then go find a seat (my favorite is sitting outside with my dog) and they bring the food to you. I was pleasantly surprised that the food is much more healthy and fresh than what I was expecting. Definitely a win win for the kids & the adults. Make sure to check out the bathrooms when you go - the decor is rather interesting, lol!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location. Gorgeous grounds, incredibly beautiful and old trees; an outdoor eating area that is so pleasant. The food is good too! But really, the atmosphere is the best part; even when I arrived on a cool and rainy day! Pretty large portions and good quality ingredients! Recommend for families and you can even bring your dogs!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Love the Southwest Burger. Great to see the owners in there chatting customers and helping out in the kitchen as well.  Lemonade is amazing! Best I've had!"}
{"text":"From the garden to your plate is as fresh as you can get. Sit outside and enjoy your meal while you watch the plants grow. Hard to choose from the menu cause it had so many appealing choices. Also rare soda choices inside that are refreshingly different. Restaurant was featured on the food channel so it has some well known items one of them being the onion rings if you like them crispy like I do highly recommend"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and trying out restaurants, so we tried this one. Very crowded and under construction, so we barely found a place to sit. Ordering was quick and easy, and food was ready in a good amount of time. The overall taste wasn't the best; I didn't leave thinking we had to come back for more. I had the chicken sandwich and my husband had the sampler plate. It was all regular tasting BBQ for us, nothing incredible. Lots of flies, but I'm sure once the construction is finished everything will be cleaned up. I've heard their shakes are great so maybe it was just what we ordered."}
{"text":"I love joes! They have some of the best hamburgers around and I'm not much if a fan of burgers. I know a ton of people rave about the pizza but I don't think that is their best item. If the weather is nice, sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.  Side note about the flies- yes in the summer they can get bad. It has FARM in its name though, so I'd you don't like nature you might want to skip it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The menu was unique and reasonably priced. The restrooms were interesting (TV and all). Good service, nice place to meet with a group."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with family. The burgers are awesome, but can be inconsistent. They come medium rare which is perfect, but sometimes it's a little too rare. You can have them remake it if that's the case. Pickles on the burgers are homemade and delicious! All the sides are great, too. I especially like the garlic fries, zucchini, and Asian slaw."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service is much to be desired. After being spoiled by Joe's Real BBQ, the ordering system is below par and getting your food is slow.  I wish Joe would figure out a better way to do this."}
{"text":"Joe understands the dining experience.  Casual dining with great food.  Soup to nuts, it's great.  Today, the breakfast burger.  Tomorrow, the tuna.  Just great food."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Only downside is the line when you go at peak times. You know they have great food when the line is streaming out the doors."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH! If I could give this place 1000 stars I would! My husband took me here & it is by far the best breakfast in the valley! We both got he pancake combo & it was absolutely delicious! The pancakes melt in your mouth & the eggs are so good! Definitely come here!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hard restaurant to read! I love the environment, I love the idea, but the food is not great. I had a salad, my husband had a hotdog, one son had a burger, and the other son had chicken. We all had mixed feelings in that it was good but not great. Given the price , I expected more."}
{"text":"Had Joe's Farm Grill for the first time today.  It was outstanding.  We had the fried zucchini awesome and I had the fontina burger and was by far the best burger I've had.  Fries were also perfectly delicious. Big line and I can see why but everyone was moving fast and we didn't  wait long. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Mix outdoor picnic tables with mid century modern indoor furniture by Vitra and what do you get? Joe's most eclectic collection yet. This guy really has an eye for design, and pairing great food with it doesn't hurt. I don't want to post 5 stars because I'm so fanatical about this place and realize it might not be for everyone, but if you appreciate great tasting food in the $8-$12 range, turn back the clock design and a very helpful crew of employees, go here now!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is great with tasty burgers, gourmet hot dogs, pizzas, salads and sandwiches. I have had several items on the menu and all have been very good not quite 5 star delicious but above average for sure. I really like the 4B burger with bacon, blue cheese and barbecue sauce. My wife loves the buffalo chicken sandwich grilled and fried depending on the desired healthy eating. I have had the Sonaran hot dog and it is very good not quite as amazing as the el guerra canela Sonoran but easier to get to than Tucson. Overall good food and a great outside eating area for large groups and families."}
{"text":"Joes farm grill is so much fun! The atmosphere is awesome and the food is the best! We love doing family outings here and just walking around the area!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the lines are long for waiting especially on weekends.  I would go either early or off times."}
{"text":"My family and I loved the food and the outdoor picnic setting. We all ordered burgers and had no complaints. The highlight of our meal was the fried zucchini...it was delicious! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the menu here, they also have a sister location in downtown Gilbert call Joes real BBQ. Here at Joes farm you will the freshest salads with grilled mushrooms or grilled chicken. I suggest getting both. Really great place to eat with kids and family."}
{"text":"Wow! The fontina burger, onion rings, and pumpkin shake! Cannot say enough good things about them. This place has made it into my top 10!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Saturday morning omelets at work happens frequently.  Good service and good food here's a reason they're always busy!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the area. I come here when ever im in Gilbert Az. BBQ Chicken pizza is also very good. It's grilled not baked! All fresh ingredients grown on site. Dont miss this place if in the area."}
{"text":"What the heck is not to love about Joe's? The food, the people, the place. They just do it really well.  Seriously, it's all good. One of my favorites would be the BBQ Bacon Blue burger. Yes, it's *really* good. Ever had a grilled peanut butter and banana split sandwich? Yeah, you should go ahead and try the one Joe makes..."}
{"text":"Beautiful scenery!! Food was delicious &  price is very reasonable .  Great place to be out with family , friends and pets."}
{"text":"I know this place doesn't need another review so I will keep it short and sweet. Joe's Farm Grill is a great  desert gym. I had the Fontina Burger with the Garlic Fries and I literally dreamt about it the next night. I plan on going back to try the other items. The only negative is the lack of indoor seating. I would recommend staking out a seat before you order so that way you don't get stuck outside with the flies."}
{"text":"Our family who lives in Gilbert loves this place and were anxious for us to try it. We arrived at 3pm on Sunday and the line was out the door.  It took about 30 minutes to get to the window to order.  That gave us lots of time to keep changing our mind on what to order.  One couple split the Ahi sandwich with onions rings and beet salad and loved it (their \"go to\" on the menu). One couple split the Thai salad and said it was ok...a little spicy for them.  We ordered the pull pork sandwich with onion rings and the burger with sautéed onions and added sautéed mushrooms.  The pulled pork was a little dry.  You have to add bottled bbq sauce after it arrives at the table.  We prefer pulled pork sandwiches that have the bbq sauce tossed in with the pork and Cole slaw added.  The onion rings were quite good.   The burger was really good, but the fries were not very hot or crispy.  I love fries but they have to be hot and crispy.  They were disappointing, but it saved me calories.   The food came out of the kitchen pretty quickly and the staff was super friendly.  We loved all of the picnic benches outside as we had wonderful weather.   It was nice and relaxing.   We would come here again to try other items."}
{"text":"Wow, had a horrible experience tonight, ordered 2 burgers and told the manager Matt, no sides as in no fries, just the burgers.  Got home and the 2 burgers didn't have buns.  Called back and Matt said he misunderstood my order, he then offered to give me the buns if I drove all the way back(not that he cared that my food would get cold), I said no, thanks.  I waited for him to say, I'm sorry and next time you come in, I'll make it right and get you 2 new burgers.  No, he refused.  I guess the farm grill doesn't care about customer satisfaction?  Please look to companies like Costco and Southwest Airlines who know how to take care of customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a total post-modern 1950s-style diner, complete with a retro building design and counter service controlled by computerized buzzers that go off when your order is ready. It has been featured several times on the Food Network, and was on an episode of Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,\" which have definitely put the restaurant on the map.   Everything about the place has character.  For example, the menu has standard hamburgers, as well as unique and tasty items like the Ahi Sandwich, or whatever special they happen to offer that is not on the menu.  When I was there, they were offering Pork Tenderloin and fresh-squeezed lemonade.  Everything we got was great.   The restaurant itself is located on a working farm, and has a nifty little outdoor seating area with benches underneath a huge and ancient pepper tree that provides some shade from the heat of the sun.  There is also a little grassy area where kids can run around, play, or have a picnic.  After you eat, you can also walk through various areas of the farm.  You can make your visit here a short one, or stay all afternoon.  There's a lot to see.   Though there are only two bathrooms, they are clean, and feature old school barbies and G.I. Joes in stainless steel, LED-lit cases in the walls.  They've also got old episodes of the Thunderbirds playing on small T.V.'s.  It's unique and compellingly awesome, like so much about this restaurant.   Be advised, however, that it can get slammed with customers on the weekends, and if you don't get there before the rush, be prepared to wait!  This is despite the fact that they are prepared to handle volume and pump out the food at an incredibly fast pace.   Overall if you are in the area, this place is worth trying at least once, for the experience.  In my opinion it's worth going back several times, just to try all the food."}
{"text":"What a great place to take out of town guests. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. A nice touch is the signs warning of scorpions in the trees. It truly is a great treat. I'm hungry just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try out this place for awhile but haven't made it out to Gilbert.    My Fiance and I shared the ahi tuna sandwich, which had a very generous portion of ahi and was cooked with a nice sear on the outside and served rare.  The sandwich comes on a brioche bun which is soft and delicious.  Four our side we choose the Asian slaw, which is a cool and tasty variation on traditional coleslaw.  We also ordered the garlic parmesan fries which came out crispy, hot and  lots of tasty parmesan and garlic sauce - they were addicting!   Looking forward to coming back and trying one of their burgers!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland flavor food. Bad combination.   The service was fast with friendly attentive staffs.  Atmosphere is nice but there are tons of flies outside. This is end of April.  Again, highly overpriced and the food flavoring is boring.."}
{"text":"I've driven past Joe's a dozen or more times but never went.    A couple weekends ago I went with my 12 year old and I think she liked it as much as I did.  It's a cute little place with plenty of places to sit outside in the great AZ weather.  The temp and blue skies were perfect the day we went.   Even though the wait was long it was well worth it.  We sat out back under one of the gigantic trees while we waited.  It smelled like a weekend barbecue and it was actually quite relaxing.  We split a burger and fries which was the perfect amount for us.  My daughter got a chocolate shake that was absolutely yummy and I got the ginger ale made with real cane sugar.  It is such a refreshing change from the sugary sweet sodas.  I think the price was a little high but I would rather pay more for good quality food than buy something off the dollar menu these days."}
{"text":"Been here many times.   Great food and service.  Line to order can get long.  But that probably tells u something. So go early.  No Alcohol."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place to eat in Arizona.  The food is freakin AMAZING. The staff is top notch and provides some of the best service I've seen in a very long time.   Ive returned several times and must come here every time I'm visiting from out of state.  Thanks everyone for great service."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE Joe's Farm Grill! We've been here many times since moving to Gilbert last fall. It was exciting to go to a restaurant that was featured on the Food Network Channel. I really like that they have a big grassy area in the back for kids to run around.   All of the food we've had there is fantastic - from the fried zucchini to the wood fire flatbread pizzas to the grilled chicken sandwiches. You can't go wrong with anything from Joe's. Oh - and the portions are big. They use farm fresh ingredients in all of their dishes that comes from their farm adjacent to the restaurant.   It does get busy during peak times (because its so good!) so be ready to wait in line. Definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"I get the whole farm fresh \"organic\" thing. I guess I was expecting to be wowed by this place.  I love the fact that you can sit outdoors because they have the misters going. After all, who wants to sit outside in 110 degrees?? You can also sit inside if you choose.   It is a great place to bring your family. They have big benches you can all sit on.  The breakfast was good. I enjoyed the pancakes. It was okay."}
{"text":"If I lived closer I would be eating at Joe's Farm Grill all the time. The best part of the place is atmosphere. The grounds are huge and kids run around. The architecture is retro and impressive.  The bathrooms are a real trip, decorated with Barbie dolls, GI Joe's (hence \"Joe's\" Farm grill) and these bizarre kid's videos are playing above the urinal. We had the Ahi Tuna sandwich which was good, but not great. We also got a burger, pizza and onion rings. All the food was tasty. This is a great place to go when the nights get cooler. If you want to eat outdoors, this place is top-notch."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my birthday breakfast and had the short ribs and waffles. It was really good and I highly recommended it. I went when breakfast was ending and they were about to serve lunch so the line wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The staff is very friendly and helpful with helping me decide what to get since it was my first time. My kids had the French toast sticks and loved it also. I am looking forward to trying their lunch menu in the future. Everything on their menu sounds amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place excellent food and environment. Just wish they had more indoor seating but aside from that one of my faves."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a Saturday trip out to Gilbert.   Was very busy with lots of families but line moved as quickly as possible and food was up as fast as one could expect.   Order chicken sandwich with garlic fries and a chicken salad. Sandwich was ok but fries were solid and actually chicken barbecue was best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  My personal favorites are the BBQ Bacon & Bleu Burger, Portobella Sandwich, Pulled Pork Sandwich, sweet potato fries with pineapple serrano sauce, and the garlic fries.  My sister loves the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and my mom loves the shakes.  My son loves the kids meals and the atmosphere, and really likes a side of the beans that come with the breakfast meal, which aren't on the menu, but you can usually get if they don't run out.  It can get very crowded here, especially on weekends near meal time, so have someone in your party grab a seat before you get in line if you can."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant. Good food. Good service. Salmon (middle wasn't cooked through), beet salad, asparagus and fries. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's fresh, food is always delicious, reasonable prices, and right up the street from me!"}
{"text":"They have the Farm Veggie burger as a vegan option. It's pretty good. A bean patty on a whole wheat bun with veggies, pickles, and vegan thousand island. I always order with fries. You order at the counter, the line can be out the door sometimes, and then you get a buzzer. It can take a little while to get your food so I usually go find a place to sit and hang out while I wait for my food. I bring friends here all the time! Since I can only eat one thing on the menu (I'm pretty sure) I sometimes just pop over to the coffee shop and grab something there instead. Like the whole area, there's indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor has shaded spots and misters. At night they have barnyard wedding style lights strung up. There's sometimes random things going on like one time there was a bird meet up in the outdoor seating area. People who owned birds brought their parrots etc. to come hang out. Of course that was the time I brought my friend who is terrified of birds with me. We sat inside, it all worked out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, due to all the hype and countless recommendations, Joe's Farm Grill just doesn't live up to the hoopla.  We have been trying to eat here for quite some time, but I am one of those people who does not have the patience to stand in a long line and then stress out trying to find a place to sit before my food comes out. Today, a Sunday, at 12:45pm the line was relatively short, and by relatively short, I mean not out the door.  My husband ordered while my son & I went scavenging for an inside table (104 degrees out today and the indoor seating is scarce), which I cleaned off with an anti-bacterial wet wipe from my purse.  The food was okay.  I won't be rushing back.  Actually, I probably won't be back at all.  My son ordered a strawberry shake, which the strawberries were clearly frozen, not fresh.  The onion rings, that are boasted as being on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" is nothing to brag about.  As matter of fact they came to the table luke-warm and with very little flavor. My husband and I had the chicken pesto sandwich with coleslaw. Sandwich was ok, mushrooms had good flavor, but otherwise it was pretty bland. Coleslaw was much of the same, bland. Good crunchy slaw, but nothing special about the flavor.  Overall, the food was edible, nothing outstanding, but nothing horrible. I was really expecting something incredible, especially since we love Joe's BBQ.  :("}
{"text":"used to love coming here  not sure if management has changed ...will not be back ... service is ok... buns where soggy and burgers where not as good as they used to be  ... I found a plastic and a hair inside our food.. I spoke to the manager and she wasn't very apologetic I had to ask for my money back ..."}
{"text":"Good place for common food!!!. Ingredients tasted incredibly fresh for a dessert restaurant. LOVE the garlic fries. Nice view of the Superstition mountain.   Be prepared to wait, everyone wants to try this delicious food."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME, wow I was impressed.   I came here because I say the yelp reviews (700+) and I was in the neighborhood which is on the WAY east side. The inside is super unique and cool. This is a semi-fast kind of joint, order at the window but boy is it worth it.   I had the Fontina Burger, and is was phenomenal!!! Every bite made my salivary glands kick into action. I had a similar feeling when eating at DMK in Chicago. (not comparing to DMK but similar feeling). I would def recommend this place and a place to show people.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've visited a lot. I came before they expanded the inside portion. I love what they've changed. More indoor seating, staff bring you you're food, nicer dinnerware, and tractor soda bar inside (no more bees yay). I've tried many of their burgers and they're okay--others really enjoy them. I personally go for the garlic fries and the REAL milkshakes. Seriously two best menu items. The garlic fries leave you stinky, but definitely satisfied. The milkshakes are the size of an adult forearm and come fully equipped with whipped cream and cherry and are so worth the $5.50. I always get strawberry--which is made with real strawberries not the fake stuff like other places. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and great for families. Watch out on Friday's, as you will be greeted with a line out the door because they're that good. I recently tried the buffalo chicken sandwich and found a new favorite! Perfect balance of grill flavor and spice. Next time I hope to try their pizza. You won't be disappointed here. When it's cooler, enjoy the beautiful grounds outside. The story behind this place is very magical, too so don't forget to watch the story on the tv while you wait in the line to order."}
{"text":"had lunch here today with Rand H and Robyn N. I had the the hot dog with pulled pork on it and baked potato fries and both of these were awesome. Rand H. gave me one of his onion rings and it was probably the best onion ring I have ever tasted.After are great lunch I stopped at the coffee shop and grabbed a berry scone and some type of orange chocolate filled cookie and both of those were great as well. So with nothing I could say negative about the place I give them 5 stars and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"To be honest, I came here just for the free birthday meal every year.  I live way too far to be driving down here just for the yummy and delicious food.  Service was great and the food is just excellent.  I try to order different things from the menu and I usually order something else and not just get the free food and leave.  Great family tradition, thanks.  Now I just wish they can open up another location up north."}
{"text":"A gilbert gem! This place has awesome customer service, ambiance, and food. The sweet potato fires, onion rkngs, milkshakes, fontina burger, and BBQ chicken pizza are my favorites on the menu.  Make sure to visit on your birthday for 10 off your meal!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times before and LOVED it. Today however was not as great as our previous visits the food still awesome, the people working friendly but they had a awful fly situation going on that made my mom and I totally lose our appetites. Hope they fix it ASAP!"}
{"text":"What an interesting find in the Phoenix metro!  Brought to you by the same folks that run Joe's Real BBQ (also in Gilbert) this place is so fresh and so good.  Located in south Gilbert, you feel like you're eating outside in the country.  Phoenix couldn't feel farther away.    The food was fantastic, and there are a lot of fresh, whimsical, and interesting players on the menu.  I went for a burger with BBQ sauce, onion ring, bacon, and blue cheese...pretty much my standard burger toppings, and it didn't disappoint in the slightest.  Simon got the ahi tuna sandwich, and he said it was excellent.  We shared some garlic fries, which were covered in fresh garlic and parmesan cheese, and dripping in butter.  They were fantastic.  Luckily all of us ate them so that no one could accuse the other of having bad breath.    I loved that you have the option to eat outside, sitting on picnic tables underneath giant trees.  It's just not an environment that you see much in the valley."}
{"text":"I love to visit Joe's Farm Grill when visiting my sister in Gilbert.  Everything is so fresh as delicious.  I always get the burger with red peppers and a side of the roasted beets.  I've also been here for breakfast and the food is just as delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is at a great location.  Not a convenient location for me, but eating at a farm is quite charming.  I really like that you have the option to eat indoors or a number of different places outdoors.    The facility is such a futuristic looking building, yet it's on a farm.  Quite trippy.  The bathrooms are clean, and they have a convenient hand washing station located near the restrooms.    The food tastes fresh and tasty.  I just had a cheeseburger, garlic fries, and a soda.  Some say it's a little pricey, but I think the prices are on par with Carl's Jr.  Believe me, you'd rather be eating food from Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Arizona, my in-laws took my husband and I to Joe's Farm Grill for breakfast before we had to go to the airport. I've never been to a restaurant like this before. It's actually a little hard to describe. There are two places to eat. There's a cafe and a grill. I'm really not sure if there's a difference. We were going to go to the cafe but the line was really long so we went to the grill. This required walking through the outside areas and gave me a chance to take in the whole place. There are community farm plots outside and several interesting outdoor eating spaces. The coolest was one around a massive oak tree.   The restaurant is in an old converted house and some dining areas still look like a 50s-style ranch--which I think is pretty cool. Anyway, on to the food. I had the Huevos de Farm Grill which was good but not exactly what I was expecting. It's scrambled eggs with pulled pork, beans and fried tortillas. It was good but I didn't expect the pork to be mixed in with the eggs. My husband had the breakfast tacos and they were really good. Everything was fresh and delicious. Nothing tasted processed or fake. I'd definitely go back for the food but probably on a cooler day so I could sit out by the oak. The drawbacks are that you eat on plastic plates, which somewhat ruins the whole eco-friendly vibe, and the bathrooms are outside. The bathrooms are really cool. They have Barbie and GI Joe dolls encased in backlit shadow boxes. They really went for the 50s nostalgia. It feels like you're in a spaceship. However, I just really don't like going outside to use the toilet unless I'm sitting outside.   Like I said, this was overall a great experience and I would definitely go back the next time I'm visiting my family in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is good just not all that great. Hard to find parking and a very long wait for fast food quality items. Just because the restaurant is on a farm doesn't mean it is all organic or high quality. Mormon central thats for sure! so be prepared to be overwhelmed with large families and children running all over the place"}
{"text":"I really love this place and I'm not even a burger head!!! This is an amazing outdoor for families!! The food is absolutely greasy good! I would definitely be back for more even though it's really out of my way!! 15 miles!"}
{"text":"The food overall was good and fresh. The outdoor condiment bar is a great idea so we can get different toppings. The hamburger buns were really good too.   The line was very long though, and I don't suggest outdoor seating, although the surroundings were so nice and the misters keep you really cool. The flies are just overwhelming.   I'd just say though I didn't see what was so special about the food, but I did just get a cheeseburger. It's like a really expensive and big In and Out. Two cheeseburger meals were about $21-22 and the wait was overall about 20 minutes.  I have heard great things about the chicken and zucchini though, so I'll probably try it again. Everything was very clean for how busy they were."}
{"text":"I understand that Joe's Farm Grill is very popular as a result of Diners, Drive-Ins,& Dives, but after going a couple of times, I fail to understand all the hype.  I've had both the Farm Chicken Sandwich & the BBQ Chicken Flatbread. The sandwich was not that great; I ordered it with American cheese & grilled onions ... & the fries that it came with left much to desire as they were ridiculously salty & greasy. The flatbread was not a much better alternative.  The price isn't worth the quality & the restaurant is out of the way from everything so I don't see myself making the drive out there much. Also, most of the seating is outdoors & there are a lot of flies. 2 stars is even being a little generous but it's nice to know they use local ingredients from the farm."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about JFG! I came for the first time a couple of years ago almost when our best friends moved to Gilbert.  We make sure we go there EVERY TIME we are in the area -- it was also fun to see that it was a Triple D and to check out what items Guy Fieri checked out.  I unfortunately haven't spread out from my norm much because I love my burger with bleu cheese and mushrooms on it! Their different fries like the garlic fries and loaded baked potato fries are delish, and their onion rings are DELIGHTFUL.  They make KILLER homemade lemonade (I get the Strawberry!) and know how to make a mean milkshake.  Everything else I've seen on the menu that people have gotten have looked nothing short of amazing so maybe one day I'll stray from the norm!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place several times and I'll tell you why: ingredients taste fresh and inventive combinations exist throughout.  They are generous with portions and the setting is relaxed, family-oriented, but still interesting and very tasty food options that go beyond your typical burger and hot dog.  I've had the breakfast Fontina burger and was in gooey-fat heaven, the banana pudding, the double dogs (in natural casings!), the Ahi Tuna salad (so amazing!).  The bathroom is the ultimate weirdness experience, but you gotta try it!  I like going here with friends or family for breakfast or for lunch (only been to dinner time once) and it is such a nice view of a great big tree, a garden and farm property.  I look forward to eating at this place."}
{"text":"This place BY FAR has the best BBQ ribs! I've wanted to try this place for a long time. So happy to say I have! Oooooo it sure was tasty"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner here! Loved the relaxed atmosphere, and the easy ordering/seating. The Thai chicken salad was just okay, but the Fontina burger was amazing. LOVED the strawberry lemonade , and the onion rings and garlic fries were to die for."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and had two very different expereinces. For lunch I would give this 5 stars. The hot dogs are fantastic. Really good buns that are toasted and great selection of toppings. The fries are also very good. The bbq chicken pizza has so many great flavors on it. Really good.   Breakfast was a different story. My omlette tasted like someone dropped the salt shaker in it. It wasn't even edible. My mom got a waffle and it wasn't fully cooked. the middle was still gooey dough. Had I not had my sister insisting that the hot dogs were amazing we would not have gone back.   So for lunch I reccomend this place,  especially with the great weather and all the outdoor seating. Five stars for their non breakfast items!"}
{"text":"What a delight! This place somehow has found a way to take something that was already really good both in quality and service and exponentially make it better!  Joe, you are a gem in the valley and I'm truly thankful that you serve us some great food, excellent ambiance and a lifetime of memories.   And the water cups are super cute!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside and enjoy a good meal I love there garlic fries. Also if you love milk shakes this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Joes Farm Grill breakfast tacos. Where have you been my whole life. These three tacos are so good with chicken potatoes eggs and seasoned perfectly. I love the beans that you get with the meal. You will be full after these tacos, they are not extra large but i assure you they are enough for a large man to be full from breakfast. I will be back for them for sure. I think they were about 8 dollars or so."}
{"text":"They have wonderful food. I never thought their food could be a good as their sister restaurant Joe's Real BBQ, but it is. The ribs are fantastic. They even do a breakfast with waffles and ribs. And the staff are very courteous and respectful of allergies. My wife is allergic to dairy, so they all cleaned the grills and put on new gloves just for her order. Also the location is great and has plenty of space to do a picnic. I love Joe's!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always fresh. Bring all my out of town guests here always something for everyone.  My favorite has to be the cheeseburger and fries.  Milkshake to top it off."}
{"text":"Best Lemonade ever!! No line after 5 on a Wednesday evening.. Amazing Fast service, very cute & quiet spot"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Always a great place to eat.  I wish they would bring back the jalapeño, sausage gravy.  That was delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered: 2 Fontina Burgers one with french fries the other with the beet salad, Ahi Tuna burger, Farm burger with cheese, BBQ Chicken salad, Blackberry milkshake, and a lemonade. Everything here was delicious! I had the Fontina burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! I ordered the pecan pesto on the side since I wasn't sure if I was going to like that, but it was pretty good! My Dad used it as a dipping sauce for this french fries. The lemonade was MASSIVE and super refreshing! After walking around Agritopia and The Farm in the hot sun this was the perfect place to have lunch. Ther service was friendly and the place was clean and full of character. I would definitely come back here when I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"They by far have the best chicken fingers I have ever had!! Love coming here for both the food and quick service. It's easy to call and pick up within 10 minutes. Oh and the garlic fries... AMAZING!! They simply know customer service here and care about the community. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more, The vibe was cool, loved the outdoor dining space, really LOVE the locavore aspect, heck even the bathrooms are cool.  But the bottom line is that the food is \"good\" not great. I went for the sustainable, local angle, but the  food tasted average and the prices were high. They really work hard on the marketing, but are they really tasting the food?  I had the ribs and my wife had a veggie burger. Fries were cold and limp, BBQ sauce nothing to write home about. We compared notes and did not feel that the food was worth the wait or the price. MEH.  Onion rings were amazing.  It felt like marketing and style over substance.   The wait is interminable (2 visits) - tough on kids to wait that long. it felt like the lines for Space Mountain during spring break.  If they regularly have 30 minute + waits to get to a single order window, why not open another?"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic breakfast here today! Joes grows much of their own produce, and the result is fresh tasting dishes, made to order at great prices.   My friend and I split two dishes- the pancakes with bacon and the chicken egg scramble. The pancakes were fluffy and light, served with tasty syrup and whipped butter of course! The chicken in the scramble was so succulent and flavourful, and the veggies still had a nice bite to them.   Good strong coffee rounded out the meal, not to mention dining out back in the sunshine! Will definitely be back to try out the lunch options!"}
{"text":"One of my best experience. Service is on point, food is magnificent. The veggies are from the farm to your plate. I'm a creature of habit, I love the giant shrimp & cesar salad. I'm a repeat customer and a satisfied customer. This is the real deal. Joe's Farm Grill, makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"My family and I were so excited to try Joe's Farm Grill after the reviews, hype and waiting 30 minutes in the line out the door. I went with some of the items sampled by The Food Network. I had the Fontina Burger and the onion rings and figured, why not, let's try the dark chocolate shake too. I don't like mushrooms so I added avocado and took off the mushrooms on the burger. It was a very tasty burger. And they made substitutions with no issues. The onion rings were crispy and good, but not to-die for. The shake was average. It was just chocolate not dark chocolate in my opinion and not worth the calories. I think the favorite item by consensus in my group was the ribs.   The outdoor seating is beautiful. I loved being surrounded by gardens and sitting under a gigantic tree. Very tranquil, peaceful setting. So after our nice pleasant dinner I got up to ask where the recycle bins were for the plastic drink cups. I mean, come on, this is Joe's FARM grill adjacent to Agritopia's organic gardens and their own 24-hour \"FARM\" stand where you can pick up items and pay via envelope. And the answer I got was, \"WE DON'T HAVE RECYCLE BINS.\" Are you kidding me? How can a place like this NOT have recycle bins much less a composting bin? Which leads me to believe that Joe's is all hype and slick marketing. I didn't expect them to be cooking with solar ovens, but seriously? Any place that is going to have FARM in the name and advertise organic ingredients should at least offer one fricken recycle bin. I will never return to this place. I'll stick to places in the valley that really believe in farming and sustainability: The FARM at South Mountain, Essence Bakery, Hillside Spot and even Chipotle. So utterly disappointing."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS AMAZING. It is so good that its worth even flying into AZ just to eat here. This is seriously one of the best places Ive eaten in my life. Their Ahi Tuna sandwich is beyond words. Please eat here. Its worth it even if there is a long line"}
{"text":"Great natural  outdoor setting with tables inside and out.  Casual diner like setting.  Gooey, tasty grilled cheese.  (Hard not to screw grilled fatty cheese!) Onion rings were crisp and tasty.......just missing tartar sauce.  (They only offer it on Fridays with their fish.) This British Columbian gal understands that it is  not a tradition in AZ to  serve tartar sauce with onion rings.  Nevertheless, I make my own with the relish, mayo and lemon juice they have in the restaurant kitchen to suffice!  ;). Once you try an onion ring with a creamy, tangy tartar sauce, it is hard to go without!"}
{"text":"I had a very delicious freshly prepared burger, fries, onion rings, and a shake! So good! The atmosphere is awesome too! They have a nice outdoor seating area with a huge tree for shade. As well as an indoor area, that is really crowded. This place deserves the great reputation that it has!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Last time we were there we asked for fried shrimp. Paid for it and waited...and waited...and waited. About 20 minutes, we asked where our food was. They check on it and said it will be a few more minutes. A couple minutes pass by and the manager comes over to tell us that they had no more shrimp. They offered to get us another meal but I wasn't wanting anything else as I haven't been impressed with the other things we've got there before. They didn't offer a refund. Instead they gave us a $10 gift card to use at either the grill or BBQ place."}
{"text":"Joe's is great.  Great family place.  Great ambiance.  Great food.   You'll know this is true because this place always has a line.  I've yet to find something I didn't really care for.  Bathrooms are clean.  I can't say much more than the other hundred reviews haven't already said.   Get here!"}
{"text":"I can't believe all the 5 star ratings. This place is ok at best! I love the atmosphere and being able to \"picnic\" outside, but it is heavily overpriced and everything is just ok. Don't get me wrong we go there from time to time but that's just to sit outside. Friendly advice.... don't get their homemade soda it's horrible.  $50 for two people to eat burgers and lemonade is kinda crazy.....Just sayin'"}
{"text":"I love Joes Farm Grill. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. But recently when I was sick on my birthday and couldn't get there for my $10 birthday deal, I came back three days later to celebrate my wife's birthday and explained my situation to the manager. She explained that they couldn't help me even with my extenuating circumstances. She said her family couldn't even be given exceptions which I would not expect. While I will continue to be a fan of Joe's, and I know they do 6,000 birthday meals a week, it still seems like giving some consideration to a loyal customers special situation would have been warranted. I'm disappointed that they do not allow for special cases. I understand their position and that there are those people who would take advantage of another's honesty, but naturally I am disappointed and wanted to express my displeasure."}
{"text":"Eating at Joe's is like Sunday lunch at Grandmas farm.  Outside seating on picnic tables under huge shade trees.  Today we ordered the pesto chicken on multigrain bun side of beet salad. Onion rings too.  Everything cooked to perfection.  Try to come before or after traditional meal time. The line is very long otherwise.  Food is sooo worth it.  Check out the milk shake of the day.  Today's was butter pecan."}
{"text":"great food and friendly service. I recommend the 1/2 lb burger. Fresh beef the way you want a hamburger to taste."}
{"text":"Did not like the food, pancakes not cooked through, counter service for breakfast. This place was horrible!  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Cost $50 for three adults (we did upgrade our fries and all got burgers and drinks).  The garlic fries are good, but greasy. Onion rings were good, but I like my onions thinner (too much onion on these ones, but some are into that). My brother LOVED the sweet potato fries! Burgers were awesome! I love the buns they are on. Awesome portions for everything! The green beans were OK, but don't have a lot of taste to them, I wouldn't get them again.  I love the atmosphere and would come back for another burger."}
{"text":"Impressed by Joe's Farm Grill's unique concept, great ethos (Agritopia, 12 acres of urban farming), fun environment. Actual offerings could use some improvement.  4 for locally sourced, fresh ingredients, community farming plots, fun/retro atmosphere, beautiful, spacious groves, light-strung trees after dusk 3.5 for variety of offerings 2.8 for execution / pricing  3 Fontina burger (4 fixings, 2.8 burger) - the fixings definitely made the burger (roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, field greens, farm-made pecan pesto, fontina), but was disappointed with the bland, well-done burger, which was on the dry side  3.5 garlic fries  (tossed in olive oil, Pecorino Romano, fresh garlic, herbs) unexpectedly stole the show - not too heavy, excellent seasoning  3 onion rings - high quality, the hand-breading is evident, panko coating is a nice thought, but was overly fried to a hard crust, which  completely covered any rosemary/dill notes  3 bbq chicken pizza - chicken breast is very smoky, mild blue cheese - great flavor but as prior reviewers warn, be prepared for some sogginess w/the bbq sauce  2.8 ribs & pulled pork platter - ribs pack a light heat, dry rub with some sauce; pulled pork is a tiny side - found the sauce overly sweet, a bit heavy, lacking tender/moistness that you might expect from pulled pork; for being average bbq, on the pricier side  3 beet salad - refreshing but found the small portion overpriced (3 oz for $3)  overall worth visiting for the concept and supporting local produce"}
{"text":"We go to Joe's often. We always bring family and friends when they come into town and visit. Great for a quick bite to eat or a group. Love this place. Never had a meal I didn't love. Lines can get pretty long on weekend mornings but the food is certainly worth the wait. Meat Scramble is my favorite breakfast dish."}
{"text":"This place is one of my FAVORITE places to eat in Az. Anytime out-of-town friends come by, I always take them to Joe's to show off this little gem of a restaurant. First off, the food is AMAZING. I've had pretty much everything on the menu, and still have yet to be disappointed. I love the grilled veggie pizza, as well as the BBQ bacon blue burger. Yum! I'm usually here w/ my 4 year old, and he loves the back area - PLENTY of space to run around. There's usually always a pack of kids out there! And the garden in the back is a nice place to walk off the food. All in all, this place is amazing! Worth the wait, the price, and multiple return visits :)"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not quite there. Great place for families with room for kids to run around out back.   Pros: cool building and site, good menu selection, condiments on tap in the back (ranch, brown mustard, rooster, along with the normal things), fast service.   Cons: food was ok, better than sonic but it was all a little off, lots of kids and young families ( there is seating around front that is quieter), food was mildly warm but not enough to still be so when you got to the end.   I had: cheese burger with bacon (not thick or chrispy, but tasty still), grilled onions, real cheddar, but the burger wasn't too juicy (over cooked).  Liked the flame broiled and natural shape. Sweet potato fries were limp and luke warm, fried zucchini had a good batter, shape, and texture, sauce could use to be less chunky so you could eat it vs. just dip in juice.   Over not bad for 13 bucks, could improve though."}
{"text":"The fried jumbo shrimp was really good.  The homemade cocktail sauce is so much better than the grocery store stuff. Delicious.  However, this place NEEDS to work on getting customers through the line faster.  There was only one window open during the prime dinner time crowd and it took us an hour from standing in line, to ordering, to getting our food.  Also, the girls working in the kitchen had gross long hair that was not in a hair net and they were the ones preparing the food.  Yuck."}
{"text":"The only thing that is keeping me from giving this place a 5 star is that the lines are way too long.   I first heard of this place through watching Food Network on Guy Fieri's show, 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives'. The onion rings that were featured on the show looked absolutely delicious. I also liked that the place was not too far from my house and everything they had came from their own farm- hence the name.  Upon arriving to the location, it was near a suburban community and right next to a little farm where you can pick your own vegetables. I was surprised at how green and cookie-cutter perfect the neighborhood was. There also appeared to be a lot of people since the paved parking was full and I had to go to the dirt lot. The place looked popular enough, so it couldn't kill to pave that parking space.  The architecture of the place seemed really funky, but fitting for the scenery. A huge downside though was that I came at the lunch rush so there was a line that spread all the way to the outside of the restaurant. That was my first indication that the place must be really good. However, after waiting 20 minutes, I was starting to doubt if it was worth it.  Boy was I in for a treat. I decided to order their 'Farm Burger' with bacon and mushrooms, which was an extra dollar for both and their infamous onion rings. Looking at how pricey things were getting, I opted for just a water cup. I was given a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready. I had the choice of sitting inside or eating outside, and I chose sitting outside since it was a nice day. On the side of the restaurant is a counter where you can get all your drinks, condiments, and dipping sauces. There was even a hand washing station where I could wash my hands, which was a huge plus.  I decided to sit underneath the huge tree in the middle. Once I was settled, I was happy to find that my buzzer was beeping and I could go get my food. Once I got my food. I realized that for the money I was paying, I was given huge portions. I put the vegetables that was separated in the burger and took a bite. Let me say that this was probably one of the next burgers I have ever tasted. Juices were running down my hands so you know it was good. I couldn't get enough of it. Finally once I got off my momentary food high, I took a bite out of one of my onion rings. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy what seemed like Rosemary in the seasoning. I savored every bite to the last crumb.  Overall, it was a great experience. I want to come back and try their other burgers. They always seem to have a special everyday, so I want to try that one day as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great family-friendly restaurant and fantastic burgers and onion rings."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 2 stars for atmosphere. We decided to come here because they have a nice outdoor area and we were able to bring our dog. The food was delicious and the wait time was reasonable. I rated the experience three out of five stars because the out door area was packed with parents not tending to their children. It was frustrating trying to get to the table with food while dodging kids running around. Then waiting for kids to stop playing in the soda fountain to fill my beverage. Hearing them yelling and screaming really killed the ambiance for us. We were looking for a nice quiet place to enjoy a meal outdoors."}
{"text":"Ok now this a awesome spot, this place is well developed; loving the whole property and the food is on extra point! Can't wait to bring the parents to this spot! Cheers"}
{"text":"Always come here when I am in town. Great spot for fresh and consistent food. Worth the loooooong drive the Gilbert. Love the Ahi Tina sandwich, burgers, BBQ pork and salads ....all good. The only downside is that it so popular it is always crowded and they don't really engage you as a customer.  Everyone that works there is behind a big wall of glass and the only people waking around are bus boys. They would do  to engage customers a bit more to warm up the place. If you lower your expectations for warmth of service, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I were in town to catch some Spring Training Games.  A friend who used to live in AZ highly recommended Joe's to us.  After getting confused in the Loop a few times, we finally made it.  The Belgian Waffle and BBQ Pork Ribs was the dish of choice.  Waffles and Ribs for Breakfast?  We were in heaven!  I've told others of this combo and even showed them our photos.  They were disgusted and said that was the most unhealthy breakfast they'd ever heard of.  How can 4 smoked baby back ribs be worse for you than say 4 link sausages or 4 slices of bacon, both of which are fried?  Although the meat didn't fall off the bone, the ribs were tender.  I wasn't fond of the sauce, it was a little too tangy for my taste. (see photo)  The fresh apple mini fritters were also a hit.  They're fried fresh to order, served hot, and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  (see photo)  We also had the chicken and mushroom scramble.  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onion, fontina + cream cheese.  It was good, but definately not my favorite of the three, and I probably wouldn't order it again.  This is a must eat spot if you're in the Phoenix area, and worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. One of the best places we have ever had breakfast at. They have a garden near by that they grow the food for the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a great place. It's located in a restaurant complex, I suppose, and on the other side of the lawn is a coffee shop and beyond that a mixed use restaurant and business space. Joe's Farm Grill is in a stand alone building though. It's got a modern diner feel to it. The space is really cool. I had the bbq bacon bleu burger, which was excellent. Just enough bbq sauce so that the burger wasn't drowning in it. Both the bun and burger patty were grilled. So tasty. I snuck a sip of my friend's strawberry milkshake. I'll have to get my own next time. My only complaint was that it took them a little while to clear off the tables, so there were about 5 empty tables that couldn't be used. However that's a minor complaint, as there were other tables available, but we wanted a booth. I will definitely be there again. And I'm sure it's very pleasant in the spring and fall when weather permits sitting at the picnic tables outside."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The food is fresh, goes without saying, it's delicious. The atmosphere is awesome. Great place for kids. I would suggest getting there early, because you have to stand in line to order and the place gets packed quickly. It's amazing how quickly you forget you're in a desert. The name fits. It's farm fresh without the smell"}
{"text":"What a great place. Seen it on Diner Drive in and Dives. Fantastic place. Had the fontini burger with onion rings amazing. Also the pork tenderloin was awesome. Great service great tasting food"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, great sides, farm-fresh produce, amazing shakes, and a fun, casual setting, Joe's Farm Grill is a slice of everything American. I love the fontina burger with a side of garlic fries, and my newfound love is their espresso shake, a giant cup of glorious cold brew shake blended with chocolate covered espresso beans. There are families galore outside with little kids running around the grassy areas. Note that there is almost always a line to order, but just peruse the menu and make friends before you go grab a picnic table outside in the shade."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is super fresh and tasty definitely will be coming back! Burger was great and the farm fish was amazing"}
{"text":"We've taken so many of our friends to Joe's and they love it just as much as we do. Their menu is pretty simple but that's the way to do it. Our favorites are the grilled pizzas: both the BBQ chicken and the Veggie. The line can be unreal sometimes but it usually goes pretty quick. The food is great, the reason for the 4 stars is sometimes the staff can be a little unresponsive or flat out ignore you until you say excuse me. This has generally happened when we do takeout and I go straight to the pick up counter. Overall, great place to dine."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had!  Not really sure what they do to a simple hamburger, but I had to try it again just to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Seriously tasty hamburger.  And did I mention the shakes? Whoa!  I do have to stand in line most visits. However, even if the line looks long, it moves very quickly.   The outside atmosphere is also one of the best points. It's almost like being at a picnic. Just wonderful outdoor seating, with lots of trees and people just having a good time."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the places our family loves coming to the most. I know there's always a line that many complain about, but it's not because Joe's has a poorly run kitchen or skimps on their service. It's because it's arguably the most unique and popular of restaurants in the East Valley.  My \"go to\" item here is the Bleu Cheese Bacon burger. My wife and I are fairly enthusiastic foodies, and I can say without reservations that that burger is the best I've ever tasted. After a few years I started asking for extra bleu cheese on it because it seemed the longer they've been around, the more stingy they are on it. And that stuff, which I think is homemade, is what makes that burger. They also have sweet potato fries with pineapple salsa that my wife raves about. Every once in a while I get a yummy chocolate shake too.  This place was also featured on The Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,\" and they definitely are good and proud of it. TVs are everywhere showing the episode on repeat, even in the bathroom. (Something that while cool, I think patrons make a bigger deal out of than necessary. Nothing against the restaurant though; I just laugh when people go crazy over a tv in the bathroom. If it was playing the Suns game on it, then maybe you can freak out.)  Once or maybe twice a year they do customer appreciation day and give out free burgers all afternoon. This restaurant has a loyal following and I think it's pretty cool for a business to show value in it's customers in such a manner. With that being said, I NEVER go to Joe's on \"Free Day.\" You think the lines are bad on a normal day? They're ridiculous on Free Day, requiring even DPS traffic control to maintain some sense of order. What people won't do for a free handout! My time is worth more than saving 7 bucks on a burger. Just to make a statement to all the freeloaders (and I say that in the nicest way possible, hardy har) that show up, I'd love to come in on Free Day and pay double the normal price for the burger if it meant cutting the line or something. Not saying it should happen, but it'd be funny. But that says more about people in general than Joe's, and again, I commend them for valuing the community like that. I think one year we arrived at Joe's not realizing it was Free day, and all I could say was \"Ah crap.\" lol.  Joe's is the best. I'm telling ya, try the Bleu Cheese Bacon burger, and make sure to ask for extra bleu cheese on it, even if they charge for it. It's SOOOOOOO good!  And if you \"Like\" their Facebook page, you'll get all their announcements, including the year's \"Free Day,\" so that you know when NOT to go to Joe's, which should be the only time you shouldn't. I haven't had their breakfast yet, but I hear it's equally thrilling."}
{"text":"There's a lot of great ambiance here.  The kids love the open spaces to eat out in the yard and the grass is always lush and green.  I do enjoy coming here, however, the food has always just been ok to me.  Not really great for the price you pay.  The wait is long almost all the time, which is certainly a sign of their popularity, so prepare to get there with plenty of time.  If you haven't been, I definitely recommend giving it a try.  Make sure to check out the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Always satisfied with my experience at Joe's Farm Grill. As everyone probably knows, the line is outrageous! It would help if they always ran 2 windows at a time, they have done this a couple times I have been there and it definitely speeds up the line. Otherwise, the food is great! The burgers and salads are awesome! My favorite is the chicken tender basket. The shakes are also great, love the seasonal ones too!"}
{"text":"I would say this restaurant is one of those hidden treasures of the East Valley.  I actually heard about a customer appreciation day on the radio, so I just had to visit.  The line was about 1.5 hours long for a free burger, fries and soda - and it was certainly worth it.  I will definitely return soon!  Excellent food, great atmosphere, and great service - you just can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here, a nice restaurant nestled deep within Gilbert. Unless you're looking for it, it's rather tough to find however. Wonderful food and tasteful atmosphere to boot, definitely a place you should look into.  The only complaint I could have is the rather strange bathrooms -- G.I Joe's and Barbie dolls ?"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here because they have room for the kids to run around. It had wen a couple of years since we were last there and we had enjoyed it in the past. We had a few issues this visit. The service and food seems to have gone down hill. We got the food fast, but we did have an issue with the order. I was given regular fries as opposed to sweet potato. After a few more minutes I got my fries. Not a huge deal. But then we began to eat. My wife's burger was almost completely raw. When she took it back, they said that's how they are cooked, which can't be right. She was given a bit of a hard time about it. Mine was cooked perfectly.   She had it replaced with the BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza didn't taste as good as it sounded. The garlic fries were very soggy.   Our experience this time around was definitely not up to par. For the amount we paid, we definitely were not satisfied.   And the flies were terrible."}
{"text":"Excellent food, always natural and a great location in Gilbert.  Also, their coffee shop is hands down the best breakfast location in the valley of the sun!"}
{"text":"Free meal on your birthday!  Food is amazing, atmosphere is fun, 5 stars easy..."}
{"text":"Based on their fantastic food, I wouldn't hesitant to give Joe's 4 stars, but their Vanilla milkshake is horrible so they will have to settle for 3. I later found out via Twitter that the milkshakes contain a splash of lime juice in them because when the owner was a kid his local drug store made them that way. Apparently, the lime juice adds complexity and cuts out the richness. Are you kidding me? Isn't the entire reason milkshakes were created was for the richness. This is almost sacrosanct.  I'm surprised the ice cream didn't curdle because it tasted like old goat's milk.   That being said, the food is finger linkin good and not all that bad for you either. Our group of four enjoyed the BBQ chicken pizza, Ahi Sandwich, Ribs and Onion Rings. Service was great and unpretentious, food was well prepared and fresh, and the atmosphere fun and upbeat. We will definitely visit again but leave the milkshake off our order."}
{"text":"So...I wasn't going to review Joe's because it has been done and everything that needs to be said is duly noted in the 110 reviews before me, but it has now been like 4 days and I can't stop craving the barbecue chicken pizza. Maybe it is just because I am on an after holiday diet, but maybe, just maybe it is due to the winning combination of thin crust (without being like a cracker), barbecued chicken, onions, and Gorgonzola cheese crumbles. Yum!  Besides that, Joe's offers the complete experience. It is a blast from the past, and the perfect date spot for all those clueless guys who want to land a lady that likes the outdoors, picnics, and simple pleasures.  When you visit, you are going to be tempted by the grilled peanut butter + banana split under Farm Favorites. It sounds like horrible goodness, and it is worth getting to say you tried it, but nothing to write home about. In short it is a total stoner sandwich and maybe someday I will have a use for it, but I will not be ordering it again as there are so many other yummy sounding things to pick from on the menu."}
{"text":"Joe's restaurants are always interesting to review because they have so many facets.  Food - A wide range of food that is both tasty and fresh, I have yet to go with someone who couldn't find something they liked on the menu. Personal favorites are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Sweet Potato Fries. I also like their milkshakes, though they tend to be more tasty calories than I should be packing these days. Most of the veggies and food comes from the nearby farm.  Restaurant - Retro furturistic farmstead? I don't know where Joe gets his concepts, but they are fun. The building is the old Johnston family house, and the fireplace in the inside dining area still looks like it is from the 1950s. Also, be sure to visit the restrooms.  Outside Area - My one downside to this restaurant is the free for all often found around the building. The grass area is a great place for kids, but too many parents seem to think this is a license to let their kids run around unsupervised. I usually opt to eat inside as a result, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful area.   Overall an honest recommendation for Joe's Farm Grill, one of the tastiest places around!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is an absolute must. It should be on anyone's bucket list who lives in the area or is passing through. Whenever we have family visit from out of state, we take them to Joe's Farm Grill. Their burgers are delicious... especially the meat in the burger itself. The burger patties taste like they could possibly be high quality Kobe beef or Angus beef.   Sushi lovers will enjoy the Thai Ahi Salad... seared on the outside and raw on the inside. Yum!  Joe's Farm Grill is also a good place to take the whole family. Noisy babies won't be notice by many of the other patrons since most of the seating is outdoors and there is a lot of other activity."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything taste fresh and delicious.  It is a bit pricey but our family loves it. The outdoor area is great and kids love it because they can run around and play! Sweet potatoe fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Cons: Be prepared to wait in line for 40 minutes, even if the line is barely out the door. That does not include the time you spend waiting for your food!  Combos do not mean drink is included.  The man taking my order said, \"You can get ____, ____, lemonade....\"   I assumed based on his question that the drink was included.  Otherwise, he should have asked, \"Anything else?  Would you like a drink?\"   Lemonade is $4.07.  Yikes!  Upgrade to onion rings instead of fries $2.55.   Lunch for one is almost $23  Pros:  The food tasted fresh, but the fish was NOT better than what I've gotten elsewhere which would did not include 40 minutes in line + wait time + $4 drinks.  It's a lot of food and impossible to finish."}
{"text":"So I love the concept, like the atmosphere, and like the food. (My favs are the curry chicken salad sandwich, the BBQ chicken pizza, the onion rings and the sweet potato fries)  However there are 2 things that keep me from giving Joe's 5 stars:  the prices and the huge lines.  Considering they grow all their own produce, the prices could be a tad cheaper.  But what bothers me more is the lines.  Ever since Joe's Farm Grill has opened, there has been lines, and I am sorry, but this problem should have been solved by now.  Open 2 windows on the weekends, hire more cooks, do SOMETHING, but NO food is worth waiting over an hour just to order.  Long lines may be a boost to the ego, but not really good customer service.  If Joe's could solve this issue, I would visit much more often, because I really do commend them for doing something unique."}
{"text":"Fantastic super garlics crunchy green beans and garlic fries!! Need I say more! Love this place"}
{"text":"We drove an hour to get here. The place did not disappoint. The onion rings are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love having this place in my neighborhood, just a mere 800 steps from my front door. The menu appeals to everyone, from foodies to Applebee's addicts. It's a unique spot that's great for taking out of town visitors.  Service has been great the many times I've come here. The restaurant is run efficiently, and the few times that we've run into problems (like a burnt pizza), the situation is remedied quickly. My dog once escaped and ran to Joe's (can you blame him?), and the manager was sweet enough to feed him chicken and watch over him until I could leave work to pick him up.  I love that they added a veggie burger to the menu. It's a good one, too! It comes with a vegan 1000 island dressing, but I like to have it topped with the fixings from the fontina burger. Their portobello burger is one of my favorites which says a lot because as a vegetarian, I've eaten my body weight in \"token vegetarian option\" sandwiches. It has an awesome grilled flavor and is simply dressed. I love the grilled pizza too. No one near by does this, and the leftovers make an awesome breakfast.  Speaking of which, breakfast at Joe's Farm Grill is wonderful. My husband swears their pancakes are the best he's ever had at a restaurant, very close to his mother's version. He also goes gaga over the ribs and waffles (but a nap is required afterwards) and the breakfast tacos. I usually get the veggie scramble with a salad, grilled flatbread, and a great fruit cup that *doesn't* include cheapo grapes and cantaloupe.   Lastly, I just have to say how happy I am that they finally took the endless loop of Guy Fieri off their TV monitors. Good decision!"}
{"text":"I do not usually give 5 stars. I tried to stay away from giving place is five stars so that when I do people know it's worth it. THIS PLACE DESERVES IT.   This is my first time going to a farm-to-table restaurant. I was very happy that there was a walking area to view the farm. It could be turned into something extremely romantic, although I was more interested in the agriculture myself.  There was outdoor seating as well as indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was by far the best. You're able to sit in a very lush green area while enjoying your food. This is most definitely a luxury in southern Arizona.   I can only speak on behalf of the breakfast foods. So for the breakfast foods they were absolutely amazing. I had some eggs as well as a Belgian waffle, and I have not had a Belgian waffle that good since my visit to Europe. The environment could have had an influence on how good the waffle tasted, but isn't that the point?  I will most definitely be returning to this place whenever I'm in the Mesa/Gilbert area. This is definitely an experience that you shouldn't miss out on and it's probably best for groups."}
{"text":"OK, the vibe at this place is pretty cool. They have done a fantastic job of creating an outside dining space. However, the organization leaves a lot to be desired. We waited in a looooong line. One one person taking orders, really.....they even have two windows. In addition to the long line the two people in front of us kept welcoming their friends into line with them - all eight of them. Wait time in line - 30 minutes. Now interacting with the staff there was pleasant so I do not want to take anything away from them, it really is just the organization that needs work.   If you are hoping to find something healthy you are going to have limited choices. Pretty much fried everything and some salads. The food gets three stars but the items above and the cost take it down to two. All in all an interesting experience that is worth the trip, just needs some tweaking to get them across the finish line."}
{"text":"Joe's really cares about their customers and their input.  I did receive an email shortly after my review and apologoized for my bad experience.  I will definitely be giving this place another try.  Five starts to them for listening.  Defintely an establishment for long term customers."}
{"text":"This is one of our family's favorite local places. Great food, great selection, and great ambience. Can't beat the free $10 on your birthday either!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh and the customer service is great! Our favorites are the chicken pesto sandwich, BBQ pork sandwich, and onion rings (a must try!)."}
{"text":"We have come here twice for breakfast,  mainly because the lines later in the day get ridiculously long. Both times, breakfast was great. I had the breakfast tacos and more recently had the green eggs and ham scramble. Both entrées were generously portioned,  although my one complaint would be that the fruit cup I got to accompany the scramble was really small. Especially when you compare it to the generous side of potatoes my husband got with his scramble. Eh, it's a small thing, because in hindsight the food tastes great,  and the fruit itself was fresh.   Their coffee is really good, although I have one small complaint here, too. There's only one coffee pot that's left out to serve all the people there for breakfast,  so it runs out a lot and I usually get stuck with asking for more. Maybe we can put out 2 or 3 coffee pots? That might quicken up the speed of the coffee station as a whole, too.  I love the ambiance of the farm right outside and there's plenty of seating choices to choose from. It's very serve-yourself here, and that's ok, just don't come in expecting a fine dining experience. It's wholesome food, and I always leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Joe's is a wonderful place to go and eat \"great\" bar b que pork. Def a \"CHEAT DAY\" place though. No diet specific foods offered. Love it....."}
{"text":"Food: 5 Stars Service: 5 Stars Seating/wait time: 2 stars  I can't say anything bad about the food or the service, but man do I wish the place was a tiny bit bigger and that they'd done a better job laying out their counter-height tables inside; they just are so close to the doors that I feel like people are constantly too close. We've wanted to take friends and family visiting from out of town here, but twice we've been able to see the line from the street and just kept going by to eat elsewhere. I know Gilbert is a happening place for restaurants and we do love Joe's, but we are more likely to come during off times on a Friday (the time's we've given up have been Saturdays/Sundays late afternoon)."}
{"text":"Came for an afternoon lunch. Wasn't dissapointed. My cheeseburger was delicious. Went during 2pm on a sunday, no line and not terribly packed. During the better, cooler temperature I've seen the line out the door, so be prepared. Quality of food was great , a little pricey but the food made up for it. I would definately go back. It's a cute spot. Fun to eat outside during nice temps, a little crammed inside when it's hot, since majority of seating is outside. I hope the outside is dog friendly, I'm not sure but I would love to take my puppy in the winter."}
{"text":"Great experience as always. I have been here many times before but decided to try something different. Got the Sonoran dog which wasn't all that great. Only given four stars for the hot dog but everything else is great there."}
{"text":"Love the concept and outdoor seating. Felt as though the prices were high for the value received. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a lemonade. The total was around $15. The chicken sandwich was good, but not great. It was just missing something to really set it above average. The lemonade was very good and refreshing. Not sure that I would order for the cost on my next visit."}
{"text":"Never and I mean never has there been a bad experience at Joe's.  The food is hot and quick and tasty beyond imagination.  The meat is so tender it litterly drops into your mouth, YUM. I always get the sampler platter as it satisfies all my taste buds desires.  The sides are fresh and my fav is the potato salad.  Now this never fails and its the lemon cake.  I get this all the time.  Folks if this lemon cake got any more moist it would be pudding!  And the flavor of lemon is not shy on the taste buds. And if you see a line no worries, they hustle the food up in a hurry and you seat yourself either inside or outside in a park like setting.  Very nice."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious but the lines can get long (not their fault), especially on the weekends.  Otherwise this place is great and we love the environment."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times.  Food is okay.  Big infestation of flies.  Can't eat outside.  Nobody washes the tables.  No wonder there are flies. Coffee shop is quaint.  I would suggest just walk around the place and get a cup of joe."}
{"text":"Hot damn, this place is a great desert oasis. It's out there for people in the city... like, wayyyy out there, but it's worth the drive. It's been hyped up on the Food Network and stuff, but all the talk is earned. The food here is supremely fresh (they pretty much grow everything steps away) and cooked in inventive ways (see: GRILLED pizzas. Yes, I did just say that.) that makes me actually eager to try just about everything on the menu. I like that Joe's has created a little complex of different concepts on their land. The Coffee Shop next door is about the coolest that Gilbert can get and the little farm stand with refrigerated veggies and herbs is oh so convenient.   One more thing: the slaw on the ahi tuna sandwich is heaven. Purely a delight."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance at Joe's Farm Grill.  It's great to grab your food and sit outside at one of the many picnic tables.  Stopping there with the dogs after an afternoon at Cosmo Dog Park is a must!  There is something for everyone on the menu, from gourmet burgers (all I have to say is fontina! Yum!) to pizza, to ribs.  It's also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates.  They are usually psyched to be sitting outside enjoying a meal during the winter without having a propane heater involved.    Make sure you go for a walk on the grounds too.  It's very relaxing and a great way to work off a few calories!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm is one of my favorite places to eat in AZ. The food is fresh, well executed, and reasonably priced. Their motto is \"common food done uncommonly well\", and I think that sums them up perfectly."}
{"text":"Just ok, had better. Staff was great. I had the BBQ Bacon Blue burger, it was ok, fries were ok, would have had the onion rings but they were out. Like the location, maybe I'll try the coffee and breakfast if I go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place because it had great reviews .... So we had the lunch good to know because some places have great breakfast and not so great lunch  .....the fontina burger was awesome great combo ..... But I also had the onion rings not a good idea to fry anything with Fish it will always take on the fish taste with that said I had fish flavored onion rings  fried green beans were cold if they had been fried fresh they would have been hot or warm but they were room temp so not fresh ..... Cheese cake was good they put this strawberry purée on it that doesn't have much sugar so it was really really tart  maybe breakfast would be better .....hubby loved the fish and  shrimp they were huge shrimp ...."}
{"text":"I love going here, the food and atmosphere is great. No wonder Drive ins diners and Dives found it"}
{"text":"I love this spot. Such a great place to sit outside in some nice weather, surrounded by greenery and trees, which is a nice break from the desert landscape, and enjoy some AMAZING food."}
{"text":"Came in in Sunday night and even though the restaurant was almost empty  the tables were a mess, dirty and everywhere. We ordered the wedge salad which had a good amount of bacon and blue cheese. The ribs and pork combo was good but we were very let down with the warm coleslaw and bbq that had a very odd taste almost like bloody mary mix. When we asked if there was another bbq we were given the same bbq."}
{"text":"We love this place.  My daughter can run around the picnic tables and we can bring the dog too.  Our dog enjoys hitting the nearby dog park afterwards too.    I don't think I've had anything on the menu that I didn't like.  I like the fontina burger, the portobello mushroom sandwich with the green goddess dressing (yum), and the BBQ chicken pizza.  I also love that I can get the fresh beet salad with blue cheese in place of french fries.  I really don't have anything negative to say about it other than the drive.  We live about 45 minutes away, but still make a point of going there as often as we can."}
{"text":"After reading good things about this place we decided to give it a go at around noon on a Sunday.  There was a line but it wasn't too bad and they moved people through quickly.  I ordered chicken tenders with fries & hubby ordered a burger with onion rings.  His burger was good...a bit too \"flame-grilled\" for my taste but he liked it.  My chicken seemed like good quality chicken but it was horribly bland.  No seasoning on the chicken or in the panko type breading.  Nothing.  The fries were also bland.  No seasoning at all...not even a hint of salt.  The onion rings were cooked in the same panko type of breading and they, too, were lacking in seasoning and flavor.  We were very disappointed.  This place isn't cheap and when the food is subpar the cost adds to the disappointment.  Our meal was $28 and change for two baskets and 2 drinks.  I give it one star for the atmosphere - lots of outdoor tables among large shade trees as well as indoor seating, and one star for being dog friendly.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The Farm Salad might be the best salad I have ever had in my life. The fried zucchini was amazing, and the Date Shake was delicious. I don't even care how busy this place was. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday at breakfast time. Ordered their big breakfast which consisted of 3 scrambled eggs, 2 pcs bacon, 2 sausage links, cottage type potatoes and two pancakes. Let start with the time I ordered and the time I got my food. Try 21 minutes. I get buzzed to go pick up my food at the window, was never greeted at all. They just opened the sliding door and pushed out my orange tray with two black plates full of food. The scrambled eggs were cold and dry and unflavorful. They did add green chopped onions for color I guess but they had no flavor at all...quite bland. The potatoes weren't bad but neither anything to write home about. The sausage links as well as the bacon were on a second 8inch black plastic plate and were greasy, very greasy. My guess is that they put them over the pancakes so they will absorb all the grease. YUK!  The pancakes were some sort of a bright yellow color with brown glow to them. Huh, never seen anything like them before. Pancakes were cold,very flat and awfully dry.  No syrup was give to me and I had to go ask for it after the fact. The utensils and napkins are all out doors, you literally have to go outside to the backyard and get them yourself. It was raining this morning when I went and there just seemed to be alot of confusion going on with even the amount of customers they had. I believe that there was maybe a total of 7-8 folks dining when I got there. I tried looking for a manager to tell him or her about my meal but they were nowhere in sight. Food menu item are way overpriced as well. I have been here before a few years back and it seems that the quality,service and attitude toward the business has somewhat declined.  I will more than likely stay away from this place for sometime and try it again in a couple of years again. They need to do some serious house cleaning if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"came on a thursday for dinner around 7pm, and there was line out the door. had to wait 20-25 minutes before reaching the counter. i ordered the cheapest item on their menu, the farm salad. it took only 5 minutes before i was buzzed for my salad, which was delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Great location and service! I ordered the pulled pork while my boyfriend ordered the breaded shrimp and both were flavorful and the amount of food was just right. I've been to this restaurant a few times and even when it's busy the line moves pretty quick. The outside seating offers a really nice view of the area and it's great for hanging out with family and friends."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the Fontina Burger (as mentioned in Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network) and the Farm burger with onion rings. The staff was super friendly! There are benches outside which accommodate very large parties."}
{"text":"Farm-to-table (or very close). Everything I've tried from the breakfast tacos and Belgian waffles to the burgers and onion rings are delish. My favs are the fried shrimp (literally 3-4 bites to consume one that's how large they are) and the pumpkin pie shake. They literally bake pumpkin pies and blend them up! They are out of this world. I also love that they mix up the menu as well. They have their menu staples but often surprise you with seasonal or limited-time items. Tonight we had the pork tenderloin and it's very rare to see those in AZ. I lived in Iowa as a youngster and remember the pork tenderloin sandwiches well. It was beyond yummy! We feel very lucky to live near by but it's worth the drive if you don't."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill not just for the food, which is fresh and delicious, but for the atmosphere. The picnic style seating outside, plenty of shade cover and farm to walk around at are great for getting out and enjoying being outside. The only thing I would change is having a changing table in the restrooms."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Joe's Farm Grill enough to honestly state that EVERYTHING on their breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu is tasty!"}
{"text":"Tasty burger joint in a neat atmosphere. Funky and fun.  This is a order food at the counter type place. Its always pretty packed which is good and bad. It has inside and lots of outside seating  Has items other than burgers but we always seem to order the burgers here. Onion rings and sweet potato fries are tasty.  Main favorite is the Fontina burger."}
{"text":"***attention manager****  your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!! ***attention manager****  just so you know, joe / owner/ manager. employees using gloves to handle food should not be handling money or those customer pagers at the same time.   someone could take that pager into the bathroom, dip it in the toilet and give it back to the employee handing out food using gloves.. this is disgusting as they go right back to the food to their left and handle customers food.  please teach your employees to change their gloves.. this is disgusting.   ***attention manager****  your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!! ***attention manager****"}
{"text":"This is such a nice family place to eat. Food was great, the servers were friendly. Grounds were well kept."}
{"text":"So delicious! The veggie burger was oh so good and the garlic fries were delicious! Be sure to check out the farms and the brewery on site!"}
{"text":"Joes Farm Grill is A-OK. The set up is very nice. You walk in, grab a menu and wait in line to order. The line moved very slow the time I was there so thats something to take into consideration before checking it out. The menu offers a full array of different items. Lots of burgers, including a veggie option. A few of the items that were featured in Diners Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri are there with a red dot on them and the episodes are playing on some of the smaller TV's in the front. I got excited about the Gouda and Garlic Burger and was happy to know that they cooked them \"pink\" but when I bit into it, it was dry. That cost them a star as well as the wait of over 30 minutes.  Over all, the price was a little more than average since mine was $13 out of the gates I felt like it would be a little more crafty than what I got. I still think this place is great, and would come back - now I know what to expect. I would say that this is better for a family gathering rather than a craft burger experience. And it's obviously well liked based on the reviews. Maybe I had a one off experience, or maybe my expectations were set wrong to begin with.   Hope you enjoy."}
{"text":"I went last week for the first time, and it was a perfect experience! The atmosphere is charming, and the food is delicious. Their manager (Summer) I believe, was awesome, she was very attentive & interactive with the guests. I will definitely be going back! It's a great place if you have kiddos that can run around while you're eating, but can also be a fun romantic setting."}
{"text":"Ohmygawd. So good.  You may actually drive by this place and not notice that a restaurant is here (since it is hidden behind trees and next to dairy farms, corn fields and such).   Casual atmosphere with large out door picnic area, very pretty.  The Half Ribs with garlic fried, pulled pork and cole slaw (Mine), and the Pesto Chicken Sandwich (Hubs) was to die for !!  Ribs- Super moist, tender, fall-off-the-bone, finger-linkn', smokey, sweet & bold sauciness!   Cole-Slaw- So-so. Wish it was more like KFC 'slaw (sweet).  Garlic Fries- Good, a little greasy towards the bottom, but very crispy and flavorful.  Pulled Pork- Nice and plentiful.  Total cost? About $30. But ssooo much food and exactly what I expect BBQ to be.  I cannot believe this place is only 10 minutes from our house and we haven't come by sooner.   Note: This place has pizza, milkshakes, burgers, salads, ribs, etc. All your classics done very very well."}
{"text":"Old 60's house, converted + urban farm + KILLER food = Joe's Farm Grill.  BEST burger!  OMG the fontina cheese and bacon on it made it SO yummie.  I rarely eat red meat and knowing it was fresh and free of antibiotics and manufactured feed created a guilt free experience!!   I got HOMEMADE bleu cheese dressing for dipping the KILLER ONION RINGS (which are hand breaded with rosemary and dill in the batter).  Really??? YES!! Everything on the menu has a cool twist to it but not overstated.  Got the homemade strawberry lemonade, YUM.  Worth the 40 minute drive from Scottsdale!!    Don't forget to save room for a cupcake a the Coffee Shop next door!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I got a bbq hamburger that was absolutely delicious. I ordered the same burger the second time around and it wasn't nearly as good. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So today, after about 6 months I returned craving a delicious, juicy burger. I'm sorely disappointed. They say they cook their burgers pink, mine was charred. I've never had a burger so dry and sad. The bacon on the burger was not good either. Very little fat so it was left extremely chewy and not melt in your mouth. It was like plastic. I was with my dog and toddler so I rushed and ate it regardless. Was not very pleasurable. I won't be returning unfortunately. If you can't get a burger right what are you doin'?!"}
{"text":"Very cool picnic style restaurant. Dont get to see to many of those. love that some of the food is local grown and the place looks nice. Can get pricing with a family but the food taste great. Weather is a factor here so summers make it hard for this place to even be considered."}
{"text":"No need for one more excellent review of this place, but I'm gonna do it anyway. After much ado & buzz over the last few years, I finally made the hike (and believe me, it's a 45 minute jaunt from CenPho) out here today for a client meeting. Wham, bam, thank you Joe -- I'm a fan.  Excellent food.  Killer restrooms.  Awesome pressurized condiments.  Oh, and they give you a $10 credit towards your meal on your birthday.  Cool!  150% excellence."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start on this place. I had no idea this place was going to be so different and nice. When you arrive outside you can see all these trees and the environment in a whole is just outstanding. The way you order is kinda weird you walk In grab a menu and wait in line. The menu tries to help you out on what's like popular like some of the items have been on the food channel so it tells you that which is cool. But after all that I still did not know what to order, everything sounded so good! I just went with a slab of ribs and 2$ up charge for garlic fries and a drink was about 26$.. Isn't bad to be honest it's like going to any sit down and getting ribs but with sit downs they do everything for you while here you have to do it that's the only down side. This place is like a fast food joint with high prices. They give you a buzzer device so when the food is ready it starts vibrating. The fountain machine is outside and so are the sauces and all the things you need for your meal even a sink which is different and nice. My meal came out in like 5 minutes while they were busy and it was incredible. The ribs were tasty, the garlic fries were perfect and the coleslaw was probably the best coleslaw I have had. The food the environment is just so cool sitting outside with a heater and so much green around you. Very nice place I will be back!"}
{"text":"I know the food is good but they keep losing money, especially from our family. I know the line is \"designed\" to not overwhelm the kitchen but enough is enough. EXPAND THE KITCHEN.  HIRE MORE PEOPLE. Very simple. Invest in the expansion, build the kitchen expansion you so can service more people. You lost a group of 14 tonight (at least $200), another group last week of 11 (at least $100) and twice last year of at least $300 combined. So sad you haven't figured out the wait for the line. Instead we leave and tell others on the way in its a 45 minute wait, you might want to go elsewhere. If you lost $1,000 from us over a few times, I don't know what other families have lost for you for revenue....Tens of thousands in revenue....We have stopped attempting to go and have told others and they are fed up with the waits too of one cashier. Good riddance. We have given you a few years and nothing has changed...VALUE OUR TIME. It appears not..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Love the fact that they use fresh herbs that they grow themselves. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Alright. Stopped here after making a pickup at the Mesa Airport. The hype is real. Love the story. Love the farm fresh ingredients. The food is great. I had the turkey jalapeño dog and fried zucchini. My daughter had the mushroom sandwich with sweet potato fries, both with the hand squeezed lemonade.  We sat outside. Great mid century modern burger joint decor. When I get in the area again, I'll definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is so friendly  food is great pricing is good.  Down side - Always a kong line and lots of flys"}
{"text":"I love Joe's! Been here a few times...Must have the garlic fries!!!  The Fontina burger is good and I also love the Seared Ahi Sandwich! Never tried anything else just always get the same thing. Although I have tried the regular fries and the sweet potato but love the Garlic Fries by far!"}
{"text":"I live right by here and have heard all the hype on this place so me, my neighbor and my daughter just ate breakfast here. One word-OVERRATED.   Beautiful grounds and scenery but I am rating just by the food, price, and atmosphere.   Set up is a little confusing. You order from a window and seat yourself. I had no idea. Food is pricey and no fresh orange juice they sold Tropicana. Ordered for 2 adults and a child and it was $32.00. For breakfast.   We ordered omelets, bacon, my daughter had kids French toast.   Food so -so and it is not cheap. My daughter did not like the apple crisp bacon. I thought it was ok. Me and my friend both got omelets which were just ok. Came with a pita bread and salad and a side of fruit.   utensils outside and flies everywhere including the inside. We cannot figure out the hype here. We would have had a better breakfast at The Good Egg."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is a favorite for out of town guests.   The food is yummy. If the weather is nice, the location is yummy.   Great place to take kids.   The lines SUCK. Go eat there when most people don't eat. And never on a Sunday post church time."}
{"text":"Yes, Joes Farm Grill in Gilbert, AZ is a modern and trendy burger joint. The ambiance is very cool and many people come here regularly. But, it's called Joes FARM grill, so get something that's grown on the Agrotopia farm.  It's super fresh and tasty.  I recommend the Thai chicken salad, Beet salad, Farm salad or BBQ chicken salad.  All have fresh vegetables straight from the farm.  Admittedly, the burgers are good, especially the Fontina burger. Yum. Add fresh homemade onion rings and garlic fries and you can be in that naughty little zone of eating fast food that you know isn't really healthy while at the same time justifying it by  having a salad too!  After all, it's fresh from the farm!  The pizza is great too.  Overall, it's a really fun place to go to lunch and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food here is always great and the grounds are so peaceful and really enjoyable! The only issue I have about this place is 1. The dining room smells like a locker room \"time for a carpet shampoo\" and 2. For an \"organic\" restaurant they sure use an awful lot of plastic! Plastic cups,knives,forks, condiment cups and plates! Your carbon footprint is horrible!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere at Joe's.  I have been going there for a long time (my sister found it before the DD&D show) and I have always loved going there.  I would have given 5 stars, except the last two times I have been there the lines have been HORRIBLE.    I don't mind waiting in a line when I think the restaurant is doing everything it can to get me through it, but both times I have waited in a line for over 30 minutes they have had ONLY one register open. Once was on a Wednesday night, and once was in the middle of the day!  JOE, if you read this, make sure that if the line is out the door you get them to run both registers.  The food came out quickly, so I know the cooks weren't busy.  I would rather wait at the table a little longer for my food and have one of those cooks taking orders.  At least then I am sitting down.  As for the food, it's great.  Love the BBQ Chicken Salad, the pizzas, all of their chicken sandwiches, burgers and the onion rings, the sweet potato fries (dipped in their homemade ranch, yum!) and even the beet salad are great.   But come prepared to wait in line!!"}
{"text":"This place is certainly worth a visit, and I live all the way in Moon Valley (North Phoenix)!!  Great atmosphere in the middle of a community based around a large garden/small farm with mature trees and a great patio surrounding this old (at least by AZ standards) building!! Food is pretty standard fare with burgers, sandwiches and deep fried goodies.  They do a pretty good job, few places do an awful job, but the spot is the draw here."}
{"text":"First off the food is amazing, and everyone who works there is so nice and helpful! The food is super fresh and tastey! Sumer is also extremely sweet, and a great person to be around! I highly recommend there food for anymeal and the location is amazing! Fantastic family atmosphere for all ages!"}
{"text":"An awesome restaurant. We went with Mrs. B's sister and friends for the first time while in AZ for the weekend.  The food was great and its a cool environment. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fathers day, family eating burger s with egg, pancakes, the meat skillet... Great combo of spicy and sweet. Great job guys! Amazed at the time in line and eating completed in an hour."}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's twice: once for brunch and more recently for dinner.  The food is fresh and well-prepared with tremendous selection for every palette.  We went on a Saturday night after 6 PM and the line was quite long (it took more than half an hour before we ordered), which apparently is par for the course given this place's popularity.  I went for the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, which was fantastic, paired with fries (I asked for jalapenos on them), and a ginger ale made with sugar cane.  Despite the long wait on line and for our food to be ready, it was well worth it.  The prices are a bit high for food that you order at a counter and then pick up, but I was pleased to support the locally grown harvest and I don't mind paying for gourmet quality.  Sitting outside is also fantastic, even as it started to get dark.  The experience itself felt like eating on a farm and there's something to be said for that in this day and age."}
{"text":"When ordering I was privileged to watch two full bearded fellows handle the food without hair nets covering their over-grown hipster accessories, gross.  They play an episode from a food network show on a loop by the cashier like a badge of honor without backing up the national exposure by cooking flavorful original food.   The food tastes like they just throw everything in a large fryer and call it quits no actual flavors, just the same bland taste across every dish. If you want this taste go spend half the amount and Long John's or the like."}
{"text":"Back because we couldnt help but check out their breakfast selection.  Lunch was amazing and filling yesterday"}
{"text":"I wish I could split up catagories as their breakfast truly carries their rating with me.  Breakfast- awesome.  I recommend the pancakes, with anything.  They are the best pancakes I have ever had in my entire life.  Seriously.  I'm not sure what they put in them but they always taste so good.  My second recommendation would be to get the breakfast tacos with sausage.  Also, so good.  My husband always get the huevos rancheros; he goes on about how delicious they are but I have yet to try them myself.  Go for breakfast but make sure you go early and don't go between 10:30-11 on a Sunday because you'll have a bit of a wait.  During the week is usually quiet and is a good time.  Lunch/dinner- I haven't exactly had the best experience with anything that I've had.  It's not that what I had was made poorly or was disgusting it's just food you can get anywhere.  There are no dynamic flavors in anything; everything is just blah.  I feel bad writing this review because I want to love everything I get but I'm never fully satisfied with my choices.  In their defense, my husband and aunt rave about their chicken salad sandwich but, again, I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years, and decided to finally give it a try when I learned about the free birthday meal.  We went for breakfast, and I ordered the veggie scramble.  Yum!  I've never had such delicious eggs... everything was so fresh!  The freshly squeezed orange juice was to die for.  We ordered the apple fritters, too, and our 5-year-old couldn't stop licking the sugar off his fingers.    The building is really interesting, and I like the variety of seating options (outside, inside, high-top, booth, etc...).  And I know this might be a weird thing to comment on, but the bathrooms are worth a mention.  They're very retro, with Barbie & G.I. Joe dolls encased in the walls.  There's a T.V. playing old 50's shows, too.  In the bathroom.  Yep.  I definitely want to come back for lunch or dinner at some point.  This will be one of my \"go-to\" unique places to take out-of-town guests from now on."}
{"text":"Darn it!  Chris B. took all my good points, including the bathroom (with a TV that was running an episode of the delightfully retro \"Supermarionation\" show called \"Thunderbirds.\")  The condiment fountain is, indeed, a miracle of fast-food engineering.  And the food was fantastic.  The BF and I waaaay overate, but it was worth every tasty bite of the ahi sandwich with Asian slaw, seafood combo plate, chocolate malt, and chocolate-coconut bars.  We'll be return customers, no doubt.  My only complaint was that the bun with the ahi sandwich was a little too sweet for my taste; it detracted slightly from the Asian flavors.  As for other reviewers who complained about flies....yes, there were some, outside, around the tables on the grass.  When you eat al fresco, that's the chance you take.  You're next to a working farm (hence, the name) in an area still somewhat agrarian; what do you expect?  Inside, and at the non-grass outdoor table, it wasn't a problem.  The service was fine; tables and the self-service area were being kept clean, in spite of the lunch crowd.  My only suggestion is that another bay of drink dispensers would come in handy when the joint is jumpin'."}
{"text":"Pretty fresh, decent food. Nothing EXCITING, but good. It's your usual fare, burger, sandwich, salad, fries, but it's made well.  The sweet potato fries are fantastic, the meat is a higher quality, the lettuce and veggies are fresh and not the cheap, bagged, romaine variety you get everywhere else.  I like how they use fresher, local ingredients and promote a farm culture. The grounds nearby are very country-styled, with big benches under trees, outdoor seating, it's a country vibe, and I like that in a city environment."}
{"text":"We came here with my in-laws when they came to town. It was featured on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives and they play the episode inside the place. Here you wait in line as you make your way up to the person taking orders. When you walk in be sure to grab a menu and you can peruse it while you wait in line. Once you get to the front there is a place to put your menu and you simply order your meal. You will be given a buzzer to alert you when your food is ready. The ingredients are very fresh and the food is good. This is also a very kid friendly place and noisy because of all the children. You can sit inside or outside on park benches. A very casual, low key place with decent breakfast of lunch food.    Visited April 2012"}
{"text":"It's been at least 5 years since I've eaten here, so I don't have a good memory of my previous experience.  Took the wife there tonight.  We had the pork sandwich.  I had cole slaw.  She had onion rings. She had unsweetened tea, I had diet coke.  1.  The price is fair for the meal but outrageous for the drink. 2.  Without a doubt, this was the worst cole slaw I've ever had.  Raw cabbage would have had more flavor. 3.  Her tea tasted funny.  I didn't like it either.  Threw it out and got something else. 4.  The onion rings were different.  Very large.  about 5-6 in total.  Tasted good. 5.  The pork was good, similar to Joe's BBQ, except no real selections on BBQ sauce. 6.  The ambiance of eating inside is horrible.  Horrible acoustics.  Very loud echoes.    RECOMMENDATION:  Bring your own drink from Circle K.  Wait until its cool outside and eat outside."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, and great food in general! Long line to place order (Sunday after church) but it moves quickly. Very organized place."}
{"text":"I have not eaten anything here that was flat out amazing. I do like the fried shrimp. Large prawns, very reasonable price for how much you get! The service has taken a long time every time I have been. One visit they took about 25 minutes to get breakfast to us. I love the atmosphere and the buzz that is here but I rate on food as the highest percentage and I have to give it 3 stars. If you want to experience joes, experience Joe's BBQ."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit in Gilbert. I love that I can sit outside at a picnic table and enjoy the weather in Gilbert. The food is delicious no matter what you pick to eat."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the big deal is about this place. The lines to get food belie the complete mediocrity of it. They should have stopped at 'Common Food...' in their motto.   I ordered the grilled veggie omelet and was so underwhelmed that I was more fascinated by the fact that I'd never seen a grapefruit tree before. Now THAT was awesome.   It was overpriced and underflavored. I would go back and try other things, but I don't do heart attack food that well and I eat mostly vegetarian so I guess I'll never be back. Oh well."}
{"text":"The food quality has definitely gone down since I had last eaten there. There were also a great deal of flies. Some of them had gotten into my wive's food and I had to keep swatting them away from my face."}
{"text":"A unique dining experience. As you enter you're free to choose what you want and where to sit. We chose to sit under a huge tree outside but after we got out food it got too dusty for me to enjoy. I ordered a chicken and mushroom scramble while my husband had the breakfast burger, both of which were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Good burgers, fresh ingredients from the Agritopia garden. Anything with their homemade blue cheese sauce or barbecue is amazing! The Dog Days of Summer hot dogs are very good -- just wish you could get them year round."}
{"text":"Great food! Really nice place. Good service. Enjoyed everything here. The ingredients were quality ingredients and they all taste very good. If it wasn't so far I would try more often. Please open more stores in the valley! Prices are a bit too high but the atmosphere and quality food makes it worth it.   Great for kids and families!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees.  Hearing about this place while watching Triple D on the FoodNetwork, I was elated to go here once bae chose this place to go for her birthday.  I like the ordering system of waiting in line and the server bringing it to you based on the gps buzzer thing so it is easy for them to spot you.   The burger is an all-timer for me. When you deal with a fatty patty as illustrated in my photo, typically taste is compromised: Not the case here The juiciness and seasoning permeated through the entire burger.    Each and every item we tried was superb and made to perfection. From the salmon, fried zucchini, regular and sweet potato fries were simply divine. After the meal the triple berry milkshake was a fitting selection for dessert."}
{"text":"I really dig this place! It was on food networks \"Diners, drive-ins, and dives\" show. The atmosphere comes off as retro/vintage. There's lots of seating options inside and out. There was so much to try on the menu that was unique and original. We tried the bbq chicken pizza, fried zucchini, and cobb salad. The pizza was excellent--thin crust and perfectly crispy. The zucchini was nicely battered and came with side of ranch. I cant wait to come back and try the fontina burger next time!"}
{"text":"This is great place to bring the family and let the kids roam outside while you sit on a bench and watch.   The food is good and the service (behind the window) is friendly. The Food Network came here with Guy Fieri. Guy likes the food and says their onion rings are \"Captial K Krunchy!\".   I normally come for breakfast. Love the breakfast tacos with bacon. Who doesn't love bacon? The combo of pesto and sour cream which are both topped on the tacos really bring it to a whole new level.   Delicious coffee. I wish I could take a full carafe home.   The inside of the restaurant is usually packed and patrons need to fill the tables outside. With days like today, when it is beautiful outside... I'd rather be outside anyways.    If you haven't been to Joe's Farm Grill, you owe it to your family and self to get out here!"}
{"text":"The only thing I would change about this place, is maybe a little cheaper, with that said for the quality of food it its amazing. My two favorite items here are the BBQ pizza and the BBQ bacon burger. My wife always gets the chicken sandwhich and its amazing.   I am not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, but theres are amazing. They come with a garlic sauce. I would have to say the best side is onion rings. They are sooo good with some of there fresh ranch.  This is the kind of place you want to take family from out of town. I always bring my dog there with me and eat outside with my wife.   We just had a daughter and when she gets a little older I know we will be going here weekly since its so kid friendly and have a great kids menu.   Oh by the way if your up early enough, there breakfast is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"You know the food has to be good when you get there and there a massive line out the door and around the corner. It is a very casual place and you might have to wait in a long line but it is completely worth it. The food tasted so fresh. Seating is mostly outside, which is actually nice. Plenty of shade provided by the humongous tree in the back. There is a fenced in grass area where kids can play. I am not local to the area and this was my first time there but would definitely go back when I am in AZ again."}
{"text":"We were here last night wanting some good ribs.  It is one of the cutest little diner-ish restaurant surrounded by the trees and acres of land.  The ordering process is pretty much the same as the original Joe's real bbq in Gilbert but the decor and ambiance is way different.  It is much more contemporary.  I must say, until last night, I had the assumption that this place is a restaurant...you know, like Cracker Barrel and such.  But It is pretty much as casual as the Joe's real bbq which gives more character to the place.  After all, real bbq should be done self-serve style :)  My bf tried the Fontina Burger and I had the Baby back ribs with Mango milkshake.  (note:  Mango milkshake is limited time only so you should try it NOW)  We got our pager and waited maybe around 20min?...yeah, it was a little long but it's all good.  We were enjoying the nice, calm breeze outside.    The food was great!  We were a little skeptical since we didn't really have a wonderful time at Joe's real bbq.  But the baby back ribs were very tender and juicy with great flavor.  The winner though was the Fontina burger.  The little hint of pesto did the trick we think.  The fries...we preferred the regular fries over the sweet potato.  It tastes wonderful the first few bites but afterwards, you kinda feel like you had enough...you know?    Overall, it was a great experience.  I know that I have the tendency to complain saying \"it is not as good as L.A.\" but this place is different.  There is no way that a place like this exists in L.A. and we love it.  *Food = great *Service = good but you basically serve yourself *Price = good *Decor = very cool.  OH YOU HAVE TO SEE THE BATHROOM.  I know it's kinda weird for me recommend seeing the bathroom in a restaurant but it is one of the COOLEST BATHROOMS I've ever been into."}
{"text":"great food, service and delicious coffee. I suggest the mediterranean scramble for breakfast if you're looking for something vegetarian (the feta cheese is the perfect addition to the veggies) and the iced coffee is to die for. I love all the families, the dog friendly patio and the beautiful surrounding agritopia. Can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Their food is always fresh and delicious.  They only get 4 stars because of the logjam cluster$%#@ of a food pickup area and drink station, which has become customary in all of the Johnston restaurants.  Seriously, can you put the pickup window outside away from the order line, because the general public is not smart enough to stand back after they order and allow those who ordered before them to pick up their food.  Same with the drink station.  Fill up your soda and move along, it's not time to experiment with all 32 beverages and fill 12 cups of ketchup and ranch while a line of 15 people wait behind you because your whole party is blocking the station.    I'm just baffled as to the lack of awareness on behalf of the restaurant and it's patrons, and not sure who should shoulder more of the blame, but it's enough to deter me from frequenting the Johnston establishments more than I do."}
{"text":"The food was great, I love places that use local ingredients. The price is a little high but the quality was worth it. The long lines and wait times are sometimes worth the wait, once in a while."}
{"text":"We were in the area so we decided to check out Joe's Farm Grill, a place we had heard so much about.  In general, we all agreed that it was good. I would return if I was in the area, but I don't think I would make a special trip.  The food seemed fresh. I had a grilled cheese sandwich. It was good but not the best I have had. Others in my party commented that there food was great.  It is decent for kids if the weather is nice. Lots of outdoor seating with areas to walk/run and play. My kids enjoyed walking the grounds and seeing the parrots. One word of warning, however: choose your outdoor seating carefully. We didn't have a lot of options when we arrived. Our table, which was located under the big tree, was a target for bird poop! My brother was hit no less than three times! Take a look at your table before you sit down and see if there is evidence of birds."}
{"text":"Eating the chicken tenders and French fried with my husband, kids, and friend and loving it. Best chicken tenders I have eaten are here! Love the environment of Joe's Farm Grill and good smells!"}
{"text":"I love Joes Farm Grill. It's definately worth the drive! I have never had anything from here that wasn't absolutely delicious! They have great pumpkin milkshakes too :D It's very cute and great for families or even a cute place to go for a date. Except if you hate kids (like me). These little shits are everywhere, running around screaming and being gross with food all over their faces. Wtf, for real. But the plus is that it's right next door to Cosmo Dog Park, so there are always a few cute dogs hanging out with their owners. Oh, and the food is kickass."}
{"text":"We love Joe's. It's a great place to dine with kids cause you can sit outside under the big tree on picnic tables. I have been several times. I love the burgers and the bbq chicken pizza is very good. I think they grill it cause it had like a charcoal flavor which was different but good.  My wife loves the Onion rings and fried green beans. The atmosphere is awesome. Nice area to get refills on drinks and condiments. The bathrooms are even cool, so check them out even if you don't have to go. Close to the 202 yet you feel like you are out in the country."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!  Great food, prices, and a wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Good food, a little pricey but good overall. It has a bit of a fast food feel because you have to stand in line to order then go sit to wait."}
{"text":"I choose to come here for breakfast on my birthday w/my Mom. I showed my ID on birthday ($10 worth) on the menu. Food was good, service was fast, nice place to try out, lots of room to sit (indoors or large patio & picnic tables).  First time here, heard lots of good reviews from friends .."}
{"text":"My go to choice of food here for breakfast would be the ribs and waffles which I would if never combined if I didn't try it out here and it was pretty tasty! I also like the bacon Bleu cheese burger with a side of garlic fries and my cousins from San diego visit and they love the garlic fries here at joes.  I love this place it's very kid friendly which I love because I can take my niece and nephew here and they can run around and play because not alot of places are and I definitely would recommend this place for sure!I know everytime I come here I always enjoy the food and the service."}
{"text":"This is a cool place with a nice selection of foods.  My favorite is breakfast where you get hearty portions of quality breakfast items.  There is some indoor seating but most is outside in mostly shaded areas.  It's a great atmosphere when the weather is nice but it is often very crowded and the line for food can get quite lengthy which is my only significant complaint and the only reason why I seldom visit here."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review since my birthday last November.  My husband took me here for lunch.  I had the vegetarian burger, which was amazing!  I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the staff was so incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone loves about this place.  We ate there today and tried many of the items they are known for - onion rings had no flavor what-so-ever, the barbeque chicken pizza was not good at all, I had to actually douse it with barbeque sauce to even make it have a modicum of flavor, the kids corn dogs were just like you would buy at the grocery store and my husbands double dogs tasted like the chili was burnt to a crisp.  All in all at 38.00 total this was a horrible experience.  We will not be eating here again that is for sure!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for burgers and I ordered the burger that was rated by the food channel's Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives. I personally thought it would be better than it was, but that's okay. The deep fried green beans were overdone, so I had them remake the order and they were yummy after being less cooked."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast yelp is making me right more or they won't post that I think this is nice place for breakfast."}
{"text":"To round out my reviews of all three Joe's-owned locations, Joe's Farm Grill in Agritopia is a casual, family-friendly restaurant with all the \"favorites\" if you will: burgers, pizza, barbecue, hot dogs, fried things...what else do you need? I mean, if it's been featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" and Guy Fieri approved it, it must be good. *sarcastic eye roll*  But to be real, Joe's Farm Grill is next level. Just to point out a few of my favorite things on the menu (though everything I've had here has been delicious), I love the Southwest Burger (topped with taco rub, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo, and avocado), the Buffalo Chicken and Farm-Made Pecan Pesto Chicken Sandwiches, and any of the grilled pizzas or BBQ items--I realize that that's like a third of the menu but seriously all of these are bomb. The pizzas and barbecue are similar to what's available at Joe's other restaurants so you can't go wrong there and the Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, and \"Farm Favorites\" are all welcome additions to the already delicious spread. Make sure to get either the Onion Rings (my personal favorite), Garlic Fries, or Sweet Potato Fries (which come with a delicious pineapple-serrano dipping sauce) on the side of whatever you order!  Aside from the food, I love the setting here too, with plenty of outdoor seating at picnic tables for nice days and room inside to eat when it gets too hot (or cold...but let's be honest with ourselves here, this is Arizona). The fountain drinks are all available outside as well as self-service dipping sauces for all the tasty fried things you're sure to order. Whether you're looking for a healthier meal or something decadent, Joe's Farm Grill has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and portions are good sizes for the prices they charge. Cool atmosphere and a variety of options, this is a local favorite and worth the trip if your not from QC or STV. Hadve had multiple items that were all flavorful and cooked to order, if you are curious about the Ahi sandwich its great and super hearty, not some tiny little patty."}
{"text":"Saw this place reviewed by Guy on Diners, drive ins and Dives and thought we would try it and see what we thought! We pulled up and the line was about 30 deep but when we saw how fast it was moving we thought it wouldn't take long. It was worth the wait in line after we ordered they gave us a pager and within 15 minutes we had fresh amazing home made food and plenty of seating inside and out. We had breakfast and all I can say is pancakes the size of your head with home made sausage and potato fries. Oh and did I mention the home made lemonade and cheesecake. Great place we will be back"}
{"text":"First time there and the food was okay and I didn't have to wait long for the food to be ready.  There were tables available but none of them were cleaned. There were tons of flies in the indoor eating area.   Seems like a good place to go to when it's cooler outside."}
{"text":"I love the Gouda burger & garlic fries !! Great  food , great location , great service!! I like the community farming co-op thing they have going too. great place for a family outing. We come here for birthdays and any other types of  large family events, somewhat of a tradition! We love this place!!! Sit outside under the beautiful trees and enjoy A meal with the family at the picnic tables! You can't beat this!"}
{"text":"We met some friends here for breakfast and it's a great place. The grounds are amazing, the staff was pleasant and the quality of the food was great.  The quality of the food didn't translate into great taste. I had the French toast (my favorite) with eggs and it was good but honesty? I've had better tasting. I really wish I came for lunch and tried a burger, they look amazing.  They have a farm directly behind where some, if not all the food comes from. You can't get fresher than that!  The wait was crazy but it did move along.  I live in north Phoenix and would not come back due to the wait. I'm not going to drive an hour to wait an hour to eat. Just my 2 cents. If I was in the area for another reason, I would come and try a burger."}
{"text":"OMG!! I've been here MANY times. The burgers here are amazing. I love the fresh grilled taste they have. Their onion rings and French fries are addicting!! The milkshakes are also real and delicious! This is a place to go if you want some delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"The char-crust on the burgers are friggin' ridonculous! Every bite is an explosion of flavorness and juiciness, and whichever other 'ness' you could imagine.  The Garlic fries here have utterly ruined any other chance that any other garlic fry out there would have-ever.  I have not tasted their equal anywhere! First taste brings me back to my childhood.  With it's escargot-like butter concoction, I lost my mind!  They get extra points for the pool of residue that collects at the bottom of the fry boat. My mouth is literally watering as I type...sigh  Chocolate shake rounds out the dining experience due to it's bombness! get a spoon, they're thickness.  Clearly they have more to offer, but I have found the magic equation and will stick to it.  The pizzas do look good however...."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is a beautiful and tasteful environment! The line to order moves quick and your order is out in a jippy. Their Root Beer is one of the many things I go there for :) Any time  of the year works to be outside! Winter they have heaters, Summer they have plenty of shade and misters."}
{"text":"For all of the notoriety Joe's has gotten for being farm-to-table and all about the freshest ingredients, I - in my infinite wisdom - accidentally ordered something a meal that was entirely fried.  That's not to say the panko-breaded eggplant wasn't great, because it was fried well and came along with a great homemade marinara sauce. Similarly, the hushpuppies were equally excellent, made with pieces of actual corn for a little bit of texture. And the Friday fried cod was no slouch either, though given an upbringing where fish fries were the norm, the purity of ingredients approach did little to curb my ho-hum attitude.   It's easy to see why the line was out the door by the time I finished my meal - Joe's is a bastion of fresh food in a desert, but I advise those ordering to choose menu items that best highlight that freshness."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The area, the atmosphere and the outdoor seating area is just so welcoming to me. I usually try to get as much as I can when I get here and then I end up playing myself and realize I can't finish all of the food. I highly recommend the bbq platter, garlic fries, and the hot dogs I can recommend the whole menu but then again you'd end up doing the same thing as me and not finishing all of it. One of of my favorite - cool places to go to with friends and hangout.   #CERTIFIEDBANGER"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been going here for years and the atmosphere is amazing and still not as great as the super fresh food. It's gotten a little crazy since the Food Network show (I was there the day after not realizing; and the line was INSANE) but it doesn't dissuade me. Especially when you can take a walk down the path after and burn off a few calories and scope out the farm itself."}
{"text":"Great, fresh-tasting food! Love the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"For all those people whos experience was not so good at Joe's.  We have been going there for a long time! And Yes! The garlic fries are the hit of the menu, for that matter any menu. We have never had a bad meal ever! Maybe they ran out of tea a few times, but after mentioning it they fixed it right away. And as a group we have had most of the things on the menu. None ofwhich disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food, but long, slow lines when busy. I had the pulled pork sandwich with onion ring and both were delicious. My wife had a strawberry shake and a grilled cheese sandwich, which she enjoyed.  If you go when it's busy, leave a few people to save a table. You wait in line to place your order and then wait for your name to be called. A friend of mine who lives in Gilbert raved about this place and I always love going to places that appeared on Diners, Drive-in and Dives.  Scariest part about eating here: There are signs under the trees that warn about FALLING SCORPIONS! Yikes!"}
{"text":"As I was heading to San Tan Village today with my parents to do some holiday shopping, we were all throwing out ideas of where to eat. I suggested that we try Joe's Farm Grill.  I have been hearing about this place for years, seen several news broadcasts, and hell it was even showcased on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  So I was actually wicked excited to try it.  My parents each got burgers.  The burgers  were nothing special, heh.  I got the Ahi Tuna sandwich.  My complaint about the tuna is that is what cooked too long.  It came to me cooked as if it was a medium rare burger.  The next thing that really frustrated me and was a huge dissappointment was the bun they served it on.  It was an everyday hamburger bun that you can buy at any supermarket.  Lame.  As far as the atmosphere of the place, bleh.  The interior was kind of bland, nothing special to look at.  What I will give props to is that you can watch your food being cooked.  Technically it's not an open kitchen because you watch through windows.  I mean everything tasted fine, but it's not a destination that I will go out of my way for.  If I'm in the area I will stop by and try it again, and hopefully with better results food wise."}
{"text":"Bomb.com nuff said!!! The bleu cheese burger and garlic fries with fresh strawberry lemonade. Worth the drive and money."}
{"text":"I finally visited all three of Joe Johnston's places. And I am stuffed. I've been going to Joe's BBQ since 1998, tried Liberty Market in November and finally on my birthday went to Joe's Farm Grill for lunch.   And got my meal for free! What a nice surprise.  Mike had the Double Dogs (2 hot dogs) with onion rings. The onion rings were so crispy and goooood. The hot dogs were decent. He said he would get them again. I would be willing to get them on another visit if they were covered in chili and cheese. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and it was was absolutely delicious (I'm craving it right now just writing this review) with their regular french fries. The fries were also very good. Fresh and crispy. The burger was topped with cheese, BBQ sauce, an onion ring, bacon and blue cheese. Unbelievably good. And we couldn't pass up having milkshakes for dessert. You can pay for them at the time that you order your meal and go to the pick-up counter to get them when your done eating and bypass the line.   I loved all the outdoor picnic table seating and the huge tree in the back. The bathrooms are worth taking a look at. Just a little strange. The fireplace in the dining room is original to the house. It's a little dangerous that this place is so close to home. If you are coming during the lunch hour get here just before noon when it gets really busy.   I heard they will be having all kinds of specials in March to celebrate their appearance on \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives,\" and their episode will re-run on the Food Network a couple of times in March also."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place then your missing out. I was introduced to this place over a year ago by my sister. One I came here for the first time on my birthday. I was suggested to get the fontina burger with a side of sweet potato fries and let me tell you....my tummy was very happy. Everything is made with their fresh veggies which is grown in their farm. Everyone should try out this place I know you will not be disappointed. Trust me. Make sure you try out their sweet potato fries. If Guy Fieri approves of then that tells u something. Go to Joes Farm Grill"}
{"text":"If you want the breakfast or lunch hat trick of friendly, fresh food, and quick service, Joe's is your spot!  In a chain dominated area, Joe's is refreshingly old school and offers genuine authenticity."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great atmosphere. Place is always clean and a little customer service goes a long way. Favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"We LOVE Joe's Farm Grill! The building and grounds itself are reason enough to check it out, and the food is amazing. Head outside when the weather is nice and sit under one of dozens of huge, gorgeous old trees to enjoy your meal at a picnic table. The kids love running around in the grass and chasing the birds. The building has a cool history, if you're from the area and remember when the land was all farms. Try the hamburgers with grilled onions and the sweet potato fries- DELISH!!! Get there early for the lunch rush, as lines can stretch out of the building and down to the parking lot during spring and fall months. The staff is always courteous and the tables are sparkling clean. Even the bathrooms are kinda fun, with retro cartoons playing on small tv's in the walls. Make sure you hit them up on your birthday, for $10 towards your meal. Joe's Farm Grill is one of our favorite restaurants to visit when the weather is nice, and the Agritopia area is one of the most gorgeous spots in Gilbert. If you're looking for something different and want to enjoy the gorgeous spring/fall/winter weather, definitely head here!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Joe's Farm Grill was a great idea!  I saw it on Food Networks Diners, Dives and Drive In's and it stuck in my mind as a place that I wanted to try. It was a bit of a drive from where I was staying in Chandler, but it was totally worth it. Before stepping a foot into the restaurant, we fell in love with the grapefruit trees surrounding the building, such a cute area with a lot of outdoor seating. I ordered the special of the day, which was a grilled salad.  It was Romaine lettuce, topped with bacon, tomatos and blue cheese. Oh mama... so damn good. BUT what made me stop in my tracks was the GIANT slice of lemon- seriously it was almost as big as my hand. The salad was really good, and since it was grilled, it gave a nice smoky flavor but it was not over powering.  My only complaint is that we only ate their once.  They had plenty of items on their breakfast and lunch menu that I wanted to try.   I like that they use local ingredients when they can and look for healthy ingredients (natural beef for the burgers and transfat free oils)"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype is all about. I waited in a line that was out the door and gotten eaten my mosquitos outside. I love that they are local and serve locally grown food but it's not worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"This place does everything right. From breakfast to dinner, hands down, this place can't be beat.  Joe's big breakfast and their fontina burger are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice, all clean everywhere, nice places to seat inside and outside, food  really good! Good quality, fresh ingredients! Please try the sweet potato pie! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Delicious food with dog friendly patio. I had the grilled chicken pesto on the gluten free bun.w fries. The chicken was topped with diced grilled red peppers and mushrooms with a pecan pesto sauce. The sliced tomato was garden fresh. Yunmy!! Nice employee brought out a dish of cold water for our dog.  First time here, will definitely return.  Beautiful old trees provide nice shade!"}
{"text":"As usual I loved my favourite BBQ. This time I had the sliced brisket.  This was so yummy the crust in the meat was perfect and very little fat. I discovered the cheesy potatoes my new favourite side. I actually think the other sides are not so good   The only consistent downside of the meal is the bread. What ever they spray on the grill or the bread just leaves a really bad taste on the bread. The bread would be a wonderful vehicle to sop up extra sauce but the taste of the oil (whatever it is ). Leaves such a bad taste I usually throw the bread away. I always get the bread in hope the bad taste has gone"}
{"text":"This place is THE place to go for a good burger. The tuna burger is great too... just about everything is fresh from the farm out back. Mmmm.... the sweet potato fries..."}
{"text":"Full disclosure I haven't been back in over a year but that doesn't represent how much I enjoyed Joes. As soon as you walk in the aroma welcomes you with a sweet barbecue hello. I have been thinking about Joes non stop and can't wait to get back. Keep it simple and get a slab. Mac and Cheese is good and the beans hit the spot.  Picnic like set up for dining but it has its charm."}
{"text":"So yummy! We had the BBQ pork sandwich, fried zucchini, burger, strawberry lemonade and vanilla milk shake. Everything was perfect! We really enjoyed their homemade ranch!"}
{"text":"So if you ever been to Joe's in downtown Gilbert you know they have great food. Well same goes for this place! More diversity on the menu as far as not everything being bbq. Really quality ingredients, food takes some time, but that's okay! You gotta wait for good food :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! You can definitely taste the quality and freshness of their ingredients! I love their fontina burger and pesto chicken. It is my favorite. Make sure you try their milkshakes as well. The place is nice and peaceful. Great for family outings"}
{"text":"This is a neat place...we really like the farm to table concept.  Food was fresh and very good and service friendly.  The day we were there happened to be their annual customer appreciation day so we ended up having a burger (only option that day) as well as 3,200 other people.  Will definitely go back but next time not on such a busy day."}
{"text":"Everyone should eat here once.   It was a little bit more expensive than I expected but I mean the food was great.   I ordered the special which was like a bacon cheeseburger that day & my Fianceé got ribs (which i ate half of) .  Would HIGHLY recommend the ribs & sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are amazing. I really like how you can get $10 off your meal on your birthday. The atmosphere is fun, modern, and the staff is helpful even when its crowded."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and employees. I only gave 4 stars because it does get crowded all the time. There is enough seating to accommodate tons of people when it's crowded but the line just goes on forever out the door."}
{"text":"I came to Joes Farm Grill to try their breakfast, which I'd never had before but had been wanting to try for a while. The first time I came here was with my sister during the week so it wasn't too busy. She got the new biscuits and gravy which she said she liked, and I ordered the pancakes with berries. These pancakes are so good! The flavor is great, they're on the thin side which I like, but they also had a slight crisp on the edges which was perfect! The berries were nice and fresh and it came with plenty of them.  The second time I came here was a few weeks after on a weekday, so again, it wasn't too busy. I told my parents about the pancakes and they wanted to try them as well, so we all ordered them! They tasted the same as the first time I had them, so Joes has proven to be very consistent. The price is also very reasonable, and I love the new remodel! It is much more spacious and open and a really nice place for families. Look forward to trying more of their food!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, it was like coming home for breakfast.  Unfortunately it's lost its charm. Service is seriously lacking, food is mediocre and there are huge air vents blasting cold air on your food (even in the winter)  It's extremely frustrating to be served cold syrup for your pancakes ( that are also being blasted by cold air) cold air, cold syrup, cold pancakes, cold food.   The dining room smells like musty carpet. It seems they've lost interest in making this place great. I seriously doubt that Triple D would ever visit this place again.  The outside is nice but not worth paying for overpriced food just for picnic charm.  I'm sure this could all be remedied with some decent management.  Truly sad.  I gave it a 2 because the last three visits have been nothing but disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years. Always a place I go back to. The food quality can't be beat. It's casual yet the food is not your standard fast food. It's actually good and good for you! When I had family visiting, I brought them here for lunch. We came once again for dinner the following day since they loved it so much!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth driving 45 miles for great food! Food is fresh and delicious. If you're looking for a new place to try and want a different ambience this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I probably just ate half pieces of the best cheesecake I ever have! Unfortunately I asked my husband if he wanted to share it and he said YES.  But it's better for my waist line.  You can tell by the weight of the cake.   The grilled wild salmon was cooked to perfection. The beet salad,  so good.  The French fries were a bit salty.   Next time I ready have my eyes on the pumpkin pies!"}
{"text":"Trying Joe's in Gilbert AZ. Thought this was going to be a small place, on the contrary it's large with indoor and outdoor seating and surrounded by 40 acres. Hence the farm in the name. Place was busy with line out side. To the food, ordered the lamb burger stuffed with goat cheese. Not a big fan of lamb, but this was truly tasty. No gamy flavor at all. Perfectly grilled topped with some greens, a delicious treat. They have several homemade sodas to choose from. The prices were average for the area and the atmosphere was very friendly. If your out this way, head to the farm. BTW this is a Triple D joint"}
{"text":"Love it here! My favorites are the chicken pesto sandwich & the bbq chicken pizza! The wait in line is worth it! The atmosphere is wonderful & u must check out the bathroom (trust me)!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Did not disappoint. I have never ever ever had a bad meal here. My personal favorite is the mahi mahi sandwich. They just do it right and it's not easy getting good fish in Arizona."}
{"text":"Finally a great place to eat by my house. We moved from California and have struggled with the new food options in Arizona by comparison. This place however did not disappoint.  Fresh food with good portion sizes!  The only wierd thing is they have dolls in the bathroom..... super creepy... not sure what thats about lol."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé for a surprise date and omg so yummy. Always get the lemonade (there's like 4 types ) the people there are very friendly and nice. Also the burgers are big but not overpriced like other places. Always a good time when we come here."}
{"text":"Great food and worth the wait!  The line can be a little ridiculous but I will say that it wasn't as bad because an employee came out and educated us all about the menu item's and the daily deals. Hence the Burger for Two, which really could've fed four!!  The deal also included side of fries, coleslaw, one slice of tomato (not enough for that big burger), lettuce, some onion, and a few bites of cheesecake. Overall it was all very good!!! Price was decent too, cheaper then us both getting two separate orders of burgers and fries. My favorites are the Farm burger, sweet potato fries w the yummy pineapple goodness it's served with, and the Date Milkshake!!! Not so good was the Chicken salad sandwich, it was just meh.  The flies were a nuisance but what do you expect when the seating is mainly outside. No complaints here though, Joe's Farm Grill gets two thumbs up from me!  Note:  We got that burger about 3 months ago so not sure if it is a regular menu item."}
{"text":"Awesome healthy options for breakfast. The strawberry lemonade was so refreshing. We ate outdoors but options to eat inside as well. The omelet was very filling it came with a salad and side and a biscuit or coffee cake. The farm scramble was great as well will definitely come back -staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in SW by far! Family owned, great service, Old school. Luv the slider sampler and don't forget ur free meal on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Joe's is amazing.  My husband ordered the lamb burger and I ordered the jumbo shrimp.  The food is prepared with love and care. Fresh veggies and for sides. The onion rings were delicious.  So, looking for a fresh spot with great customer service,  eat here!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I just went there, thought we would try it again, and again, it was just....ok.  I had the ahi tuna sandwich and Megan had the cheeseburger.    The ahi sandwich came with this wonderful slaw on it, the best thing about the whole meal, very fresh and crunchy with a good flavor.   I took a bite of the tuna by itself and it was pretty much tasteless.  Would have been better if I'd poured salt on it (no more, high blood pressure you know).   Megan's cheeseburger was a little above average, mostly due to the thick slices of bacon that came with it.  French fries were ok, and the food was just kinda warm, at least Megan's was.  Mine, however, was not.  Bun was almost cold.  I don't think I'll be going here again.  For the price we paid for two meals ($25) it wasn't worth it, and this is the second time I have had just an \"ok\" experience here.."}
{"text":"Delicious and awesome staff ! I love the options to be able to sit outside on the picnic tables. You have got to try their garlic fries!!"}
{"text":"Found Joe's Farm on the list of places visited by DDD.   Unfortunately, the food was nothing special and not worth the cost of gas from Scottsdale.    We had the Thai Chicken Salad and the pork ribs/pulled pork combo.  The Thai Chicken salad came with 2 small grilled chicken breast, assorted greens, sugar snap peas, bean sprouts, sliced radishes, shredded carrots and celery along with a Thai vinaigrette dressing.  You could barely taste the dressing and it really didn't add much flavor.  The combo came with coleslaw and French fries.  We upgraded to onion rings for an additional $2.50.  Definitely worth the extra cost.  This was the best part of the meal.  The ribs were on the dry side, although the meat did sort of fall off the bones. The pulled pork was so so.  At least, the meat was moist.  Overall we were disappointed given all the hype.  Guess it won't be necessary to check  out the sister rib joint."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and enjoyed it both times.  The flies were a little out of control last time, but I don't think this is always the case.    I LOVED my fontina burger and the sweet potato fries (and pineapple dipping sauce) are divine! I've also tried the Bleu Cheese Burger and it was REALLY good.  I'd order them both again.  I don't think there is anything on the menu that I wouldn't try.   We waited in line once for about 5 minutes (the line moved fast) and the next time there was no line at all.  Luckily when there is a line they have menus for you to look through so you are completely prepared when you get to the window."}
{"text":"why is this place so far away??  we ordered a burger, the grilled chicken sandwich, fries and onion rings. we topped it off w a fresh strawberry shake since it was the special for the day.   we split everything and boy oh boy was it great! I have also heard that their pizza is awesome and their breakfast. I need to go back and get both.  also, don't forget to check out the bathroom. i think i spent like 15 minutes in there. lol jk. it is pretty entertaining though."}
{"text":"Located in Gilbert, AZ (East Valley). Been going here for over 10 years. Excellent food and service. Price is comparable to Red Robin.  You get anything from breakfast, burgers, ribs to salmon salad and seafood plates. Great family atmosphere. On your birthday they give you $11.00 to apply towards any meal."}
{"text":"Lots of hype around this place, lines all the way out the door all the time... The first time I ate here, I had the Fontina Burger, and was quite underwhelmed.  I also had the date shake, which had barely any date in it.  I didn't want to write the place off, however, since Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants.  This time, I went with the hot dogs: Carolina and Sonoran.  The Carolina dog sounded pretty good, with its pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and slaw toppings.  It was decent, but not as awesome as I thought it'd be.  The franks seemed to be decent quality, and the buns were nice.  If you get a dog, this is probably the best option.  Now, I knew going in that the Sonoran Dog would not be an authentic Sonoran dog.  Sour cream?  Really?  But I tried it anyways, hoping it would at least be good, even if not a Sonoran Dog.  It was underwhelming; seriously, guys, at least make it spicy.  If it doesn't even have that in common with a real Sonoran Dog, why is it called that?  A Sonoran Dog has pinto beans, bacon, mayo, mustard, pico de gaullo, tomatillo sauce, is served on a bolillo roll, and is served with a grilled hot pepper.  You can't just slap some bacon and beans on a hot dog and call it a Sonoran Dog.  This should be a crime.  This is a blatant affront to all of the hardworking Mexican immigrants who, through their efforts, created Arizona's finest contribution to the culinary landscape.  The outdoor seating is nice.  That's really about it.  They don't even have the awesome homemade root beer or lemonade they have at Joe's Real BBQ. Skip this, and stick with Joe's other restaurants."}
{"text":"Been to Joe's as far back as a couple of years ago and as recently as yesterday. The atmosphere is ideal if you are visiting Gilbert as it is the perfect representation of this town (farmy, sunny, a lot of real estate). The food is great as well. My Only complaint is the pricing. It can be a bit pricey compared to the market. Other than price, everything is fantastic. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A cute place with average food that is one of the few left to allow pets...and that's the reason you come here.  I'm not sure why so many rave about such average food, but it makes for a nice setting and a spring/summertime lunch.  Maybe if I had the cheesecake I'd be in a better mood ;)"}
{"text":"First time here. Wasn't overly impressed with the food, but even less impressed with the amount of flies in the restaurant. The whole time we had to swat flies away. Hueveros DE ranch were okay at best and served a little cold. :(probably won't go back. Sad because it's such a cute place."}
{"text":"I've been in this establishment a couple times and it never disappoints. The food is always fresh and made from great ingredients. The staff is friendly and accommodating and it's a nice family environment.  We came here recently for Mother's Day and I had the special of the day: coconut macadamia nut white chocolate chip pancake. I don't like white chocolate so I asked if they could substitute regular chocolate chips and they did! They get busy on the weekends but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We came here when visiting my mom in Chandler. I had to check it out since my hero from the food channel, Guy Fieri came here.  I had the house special bbq chicken pizza which has a ton of flavor and a nice grilled thin crispy crust. Mmmm. Highly recommended! Wifey and mom had salad which was fine. Supposedly they grow everything on site in their farm so the veggies are always fresh.   Overall the food is good, nothing spectacular but its definitely good. Service was friendly, which is very important to me!  They have picnic tables outside you can eat on, which is nicer than the plasticky 'school cafeteria' furniture thats inside.  I'll probably come back here on my next visit to AZ to try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"The wife and I didn't like it, for the money, it wasn't worth it. She had the curry chicken sandwich which really didn't pop with curry flavor and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was overpowered by the bleu cheese sauce and I like bleu cheese. We got there right at the transition from breakfast to lunch so we got the kids an overpriced breakfast and got ourselves an overpriced lunch. The only reason I give it two stars is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Little pricey,  but the food is really good. I really enjoyed the watermelon contest they did on memorial day weekend.  Very fun and creative."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Awesome and delicious fresh food. It's also pretty affordable. We love sitting outside and our daughter loves using their kid tables outside. Beautiful place in a beautiful area!!"}
{"text":"Location on the actual farm...now thats farm fresh.  Very casual, Very clean.  Food is the typical Dinner experience but its nice to know that Joe's farm grill makes the effort to use farm fresh products whenever possible.    My husband loved the pancakes.  You can tell the cakes are from scratch rather than a mix, plus, they are griddle fried,  not just cooked brown on both sides (if you know what I'm talking about then you know how much of a difference it makes) and they use real maple syrup without having to ask.  you can also tell the eggs are higher quality than grocery store eggs...score.  It will be interesting to come out and have dinner during a time of year when more farm produce is in season.  I look forward to harvest time!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for several years and we keep waiting for it to improve and it never really does. The food is just \"ok\" and we really only come here because there is a large grassy area where kids can run around and play while you wait for your food. This is a huge draw because it takes the stress out of having to keep your kids corraled the entire time. We've had the chicken tenders (strange), fish (ok), grilled cheese (the best thing we've had here), corn dogs, the BBQ platters (dry) and several other things in between. It's not that the food is bad....it's just not good - it's OK.  Our kids love to come and run around with other kids and that is the only thing that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Simple but so good! I've been coming here since I was a Sophomore in High School and every time I'm back home I have to come here! This place was on Food Network for a reason, because of the simple and fresh menu they have that will not disappoint! I try to get something different here every time I go, and have yet to come across something I didn't like. Using ingredients from their own farm, and BBQ from Joe's Real BBQ.  The burgers are delicious and fresh, the Fontina burger is a local favorite but the Bacon Blue Burger is right there too if you want something more meaty! The Grilled Chicken Pizza is a great choice if you're a fan of grilled pizzas. Do NOT miss your chance to eat the onion rings here, possibly the best onion rings you'll ever eat! Be sure to try out their Strawberry Lemonade to wash it all down, you won't regret it!   The only area I could vote this place down is the wait time. Come at prime lunch or dinner times and expect to wait for a good minute just to order. However, the wait is well worth it, and won't keep you from coming back!"}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner yesterday. We had the bacon blue cheese burger and the garlic Gouda burger with garlic fries and sweet potato fries. Basically the environment is super relaxed, the staff is super nice, the place is clean and efficient but the important part is these are probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and HUGE. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Joe's Farm Grill.  My bf and I went on a Sunday morning for breakfast and we were definitely pleased.  You order at a counter, find a table and wait for your buzzer to beep when they are ready.  The place was CROWDED with a ton of parents & kids, which was kind of annoying but hey, just because I don't have kids doesn't mean others aren't allowed to ;)  I had the Joe's Big Breakfast and my bf had the meat & potatoes .... everything was delicious.  Just make sure you're dressed for the weather because you are likely sitting outside at one of their picnic benches."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Joe's Farm Grill I got the Fontina Burger (hands down this is my favorite burger, maybe ever) and baked potato fries (fries topped with cheese, sour cream and bacon). That meal was SO delicious, it's what I keep getting every time I go back. One of these days I might have to try something else off that menu!   My meals there have always been consistently fresh and tasty. The shady outdoor picnic seating makes for a fun family outing. You can practically taste the nostalgia. I love how they have repurposed the family farmhouse.   Parking, seating and the service concept can be frustrating when they are busy. And it seems like they are always busy, and with good reason. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been more than once, so it is a place I would recommend going to at least one time. I think this place however is a bit over-rated just because it was on TV. To me it seems like diner food but with better ingredients, but I guess that's the point. It's the kind of place, if I rolled up and one of the obscene lines were forming, I would go somewhere else.   Eating outside, where the majority of the seating is located, is a pain. We had a ton of flies around last time, which my daughter kept freaking about. So we try to stick to the limited inside seating. We've also had 2 orders incorrect in the past, which were corrected, just not ideal when a hungry 3 year old is in the mix. Another downside is they do not serve alcohol, so a beer with a decent burger is out of the mix, and frankly seems just wrong.  I will say this is a neat place to take the kids, and yeah will go back for them and my wife who really likes the veggie burgers. Service is always friendly and even when it's busy they seem to be pretty quick with food delivery. And the food is actually pretty tasty and menu is pretty good selection wise. It's comfort food, so don't be fooled with the \"Farm Grill\" title thinking it's a healthy option, I have yet to try a salad there, but they do sound good from the menu.  When it comes down to it there are just better options in my opinion. Guess I'm on Joe's fence, hence the middle of the road rating."}
{"text":"We came here expecting it to be the end all be all of restaurants, considering it was on TV and if you speak to most people, they say how great it was. This was not the case in our experience. We can definitely do without. It was packed and not enough seating to hold all of the customers they had, so sitting outside in the cold (this was in early March), was not going to happen."}
{"text":"Good food and nice outdoor tables.  Prices fair and the beet salad is terrific!"}
{"text":"Line is soooooo long.  Especially on the weekends.  They need more registers.  Staff tends to seem kind of burnt out all the time.  However, the atmosphere is great and the food is so fresh and delicious.  We love sitting outside under the big trees looking out on the farm.  It is kind of romantic and low key."}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate the flies and flimsy napkins. Lines are long on weekends. Forget about trying to get breakfast on a weekend with less than a 45 min wait! Best time to go is evenings and early morning workdays. The fresh squeezed OJ Is super expensive but so delicious. Lots of variety in menu."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and you can taste how fresh it is. I would say that the prices are justified. I would love to come here more often just for the vibe of the place and the nice people that work there, but the place is a little to pricey to be just a casual hang out. I've been here a couple of times and i've been pleased with the food 100% of the time"}
{"text":"This little jewel is not to be missed. Their food is fresh and tastes like what you wish you could have on family picnics and barbecues - simple, delicious, and filling! I had a hard time choosing something because I wanted everything they offered. I had a great time sharing plates with my friends and sighing after every bite (no joke). The food is the staple to a restaurant, but here at Joe's, the environment is as well. The decor is fresh and modern, yet feels completely unintruding. If it's nice outside, sit near the huge trees and then take a walk by the garden nearby. In general, this place is full of happy, and I felt like a kid eating at a banquet. My favorite part? It might sound a little weird, but the bathrooms are the coolest. Expect a few surprises when you walk inside."}
{"text":"I really loved the dining experience here from start to finish. The food was very good and fresh.  I would recommend the sweet potato fries especially. So good. As a matter of fact, the veggies on my plate were what stood out, which is unique. I brought my children as well and they were happy & I felt comfortable With them in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We really only come here on special occasions due to the slightly high prices and long wait in line.  Even though I always say I am going to try something new on the menu, I end up getting a burger, fries and milkshake.  They are all really good.  When the weather is nice, we really enjoy sitting outside on the benches."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ pork, awesome scenery, you can sit inside or outside there is their farm all around the restaurant.  If you are within 40 mins of here you should make the trip!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go against the grain on this one. I think the food is decent but nothing special. We've tried various items but haven't  found anything to come back for. When we do go there it's with guests who saw it on TV and want to give it a try. The environment is kinda cool if you don't mind all the flies."}
{"text":"I went here after I saw a friend post this on facebook after it was on Triple D!  I went there around 8:30pm on a Saturday night right before they were closing and it was still packed, waiting a good 15 mins just to order.  What I got Fontina Burger with onion rings- Excellent Grilled BBQ Chicken Pizza - Somewhat tasty but I was full from my burger Vanilla Shake - The blue cherry hit the spot  Also had a bite of the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich which is somewhat great but I couldn't eat it as a meal.  If I went to Phx, I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have been a few times and I really just don't get the hype. I really like Joe's Farmhouse Grill though!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here about 20 times. After the remodel we're dealing with some pretty heavy lines now. The 'next level' mentioned is regarding pricing as we paid $37 and change for 2 burgers, one of them a combo and 2 sodas total. Thirty Seven Dollars. For that amount Ill be grocery shopping for a 3 day haul. I get it it's organic, most of everything they serve comes from the farm within a stone's throw of the restaurant and the meat is local. I am always confused as to why when that is the case, things are so much more expensive. I think restaurants are starting to realize in Gilbert that although people are flocking here to save money, that they have money to burn as a result and so raising the prices of what you would normally pay for up to maybe 20% above what the actual value...25% above actual value maybe, are what people are going to pay and they are. Now there are very long lines here depending on when you go and they've quite the nostalgic feel in the bathroom too. This place does very well but for two hamburgers and two sodas and an order of fries for $37 & change, there are other places in the town that I wouldn't mind stepping down a half star in order to get two to three times as much food should I want it. So Joe's will become our quarterly place to eat simply because it's just too expensive to eat here regularly. I do want to mention that the entire staff and management is nice though."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great burgers and their grilled salmon and pizzas are delicious.    Heard about this place while reading reviews on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Is that what put this place on the map because it definately appears to be a tourist destination on weekends.  Lines can be long depending on time of visit.  Indoor seating is limited but plenty of space outdoors.  Bring a blanket, find some shade under a tree and chill out (or use one of their many picnic tables.    I have returned often but will usually drive on by if lines are out the door."}
{"text":"It's a great place to have lunch outside this time of year(March). We tried several menu items. The rib meal was yummy, as was the Sonoran Dog, garlic fries, and onion rings. The grilled wedge salad was satisfactory as well as the pepperoni pizza. Be prepared to spend between$12-$15 a person. It was a nice place to try, but nothing I will drive over an hour to again."}
{"text":"I was visiting my parents for Father's Day Weekend and always wanted to take them to Joe's after seeing it on Food Network. It was great! The ahi tuna sandwich totally lived up to what I saw on the show! Everyone loved their food and we will definitely be back again one day!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place.  Great environment for families with cooled outdoor seating.  Ribs and BBQ platter were excellent!  Ribs were fall off the bone and the sauce was wonderful.  Side dishes very good.  We look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is one of the cutest spots in Gilbert!  Agritopia is adorable.  The food is good, but not incredible, especially for the price.  But, the atmosphere makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"Yumm so good and pleasant! Geat place for  after winning a soccer tourney!!! Gooooooal!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, and is a fairly decent portion size. My only two issues are that it is way, way overpriced, and rather bland. I've been to this place 4 times and tried different dishes and came away feeling the same each time. Great atmosphere though."}
{"text":"The seating is cafeteria style. I ordered a burger plain, no bun. It was okay not wonderful. I also ordered fried extra crispy with cheese on top. I was finished eating my burger by the time I got my fries not extra crispy with a very light sprinkle of rock hard shredded cheese.  The young woman (teenager) behind the window could not hear me or my husband when we were ordering our food, we had to repeat what we wanted over and over again."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for tacos, but there aren't many taco hotspots in Gilbert so we decided to lean back on to reliable Joe. I've never had a bad meal here and the streak continues. Today I tried the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, without the bleu cheese and they forgot to give us the celery that is supposed to come with it. We didn't realize that until we got home, but i really would have loved that celery. I was splitting the sandwich with my gf and asked to have the sandwich cut in half and when i got the sandwich they told me there were knives around the corner...essentially saying, \"do it yourself.\" Not a huge ordeal, but still would've been nice if they went the extra mile.  All in all the sandwich had a good spicy kick to it, exactly what I needed. We got fried zucchini as the side and the breading that came with it was perfectly crusted. Definitely went well with the marinara sauce, but I always prefer ranch with my fried products.   When we first got here, the line was out the door and pretty long. But, the line went by fast - really only waited 15 minutes or so and then we got our food in about 10 minutes...so it wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be. And while you wait, you know you'll be greeted with tons of little children running around with sticks whapping trees and tables...so it gives you a good opportunity to judge other people's parenting."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. The food is super fresh. You order at a window and they bring it to you. No alcohol but plenty next door at the brewery. High priced for the serving you get, but its all farm to table. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Cool place to bump elbows with someone new and make/meet friends. I'd definitely go back for their burgers."}
{"text":"I had the Salmon Caesar Salad yesterday for lunch and lets just say it's my new pregnancy craving! It was amazing! :)"}
{"text":"I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive..."}
{"text":"With 40 people already writing reviews: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  It is a simple place, much more diner than restaurant, you stand in line to order then pick up when your number is called. But the food is great. Wonderful salads and a fantastic grilled ahi tuna.  And did you hear, they grow their own veggies.  Would Guy or me ever lead you wrong?"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I lived less than ten minutes from Joe's for almost five years and ate here once...WTH?  I guess the location off Higley and Ray wasn't along my normal route, otherwise I would have been a regular for sure.  I'm spending the day with my Golden Retriever, Chloe Rose, so after a walk around the park and a stop off at the doggie juice bar for Mutt Muffins and Yappy Yogurt, I needed a decent spot for lunch that would allow the princess pooch to hang out with me.    The atmosphere at Joe's is really cool and very unique...it was portrayed well on the Food Network's \"Triple D\"  It's modern, kindof rustic and not Arizona at all.  Gotta love the TV playing cartoons and the Barbie Dolls/GI Joe figurines in the unisex restroom.    We ordered the signature BBQ chicken pizza (the bomb) and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich (one of the best I've ever had) which is HUGE....I ordered it on a multi-grain bun with blue cheese and \"upgraded\" to garlic fries which were to die for...seriously dripping with garlic and parmesean cheese.  I must also mention the pickles which were awesome...so fresh tasting since the cucumbers are locally grown.   I like that the condiments are self-serve along with the beverages.  I cannot wait to get back here for breakfast next weekend :)"}
{"text":"Four of us went Saturday evening, and I was excited to find several open tables inside and little wait to order.  It's a really neat building with a great story, appealing to my love of things local, natural, and organic.  Although....however natural my grilled cheese and french fries were, I'm sure they weren't healthy!  Definitely delicious with the texas toast, and a chocolate shake to top it off!  The boyfriend enjoyed the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger and garlic fries, although I had to stay away from him after that because those were stroooong!    I'm not sure it's a good place to go on a date, since yes, there were plenty of kids around and this was just a Saturday evening.  In fact, several were playing in the ditch as we went to leave.  I can only imagine a weekend morning.  Great if you have kids since there's lots of outdoor space to run around in, not so great if you don't want to hear it.    Overall, a unique and pleasant addition to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I say, \"Thai Chicken Salad,\" and \"would go back if nearby.\"  I thought the sign warning that anyone doing commercial photography would be charged with trespassing was strange. There must be a story here."}
{"text":"Food is good, but someone needs to be here to watch the gaggle of 17 year olds that don't give a shit about their jobs. Customer service isn't terrible but I don't know if they are pretending to be slow or are actually slow."}
{"text":"We love this place nice atmosphere good fresh food never a disappointment. Always nice to be able to let the kids run around in the grass on a beautiful day on their grounds"}
{"text":"The farm grill is soooo good. I think the food is quite superior to the bbq joint. I love the bbq chicken pizzas,-and the green eggs and ham for breakfast! I've actually never tasted anything bad here. The burgers are really good as well."}
{"text":"Well, I wish this place was worth it.  The food was good compared to the typical stuff can find this far out into the east valley, but it wasn't mind blowing.  I tried the famous fontina burger, and it was decent.  It wasn't worth the huge wait to get it.  Standing in line for 40 minutes just to order isn't really worth a burger to me.  The ingredients were fresh, and I could tell that they were high quality.  If someone wanted to eat there again then I would, but I wouldn't go on my own again.  It wasn't anything special enough to wait that long to order.  It's what I would refer to as just vanilla.  What I mean by that is it might be good or fun to you... If you are a Mormon."}
{"text":"The Ahi Tuna Sandwich was delicious. The meat was cooked perfect and was high quality. I get a similar sandwich when I go to the yard house and let me tell you this sandwich puts the other one on Mcdonalds status. The Milkshakes were just typical milk shakes but you could taste the more quality ingredients. The line was long but moved rapidly. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Great food!  BBQ pizza and fontina burger wonderful.  Need more places like this closer to home!"}
{"text":"The fontina burger & garlic fries are amazing!! (& always my go to) Staff is always friendly (the manager even helped me find a salon because she took the time to find out I was new to the area... And my hair looked terrible hence why I was diving face first into a fontina burger & garlic fries )"}
{"text":"As you can probably perceive from the picture I took, the restaurant has a beautiful atmosphere that's as fresh and vibrant as the food they serve! Plenty of outdoor seating and even some indoor seating for restaurant goers.   It was a after noon but it was still crazy busy, so be prepared that there are many other people that know about and want to enjoy this yummy food! It's well worth the crowd in my opinion. I had the fish fry special and sure enough this was flaky hand breaded and well seasoned fish. I don't like ordering fish in AZ, however, the food here looked so good and fresh and so many people ordered it, I gave it a try. What I really enjoyed were the corn fritters that were full of flavor and so crunchy on the outside! Inside were while corn kernels that added a nice texture and pop of sweetness to the hush puppy. The fries and slaw didn't disappoint!   They do have desserts as well but I was too full to try any... Next time Joe's! :) I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, nice and fresh and the burgers are great. I did knock a couple stars off since the past few times I have called in a phone order the person has been extremely rude. In addition, they will have a line winding through the restaurant, out the door, to the street and still only have one person taking orders. I love the atmosphere and that its family friendly, but I'm not willing to put up with subpar service and waits over 30min just to put in an order. There are so many other great places in Gilbert now that Joe's had better get this under control. Especially the service. I called today to put in a phone order and heard the girl verbally go \"ok ugghhhh.\" Really?!?!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Joe's Farm Grill. I haven't had a bad meal yet. They provide open outdoor seating areas that are pet friendly. It's great place to stop after coming from Cosmos Dog Park just down the street. :)  For those of you that like to eat flour tortillas with your breakfast.... guess what, they don't have them. The gal at the register looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when i asked for one. They do have tiny corn tortillas or flat bread that will suffice."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. I went here with two of my best girlfriends for lunch before our shopping spree and fell in love with this place.  It's a perfect place for lunch with the family or even if you are on a date. The eating area is surrounded by plenty of trees(orange maybe?) I forgot for a second that I am in Arizona. Almost all of their food are locally grown and the produce are harvest on the same day....from their farm to your  plate.  I had grill salmon with asparagus and it was delicious, my friends had a BBQ hamburger(6 oz., thick cut bacon, blue cheese, hand-breaded onion ring, Joe's Real BBQ sauce.) and from the expressions on their faces it was DELISH. I recommend the zucchini fries, garlic fries and onion rings...it was a feature on food's network.  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"The food is great ! The service is great! Could always use more help but I think I got there during rush -dinner time.  Super cool bathrooms!  the tables could use some better cleaning- I always feel like the wet towel is just spreading the germs from one table to another  Will return to try the salmon next time ."}
{"text":"I love love love this place and take out of town visitors here when I have the chance. It's usually about $10 for a burger which is average amongst restaurants but the food is delicious!  The onion rings in the burger is a great touch too. Great place to eat and hang out!"}
{"text":"Overall I enjoyed the food and the outdoor setting.  While it fell a bit short of a 5 Star rating, I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"A few negatives about this restaurant. First off, I ordered our food and drinks. Being this is my first time I assumed the drinks next to the check out were all they had so grabbed our waters and headed out to a picnic table...only to get chased down by the manager for not paying for our drinks! After crediting me back for the drinks he \"thought\" i was getting he had chased me down and humiliated me for 40 cents! Not a very good manager. Secondly, they sure do use a lot of throw aways, plastic and paper- not great for the environment. Food was OK, not great- lots of fried items, if that is healthy? I defiantly will not be going back or recommending them to my friends and family in the area, especially after their mistake ringing up our drinks- and then chasing me down for a measly 40 cents. And then to top it off, they don't recycle their glass bottles that he chased me down for the 40 cents- I had to bring home to recycle. WHAT?? SMH."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome environment. Everything is laid back and backyard seating so nothing too comfortable but the organic home grown food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this perfect restaurant. I love the ambiance, the FOOD (of course) and the fact that there is a farm right outside the restaurant that they grow veggies and other delights that they use in their cooking! Talk about farm to table!!   First off, this truly is a great summer restaurant to hit up, with it's beautiful outside seating around orange trees and other greenery. If there's a long line, no bother. You can walk 2 minutes away down to the farm and look at all their beautiful flowers, plants, and produce that they grow. GREAT place to let the kids run around.   Even when they are super busy, I feel like the line moves pretty quickly. They are very friendly and truly desire the highest quality for their food, which I admire so much.  Highlights from the menu: Salmon Salad (If you are a Salmon fan, this is for you) Farm Veggie Burger (LITERALLY the best one I've ever had, no lie) Any of the pizzas Any of the BBQ plates Garlic Fries (A MUST) Any of their shakes (they vary from season to season, all used with fresh ingredients from the farm!)   You really just have to go there and experience the greatness for yourself. If you love good food and enjoying the sunshine on a gorgeous day, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"One of my three favorite onion rings!  The food tastes unusually fresh for burgers, pizzas and so forth, but they use local growers (many in their Agritopia subdivision).  The feel is very neighborly and is fun when you can sit outside and not fry."}
{"text":"Great vintage look to this restaurant.  Very tasty burgers that were well cooked and seasoned.  The peach milkshake was excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience, great food, fun atmosphere! Really kid friendly and feels like you are far from traditional dining experience in the suburbs!"}
{"text":"This gem is only minutes away from our house and life is better for it! Whether you order in or to go, the food is usually prepared in a timely fashion and I haven't had a bad dish in 7 years. I recommend the bbq bacon Bleu Burger! I also recommend eating outside under the old tree!"}
{"text":"Have heard about this place for years and finally tried it.  The ambiance is the best part.  However at night it is quite dark to sit outside on the picnic benches.  They really need more of the Christmas style lights.  Parking is abundant but packed.  The line was 24 minutes long on a Saturday night with only one employee taking orders.  Food was just okay.  Burger is very meaty tasting and thick.  The fries were cold fast eating outside so might have been better if I could have eaten faster.  My kid liked the pulled pork with sweet potato fries and coleslaw.  The drink choices are different.  Tasted all of them.  Went with the root beer first but it had a strange aftertaste.  Then tried the blood orange soda mixed with a bit of coconut soda.  That was way better."}
{"text":"We came on free burger day and only expected a free burger and thought they'd make us pay for anything else. They hooked us up! A delicious burger! Fries and a drink. This was awesome. We will definitely be back when in town again. They have their own garden and a huge beautiful shady outdoor sitting area. And they gave out free burgers for their 10th anniversary!"}
{"text":"Overall one of the better casual family dining spots in the east valley, but the consistency of the dining experience has diminished over the past year. The food is always good and sometimes great. It used to be the other way around. Though the outdoor dining is nice, the grounds are looking like they need an overhaul. Prices have always been slightly high, but not outrageous."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super neat to sit outside and listen to the exotic birds they have. Food great and will go again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Can't wait to come back. The line gets crazy long. We arrived at 4:45 with no wait in line. By 5:00 the line was out the door! The portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious! The atmosphere is nice with lots of outdoor space to sit. Beautiful trees and surrounding farm. We will be back next time we come to the East valley."}
{"text":"Joes farm grill has always been one of my favorite places to go into, until recently. Don't get me wrong I will always love their breakfast tacos even though on occasion their potatoes are overcooked.  Their food is pretty good when it comes to flavor but lately I don't think it's worth the trouble of having to get our order right. I have had on numerous occasions gotten my order wrong.  Which isint a big deal if you eat there but when you take it to go, it's not something you wanna drive back for. They don't open your food when they give it to you to go so always make sure you check it yourself. Because it will save ya the drive and having your food half cold by the time you drive back home. Also today they told me they don't do \"no ice\" on drinks.  I ordered a lemonade and when I ordered the drink with no ice they didn't tell me anything about their policy. So when I got the drink, it had ice. I tried to get one without ice and they told me their manager tells their employees to put ice on their lemonades regardless if the customer asked for it otherwise. Had the lady told me at first I probably wouldn't have ordered it. With this order alone not only did they forget to tell me about their no ice policy but the girl over the phone forgot to add the extra side of beans I had ordered over the phone. I know we all make mistakes but it gets frustrating when it happens so often :/.  Anyhow long story short make sure your order is correct before you get it to go because from my experience I have decided to hardly ever go back to joes because of their inconsistencies."}
{"text":"I really wanted to dislike this place.  I thought for sure I'd hate it and think it was overrated.  I've driven by and seen the lines and laugh \"I'm not waiting in a line like that for food.\"     So one day my daughter got out of school early, and we rushed to try it before the line starts. Which worked, only two families in front of us.  To start, the atmosphere was NOT my thing (note one star missing).  It reminded me of a concession stand at a zoo (flies and all).    But the food was sensational. I ordered the Blue Cheese and Bacon Burger, which was one the best burgers I've had in AZ.  My daughter ordered the chicken tenders, which were delicious (we always share a bite, just to compare).  We don't usually eat fries, but even their fries were good.  I also had the onion rings, which I've had better.   We will go back, and I will try one of their huge fresh salads that I saw others with."}
{"text":"I've got nothing bad to say about this place. Great staff, great service and wonderful cooked food. I've been here countless times and never had a bad experience. If I go though, I prefer for selection of hots dogs, two for $9.99.  But one is enough and will keep you longing for more. Can't wait to go back! Such a fun environment."}
{"text":"Great food, service is pretty fast! My family loves going here because of the outdoor patio. There are both indoor seating and outdoor with shade or in the sun! I love the sauce dispensers, where you can get your own ranch, mustard, ketchup ect! Also be sure to check out the bathrooms they're hilarious!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to cross the Farm Grill off my Yelp bucket list for a few years now! I'm over here in AZ visiting family so I finally had the chance to do just that  I had the Take Two foot long hot dog! It was great! I was told the dog was home made. It was top notch. I am the kinda guy who likes a dog to snap as you bite into it! The bun was great; tasted like it was home made and grilled.   My wife had the BBQ Chicken pizza. It was awesome. The bread used for the crust was definitely home made and had great texture.   The service was great! Very friendly staff! The place was super clean! We'll be back! I have two or three other items is like to try!"}
{"text":"This place is just FUN!!!  Kids / Grandkids can run crazy in the open air eating area.  And your visit to the restroom will be equally as fun - hard to describe, just know you will enjoy a visit to the restroom!!   Great family heritage of the building and some fun menu items that you just don't find other places!  My grandchildren love the Green Eggs and Ham breakfast for obvious reasons!!  I love their burgers and Triple D made their chicken BBQ pizza famous!!  Great fun, great food!!  There may be a line at prime hours - but they move quick and worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Before they changed the menu this would have been five stars, but they recently got rid of the grilled peanut butter and banana split sandwich and that was one of our favorite things. We are heartbroken. My brother got the hot dogs instead and was very disappointed. He took one bite, said they taste \"funky\", and didn't want to eat anymore. So unless the sandwich is brought back I don't see us coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I will say this...it was a commute to get there...but worth the drive. I love the whole concept of 'preserving agriculture' and growing all menu produce in the adjoining farm - and you can taste the difference - everything is fresh. While the decor was very lacking in its cafeteria style of service....the food made up for it - the burgers, the Ahi Tuna Sandwich....well I was 'IN\" at the sweet potato fries. The portions are far from shy ....so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday and we were not disappointed. This place is delicious and a wonderful concept. You wait in line order your food, which is exquisite, and then eat on the picnic benches outside. We loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place because everything is fresh and delicious. They really care about their customers and will do whatever it takes to make the customer happy!! I like the chicken sandwich and the salads!! I also buy the BBQ sauce b/c it doesn't have food coloring in it and it is delish!"}
{"text":"Not only is Joe's a great concept restaurant to get a tasty meal, but it's also a great outing for the whole family.  A wonderful outdoor area with gardens in every direction on a working farm.   We are happy to make the trip from Tempe for this place!  Consistently a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and local. Sometimes a wait but worth it . My dad is buffalo chicken sandwich , homemade ketchup. Free birthday lunch,  great open space outside to eat"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Love the coffee, the burgers, the farm ....just amazing....can't do wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance set up on a farm, food wasn't what I expected for the environment (greasy burgers and saucy chicken sandwiches) but still very good.  Not pretentious like other restaurants with the same style of set-up.  It's a bit pricey but the quality is good and you will definitely not leave here hungry.  It's very busy and loud but still a nice atmosphere.  Lots of waitstaff to clean up and help.  VERY clean for the size and how busy it is.  Fun little shops on the same property to walk around and look while your food settles.    Words of advice, if you like lemonade but not very sweet, order an extra cup to add water and mix.  The lemonade is delicious but very tart and way too much sugar for my taste.  I ended up getting a good 4 glasses out of my 1 drink.  Also, when certain items run out they don't post it.  I ordered twice and was told they were all out and had to settle on my 3rd choice.  Still very good though."}
{"text":"Very delicious burgers.  This felt like a nice little hidden gem out in Gilbert.  Beautiful location."}
{"text":"NOT Handicap friendly. Went here after seeing them on Channel 10 news and viewing their menu online. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was very put off by management's lack of humane treatment toward the handicapped. After expected the handicapped to endure long lines STANDING outside in the hot sun, you would think management would at least offer a chair when asked if there was anything they could do for the handicapped. And not being 20 years old anymore, you would think they'd accommodate the aging category with a foot long hot dog that ISN'T loaded with the chili and cheese on it. (You can ask for it, but they charge you $10.99 for a hot dog, the same as the fully loaded one.)  And the outside dining area, which really brings in the farmhouse feel, isn't really wheelchair friendly, with several inch drops off the sidewalk to the picnic tables.  That's a shame because aging and handicapped individuals deserve the same opportunity to enjoy their nostalgic \"food stand\" goodies as much as the next guy. Nevertheless, I gave them two stars for their great food offerings, if you don't mind overpaying for items you can't eat or being in pain when you do finally get to sit down and eat them!"}
{"text":"The Bomb, but what's up with those crazy lines..... The food is great 100%if the time"}
{"text":"Very good food and an awesome place. It can be very busy but you can't blame them for that."}
{"text":"This place is always packed! Their burgers are amazing and is totally worth the wait at lunch time. The garlic fries are a great upgrade and their ranch is fantastic-- we love going here!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! The Mediterranean scramble and the imperial omelette were INCREDIBLE!! This place is amazing every single time I go and the staff is so helpful!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for quite some time and to be honest the reason that I am moved to Arizona. I went for a walk after lunch in the garden and walked into Agritopia looking at houses in the area and fell in love.  The food is awesome. The ambience is casual. There is nothing like it in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Burgers, chicken and sides are all fantastic. Farm fresh produce. Good quality meats.  This is one of the most fun restaurants to eat at. Sit outside under a pine tree at a picnic table.  The perfect place to bring out-of-town guests for a great meal, and memorable experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ate here this past weekend while visiting Phoenix.  We enjoyed the food very much.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with garlic fries, my wife ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich with onion rings and a chocolate malt, my mother and stepfather ordered burgers with sweet potato fries and fried zuchini and my 2 1/2 yer old got a kid's cheese pizza.  Everything was really good.  We all tried some of each of the sides.  Everyone loved the garlic fries.  The onion rings were very good.  My wife and mother liked the sweet potato fries. The pizza had really fresh sauce and the crust was quite good.  My wife's chocolate malt was the best we have had in a while.  The food was all very fresh and quite tasty.  We will definitely eat here again when we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Vegan and vegetarian friendly On top of that,  the vegetarian burger is THE BEST I've ever had in my years of being a vegetarian.  I couldn't stop eating.  It's made with vegan 1000 island dressing as well.  The owner stopped by to visit us during ite lunch and she was so sweet.  Only dropped 1  because the iced tea is instant,  not fresh brewed :( it was pretty gross.  I dumped it out immediately and got water instead."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, the location, the backstory of how it came to be. Fontina Burger!"}
{"text":"I think this place might be a little too hyped on Yelp. It's not the culinary extravaganza I thought it would be.  Basically, Joe's is a counter-order diner with fresh food. I thought the menu items were pretty basic, and portions were rather small for the diner-restaurant category. The food quality is good, don't get me wrong, and the place is pretty cute. The bathroom is awesome.   But overall, I'd say this falls into the very good, but not OMG amazing ranking."}
{"text":"Delicious food made from local fresh ingredients and a beautiful park like setting with ample seating. Don't be deterred by the long line to order, it moves quickly and doesn't take long to receive your food."}
{"text":"love this place. I discovered it b/c it's next to cosmo  dog park. This place is an oases in the center of the desert if you like to get that country feeling with greenery, trees and chirping birds. The food is awesome. The burgers are amazing.  The weekends are crowded so if you can go during the week, it's much more relaxing. Wish i can live in this development called Agritopia which is attached to the farm. Lovely farm feeling. Love it!"}
{"text":"I had to experience it since everyone was raving about it.  Not sure what the hype was about, I had the tuna and it was tasteless, but I loved my garlic fries.  I'm not sure but I pictured it as a sit down and a server comes over restaurant, not a fast food joint.  Everyone else in my party liked their food, but didn't think it was the greatest thing ever.  Don't believe the hype.  If it wasn't on Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it wouldn't of been as successful."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about coming here. I just wanted a margarita and some sub-par food to absorb the tequila. Finding out that I was being taken to some fast-casual burger place without alcohol was slightly disappointing to me. I sucked it up and went on Yelp to see what's good here, and imagine my surprise to see over 700 reviews with an average of 4 stars. Suddenly, the afternoon started to look up.  Based on Yelp reviews, I ordered the Fontina Burger with garlic fries, my friends ordered The Farm Burger and BBQ Bleu Cheese Pizza, and together we shared the Butter Pecan Shake.  The first bite of my burger made me forget all about cool refreshing margarita waiting for me at some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. My burger was better than alcohol --- fuck that noise. This is clearly going to earn my five stars.  After I embarrassed my friends by moaning out loud while eating my burger I was actually stoked about my garlic fries. Imagine my surprise to find out that I hated them. I hated the garlic fries. I love garlic, I love fries, but I HATED these garlic fries. Actually, I hated them so much I forgot how much I loved my burger. They were just so pungent and strong and overwhelming. I was eating raw garlic on soggy, oily fries. Eck, just remembering it makes me queasy.   I had a five star burger and a 1 star side of fries, that unfortunately averages out to 3 stars. However, my friends raved about their food so I'm bumping up to four and calling it a night. A good margarita will surely erase the taste of garlic fries from my person."}
{"text":"i read their menu and decided it was too simple for me to try.  then my husband said he wanted to go so on we went, and boy i was surprised.  yes it's simple; burgers/dogs/milkshakes/fries.....but they do it WELL!  the fries are some of the best i have ever had...they taste sooo fresh.   pretty cool building too, and a lot of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and you can tell the employees take pride in their job. If you want a nice day to take a walk around the farm as well as eat one, this is the place! The pizza is delicious and don't forget to get one of their seasonal shakes. Not to mention the fried zucchini is amazing! Get there early and avoid noon since the line does grow fast."}
{"text":"One of my partners lives in Agritopia with his wife.  It's a nice community, and we just happened to be visiting. He felt bad that we had such a bad experience at Joe's Real BBQ that he wanted to buy us dinner to redeem his dreadful recommendation.   Therefore, he and his wife take us to another one of his Gilbert Faves - Joe's Farm Grill.  He talked up a storm about this place, and he also mentioned that this place was featured in the Food Network show entitled Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  This would have probably been a big deal to me, if I had actually seen this show. Seeing as that I barely watch TV, I really wasn't that overly impressed.   That quickly changed when we got to Joe's Farm Grill, which was just around the corner.  As we pulled up, both my wife and I just marveled at the exterior. It was such a throwback to a  past era, and it was quite inviting. Definitely very \"urban farm-like\" and fits right in with the overall surrounding neighborhoods.  I just wanted to hang out, and this time around we weren't really that hungry. So, we opted for a light fare. I chose the Salmon Combo, and my wife had the Hotdog. Nothing too fancy so that we could spend more time talking, rather than obsessing about the food quality.  My wife really enjoyed her Hotdog. Not sure what was in it, but she had nothing but good things to say about it. My Salmon was just marginal. Probably more hype, than actual flavor.   However, the surroundings, the atmosphere, the company, and the other friendly customers made up for whatever was lacking in my particular food selection. This time around, we chatted up a storm with just about everyone around us.   We stayed longer than we normally would have, but it was definitely a fun and memorable time discovering this Gilbert treasure!"}
{"text":"Modern convenience meets mommas cooking. Burgers are hard to pass up, but there are several other menu items that are awesome. Chicken fingers for one. Try the garlic fries if you dare."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is packed, something for everyone. Can grab a quick meal or spend an hour enjoying the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the Food, the Chicken Sandwich was very good and the sides are amazing! The Line is always long I wish they would open the 2nd register at night and on Sundays"}
{"text":"I don't know why everybody is so crazy about this place. Wait time is long and food is mediocre. You can't really screw up a burger, so that's okay. But the other sandwiches, like the ahi sandwich or portabello sandwich sound great, but are mediocre at best. Preparation was lacking--probably needed a hotter grill. Crowded, slow, mediocre food...no desire to return. Oh, and overpriced."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review, I am really for proactive owners. I really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time I went there it was really good. I was given a gift card to wipe out what I paid for the last meal as kinda of do over. I will be back Anthony and I will let you know how my next visit is."}
{"text":"Little overrated in my opinion. The salmon had no flavor at all. The garlic sauce that came with it was good. The baked potatoes fries weren't anything special. Milk shake machine was broke when we went to. I'd give it one more chance but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. I had breakfast for my first visit. I had the 4 cheese omelette with extra crispy bacon on the side and fruit with a biscuit. The food came out fairly fast and what was cool is we didn't have to get up from our conversation to get it inside as we sat outside.   The sweet lady brought us out our food and it was hot and took care of us as needed. Outside on the picnic tables were great and I loved the trees and all the shade to have an enjoyable meal.   I was maxed out full and the portions were just right. I like the peace sign and the overall vibe and ambience.  I did get a little impatient as I was trying to read the menu on the tv screen when ordering and it kept transitioning to a different screen off the menu. I didn't see any paper menus so just tried to figure it out and make a decision before it switched.   If I'm ever in the area again as it is quite for me to drive, I will be back for sure and try other items.  I haven't been for lunch but would think the food has the same quality."}
{"text":"Found a maggot in my pesto chicken sandwich. Super gross. Not happy.  My mother and I were sharing the sandwich when we found it. Both of us have been sick since we got home. Ruined her birthday."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast. All the vegetables are grown here and it is the real deal..  Give it a try"}
{"text":"Ahi-Tuna Sandwich, as described by Guy Fieri from Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.    It is sooooooooooo good!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to go with large groups or with kids. Lots of different types of food. Hamburgers, grilled chicken, barbecue, pizza, salad are a few options. Try the sweet potato fries. Fun atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is that perfect little  Sunday brunch spot for the family! With an open restaurant, tons of natural lighting, and ample seating outside its the perfect place for the kids to run around while you wait or have an impromptu photoshoot. I've bene here twice and first time for the Fontina burger with truffle fries then the Farm Fish Fry special with Asian slaw and fries. I have to say, the Fontina burger was amazing. The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy and immensely flavorful. Topped with truffle oil and mayo made this meal almost heavenly. The fish fry wasn't anything too special, just tried fish. The owner did come out and say the fish is caught fresh in the mornings and brought to the grill - and it definitely was true. The food was of the highest quality both meals. My partner got the chocolate milkshake which is about 16 oz for $5.09. If you plan on eating a full meal, that milkshake would be idea to share. But it was perfectly sweet and did not taste artificial at all. Joe's has become a favorite and I'll definitely come back for brunch one day!"}
{"text":"Fun place to get together with large groups. The food is always great. They offer a generous $10 credit on your birthday. My favorite is the fontina burger."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place forever, and I finally got around to stopping by last night!   The food was great. I had the ahi tuna sandwich with fruit, and my boyfriend had the pulled pork with seasonal veggies and sweet potato fries. I really loved how fresh everything tasted. They grow a lot of the ingredients right on the farm, which I think is really great and obviously contributes to the freshness and quality of everything.   The vibe is relaxed, and you go up to a window to order and then pick wherever you want to sit. There's tons of families and kids running around, so if you're not in the mood for lots of noise and kids playing, this might not be the place for you.   After dinner we walked around the farm a little bit, and it really is beautiful. It was a fun low-key date night spot and I'm sure it's always great for families."}
{"text":"I haven't taken a single bite here that I didn't love.  The setting is great, the food is delicious, and the service is quick for a busy place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the 1st time today! It was a really fun experience! Loved all the creative design and the food was really good. We got the breakfast burgers. It's dog friendly since there is seating outside."}
{"text":"oh man, I gained 5 pounds on Sunday but since it was from Joe's I don't even really care - it was that good.   I won't go into the local ingredients, Agritopia, etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing. More below.  The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there's a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself!  I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesn't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age.   Sitting outside wasn't too hot, as it's the one place I've seen so far where the misters really work and don't just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed. Nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall.  Oh, and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time. definitely worth going to again, and again ..."}
{"text":"Tried this place because we saw it was featured on Diners, Drive In and Dives show.    We were not disappointed.   The food was fresh, quick, and very tasty!     We've been back several times since and tried other things and never had anything that wasn't tasty!   One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here!  It's fresh, well priced, and unique!  My husband loved their green eggs and ham dish for breakfast.  The place is decorated nicely, and like was mentioned in other reviews, the service is excellent.  Just be sure to avoid rush hours, if possible, because the line can get long and the seating sparce."}
{"text":"Pricy but worth It. Not a big choice of menu but just a fun place to go. The fried green beans and garlic fries are out of this world. The shakes are ok. I love he burgers and the pork tenderloin sandwich is big."}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farm Grill! Amazing food, great service,  and incredible atmosphere! I always enjoy bringing out of town guests to experience this local treasure and now that I live out of town, we always make make a point to stop in for the best food in town when visiting. The Farm Burger is my favorite, the simplest food done so incredibly well! The fresh squeezed lemonade is a must and you can taste the freshness in every bite of food. I highly, highly recommend Joe's Farm Grill!"}
{"text":"Great place, fresh food, lots of choices . indoor/outdoor seating. Great food. First time here had a great meal and the service is good . The place does get a bit crowded, but is well worth it. My wife had the portabella mushroom sandwich which was fantastic I had Sonoran dogs and really enjoyed them the fries were great too. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Joes farm food is excellent.   Food is fresh and delicious.   Breakfast is just as good as lunch.  Great place to sit outside and enjoy the scenery with your family.  Staff is friendly and helpful, I recommend coming here anytime you are in the area for some good ole' American food!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in line on the weekends.  Friends loved the Fontina burger.  BBQ chicken pizza was very good.  Garlic fries are made with real garlic, very intense.  Good Stuff  Lots of kids running around"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here! Lines can be long and slow but the food makes up for it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Okay, we gave Joe's Farm Grill a rest for a bit after the last review... And only visited once in blue moon... Since the last review, we have gotten a couple pizzas, fries, and burgers here- before the renovation- and it was pretty good. We just came back since the renovations inside and I am happy they made the indoor dining area updated and larger. The food was delicious today. I like now that they bring it to you and I like the way they bring out the coffee and cream much better- although I would recommend bringing the coffee out a bit sooner, especially before the meal, as we didnt get it until the food arrived and usually I like to sip on it a bit before and just enjoy the coffee in and of itself and the surroundings before the meal. I like now that they have the silverware, napkins, and condiments at the table and a two sided drink fountain inside. The biscuit with the orange marmalade butter was amazing- and as a garnish(!) I think it is incedible they added a biscuit or coffee cake with the meal, brilliant! The only other improvement I would suggest is come around more frequently with the coffee please!!! It didn't really seem they came back with the coffee after the first refill (which was overdue when it was receiced as well). Otherwise, we were super impressed with the changes. The staff on the floor was great. Way to bring it back guys!! :) I would definitley feel confident recommending Joe's Farm Grill again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite family place in Gilbert!! It's not just about the awesome food! The history, the groves, the co op garden out back and the local fresh feeling! We absolutely love the ahi sandwich and the burgers are amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I especially enjoyed the salad with chicken I had there. The drink machine outside isn't always up to speed though. Other than that this is a place to go that has atmosphere and lots of outdoor seating and BIg trees. I really love all the fruit trees and grape vines all around the property."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM! Its a grill, every bit what I remember as a child, but ridiculously awesome food. The pizza was amazing, probably the best burgers I have had in my life, fresh squeezed lemonade was to die for. I cannot believe I have driven right past this place for so many years!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place after hearing so much about it online and TV. I got the ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings and my fiancé got a burger with fries. The food overall was very good. You could tell that the veggies were fresh and the portions were decent. However the place was a little pricey for what it was. $2.50 upcharge to get onion rings instead of fries with my meal? Not worth it. Especially since you get about 5 rings..  And yes, they're good. But like the rest of the food, It didn't blow me away. It was well made American food. That's it. I wouldn't go in expecting the best food you've ever eaten.   I do want to say, the place itself is really cool. Its clean, has great service, and a cute retro look. Plus the restaurant is right on the farm which is a nice walk after a big meal. They also have a coffee shop next door and a farmers market every Wednesday. We'd definitely go back, but id probably try something different, Like one of their fresh salads."}
{"text":"Great food fresh from their farm! Strawberry lemonade is a must! Outside picnic tables- a great place for the kids to run around. Don't fear the line it usually goes fast."}
{"text":"Even though they were closing in 20 minutes, the food was fresh, service was great, and we didn't feel rushed at all once they were actually closed. I always leave this place feeling well fed with great food and service!"}
{"text":"I actually live in the community and have seen Ebbs and flows in the quality of the food, right now is not the best that I've had at this restaurant super super disappointed but still giving 3 stars for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here from out of town and loved it. We'll definitely be back next time we're in the area. Food portions were big, prices were fair, and everything was delicious. I enjoyed the pulled pork, but the zucchini fries stole the show. It's also just a fun place - picnic tables under trees with lights strung up around, and a big open area where kids can run around."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight. The BF and I shared a burger and a chicken sandwich. The Bacon Blue burger was tasty. It comes with bacon, blue cheese dressing, onion rings and the bbq sauce they use for all their BBQ items. The pesto chicken sandwich was like a good chicken version of their fontina burger. Same condiments. Onion Rings were hot & crispy and the garlic fries were garlicky and flavorful. Yup, definitely get some hot breath after that. I also sampled some meat from the BBQ sampler plate the BF's sister ordered. I thought it tasted better than what you get at Joe's Real BBQ. Choosing between Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill, I'd drive the extra miles for Farm Grill."}
{"text":"A great family (and puppy) friendly environment. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner have always been top notch. There is ample shade from mature trees to sit outside at the picnic benches. Now that I live closer it will be on the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"It was my turn to choose the restaurant yesterday and I held my breath; hoping it would be ok as everybody's taste is so different. We each chose different ;  I had the Fontina burger with onion rings; which was outstanding, our friend had the Farm burger with grilled onions and salad and my husband had the BBQ bacon blue with onion rings.   Amazing food!  I now wish that I would've ordered the salad instead of the rings as I ate all of my onion rings and several of my husband's.   They are so good!     My only criticism is that the pictures do not do the food justice !"}
{"text":"Gave them another try and whatever had gone wrong in the recent past has certainly been addressed. I tried the lamb burger which was absolutely delicious.  It NEEDS to be on the menu permanently!  My wife's farm burger was perfect.  The line was long, but you can't fault them for being popular.  Once we placed our order the food was ready promptly and was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I love Joe! He is a sweet little man with a great vision. All of his restaurants are terrific and this one is no exception. Granted, I have only been here once (Its kinda far out there and I live in the Copa) but the one time I went was a great experience. I had some kind of chicken pesto sammich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was very tasty I think mainly because of the flavorful pesto that was on it. The sweet potato fries were good, however, since I am a sweet potato fries connoisseur, they were not the best I have had. However, they give you a mango salsa that does with them and that was pretty legit. Also got to try their BBQ chicken pizza. It was good but I think I am starting to lean toward not being a fan of BBQ pizza, the sauce it just too much for me on a pizza. Anyways. service was good and I loved the atmosphere outside. The inside could use a little sprucing up and I can see why people dont usually eat in there. But I love the outside and feeling like I am having a picnic in the woods with gourmet food. Way to go Joe on another successful venture, YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Take the whole family and get a nice table outside. The burgers are good, the fried zucchini is better and the the barbecue chicken is amazing..."}
{"text":"Farm fresh from Agritopia Farm..draws large crowds specially during lunch time on weekends... Expect 30 min wait in line to order and another 15-20 to get the food ready...try their daily specials like lamb burger...family friendly and see lots of dog lovers...excellent place to checkout if you are in town"}
{"text":"Great everything. Except the way you pick up your food and fill your coffee at the same place. Who's idea was it to put the coffee pot in front of the window where you pick up your tray of food? There has to be a better way.  That is my only complaint. Otherwise, fritters are the bomb and anything you pick is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this place! There is plenty of seating inside and a lovely outdoor seating area.  Everything we had tasted amazing, was so fresh and was presented beautifully.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, most recently with my family to celebrate a birthday.  I so want to fall in love with this place - partly for the agrarian atmosphere (it's conjoined with Agritopia), and partly because everything on the menu sounds so appetizing!  But with a few exceptions (garlic fries, strawberry lemonade), the food has been a let-down.  My last time here, I had a sonoran dog and a side of fried green beans.  The hot dog was just ok; flavor wasn't outstanding, and there was so much sour cream on it that it cooled off the hot dog and other toppings pretty quickly.  I couldn't taste much bacon at all.  The green beans had a wonderful garlicky aroma, but were very greasy and too heavily breaded.  They quickly turned limp from their own steam as they cooled.  I also tried some regular (not garlic or sweet potato) fries and onion rings.  The onion rings looked beautiful, but the onion was undercooked, and the flavor was bland.  Similarly, the french fries were bland, not particularly crispy, and needed salt.   I love the outdoor seating under the beautiful old trees, but I feel the prices here are a little steep for the quality of food and the fact that you're eating off of disposable everything (it generates a huge amount of trash; I saw an employee emptying an overflowing trash can when I arrived, and emptying the same trash can -- now overflowing again -- when I left)."}
{"text":"Now that it's getting cooler...well, sort of, we love eating outdoors whether a restaurant has a patio or picnic benches!  This is a grreat place to meet with friends who have kids.  They have a pretty good KIDS MEAL selection.  But, my son's favorite is the Sweet Potato Fries with pineapple relish and baby back ribs.   I was on a curry kick so I went with the Chicken Salad with curried coconut raisin dressing  the last time.  That was surprisingly good.  The bread could have been a little bit more whole grain to go with the curry instead of the hot dog bun-like bread it came with.  One of my fave is their Farm Salad with Grilled Chicken.  Most of the salad is grown in the farm behind the restaurant.  It's not just lettuce and a few shredded carrots.  It is chock full of substance like green beans, corn, carrots, beets, radish and spring salad.   My hubby prefers the BBQ ribs and chicken with garlic fries.  I forgot how great their burgers are....hmmmn."}
{"text":"We were at the great joes farm grill and the flies were so bad we threw our food away. The manager saw me swatting and told me she wipes tables down with lavender oil in the am but I saw them wipe tables down with sanitizer after each table. Great food but  my husband went up to get a soft drink and I could keep them away. I was so sick to my stomach. $40 down the drain. She said sorry it's an organic farm. I literally almost puked."}
{"text":"Great food all around they have great salads burgers and hotdogs also they have seasonal dishes and healthy and organic options.   Has an open area seating for the kids to run around"}
{"text":"Neat concept, I imagine they own Joe's Real BBQ too. Atmosphere during the day was nice, although we couldn't find a clean table and had to ask if one to be cleaned off for us.  I had the grilled cheese and sweet potato fries...not bad.  I wouldn't miss this place if I could never go there again, although I probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't 115 degrees outside, so maybe I'll give it another shot once the weather cools."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D. Did not disappoint!!  BBQ Chicken Pizza, Farm Veggie, Farm and Fontina Burgers. Soooo good. The lemonade was awesome as well. This is a must when in the area!!  The line moves fast so don't let make you drive on!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice grounds/location; however, very pricey for what you get.  First the food is excellent.  We have been there twice.  I've had the burger, and signature item BBQ pizza.  We also had the onion rings as a side item.  The burger and rings are great.  My kid had the veggie burger and raved about it.  The pizza was burned, especially around the edges.  I should have returned it, but I ate around the crust.  The grounds are beautiful.  Nice green grass, big trees, and a working farm in the background.  It is cool that this is the farm that Joe grew up.  No wonder photographers use it for a location for their shoots.  The only thing that gets me is that it is very pricey for a walk up to window to order- get a number-get your own drinks, condiments, and plastic silverware- cleanup up after yourself place.  We paid $10 -$15 per person.  The $5 dollar milkshake, okay $4.49, reminded me of \"Pulp Fiction.\"  I'm sure its a \"damn good milkshake\" but....  We recently had guests and my son wanted to take them to there.  I said it was a good idea, but I did not want to spend near or over $100 to take the eight of us for a really nice, high quality, fast food meal."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I'm here more for the ambiance and location than for the food. The food is above average, but nothing spectacular. Great location for outdoor dates or to spend time with family or friends."}
{"text":"Pork tenderloin was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Perfectly crisp pork with no \"weird tendony or fatty bites\" homemade pickles, and a light sauce. Try it with yellow mustard! Garlic fries were also superb."}
{"text":"This place was really cute and they had a great breakfast. Only problem was the wait was a little long on the weekend, but that's probably to be expected."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of our absolute favorites for breakfast or lunch! Fresh ingredients and great outdoor dining. We like taking our out of town visitors :)"}
{"text":"I got their shrimps and they were huge. Each shrimps were honestly the sizes of two adult male index and middle fingers together. The food were great, good fresh squeeze lemonade, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to the dog park up the road and grabbed some takeout from Joe's on the way home.  The portabello mushroom burger was so moist, flavorful and grilled to perfection!! Garlic fries were good.  Very friendly, productive, efficient staff who all seemed very happy to be at work!!  I don't usually comment on the bathroom but theirs are the coolest i have ever done my business in!! Place is clean, comfortable and has great outdoor seats"}
{"text":"Food was soo good.  The hot dog \"snapped\" when bitten into.  Te burger was juicy and the onion rings were crispy."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overrated. I guess someone with a TV show went here, but that doesn't mean much. I have been here several times, and much of what I have had has been over-salted. They even put salt on the dessert, which again was too much. I am familiar with the practice of salting sweet food to add depth of flavor. This wasn't that. I am pretty sure they have some sort of deal with Morton's.   Some of the food I have had here was decent or even good. Breakfast has been the better meals, and their BBQ was decent. I would stay away from the fried stuff. That has been pretty awful in my experience. I kept trying this place hoping I'd like it, but I think I am done."}
{"text":"Already an incredible restaurant, and then we discovered they serve breakfast too.  Best breakfast I have ever tasted, and their food for lunch/dinner/etc is incredible too!! Great place for families, tons of room for kids to run around and play. Go on your bday and get $10 worth of food, and check out their annual free meal day as well!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!  Haven't been disappointed once. Usually go for linner (lunch/dinner) and always leave rubbing my belly in fullness and cursing my overeating - but I can't help it- wow its jammin'  Came here for breakfast on a recent visit and was impressed as well. Fresh and yummy and great ambiance. I love the farm feel and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I go check out anywhere Triple D has been especially since this place is just right down the street. Over the last couple years I've eaten here I've never found that 1 thing that pushes them over the top. Foods good and fresh but I can't find that wow factor. Great place to sit outside and enjoy some food w the friends and fam. If your thinking about checking this place out, go on off peak hours because the line will be all the way out the front door and almost to the parking lot."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific.  Delicious, relaxing, and euphoric.  With the popularity of Joe's Real BBQ, this restaurant has sky-rocketed to the top of the list of recommended eateries in Gilbert.  Everything on the menu is DELICIOUS.  I typically tend to order the Pulled Pork sandwich, which is what they are known for in my opinion.  Tonight, I ordered the Pesto Chicken Sandwich per the suggestion of the cashier.  I also got an order of the chili cheese fries.  Both were great.  I'd consider myself a chili afficionado, and this chili was awesome. Perfect blend of meat and sauce.  The atmosphere is very euphoric to me.  There is indoor seating with lots of stuff to look at while you stuff your face with scrumptious food.  There is also seating outside, which is what I'm specifically referring to.  I always eat outside here.  There are wooden picnic benches, amongst beautiful old trees, which takes me back to when I was a young child and my family and I would eat at the park together.  It relaxes me very much, actually.  Also, the breakfast menu they have in the morning is very good. I have only had it once, the breakfast tacos, and it was just spectacular.  5 stars. A must eat. Go here. Now."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill  of my favorite places, ever. This and Joe's BBQ. I can't put my finger on what it is that makes my mouth water at the thought of either restaurant.  At Joe's Farm Grill, it could easily be the amazing ingredients. So fresh and flavorful, and you know you aren't eating some strange lab grown tomatoes. I love sitting outside under a GIANT tree, looking over at the Agritopia garden... Joe's definitely has something you don't find very often here in the commercial, cookie cutter East Valley.  Like Joe's BBQ, everything here is perfect it its own way. My favorite is the burger. Yup, I said it. Veganish me loves cheeseburgers here. I don't eat burgers often, but when I do I crave Joe's. The bun is amazingly fresh and soft, the veggies are top notch and the meat... The meat is melt in your mouth delicious.  Other notable dishes: pizza, ahi salad, bbq sandwich (uses Joe's Real BBQ sauce, of course!) and the awesome fresh made milkshakes.  I know Gilbert is a trek for a lot of people in the Valley, but it is absolutely one worth making."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill was a 40 minute round trip from my home in Phoenix but I still found myself there quite regularly. Now I live 6 hours away and I still find myself there regularly! Everything about Joe's Farm Grill is amazing. I am having a hard time working my way through the menu because every time I go there I want what I had last time again! My favorite meals have to be the pulled pork sandwich or the Carolina dog with a strawberry lemonade and onion rings. My favorite attribute about Joe's Farm Grill would be the atmosphere. A once old farm house renovated nearly beyond recognition surrounded by citrus trees, wooden picnic tables, and large trees that obviously prefer to not grow in straight lines.  Negatives/Technicalities -On a beautiful day they will be busy, expect lines! -Far from the Phoenix Metro  The few negative reviews all complain of waiting too long and high prices. The wait, in my opinion, is entirely worth it; and you get what you pay for. If you want cheap/quick food go eat at McDonalds....  Overall Joe's Farm Grill is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for family  to hang out, big place with trees and farm field,which not easy find in AZ, good American food and affordable price,,"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Amazing food and great place to eat with friends and family!  This place has grown over the years and has more places to eat on the property.  The food has always been great and my kids love it!  The shakes here are delicious especially their Date Shakes.  My kids love their Thai Salad and the dressing is the best!  The pineapple salsa is perfect with their sweet potato fries.  They BBQ and burgers are the best!"}
{"text":"Always love going to Joe's Farm grill.  The atmosphere is always great and their food is even better. If you're in Gilbert, do yourself a favor and swing by. The burgers are to die for and their ice cream is the bomb! Also, make sure to take advantage of their outdoor picnic tables and relax under the mature trees!"}
{"text":"I was so excited. Anticipating a cute restaurant on a farm. Organic veggies.  I got exactly what I was looking for- and absolutely nothing else. It is a cute restaurant on a farm. It does have an interesting menu. It does have prices that would attract a former NoSco resident... but the social atmosphere? I might as well have been at McDonald's. Usually I would not blame the other patrons on a restaurant. This time, the crowd was so overwhelmingly obnoxious, that I had to mention it. It seemed like it was coming from everywhere- noise pollution from every angle. There were children running around with no shoes on and one mother was actually throwing fries at her child because he was misbehaving. Right- that will teach him.  I had the veggie patch pizza and hubski had the grilled tuna sandwich featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. The food was mediocre, although the sweet potato fries were tasty. Hubski liked the cole slaw. We walked around the farm afterwards, which was nice.   If I went back, it would be to get a shake to go and walk around the farm. Otherwise, you won't catch me at Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"Best vegan burger in all of Gilbert! Hands down. Now they just need to serve wine and get rid of the flies."}
{"text":"Love the ahi tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Don't go if you're in a rush! Great food but horribly long wait every time. I enjoy the outside seating and love that dogs are welcome at the picnic tables. They only make enough pizza dough for the day so get there early if you want to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I need to go back! Nice wholesome food and veggie options. Huge portions. You order at a window and can site outside or inside tables. They also have a farm adjacent to the building, a WORKING FARM.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food?  My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. It's heaven in a bite.  Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)"}
{"text":"I have never been so in love with a hot dog.  I got the mix-and-match and it was perfect! Strong recommend upgrading to the sweet potato fries despite the somewhat steep up-charge. It's worth it! Seriously the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. And that sauce is   The only thing that was kinda eh was the pulled pork was pretty dry. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be but I prefer mine pretty moist. Also, the sodas were really creative but still to sweet for me. I stuck to unsweetened tea and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Out in the middle of Gilbert, who knew!?   Decor is mid century modern in a rural setting.   A great place to eat outside with lots of room for kids to play.     Food is great.   Ordered a BBQ chicken salad which was adequately portioned and tasty.  Wifey ate the entire cheeseburger/ sweet potato fries.  Highly unusual behavior.    Son had a corn dog kids meal - good enough size that everyone could cop off on his fries.    Unlimited fountain drinks.   Condiments ie ketchup, mustard and mayo are pumped thru a CO2 compressor.  Bathroom is cool.  Kind of hard to describe.    In laws were a little skeptical at first.   They prefer first rate establishments ie Mastros, etc.  In the end, they gave me a thumbs up and I was not booed."}
{"text":"I like to come here with my husband from time to time. I'm a vegan, and they have a few options! Their veggie burger is pretty tasty. I always order it with some extra vegan 1000 island dressing. Its actually pretty big too! I switch up the sides between getting sweet potatoe fries and the beet salad (86 the cheese). Its very good and filling!  We stop over next door at the coffee shop that has some great vegan options as well.  They get vegan baked good from time to time. They also have a vegan vacation bagel that is SO good, tofu benedict (YUM) and also a wrap that is large and good. I guess I should put that in the coffee shop review, though.   Also try the fresh squeezed lemonade. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Had their Fontina burger with onion rings. The burger was delicious, came with tomatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese, lettuce, and spinach. The onion rings were fried to a perfect crispiness. Also tried a little bit of their ribs, coleslaw, garlic fries, and carnitas, all of which tasted delicious! Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Love the fontina burger and sweet potato fries! Great atmosphere, plenty of seating outside and inside. Recommend ordering by phone and picking up to eat in or take home....lines can get really long. I wasn't really impressed with the kids meals."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. This is a really good place to bring out of towners because the vibe is cool and the food is good. It was a little cold because the doors don't really close (skip this place in the dead of winter). The fried zuchinni is excellent and the fontina burger is highlighted on the menu for good reason, but honorable mention goes to the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ joint in AZ!  Love the over sized baked potato topped with pulled pork!  Homemade root beer is delicious.   Line out the door after 4 on the weekends so get there early."}
{"text":"Well , I have only lived in the valley for approx 8 months . I constantly heard great thing a about Joes Farm Grill , and today 3/26/2017 I decided to bring my wife and two teenagers to eat here .  The ordering process was somewhat quick and painless . Then when out pager went off we headed to pick up our food . They gave us home fries instead of French fries , forgot the bacon on my sons burger . When they switched out the fries they just grabbed some that wheee sitting around and where not even hot . Then we sat down to eat out food . My burger was bland , the egg on my burger was over cooked , like I said before they forgot the bacon on my sons burger , so his was really bland as well . We didn't finish the fries or the burgers , that where still pink on the inside . My daughter had the waffle and ribs , the ribs tasted like they had been siting for a long time , definitely not fresh . My daughter did enjoy the waffle and my wife enjoyed the pancake . In conclusion , if you want a great experience, with mediocre food , then this is the place for you . I will not be returning to Joes Farm Grill . There is a Farm all around this restaurant , but I never tasted fresh Farm taste in anything my family or myself ate for breakfast  ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere alone is worth the visit.  It's a picnic hotspot, only they take care of all the food!  Oh and the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Sit outside on a gorgeous day, picnic style with your friends. Great for families, kids, big Parties, or even a lunch date. My friends devoured their burgers, the salads were really fresh and delicious, and the chicken salad sandwich was super yummy.  Also head to the coffee shop part where you can get the yummiest baked goods and coffee. (the cupcakes are soo good)"}
{"text":"Just didn't have flavor for me. I know it's really popular. I just don't think it was high quality food for the price."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Joe's Farm Grill with my family for years. We love the atmosphere especially now with the recent renovations. There's always a line to order as it is super popular, but I've always found the line to move quickly and the food to come out quickly as well. The food is delicious and so hearty. I always get either the veggie burger, sweet potato fries and/or farm salad. The veggie burger is all vegan. I have had countless veggie burgers and Joe's version is my favorite! Even the bun it comes on is amazing."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a Friday and the service was fantastic and the wrap was delicious!! I was at the Cafe side and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"A consistently good very family-friendly casual dining place. We have rarely come and been disappointed. The staff are friendly and amazingly quick. A long line seems to be the norm given its popularity. Even if you get stuck behind a long line at does move quickly. The portions are generous and only once can I remember the chicken being a bit overdone. I've been there about 10 times so far and have no qualms about going back. In the fall and spring outdoor seating is the best place to be."}
{"text":"Excellent choices of salads and burgers with a twist. Also tender ribs and dogs and also pizza. Excellent sauces on everything and big portions. Casual indoor or outside garden/ lawn seating."}
{"text":"AWESOME Stop! Loved the Chicken BBQ Pizza, Fresh salad, Onion Rings.. its making my mouth water just typing this. They have a great atmosphere, and really interesting bathrooms. :) A MUST STOP if you're in there area!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Joe's Farm Grill. I had the Fried Shrimp plate, and let me tell you that the shrimp alone gets 5 stars out of me! So, the meal came with fries and cold slaw, but I substituted fried green beans and onion rings. The beading on the two sides was too hard fried for me, so I ended up peeling it off. Also, be aware that these two substitutions were $3 each.  But, let's talk about the shrimp! They were jumbo shrimp with a perfectly seasoned lift batter. As a Floridian, this is what I know Shrimp are supposed to be, NOT like that wannabe butterflied mess that Phoenix area seafood restaurants try to pass off.  The atmosphere here is one of casual elegance, and as usual, I was warmly greeted by the blonde beauty in charge of the place. Come eat at Joe's Farm Grill, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"For all the hype this place gets I was really disappointed. The ambiance and atmosphere is definitely cute. There are a bunch of trees and picnic tables to eat at outside. The inside is cute as well. However we came in on Sunday a little after 11  And the inside was filthy. They weren't crowded as there was plenty of seating. We found ONE table that looked clean. There was food all over the carpet and all of the tables were just nasty. This is definitely a hotspot usually drawing big crowds so you would think that management would staff adequately. It was just gross. The food was good nothing spectacular I ordered the pesto pecan chicken burger. It wasn't pesto....it was mayonnaise based. The chicken was mediocre at best. My boyfriend  got the farm chicken sandwich and he said it was good but nothing memorable. I got the garlic fries for my side and those were absolutely amazing with tons of garlic and he ordered fried zucchini which was soggy and nasty.   Needless to say this place failed to live up to all the hype I've heard about it. We definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"You can not find a better burger & sweet potato fries! Wonderful vibe and the employees are top notch!"}
{"text":"It's popular. The line can get long.  But it's good food and big portions. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"I've had the mahi-mahi burger but we always go back for the Carolina dog. The hotdog with pulled pork and coleslaw is such a great mix of flavors that I can't get anything else! And their garlic fries are the best I've had outside of Gilroy, CA."}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this place for the longest time.  It was everything I had hoped for and more.  Three words: Pneumatic. Condiment. Dispensers. Okay, folks, I'm a condiment lover.  I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere.  Put out Ranch Dressing or BBQ Sauce in your condiment line-up and I'm even happier.  But put all the ketchup, mustard, mayo, ranch, AND bbq sauce in a shiny metal display and dispense it to me PNEUMATICALLY????? Freaking hell ...I'm distracted all the time now because I want to go back and order five different things that I can put condiments on just so I can use the pneumatic dispensers.   SO FUN!!!!! Oh, and the food.  Okay, I'll be honest, I expected good food.  I expected REALLY good food.  And I was overwhelmed at the sheer selection of food on the menu, and the flat-panel displays flashing clips of video, pictures of food, and offering me fresh ice cream shakes or fried green beans (which I didnt get but will next time).  Ordering (meaning I had to actually CHOOSE) was an exquisite agony.  I dithered for no less than 17 minutes, circling the dining room with my iPhone (to read what other Yelpers ate) and clutching the laminated menu to my chest like a crucifix.  Once my lunch partners had all arrived, my time was up and I had to enter the line.  I couldn't concentrate on the conversation because as we wound back and forth in the line, I was able to see what other people were eating, and what was being served up in the window (yes! you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) which caused me to change my mind several times. I'm the kind of person who HAS to order last, simply because I MUST KNOW what everyone else is having. It serves to lessen my post-food-arrival regret and that painful longing of \"I should have ordered that....\" The moment of truth came and I decided upon a wood-fired BBQ chicken pizza.  And in a gluttonous moment of ridonkulous insanity, blurted out 'FRENCH FRIES' fully knowing that no amount of hours on the treadmill watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes on DVD could ever redeem my choice of lunch.  But... DO NOT JUDGE ME!  You weren't there watching the orders of fries being shunted out to happy diners... it wasn't completely in my control. Food arrived.  I did admire my fellow luncher's selections, but did not suffer overmuch from longing or regret.  I had a giant wood-fired bbq chicken pizza with globs of melted fresh mozzarella on it... a paper basket of the most delicious french fries of my life... and (drumroll).... PNEUMATIC CONDIMENT DISPENSERS! It's no business of yours, to be sure, why I might have needed ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch AND bbq sauce for my pizza and french fries.  But I just did.   To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."}
{"text":"Joe's is a great place! The menu has healthy options, local ingredients, and is very tasty! The history of the building (at one time a house/residence) is cool too. There is indoor and outdoor seating, which is really nice during the cooler months in AZ. The set up is different than many restaurants. It seems to me to be a hybrid of a cafeteria and a restaurant - definitely casual.  Patrons wait in line (snakes around and out the door like an amusement park) to place their order at the window. Laminated menus are provided for perusal while in line. Once the order at the window is placed & paid for, then seats and drinks are next. Seating inside is limited to a side room that seats approx 40-50 and a long pub height table near the line to order. Additional seating is located outside in a \"back yard\" with shade trees, picnic tables and some tables with chairs. Soda fountains are also located outside.  The ordering and pick up area for the food tends to get congested. There seems to always be a line...which is a testament to the food! It's a local favorite. Family friendly. Healthy and flavorful options. Price range is $10-$15 per person (including beverage). On your birthday bring your ID and they'll give $10 toward your meal for your birthday!! That's always nice, right?  I've enjoyed everything I've ordered here - ever. So despite the congestion I will come back. The quality & consistency make it worth it."}
{"text":"Joe's delivers on both food and atmosphere. Sitting outside at a picnic table eating their sweet potato fries is the perfect way to spend an afternoon. I highly recommend this place for groups, couples and families."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! Cute place, kid friendly, perfect for a family outing and the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Charm, character, and delicious food, what more could you ask for?  I really love this place - it's so different than any other restaurant around.  Love that they use fresh, local ingredients and I really do love the charm of the place.  Had the ahi sandwhich, YUM, and the hubby had the BBQ sampler plate and a shake and loved everything he had.  Will be bringing out of town visitors here for sure."}
{"text":"We took a trip of the Southwest and wanted to catch a couple places that were featured on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives. Since it was New Year's Eve alot of the places we tried to hit right in Phoenix were closed. We decided to call Joe's and they keep the same hours rain or shine. It was a drive outside of Phoenix but we don't mind the drive. Obviously.  Any who, we arrived here finally cause the Tom-Tom was giving us the totally wrong directions.  We arrived at this place and not so many people inside, which is nice. We forgot what the episode featured so we went with our gut. I got the ribs and hubby got the hamburger with garlic fries.  OMG!!!! Everything was freakin fantastic. The Garlic Fries were outstanding. The sauce they used for the ribs was great. Hubby LOVED the burger. Everything was fresh and was just a step above the rest.  Especially since this is considered fast food.  Who would of thunk?"}
{"text":"We had the BBQ pizza and the Fontina Pesto burger and they were both delicious! :) The bun on the burger was soft and the meat was moist!  The scenery around the restaurant is beautiful! Misters are installed so it's nice to sit outside even on a hot day. My husband and I enjoyed a nice lunch date. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"On a beautiful winter day you might not mind the 45 minutes standing in line and the additional 15 minute wait for your food.....you just have to know what to expect!  My friend and I shared the infamous BBQ Chicken pizza and a Ceasar Salad w/ chicken. We thoroughly enjoyed both!  The salad was crisp and fresh. The dressing is creamy delicious & the chicken breast is perfectly prepared leaving it moist and finger lickin' good!   I loved the pizza that must be done in a really hot oven leaving the crust browned and crisp, topped with plenty of chicken, bacon and a very tasty sauce.   What would have made it 5 stars??? The table & chairs on the patio were so wobbly I thought I'd knock the table over cutting my food and I don't like the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Love the fontina burger, the history and the cool bathrooms. Seriously, it's good food. Can get crowded at times, but always worth the wait. Kids are addicted to the melted peanut butter sandwich"}
{"text":"I think Joe's Farm Grill is actually run by the mob!  Why you may ask?  Well, Except for one 2 star review, I dont seem to see any negative reviews.  Its either because \"The Family\" keeps the reviewers in check...or, Joe's is legitimately an amazing place.  I guess it's the latter but I'm going to go on thinking whatever I want!  Joe's was the second food stop on our trip througout the southwest.  Although we had breakfast only a few hours before we got to Joe's we still did our best to push our gastro abilities to the limits.    At first I looked through the huge menu at a ton of options that sounded good.  From the BBQ Pork Plate to the Ahi Tun Sandwich to the BBQ Pizza, there are a ton of great options that you would never expect at a Burger place.  But Joe's is so much more then a burger place.  The ingredients are fresh, not just fresh but actually from the farm next door fresh.    That being said...I got a burger   Well I got a burger, chili fries, a vanilla bean milkshake and a ginger ale to wash it all down.  http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1424.jpg  I dont even like sour cream and I grubbed those chili fries all down.  The burger was exceptional and the milk shake...oh that milkshake.  http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1448.jpg  Nuff Said!  The whole experience was amazing.  Although I was with my girl, I even ran into this cute chick in the bathroom http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1431.jpg"}
{"text":"Great food..Good place for the family..My kids really like it.."}
{"text":"Farm food!  Nice and fresh and yummy.  I like the Grilled Wild Salmon Platter because it's always delicious every time I order it and it comes with asparagus and two other sides of your choice.  I also like the cheese cake with strawberries.  There's a surprise oreo crust at the bottom!  The malts/shakes are also a must.  When the Hawaiian burger is in season, you should try that.  I used to always order the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, but I feel like they changed something with it that makes it not as good anymore.  Maybe the dressing?  Sitting outside is fun especially at night because lights are hung around the trees."}
{"text":"OMG!!! that's what comes to mind when you taste the food here! Fresh, fast service, atmosphere is great, even the bathroom are cool!  I had the B-B-Q chicken pizza, which was to die for! Nice crispy crust, lots of chicken, w/green onions and of course B-B-Q sauce. The hubby had their bacon w/ blue cheese burger, which was equally as good. After walking the grounds for 1/2 hr to get our meal down, we ordered a chocolate shake.. yummy!!! This place is a real treat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. I was excited to try Joe's Farm Grill. I've heard about the wonderful quality of their food for a long time and it didn't disappoint. I will be back to try breakfast items specifically but really I want to try everything on the menu. The garlic fries were marvelous."}
{"text":"Great burger, consistent every time!  Super impressed with the employees, attentive, kind and quick.  Line may appear long, but it amounts to what you'd wait at a sit down place for the food to arrive.  Once you place your order, food is out quick!    This is my GO-TO burger in AZ!  Try the \"special burgers\" they offer, which are listed at the register.  Shakes are thick and amazing and the onion rings are over the top amazing!    Great place to take the family and out of town guests for a relaxing and casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I love this place . The Ahi Tuna Sandwich is the best and the fried green beans . Also love the homemade shakes. Great place for kids as they have seating outside . I will come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious,the fact that they have their own farm right there makes it so special and tasty!The coffee shop is their neighbor, what makes your experience even better!i love these. 2 huge trees outside,so unique! If you love burgers-that's the place to check out for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Since the remodel the food, service and decor have been taken to a whole new level. Totally worth giving this place a try. I don't give 5 stars very often and I'm quite critical when it comes to food."}
{"text":"Best place ever , food , helpful staff , .sit in side or out. . Outside sitting you have the trees over flowing, so shade areas all around.walking distance to the Farm Stand and Agritopia..plenty of parking walk all around take in the sites.We have veggie burger with sweet potato fries, /ahi tuna salad with cole slaw. Both amazing  veggie burger is so big , never can finish it , and the tuna is cooked to prefection with just the right amount of pink showing,with wasbi dressing just a hint of hotnees , season to let you know its there but not over powering"}
{"text":"I love Joe's Farmgrill.  I go there quite often and always on my birthday since they give you a credit towards your bill on your actual birthday.  I think it's so wonderful of them to do that and it gives me an excuse to gather the family to Joe's.   I decided to have the grilled chicken caesar salad. Mmm everything tastes fo fresh at Joe's.  My husband ordered the Farm Burger (our family fave) and my mouth is watering just thinking about it, luckily I live down the road and can grab one for dinner tonight.  I don't know where they get their beef but it's amazing and always juice.  Some places when I ask for well done I get a \"hockey puck\" but NOT at Joe's.  We decided to have the best of both worlds and split the burger/salad between us.  A great choice.  I always order the fresh cole slaw.  It tastes like something my grandma might have  just made it fresh for me back when I was a kid growing up. I think that is part of the appeal of JOe's Farmgrill.  When I go there I feel so comfortable and relaxed.  It's a great place to meet up and I always say I'm going to have room for dessert but never get to it.  I suppose I need to plan to go there just for ice cream sometime but I cannot bring myself to go there without getting a Farm Burger.  Kudos to Joe's Farmgrill for making yet another birthday great for me."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in Gilbert.  It is a style where you order at the counter, and then the food is delivered to your table.  The food was hot, fresh, and tasty.  The owner stopped by the table, and was happy to chat.  There is an outdoor dining area, which is especially pretty at night, complete with a friendly cat who likes to roam around.  It is located in the Agritopia complex, which is a great little community of businesses.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere!  We always have a wonderful time here.  So many choices and milk shakes are the best"}
{"text":"Pretty neat place in Gilbert. I got the pulled pork and half rack of ribs as my meal and some sweet tea. I'm from the south, so I had high hopes for the BBQ. The BBQ was a little on the bland side but still has flavor. I think it's more on the sweet side. The fries and Asian coleslaw that came with it was pretty good. The drink part is a little confusing. I'm pretty sure it's just my own personal experience, but I didn't get a cup with my drink, and I was confused on where to go to get it and where to get the drinks. I'm sure that for most people who go for the first time are pretty confused too, but after the second time, it should be alrighty.   Also, it was my friend's birthday, but he didn't know he could get 10% off until he got his receipt and read at the bottom that you get 10% off on your birthday. I think if they put a sign somewhere noticeable, a few more people could save on some money.   And finally, it was a little rainy and chilly out, but there was no space inside, so we sat outside, but the heater above us was broken. : ("}
{"text":"Have to keep it real here...  there food is good but not all that I have tried there breakfast and lunch.  It's a very cool place to visit , they grow there own vegetables and you can walk there huge garden behind the building."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times it was excellent. The first time i had the bbq pork sandwich with onion rings. I loved the sandwich as the pork was perfectly cooked and the sauce was wonderful. I love pulled pork sandwiches and this is winner for sure. The onion rings were ok and well flavored but a bit soggy and not as good as i was expecting after seeing them on TV. The garlic fires were another story though as they are excellent and leave you wanting more, the only abd thing is the last few in the bucket get so soaked in grease and oil that they are pretty much un-edible. Also had a milkshake that was ok but nothing to write home about nothing i need here again but if you have a major craving with your lunch it will hit the spot.  The next time i went i got the seared ahi sandwich and it was wonderful. This was worth the trip itself as it has so much flavor and is  just melt in your mouth good. The wasabi sauce is great, not to strong to burn but enough to get a good wasabi flavor. This is something that will keep me coming back for more and more. I loved it. also got the chili cheese fries and they were good but lacking in the cheese department but the chili was very good and the fires are good too. They aren't as good as the garlic fires but very good for chili fries."}
{"text":"Waiting in line for 1/2 an hr for cafeteria food is ridiculous  I have tried to like this place but honestly very over rated  They could really decrease the wait time by opening another window and getting customers seated would be a huge plus!! Yes it's a different experience but not a good one! I'm changing the 1 star rating to a 3 star only because we have been back here several times with people who insist and luckily we came on a tues at 8am so there are no lines!  Food still okay at best but a 1 star may be unfair and I think 2 may be reserved for worse places also. I still will not be back at peak times to sit in long long lines"}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants to go eat.  I love the atmosphere and food. The prices are a little steep for frequent visits, but for a treat, the prices are worth the quality!  The Fontina Burger is the best burger I have had yet.  Edit:  This place has terrible fountain drinks since their renovation."}
{"text":"Don't know why it took me this long to check out Joe's Farm Grill but my out-of-towners got a kick of this place.  We ordered : Fontina Burger - 4* BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4* Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3* Sweet Potato Fries - 2* Garlic Fries - 4* Onion Rings - 5* Chocolate Milk Shake - 2*  The good: - great selection of American food / good portion sizes - allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal - the decor & cute history behind the farm - open kitchen / sauce bar - friendly staff  - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves - hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain - kiddies love the cool restrooms   The bad:   - lots of flies outside (that's summer in a farm for you) - limited seating inside - real vanilla milkshake tasted weird ( too much lemon juice?)"}
{"text":"Update : on 3/31/16 ordered food over an hour ago to go and still Waiting .. The girl expoing was not very nice and looked like she didn't want to be there and how dare I ask where my food was after an hour.... If it's a busy night here , save your money and head to drive through or San Tan Mall    Over all cool place with good food .  It is what I would consider to be a bit hyped and way to busy to be enjoyable on a consistent basis .   The food usually has a good quality and is not greasy and well cooked and they will always take care of any issues but it's over priced for what you get .  I recently went for breakfast and got the \"big breakfast \" which has 2 sausage 2 bacon some pancakes and eggs and potatoes which is a lot of food but it's still $10 and then $2 for a coffee ( which the coffee was definitely Burnt ).  The manager is always kind to us and we generally like the place when we have more time than normal to wait in line and a bit extra to pay since $30 for breakfast for 2 is costly ( in my opinion ) .  That said its worth checking out if your in the area and want that home cooked but not overtly grimy food ."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place ever since we saw the episode on \"Diners, Drive-in's & Dives\" We were not disappointed! I had the veggie burger with a side of onion rings. The veggie burger was awesome! The texture in this thing was really good! With 10 different kinds of veggies, rice & oats all put together it was a delight! Topped with their homemade vegan thousand island dressing on a multi-grain bun it was very tasty! The onion rings were so nice and crispy with a good onion in it not one of those whispy things that gets lost in the batter lol    My son had the Jumbo fried shrimp and they were huge! lol There was a really nice seasoning on them with just a hint of spice. It also came with a piece of garlic flat bread, a really good coleslaw and fries. He loved it and almost demolished the whole thing lol    My nephew had the BBQ blue cheese burger. Wow the patties are so big it's insane! Very delicious between the burger itself, the onion ring, BBQ sauce and blue cheese you can't go wrong! Such a great combination on top of a wonderful bun.   Kevin did a mix of the Carolina dog & the Sonoran dog with a side of baked potato fries. They were massive and he couldn't finish them lol So incredibly delicious the Sonoran was my favorite! The Carolina was very good too with the pulled pork on it! We can't wait to come back and try all the other items on their menu! :D     Also once you're done take a walk around the back to the garden it's a nice little stroll."}
{"text":"Expected a little bit more from here. Long wait (totally fine), nice staff, clean, interesting vibe. We were mainly disappointed in our food. Overdone burger (supposedly cooked pink),  super charred chicken. Good fries though..."}
{"text":"A great local place. Good food. Good atmosphere. Healthy. Only draw back is they are busy all the time. Good things are worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and prices for the freshest organic ingredients. MUCH better AND healthier than eating at chains! Give your body a break from all that processed food and try Joe's Farm Grill! Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"From where I live in North Scottsdale , it's forty seven miles to this place, taking over an hour to get there. The line, like Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean. And by the time I got lunch, it was two o'clock. One star for my crew for talking me into this.  I find a large table, underneath some very old and very beautiful tamarack trees.  I don't like that I'm sharing a table, seated next to some fat kid with ice-cream sundae all over his mug who won't shut up.  Then the ominous sign posted on the tamarack tree limb we were seated beneath, which is about five feet off the ground and growing perpendicular to it.      \"WARNING: WATCH FOR FALLING SCORPIONS FROM TREE LIMBS\"  Another star and mega props to Joe's for not only having a farm and a restaurant, but an interactive poisonous insect exhibit as well.  And finally, on the walk back to the car, we (as in my wife) noticed a plot of land across the street where you can rent a thirty by thirty plot for your very own garden. Another star for my wife now wanting me to plant a veggie garden next weekend.  I'm hungover, driving for over an hour listening to Adele on repeat, (because we haven't heard 'Someone like you' one million times yet) standing in line wanting to puke, nervously watching for suicidal scorpions as I eat my burger and fries, listening to some brat I'd like to smack the bejesus out of, and my wife tells me I'm planting a garden next weekend.  Yeah, no....I won't repeat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was great.  Having made a bit of a drive to get there we went all out and ordered a little smorgasbord of items.  A dark chocolate shake, strawberry lemonade, onion rings, a Thai chicken salad, ribs and a fontina burger.  Wow, it was a lot of food.  The salad was really the only thing I found a little lacking and that may have been because everything else was SO good.  The onion rings were hand dipped and fried in panko breadcrumbs, crispy and hot.  The ribs were fall off the bone and so lean!  The burger was melt in your mouth.   The only issue I did  have was that seating was hard to come by for us and the other couple we came with.  Their son needed a highchair, so we ended up outside.  Which seemed to be nice, even cool, (in June)  but as soon as the boys brought the food out there was a swarm of nasty flies!  They were everywhere, I literally couldn't eat without having to move my arms around my plate to keep them at bay.  We had to take the party inside.  It was croweded and difficult to get the highchair to the table.  So maybe not the greatest if you've got kids.  Otherwise, worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. I didn't even put sauce on it because of how good all of it was! Wasn't greasy, fresh produce, and excellent pesto. I think it was called the Fontina Burger. I also love the outdoor eating environment and their hanging lights. Next time we are definitely trying some of their milkshakes."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Based on so many positive reviews here, I was excited to give Joe's a try. I was further encouraged by the line that went well out the front doors when I pulled up on a Thursday evening. I have zero problem with paying a premium price or waiting a long time for unique and delicious food. Unfortunately, that's not what I got. I had the ahi sandwich, which was overcooked and flavorless. As I ate it, I was taunted by the video loop of Triple D's visit to this place, where this sandwich was featured as a must have. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was just a bad night, but either way it is evident that this place either suffers from lack of consistency or have fallen into output being more important than quality. Either way it's a problem. Perhaps the burgers and pizza are better, but unfortunately it would take some convincing to get me to give them another shot in lieu of the wait and price. I did have the fried green beans, which were done well..tasty and crispy. I didn't love the pesto they came plated on, as it made them a little oily. Blackberry lemonade had chunks of real fruit mixed in and was sweet and refreshing."}
{"text":"This place is visually amazing with a lot of rich history. One of the managers came by to each table to see how we were doing. She was a stunning woman with blonde hair. They have the most amazing tree outside that grows funny. It is a fluke of nature. It almost sits on top of the ground and resembles a woman with her legs spread wide open. It encourages a sensuous mood. The outdoor area is really nice. The bathrooms have doll babies on the walls. Very unique indeed. The burgers are expensive and the meat itself is flat. I like my burgers thick. They were juicy however and they surely do give you a lot of lettuce! I'm talking almost an entire head of lettuce! The wait staff is perfect. The fries were soggy but decent. The berry milkshake was fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"My roommate has been telling me about this awesome place and their amazing Ahi Tuna Sandwich. She's been talking non stop about it so last weekend she decided to take me. I immediately liked the place because it was surrounded by so much green grass lol. It just had that different feel to it like your someplace else and not surrounded by the lame desert... So of course I had to try the Ahi Tuna Sandwich and instead of getting fries with it I substituted it with the beets salad and got myself the strawberry lemonade. At first I was a bit skeptical about the sandwich just cuz I don't like the idea of fish in my sandwich but all I gotta say is just WOW! The sandwich literally just melts in your mouth! and the wasabi mayo they used in it gives a little kick to the taste. Their bread is a bit glazed on top and it tasted so fresh like it was right out of the oven. Their beet salad with pecans and blue cheese was good too and their strawberry lemonade was great! I like the fact that there are REAL strawberry chunks in there and no artificial flavors.   I wanna try the fontina burger with sweet potatoes next! with a banana milkshake! MMM!"}
{"text":"This place is great! My family loves to eat here on a Sunday afternoon and let the kids run around under the large shade trees. We always go for burgers and shakes. They are the best."}
{"text":"The Joe's restaurant empire is a perfect counter weight to the urban empire created by the folks in Phoenix at the La Grange Orange. Joe's is great, non pretentious, extremely fresh (it's located in a farm for crying out loud) and it's design is unique and well done.  Well done."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere and perfect for the family! They have a smaller indoor seating area and large outdoor area. I had ribs once and wasn't in love but would give them another shot because the rest of their food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place 4 stars because of the food and service, unfortunately couldn't because of the incredible number of flies both inside and out. Found myself distracted swatting away the flies rather than thoroughly enjoying the food. The breakfast meals my wife and I both had were delicious and the coffee was superb. It was the flies that diminished my enjoyment. Perhaps a different time of day or season of the year things will be different. We were there on a Sunday morning around 9am during the second week of June."}
{"text":"Ok so I love the food at Joes Farm Grill, but this time it was different! I ordered my usual bbq chicken pizza, which was yummy. I took my mom and she ordered a burger and fries, I stole a fry and it was gross! It tasted like fried shrimp!!!! Luckily I had that fry because mom is allergic to shellfish!!! They really need to be aware of allergies, maybe fry those in different oil. Shrimp flavored french fries are gross!"}
{"text":"Having only lived in Arizona for a year, I'm still exploring all the many wonderful restaurants. I'd been to Joe's Real BBQ and heard tales of their other restaurant, but it wasn't until I took a wrong turn one day and drove by Joe's Farm Grill that I was compelled to try it.   I convinced my family to have a Saturday lunch here. It wasn't busy yet, and I think that changes the experience for the better.   Let me get the cons out of the way. It was expensive, especially because we ordered more expensive items and I wanted the beet salad as well. We also got expensive drinks: their fresh lemonade (worth it!), bottled premium soda. Also, yes, flies. And scorpions. But we live down the street and have flies and scorpions as part of our daily lives. It's not avoidable.   It was hot outside, naturally, but the back was shady and all the plants made it cool. It was quite nice to sit out there even midday, and I usually hate eating outside so that's saying a lot!   Everything else was wonderful! My family was so impressed including my worldly teenagers and skeptical 8 year old. The decor drew me in. It's so retro and modern at the same time. Just my style. The food will make me go back.   I had the BBQ sampler, even though I'm not a fan of pork. But I liked their pork! The ribs were not greasy and tasted smoky and of this delicious sauce. Yum. One of the kids got the garlic fries. Oh, they were so good! We all stole them off her plate and plan to get them next time. No other garlic fries compares. The burgers were well prepared and were rated \"better food than el pollo loco\" by the 8 year old. This is very very high praise! Another kid got the shrimp. It was a generous portion and fresh enough to satisfy the New England natives. Caesar salad was fresh and tasty. No one complained about anything! That never happens!   Overall it was a very pleasant experience. So fun, so comfortable and kind of magical to sit out back with those big trees and silver buildings. I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is always pretty good! I just recently had their breakfast and it did not disappoint :) Good size portions and super tasty pancakes!  The staff is always friendly and the wait is never too shabby. I'm always in for some Joe's! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and come here each time I'm in town. Their burgers and fried zucchini are fabulous and fresh. It's a great place for the adults to eat and let the kids run wild. There is indoor seating when it's too hot out or tons of outdoor picnic tables when the weather has cooled off in the evenings."}
{"text":"Good, wholesome American cooking featuring fresh, local ingredients. Gourmet burgers and french fries is what I enjoyed here."}
{"text":"Everything is locally grown and super fresh and you can taste the difference!!  These are the best burgers I've had (other than home made).  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  The only catch is... don't go if you're in a hurry.  It is pretty much a local treasure, and the lines show it. - If it's your birthday make sure to let them know."}
{"text":"My first time here. Met a friend for lunch & we both had the BBQ Chicken Salad and some Cokes. It was a beautiful March day, so we sat outside. The ambience was amazing, the place packed, & our bellies full of BBQ Chicken Salad goodness!   We sat there for 2 hours, chatting & enjoying our delicious, farm fresh lunch. This is the perfect sit down, relaxing eatery. Also there are shops and a farmer's market on site for checking out and buying goods.   They also have a sister eatery in downtown Gilbert called Joe's Real BBQ. That's on my Bucket List to try as well."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the long trek out to Gilbert.  It's some sort of retro farm house planted in the midst of beautiful scenery... you won't miss it.  Ahi Tuna Burger is heavenly.  Juicy seared Ahi tuna served on a bun w/ crunchy cabbage mix and a side of wasabi mayo?  Count me in.  Serious.  I always get the sweet potato fries because they are some sort of perfection.  This place serves the freshest food I have ever seen.  I guess the farm part helps?  I would count this place down because there are usually so many loose children conquering the beautiful grounds while parents mindlessly chat amongst themselves but... I'm not that heartless.  It's usually always clean, the misters keep you cool & the heaters keep you warm.  This place is good for everyone... just beware of Chandler/Gilbert moms & dads who think farm grill is code for playground."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and I'm amazed at how delicious such simple food can be. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork with a side of Caesar salad and french fries. I put extra BBQ sauce and habanero pepper sauce mixed into the pulled pork and have it a hint of spicy. Probably the best BBQ pulled pork ever! There was plenty to keep me full for quiet a few hours. I wasn't too impressed with the salad or the french fries but BBQ was so amazing I had to give his place 5 stars. The line was so long but it didn't take long at all. At first the line almost scares me away but there was obviously a reason that the line was so long so I had to stay and boy am I glad I stayed.  The ambience of this place was just perfect. It was a picnic atmosphere. The outside area to sit was so cute and just shaded enough to enjoy your meal. I love eating outside! There was also a parrot meet up outside which was interesting to watch. Lots of people brought their parrots I play and meet like you would dogs. Never seen anything like that before.   The staff was awesome the food was great and the ambiance was delightful. I will be going back for sure! And everyone should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered the atlanta falcon special, a chicken sandwich with waffle fries and coleslaw snd mini bottle of coke. They didnt have the mini available so they served me without the drink. I went back in tonask for it. My friend ordered the fried shrimp, with the baked bean special that had a $3 upcharge for a tiny cup of not boston baked beans. That was an overcharge by the cashier.  The shrimp and chicken patty were amazing.  The bun was delicious. But all in all, little flavor. Onion rings were good. Beans, colenslaw and waffle fries not good. I would give them 3.5 stars if i could."}
{"text":"I know many are a fan. I can't really say I am.  Their BBQ is not as good as Joe's Real BBQ on Gilbert Rd, even though the same guy owns both.  But they do have a fairly large menu and some unique items.  I don't come here often, but I usually manage to find something good.  I can't really add much to my last review.  I still think they are 3.5 stars and have some good stuff.  I have to give four because they definitely don't deserve only 3.  I wouldn't mind if they mixed up the menu some.  Maybe had specials that change weekly or monthly."}
{"text":"I took My friend who was visiting from out of state to the Farm stand to get some of their awesome organic dates. I suggested he might like  a date shake from Joe's Grill. I waited in the coffee shop and It took him at keast 30 min. After waiting in line about 2:00p they took his order and then waited again. Customers before and after him got   their orders.  Finally he went to the counter and got his forgotten melted shake.  No apologies or offering to make it over. Bad service. Nothing special.  Not worth the wait.       ."}
{"text":"Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ.   I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD!  and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too.   Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK.  Joe's Farm grill is def. one of my fav places.."}
{"text":"Joes Farm Grill has never disappointed whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner everything is great! Food and service are always above and beyond. BBQ chicken pizza or the BBQ sampler plate are my favorites but you can't go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast just before Christmas. The staff was polite but not overly friendly which was surprising for this area. We ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes. Nothing fancy but delicious. The coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area, and tiring of searching for tex-Mex in a area that seems to have some sort of (AZ-Mex) thing going on, my Bride and I decided to stop at Joes Farm based purely on the fact that it looked interesting. best decision we made since we moved here! Heres the thing, the slogan they use \"Common foods done uncommonly well\" is spot on!  We both had the burger with chedder, heres the thing, there was no amazingly different flavor, no crazy spices, no insane toppings, just good, fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection with pride and a level of quality that you dont find very much, especially in a burger! the bun is both light and substantial, and even the pickles are amazing (they make them themselves.. which gives you a clue on how fanatic they are) On our second trip, we ordered the garlic fries... Holy jumping Jack Flash! If you like fries, and you like garlic, GET THESE! Drenched in garlic, these are some of the best fries I've ever had! The decor is fun and retro-futuristic (think tomorrowland 60's retro future, but someones living room)  And after your meal, you can take a stroll through a very nice park area of Agritopia, to walk some of the food off.  Now, if only we could find a decent tex-Mex place, life would be sweet!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite go-to restaurants in the East Valley. I love the Fontina Burger, and the Ahi Tuna Burger is delicious. Staff is friendly and quick. The facility is unique, clean and welcoming. When it's not too hot, my family and I really enjoy eating outside under the giant tree. I've been here more than three dozen times and I've always had a positive experience. In fact, after writing this review I am dying for some Joe's Farm Grill right now! See you there!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is about this place other than it was featured on the Food Channel. The line to get in the place was just ridiculous. There is only one register open which, more or less, forces you to tip..which I absolutely despise in any restaurant, not just here. The food didn't take too long but the constant battle with aggressive indoor fly's was just gross and probably some kind of heart code violation. When was the last time you ate INSIDE and were bombarded with fly's? The food was overpriced...I mean WAY overpriced and was average at best. Plan on spending about $70 for a family of four. Onion rings were not good and tasted like they were cooked the day before and warmed up. Burger was okay and the chicken in the salad tasted like a burnt grill. I won't be returning there again."}
{"text":"Since learning of this place a few years ago it has become a staple in my wife and I's restaurant list. There has only been a few times where it hasn't been 100% satisfaction but by and large its been great. The onion rings are phenomenal and pretty much everything else is amazing. I am a stickler with burgers and their burgers aren't bad. I would always suggest getting something you probably couldn't make at home i.e. don't get burgers. The jumbo shrimp are some of the best I have ever had (and I come from South Carolina which says a lot). Their Tuna sandwhich is also 5 stars. This past time I got their BBQ sampler platter and it was as usual amazing. I am usually not a huge fan of coleslaw but it went great with the fried tenders and ribs. I always recommend going to Joe's Farm Grill at least every other month :)"}
{"text":"The fontina burger is really good!  I also liked the salmon salad.  I didn't care too much for the bbq pizza though. The line can get very long on nice days."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  My favorite thing to order is the sausage breakfast tacos...yum.     We love to bring our dog...enjoy breakfast outside and then go to Cosmo Dog Park next door...makes for a lovely morning."}
{"text":"This place can get busy and the great food is the reason.  This is an awesome place to go if you have kids as they can run around outside in the ample grassy areas under the shade of citrus trees. The food is really good, but can be a little pricey.  The tuna sandwich and the bar-b-que is awesome."}
{"text":"They have a large menu and a great selection of gluten free options. The portion sizes are large. We will be back for sure. Great place!  The only downer was the flys buzzing around. We sat inside and they were annoying."}
{"text":"We love this place! Such an awesome place to bring in town guests to due to how unique it is and the restaurant was also show cased on Diners, Drive In's, and Dives. They have a wide variety of food but all of it is done wonderfully. So fresh and tasty! The outside seating is our favorite! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, awesome food! Fun location with an amazing history. Had the coffee shake with my burger... Best choice I made all week!"}
{"text":"The Farm is good!  Nice family atmosphere, good food, and nice urban farming appeal.  While the food is good, it isn't exceptionally great and with that comes a heafty bill.  We have gone several times before and will go again - we recommend eating here just be prepared to pay the high prices!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is hands down my favorite place to eat in Arizona. I've had quite a few menu items, including breakfast tacos (which are delicious) but nothing compares to their BBQ chicken pizza. All ingredients are fresh and you can tell. Every time I go there, I can safely get anything on the menu and not regret a thing.   They also offer $10 off your meal on your birthday, and I've utilized this offer for each of the past 5 years. You only get one birthday dinner a year, and this is always it for me."}
{"text":"Great fresh food.  Had a grilled peanut butter and banana split sandwich for a snack, it was really good.  Would like to try the place again."}
{"text":"Foods decent, fun to take people to as a tourist thing."}
{"text":"The food looks just like the pictures! I like the atmosphere and everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Another visit to Joe's but with family this time.  Everything was great that came out of kitchen even though the place was insanely busy that evening.  Definitely a go-to place that I recommend for friends and have never regretted making the recommendation."}
{"text":"Joe's is awesome.   I really like the atmosphere and the food is really good too.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, I dig it. For breakfast, the omelets are awesome.  If you're feeling like a waffle this is the place to get one.  For lunch or dinner the burgers are super tasty and the pizza is excellent.  We always take people from out of town here and a lot of it has to do with the atmosphere.  Not too many places where you can order food and sit at a picnic table in a farm type setting.  Sure its in the middle of suburbia but it does a great job capturing the farmhouse feel in 21st century-Gilbert AZ.  I recommend Joe's if you seek good food in a unique environment."}
{"text":"You know if your restaurant is on Diners Drive Ins and Dives you know it has to be good.  All their food is super fresh and most of their ingredients comes from Joe's farm right next door so you cant get fresher than that!  If you want a burger I recommend the Fontina Burger which is Roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, field greens, farm-made pecan pesto & imported fontina.  The meat is super tender and juicy.  Make sure you get the onion rings to go with that.  The onion rings are massive and have a real good crunch.  They are made of Hand-breaded in rosemary-dill Panko.  If a burger is not your style you can try their BBQ Chicken Pizza which is their house specialty.  The pizza has chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, onion, with Joe's Real BBQ sauce.  The crust is amazing!  Thin and has an amazing crunch!  Add Joe's Farm Grill to your list of visiting DDD restaurant.    BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"Called in take out, arrived@ 11:30a, waited in line @ least 30 min. By then fries & hot dog were no longer hot. Place needs takeout window or better time management for busy times of day. Giving 4 stars due to overall freshness of ingredients."}
{"text":"We came this afternoon and ordered 2 fontina burgers and 2 orders of onion rings. We happened to glance at the receipt and noticed that the girl who put in our order put in a fontina veggie burger rather than the regular. I'm not sure how since we literally ordered \"2 fontina burgers.\" They were happy to remake the burger but gave me my onion rings right then. So eventually, I got my burger but with my already cold onion rings and no refund of the $1.50 difference. The food was delicious but it wasn't busy when we got there and it left me annoyed. If you're going to remake it, remake the whole order so that the person isn't sitting there getting full on side orders and growing irritated."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very unique with the outdoor seating area and drink/condiment station. The fontina burger is TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Joes is always amazing. You shouldn't be reading this, you should be on the way here to eat! Get the onion rings if yours a rings person. They rock."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend wakes me up this morning and decides that I need to check out Joe's Farm Grill for breakfast. I was reluctant due to the travel time, we are in Tempe. But can I tell you, this place is fantastic!!!!  I had the Green eggs and ham scramble....yummy, you can taste those fresh ingredients, especially their home -made pesto.....delicious.  We're on our way back there again today for dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and a fun place to go with kids! We have only ever had breakfast here, and on their breakfast menu the waffles amazing! The breakfast tacos and scramble bowls are excellent too."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but good fresh food. Nothing that unique about it though. You can pretty much get this type of food at any chain restaurant."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite is the salmon salad which I swap out the Caesar for the Farm salad with citrus vinaigrette. OMG. I'm in love! This place is great. They are always so friendly and helpful. And amazing cooks."}
{"text":"This place wants to be fun. Nice setting. Gorgeous outdoor eating. However, that being said, they need to revamp their food prep. I have eaten there several times. Last time was two days ago. Food was mediocre. Biggest thing was it wasn't even hot. When you get eggs and bacon you want them hot. Took about 20 minutes to get my food although they weren't busy. Pancakes served to me with no syrup and no butter??? Had to go ask for same. Bacon - cold, eggs, cold Went to get rootbeer from fountain.......empty.......had to ask them to change it out. More attention to detail. Hot food go concept......get it out when it's hot. People do not like cold food. Good menu selection. Nice variety of choices. They just need to work on their production line timing."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Love the grounds and getting to enjoy the weather with great food.  Only thing is wait to order is too long... but still lo e the ahi tuna sandwich which to give it 5 stars.  Everyone loved their food and shakes as usual... worth the 45 minute drive."}
{"text":"Been here twice and like the overall experience.  Their pull pork bbq was awesome. Tried their featured burger and would just change out the cheese! Fast food made to order! Quick to concerns. Will come again! :-)"}
{"text":"This place is always a better investment than Disneyworld and Disneyland combined. We are from out of town but this was a total hit. Glad we could make it happen. Better lighting would be a plus for night time, especially on the southeast side. Other than that, we've had a great experience every time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the heart of Gilbert.  Always busy but don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing. I can't wait to go back and try more! It's in an adorable compound next to the farm. Dogs are welcome on the grounds. There's also BarNone and The Coffee Shop in the compound. It was a great place to go. We enjoyed the atmosphere and every bite! Oh! And the coffee was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this well known eatery, had only heard good things. Will NEVER go back!!  Extremely long lines to order, took 1 hour to get our food and it was ice cold!!!  Had to give one star because of the system, but, would really rate it as ZERO stars.  It's interesting, last week I received a message per the owner who wanted to send me a gift card to give their place another chance.  I responded that I would be more than happy to change my initial negative review.  Lo and Behold, still no gift card!  Consistent with the initial poor experience."}
{"text":"What's not to love except how crazy busy this place can be. Fresh, locally grown food. Incredible flavors and fun ambiance.   Tuna sandwich is excellent. Get the garlic fries. And their pizza is very good. The bbq is ok but not as good as going to their other location Joes BBQ which seems odd to me.   Get there early or later for lunch to help avoid the craziness."}
{"text":"Super fun place to eat, we enjoy the food and our kids love being there.  Always a fun place to take relatives when they come to town."}
{"text":"A peanut butter sandwich on Texas toast with chocolate chips, fresh starwberries and supposedly pineapple grilled.  Sounds pretty amazing and it was good but I never found the pineapple and the peanut butter was was spread just way to thin.  It was still tasty but could have used more PB.   The chicken finger looked very good and I guess they were.  The hot dog was nothing special but the ribs were finger lickin good.  The burger looked juicy and the date shake was full of pieces of dates but the end result was that it didn't taste much different than the vanilla shake.    My sons girlfrined knows I am a foodie and she tried to come up with some different choices for restaurants.(I am from Colorado) The idea that Guy Fiere was here from Food Channel was cool.  I give her credit for finding this palce.  Will I rush back upon my return to Arizona-most likely not unless the kids want to go and of course I will be with them."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best onion rings ever. Nice family fun setting. Great for spring time. Summer spot for evenings. Most of the seating is outside"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE FOOD and delightful service! Definitely will return and suggest everyone tries this place!"}
{"text":"Wow. I never thought I'd be giving three stars to one of my favorite local burger joints. They recently remodeled, and while the food hasn't really changed... their soda did. I get it, everyone is going organic, but those sodas are not good. And you need a good cold drink to go with great food. And yes, the food is still excellent. Too bad they changed the soda, cause we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Always delicious, try to bring out of town friends and family, so proud of this gem,"}
{"text":"It's confession time: I love a man and his name is Joe Johnston. Not in the way you might think, but in an admiration and respect kind of way. Johnston owns some of my favorite southeast Valley eateries, like Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Market. He also has another place, Joe's Farm Grill, that's been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  Built out of his childhood home, Joe's Farm Grill is at Agritopia, a neighborhood being built around a farm in Gilbert. Many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into Joe's kitchen. It doesn't get more local than this.  You'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant. The place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s. The lighting fixtures are groovy, baby.  The ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order. You're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready. I swear, I jump every time.  The interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating, though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees.  Also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap. Any place that has one of my favorite dips for French fries on tap is a winner in my book.  The mainstream menu of burgers, pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents Joe's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food.  My mouth started watering instantly when I saw how good the food looked. I quickly sank a bite into the Farm Burger ($7.99), which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy. Weighing in at 6 ounces, then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions, this is one tasty burger.  The Thai Chicken Salad ($8.99 small/$9.99 large) takes local greens and veggies, crispy rice noodles and peanuts, then tosses them in spicy Thai vinaigrette. This one was a disappointment because I felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice.  Joe's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked. Knowing that Joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants, ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($8.99) was a no brainer. Smoked chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion and with Joe's Real BBQ sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients, but they worked surprisingly well together. The tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet BBQ sauce created a yin and yang of flavors, a great combination.  For dessert, Joe's has milk shakes ($3.99) including vanilla, chocolate and seasonal fruit.  So it's with much love that I say I'm looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Real good, great atmosphere. Nothing much else like it nearby in AZ, feels like an old farm. The bathrooms are cool too if you get a chance to check them out."}
{"text":"Ohlala this place was delicious!!! At first I was expecting the restaurant to be a bit more classy (I was expecting table side service at first). The food was amazing. Best wedge salad of my life."}
{"text":"I had the most heart-warming experience today thanks to Bill (Goldilocks). We came for my birthday. Upon showing Bill my ID, he turned around to announce it to the staff working to which they responded with a resounding \"happy birthday, Jessica\". After a long day at work and \"average\" customer service elsewhere today, I was so overjoyed with that small act. Bill, you are a treasure. Please always remember that you make a difference in someone's day. Thank you for taking my 'normal' birthday and adding something that really made me smile!"}
{"text":"It's like a Picnic!  This place is still one of my fav's and a must! The food is always very good, reasonably priced and good portions. I love that we could sit comfortably at a picnic table in the shade and enjoy the outdoors. Such a cool place!"}
{"text":"This is such a great spot for lunch.  I love that you can eat outside on the picnic tables and the coffee shop next store is the perfect compliment."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is gorgeous and I loved the garden just wished I had come during the day to check it all out. Unfortunately the food is a bit bland. We order zucchini chips, a Sonoran dog and the bbq chicken pizza. The zucchini chips were the best item we ordered but just okay. We will go back and try it again during the day maybe for breakfast. Cute place but the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for an afternoon snack. Little did I know this place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Place was packed but line moved fast. You order first and get a table. They have indoor and outdoor seating. My friends and I all shared their garlic fries, chicken strips, farm salad and onion rings. My favorite was the garlic fries. SO GOOD!! Seasoned perfectly! The farm salad was very fresh, large portion and delicious. Onion rings were big and battered to a perfect crisp. I wish I tried their pizza which was featured on the show but I guess I gotta come back!  FYI check out their restrooms located outside. The bathrooms have strange Barbie dolls inside the walls staring at you .. but there's also a large screen tv in front of the toilet for your entertainment. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Gilbert to check out the town and this is one of the places we were looking forward to eating at. It's got a cool, trendy vibe as soon as you get in.  The line was a little long, but moved quickly. I ordered the fontina burger and their famous onion rings and a lemonade. It was amazing! It was a good size burger and the patty was super moist. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The only downside is I ordered a side of fruit and the person taking the orders at the front said that all I had to do was ask for it at the window when I picked up my burger and they would give it for free. Huh? I thought ok, weird, but I took her word for it. Anyway, that's what I did and the person at the pick up window said, \"No, you have to pay for fruit.\" I was more than willing to pay for fruit really, but I wasn't about to stand in line again just to get it. So, this is the reason for the 4 stars. Food was good and ambiance was good though."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere of this place. I went a couple of weeks ago and the weather was nice to sit outside.   I wasn't really that hungry, so I had grill cheese. Even if I got something really simple, it was really good. The fries were really good too!  Must go!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place in Phx. Best Farm to Table . It is always a must when visiting the area.The sweet potato fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing place with consistently great menu items and also a bunch of new seasonal items each time I go in.  Try the BBQ Chicken Pizza, my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Tried out the lamb burger. Must have when they have it available. Never disappointed with a trip to Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"Wow absolutely love! I have been a few times and tried several items and never been disappointed.  I know the line is long but it's worth the wait.  The outdoor atmosphere is amazing, I love walking through the garden after o eat"}
{"text":"Food is amazing definitely worth it worth the drive and trip I got the garlic fries and the farm sandwich    We got way too much stuff"}
{"text":"Best sweet potato fries anywhere.  Tuna burger awesome, regular burgers awesome, super friendly service, and plenty of room outside for big families.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has great all American food that is fresh and tasty. We had very basic items, burger and fries and chicken Caesar. Both were very good. The fries you could tell were fresh cut."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh from the farm. These burgers are some of the very best anywhere. The BBQ Bacon Bleu Burger is my favorite in PHX.   The weather from November - April is great and bing quite a crowd to enjoy the picnic benches outside. Expect a 45 minutes wait from the pop-up tents over the walk way on in.  The BBQ chicken pizza is very good, we like to add pesto sauce as well.  When available, the Butter Pecan Milkshakes are fantastic.  Don't miss the French Fries which come in great varieties: garlic, sweet potato (with pineapple dipping sauce), and baked potato (all the baker toppings on top of fries)!  The homemade onion rings were featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. They are extra crunchy and made from scratch.  Since our family eats here a lot I like to mix things up by ordering other great menu items like the breaded green beans and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  The Fried Zucchini is great, some people think the sauce is too acidic tasting but it depends on the season and the tomatoes used at the time.  I love that Joe honored his childhood home by preserving it as a retro-futuristic cool establishment. Visit the bathrooms to see the full design details."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place!  Food: We had the FONTINA BURGER, GARLIC FRIES, and their SEASONAL SHAKE (BUTTER PECAN).  All of it was very delicious!  I love coming here, but hate the long lines.  But they do go quickly so don't mind making a trip out here once in a while!  Service:  everyone was very friendly!"}
{"text":"So this place is a ways away from where I'm at... but the food here was well worth the trip!   I ordered a farm burger with blue cheese and garlic fries... more like awesome burger with awesome fries! I heard that all of the food here was fresh from the farm (hence farm grill) and you can really taste it in their ingredients.   I love the look and feel of the place too - I wish it wasn't so hot outside though, but it was cool to eat at the picnic tables they have set up outdoors. This place is a MUST GO if I am ever near this neck of the woods again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food. I got a BBQ bacon bleu burger, it was juicy and all the ingredients on it were, indiviudally, perfectly prepared, and came together in this epic fusion of awesome. Healthy portions but not too big, and reasonably priced too. I think they do breakfast too? Long story short, I am a BIG fan already!  There is indoor and outdoor seating, and the outdoor is nice and relaxed, some people even bring well-behaved dogs and children that can go on the grassy areas down the yardspace. (Note: I did go a little earlier in the summer when outdoors was still tolerable temps) It's a very lush spot, lots of nice green plants - so if you're not an AZ Native, it might be a nice place for you if you miss that kind of environment. The flies did get a little annoying but they try to take care of it with non-flypaper methods (which is great bc flypaper is kinda gross)  I will be back back soon :D"}
{"text":"Although the line was long, it was worth the wait. We tried the Sonoran dog and the Carolina dog, along with garlic fries. The Carolina was my favorite. A dog topped with pulled pork, cole slaw, and their own bbq sauce. Loved the outdoor picnic style seating on a nice warm day. Can't wait to go back to try the bbq chicken pizza and onion rings. Will be taking out of towners here for sure."}
{"text":"My family and I went on a Wednesday after my daughter's soccer game and it was easy to find a seat and order the food.  But I'm sure it get's busier on the weekend.  Anyway, the burger's were tasty(if you don't like some pink make sure to ask for well done), and the onion rings were tasty as well."}
{"text":"I live down the street and have been going to Joe's Farm Grill since Its been open.  I have never had an item on the menu that wasn't great.   This place is organized, comfortable and very family friendly, with plenty of outside seating. It can be super busy at times but it always worth the wait.  My favorites are:  Pepperoni Pizza or any of their pizzas, Grilled Cheese, Fried zucchini, sweet potato fries or any of their fries. Breakfast is awesome as well. I always get the Monte Cristo fritters with boysenberry syrup. Its worth a drive out there for those that live far way."}
{"text":"What a treat, so different than any other place to eat. Love the coffee shop as well, great breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and I definitely suggest visiting the restrooms, they are unexpected.  Food wise, there were two of us and we had burgers.  Their burgers are one of those really big really thin patties.  I think they even say something about 1/3 pound of meat.  That would be 1/3 pound of meat before cooking and it is probably with 70% because they were just really thin and really well done when they were served.  The burgers were DRY.  I had no idea what people were raving about the food for.  It was not all that!  I substituted onion rings and those were mediocre at best as well.  The shakes were tasty though.  A big plus is that you can bring your dog.  There were tons of dogs there on a nice spring day just chillin'.  I didn't see the fly problem that people were talking about but have to admit that I was put off by the signs that said \"do not climb on trees, fall hazard and scorpions.  SCORPIONS!???!!!  I'm am not sitting near any tree ever again and hesitate to even walk in the grass.  I will probably go back at least one more time in the future and get anything but the burgers.  Hopefully they won't cook the ever living life out of my food."}
{"text":"It was okay. Nothing special. I mostly liked the look of the old building on the inside. I'm not saying I would never go here again, but it wouldn't be my top choice."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place appeared on Guy Fieri's show: it's awesome.  I wound up in this part of Gilbert for something else and stopped here to eat. And I did not regret it.  I had the Fontina Burger (no field greens) and onion rings. The onion rings were very good if a touch over breaded, and the burger was dynamite. Mushrooms, cheese, beef, red pepper, etc.? Sign me up! Plus they had great shakes and a nice atmosphere. Another \"blast-off\" place on the level of Pita Jungle.  Tip: it's not crowded at 4pm on a Friday, but it does get busier soon after."}
{"text":"Ok, so Joe's Farm Grill has amazing food.  No question about it.  However, five-star-food is quickly becoming a diminished three-star experience as I have now stood in line for 45 minutes while coming to realize they have not even decided to open the second register.   I find it rude.  Please, Farm Grill respect your customers by opening another register.  That is poor planning on your part."}
{"text":"Joe's Real BBQ's skinnier more healthy little brother. I commend them for making their own fresh vegetables, but being on tv has made them a bit overrated.  The line for this place literally went out the door. By the time I got to order I had watched Guy Fieri eat their Ahi Tuna Sandwich 5 times, so i had to try it and I got to say i was pretty disappointed. The tuna was really bland and if it wasn't for the asian slaw on it I probably wouldn't have finished it. BBQ Chicken Pizza wasn't too bad and their Sweet Potato Fries and Onion Rings were pretty good.  If I had tried their burgers or BBQ I probably would have given them an extra star."}
{"text":"This is just some good home cooking, and it's in a HOME! This converted farm house is such a great place to visit with the family. Have some simple (amazing) food, sit down and relax in the park-like setting, walk around the farm a bit then top it off with a perfect coffee from \"The Coffee Shop\" at the end of the property. All in all it makes for a great day out.  BTW, I can't get enough of that meat sampler plate. Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Loved this place, even got to bring my dog! I had a lamb burger and sweet potato fries! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had girls lunch date at Joe's Farm Grill.  It's been a while since I've gone back due to past bad food experience.  I'm glad we went back.  I had their Southwest Burger and Sweet potato fries.  It was best burger I had in a long time.  And their Sweet potato fries were just fantastic.  I will have to go back and order their salads and if that's good then this might have to be my other favorite lunch place.  I couldn't give 5 stars due to malfunction of all their condiment pumps.  They were either broken or empty.  Also something was wrong with Ice tea machine.   When I went back for refill it sprayed me.  Luckily I had dark clothes on so it was no big deal but I was sad I couldn't get some Ketchup on my fries."}
{"text":"Somehow I have forgotten to review Joe's Farm Grill.  However, judging by their current reviews, they've not suffered for it.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Joe's Farm Grill is too popular, I hate standing in line.  There, there's my complaint."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised I must say to see that Joes for some here got such low scores. Yes  I  guess the flies and the noise can be a bit bothersome, but for me it is all about the food and that is awesome! I absolutely love love the onion rings there. It is hard to find really good onion rings these days. I had family recently come in and we had so much food on the table I was afraid someone was going to start oinking  at us. Fried zucchinni is also probably the very best I have ever had and the fries !awesome! How do they get them so crispy? Fontina burger is AMAZing! I will definitely keep going there!"}
{"text":"Oh my God what can I say the food here is delicious had that chicken pesto sandwich with sweet potato fries best I've ever had. My honey had the hot dog topped with pulled pork and coleslaw with onion rings he says it was to die for. We are only here for another 4 days but I think we're going to come to eat here at every meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the authenticity of this place.  The food is probably a 4 out of 5 stars however based on being such a well done restaurant that flows with the local neighborhood I'm leaning 5 stars"}
{"text":"Son loves this place. Love being able to sit outside, eat tasty food and just relax. We'll be returning for sure to experience the rest of the area!"}
{"text":"Great super fresh food and feels very hometown-ish... that's good. The food rocks and there's ample indoor and outdoor seating.  Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" with host Guy Fieri filmed a segment there which probably helped with some popularity but their food is great so it's no wonder they're already famous.  See you there."}
{"text":"Very best place to go for 'local flavor.'  Everything on the menu is killer, and the organic sodas are a little strange but fun.  Great ambiance, great food, and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Fun place to just take your family & friends for quality meal.  Annoying flies seems to be a problem during my visit, but it only diminished my experience there by a little.  Food definitely makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Okay this place was just way too cool. You walk into this restaurant with kind of a funky diner vibe and order your food at a window. Then, you can either eat inside the restaurant or go out the backdoor to eat on a picnic table adjacent to the farm where the food comes from! We had about 20 people in our party and I think everyone was extremely pleased with their food and the whole experience. I ordered the Carolina Dog and my nephew ordered the Sonoran Dog, and we shared. They were both incredible, but the Sonoran packed just a bit more flavor. The fries were delicious, and while i didn't try the onion rings, they looked out of site. My kids each enjoyed some delicious chicken fingers and some fantastic shakes. The food plus the overall ambiance and friendly staff at Joe's Farm Grill made for more than a great dinner--it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Next time I'm in the area, you can bet I'm heading back and taking some friends with me."}
{"text":"We love coming to Joe's Farm Grill. The food is always great and when the weather is nice we love sitting outside to eat. I like that the food tastes fresh and pretty much anything on the menu is good. My boyfriend and I love their Ahi Tuna Sandwich. It's our favorite. They give you a large size Ahi Tuna with wasabi mayo and slaw with the sandwich. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Joe's has good food but the price is a little steep for what you get considering there is no wait staff. You stand in line to order your food and then have the option to sit inside or out. If the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. The food was pretty good. I had a burger but like I said, a bit overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Was there and had their seafood plate. The fried fish was good but the shrimp was the best.    This has become one of my favorite places to eat.  Friendly staff and service and good food.  They treat you like family.  Don't miss this place!  It is worth the trip."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Everything made fresh from scratch with many items grown on the property. Well thought out and well executed. I haven't found any item on the menu that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Joe's is simply, amazing. The customer service, from the management, to the counter, to the bussers, is outstanding. You are greeted, and checked on throughout most of your visits. The large outdoor space and picnic table setup is huge for me and my family. The kids can run around and explore before and after we eat. What steals the show though, is the food. I have tried just about everything on the menu and have not had one disappointment. I tend to go back to the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Southwest Burger, and BBQ Platter most often. I believe the BBQ gets shipped over from Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert. The portions are more than generous and complimented by some really good sides. No alcohol, but just eat and then walk over to 12 West for a beer, or Garage East for a glass of wine! Avoid peak times if you don't want to wait in line. If you do encounter a line, it usually moves pretty fast. Plus, stay, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow, they buy it local!!! The food tastes great...don't forget to get a milkshake. It is also a great place to sit and eat outside, nice!"}
{"text":"It's decent, but nothing to rave about. I've been here twice and might try it again, but I wouldn't go out of your way."}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet.  I love this place, the food is always fresh, the service is always friendly, and the ambiance is one of a kind.  Agritopia rocks, so does Joe & the rest of the Johnston family!"}
{"text":"Excellent Easter breakfast on a beautiful day! We ate and then walked around the farm taking pictures. The scrambled eggs and country potatoes were perfect. I've never had such good sausage and bacon. Lastly, the pancakes and maple syrup were great as \"dessert\". My daughter and I shared so it was only 9.99 for their Big Breakfast. You can afford to take your family there! Love it, love it, love it!"}
{"text":"Love to meet family here, it's like A family picnic under the big huge trees. The outdoor grounds and gardening is beautiful. When the weather is nice in Arizona... coming here is a must do!!"}
{"text":"the concept is great - farm to table, but I wasn't impressed. I think it's overrated, maybe because Guy Fieri visited there for Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, but what does he know? he wears his sunglasses on the back of his head.  Super long wait time and all of our food was cold. booooo"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this out and drove a ways to get there and pretty disappointed.  I LOVE Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert and have often ordered from there for parties I have had.  Joe's Farm Grill was a bit disappointing.  30 dollars for 1 soda, and two meals at lunch time, we waited in a cafeteria type line for about 20 minutes.  Only one order window open.  Several employees in back messing around.  We ordered the ahi tuna and the chicken BBQ pizza, both featured on the Food Network.  The tuna came out first and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the BBQ pizza.  The tuna was so fatty that my husband could only eat about 4 bites.  He said flavor was good but quality of meat not good.  The BBQ pizza was so bland, chicken (very little chicken) was dried out."}
{"text":"We came here for a big group lunch during a weekend wedding in AZ. I had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up, but I was unfortunately not impressed.   The atmosphere is cute for sure. It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn't feel like every other place in AZ. While I do think that's great, it wasn't even close to enough to bring up my review of the food.   The food was not good. And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix.   And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.  I will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS. After trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I won't be back to this spot."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Beatles - Hey Jude)  Hey Joe, don't make it bad Take a salad and make it better Organic to make it healthy for my heart Then you can start to make my burger  Hey Joe, don't be afraid I was made to go out and Yelp you The minute you let try your onion rings Then I begin to feel a lot better  And anytime I feel hungry pains, hey Joe's Farm Grill Please carry some fries and bacon burgers For well you know that it's Bo Bites who eats and sings By making your world a little tastier Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah   It's Joe's from Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives!  Yes, this sweet spot has been around for some times and always a pleasure to visit.  Service here is always on spot and just having the ability to walk around the yard is fun.  The Coffee Shop next doors bakes up a storm and the farmers market is always cool to explore.    I came to Joe's after a run with a friend so we were pretty hungry!  I went for the Fontina Burger with Onion Rings, while she ordered the Ahi Sandwich with Beets.  My burger was cooked to perfection while the peppers and fontina cheese gave it a lovely sweet pop.  I would say they have the softest bun around and it just literally melts in your mouth.  The Onion rings were fresh and crunchy with every bite.  My friends Ahi Sandwich had the same bun, but within was a large slab of tuna with some slaw.  Overall, a crunchiness of the slaw gave it some texture while the wasabi mayo provided some heat.  The tuna itself was cooked lightly seared so you had somewhat of a sashimi taste to it.    In the end, Joe's Farm Grill is always a recommendation whenever someone ask me about a great place to eat.  The experience itself is always great because of the atmosphere it has and the food is always consistent! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Joes Farm Grill this weekend. Food was great. We all had large fluffy pancakes, Belgium waffles.  Fantastic.  This is a must try.  Worth the drive"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful 75 degree day today, made even more perfect with a wonderful lunch outside at Joe's Farm Grill.  We got there early to avoid the line (which rapidly appeared around 11:40am) so our food was ready very quickly after ordering.  My chicken pesto sandwich was wonderful - the meat was juicy and the peppers and mushrooms were fresh and yummy.   Others in the group enjoyed pizza, burgers, and fantastic sweet potato fries which I couldn't help sampling.  Everything looked and smelled great.  My only complaint was the condiment area which was very messy with spilled ketchup and ice everywhere.  They needed to send someone out to clean it up more promptly.   Otherwise, Joe's Farm Grill was an excellent lunch experience (as they usually are)!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is fabulously tasty. I'm sure whatever you order is amazing, but I have found my selection: Portobello Mushroom Sandwich on a Gluten Free Bun.  Holy Cannoli it's fabulous. Often they are busy so the wait for food is worth it. Be patient. Enjoy the atmosphere. Check out the bathrooms. They have old school cartoons playing in them!"}
{"text":"Is there anything better than eating outdoors on a nice sunny day with temps in the low 80's on green grass among plenty of citrus trees and evergreens  in Phoenix Arizona??  Well this is the setting everyday throughout the fall and spring at Joe's Farm Grill!!  I can't believe I haven't written a review on Joe's Farm Grill already.  It's an awesome place to take the family and friends for breakfast or lunch.  Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant.  They actually grow most of not all of the produce they use in their dishes on site. They will offer some seasonal sides, dishes and deserts based on the seasonality of their fruits and veggies.    There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill, so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu.  Some of my favorites at Joe's Farm Grill ~ BBQ smoked chicken pizza which is grilled with some char, topped with plenty of blue cheese, some veggies and BBQ sauce.  It is DELISH and the perfect app to share with friends.   Some of my fav's:  ~Fontina Burger, Chicken Pesto sandwich, ~Sonoran Dogs ~ get the X2 for $9.99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce, ~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches ~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad   All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later :^)   Don't forget to leave room for desert at \"The Coffee Shop\" or a tasty shank/malt!  Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality, fresh tasting food.    This place can get insanely busy on the weekends especially when the weather is nice.  You may want to plan your visit to Joe's either early lunch or late breakfast during the week.  Bring your dog and kiddos so they can play on the green grass and enjoy a meal outside.  I hope to see you at Joe's soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is neat, from the farmhouse meets modern diner concept to the spacious courtyard outdoor dining area to the unique and strange futuristic restrooms. As for the food, Joe's is about as \"All American\" as it gets. A wide selection of foods, but the wife and I both went with the recommended BBQ bleu cheese and bacon burger, and chicken tenders for the kids. The prices are pretty average (compare to Chilis), but like European restaurants, it seems the tips are included in the price of the food, as there really is no wait staff. The burgers were as good as we'd expected. The chicken tenders were of quality as well. The butter pecan shake was tasty. Most importantly, we left full and satisfied.  The kids had a blast running around in the courtyard, which allowed for us to enjoy our meal. The place is visually appealing, sort of blend of past, present, and future in it's design. Not sure if that was the intent, but those restrooms are very otherworldly, almost like being aboard an alien ship, with dolls encased in neon lit boxes in the walls, while Thunderbirds, a 60s television series starring marionettes, plays on a screen that can be viewed from the john.  Next time we're in the area, we would definitely pay Joe's another visit. I wish they had one in the west valley."}
{"text":"Love their onion rings and thw atmosphere of this place....the customer service is top notch as well"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place.  Super casual.  Consistently good food.  I love the asian chicken salad and the fried green beans.  The breakfast tacos are great too."}
{"text":"Friends raved about Joe's so I was excited to check it out. The line on a Thursday at 7pm took about 30min which made me think that it was going to be amazing. Love that it's mostly local and organic. Food was good but I understand why people think it was a little too pricey. Garlic fries were yummy even though they were kind of cold. Pesto Chicken Sandwich could have had more flavor but I'm a total pesto snob. The number of rude children running around bumping into people trying to pick up food or get drinks was annoying but typical. I'll go back to check out the coffee shop for sure!"}
{"text":"Just like everyone else I like Joe's Farm Grill, not sure if I love it yet. We stopped in for breakfast and I ordered the Joe's Big Breakfast consisting of eggs, sausage, bacon and 2 pancakes for $9.99 was good my eggs were not soft scrambled as I ordered them. But the delicious pancakes made up for that issue. My husband had the Chicken & Mushroom Scramble made of Grilled chicken breast, fresh mushrooms, caramelized onions, fontina and cream cheese w/ skillet potatoes. He was very impressed with his meal but wished for more that 1 strip of flatbread. We don't live near Gilbert but we will be back to eat at Joe's Farm Grill for lunch in the future so that I can change my like to Love because it takes time to build a relationship."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq chicken pizza and fresh strawberry milkshake. Love the atmosphere and great service. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Yum! Sweet potato fries are the best also LOVE the mushroom and chicken scramble for breakfast. Nice to sit outside. Staff if friendly and service is great."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious food with an insanely long line. They really need a remodel to make things run smoother! But if you're okay with waiting in line for 30 minutes this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"As usual, this place is delicious! Tried the Southwest Burger and wanted more.  The onion rings were delicious as usual and this is coming from a person who despises onions!   Yay for Joe's! Always fresh and always delicious!"}
{"text":"Went back for a late lunch. The food was still very good, the sad news you had to protect your food from the fly's. We ate inside and the fly's were a little over whelming."}
{"text":"Wonderful,  flavorful  food,  just pricey.    Wish they had cheaper kids menu with more options.  Shrimp is really  jumbo and always been great.  Chicken sandwich on multi grain bun,  grilled onions option for free. Yummy"}
{"text":"I had lived in Gilbert for 10 years and unfortunately never came here until after I moved away for college.  Everyone told me this place was fantastic, so I finally brought my family here one Sunday while I was back for spring break.  The reviews are not underrated.  We absolutely loved this place!  Sunday lunch can take a while, but it is sure worth the half-hour wait.  I ordered a Portobello Salad, knowing that their greens and fresh from Agrotopia.  Words cannot describe the wonderful medley of juicy vegetables and the succulent grilled portobello.  It was pure delight.  The rest of my family shared a large order of barbeque ribs with a side of sweet potato fries.  Everything was simply delicious, and we got to enjoy a really nice lunch outside."}
{"text":"On a trip to Tempe to visit my sister she brought me to this place. She thought I would like it. She was right she knows me all too well. I had the BBQ plate it was delectable. It came with pulled pork, baby back ribs  and some chicken tenders. All of the meat was very good quality. The food the rest of the fam looked amazing as well. They all really enjiyed it. My sister had a salad which was made with veggies grown on the premises. Very good, very fresh. Really great food. The breakfast menu looked amazing but did not get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"Love the remodel! Giving this place 5 stars, liked it before but this time I love it. Still has its original charm, friendly staff, and love how it's kid friendly. It also has a clean fresh feel. The presentation on food and coffee is perfect! Great job!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Joe's BBQ, so I thought this would be a no-brainer awesome choice. My boyfriend had a rough day so I wanted to treat him to something I had faith would be good, and with all the good reviews I thought we couldn't go wrong.  The line was only partially out the door, so we thought it wouldn't be that bad. 50 minutes later we finally were able to place our order. That was rough.  I had the tuna sandwhich and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwhich. It took about 10 minutes more to get the food. I'm not sure why people repeatedly wait 45 minutes plus for their food - it's just okay. I know places that I can get an Ahi tuna sandwhich for that are cheaper and much better quality, like LGO. There really is nothing remarkable about any of it.  Then when my boyfriend got home he started feeling sick and proceeded to have the worst bout of food poisoning I've seen. Undercooked or mishandled chicken is one of the worst types of food poisoning you can get - it took him a full 36 hours to recover. He never gets sick, and this was the only thing he ate all day, so I'm pretty confident that was the issue. Plus, there was a sauce on the chicken so it would've been hard to detect if it was slightly undercooked.  I called the manager and he said they haven't had any reports of this in the past, and sounded skeptical that it even happened. At a place where so many kids eat I'd expect this to be taken more seriously.  Overall, I'm very disappointed in this. I could've saved time, money and a whole weekend of taking care of my boyfriend simply by going somewhere else. I do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner. Worth wading through construction and large number of people and cars but the team works together to manage what looks like mayhem. Placed order in 5 minutes and food was up and ready in 6 minutes. Fontina burger and side of beet salad. After 10 years they just keep getting better. Construction takes over in September and 5 weeks later they reopen. Get your fix while you can. Its going to be a long 5 weeks."}
{"text":"I'm approximately 20 miles from The Farm Grill but I've eaten there more than a dozen times. While I think it has the best burger (albeit thin) in the Valley, it's not without its faults.  When I explain The Farm Grill to people I tell them it's food on a farm in a high tech, modern environment. I mean where else can you eat at a farm restaurant that has a condiment flushing system, TVs in the restrooms (that shows the same movie every time) and broadcasts 90s indie music on the speakers?  Remember the scene in Pulp fiction where Uma Thurman orders a milk shake and Travolta asks for a sip because he wants to know what a $5 milk shake tastes like? Well these shakes, particularly the chocolate malt, is worthy of the $4.30 price tag. I've never tried the ribs  but my friends enjoyed the salmon and tuna sandwiches.  The biggest problem with the Farm Grill is flies. I stop eating there in the late spring / early summer each year because the flies are unbearable, even indoors.   Depending on the time of day the lines get very big and the place doesn't open multiple registers. Food usually comes out quickly though no matter how crowded it is.  Due to the fact that this place is in east Gilbert the clientele is very white and very mormon. There are more pregnant women and young children at The Farm Grill on a weekend afternoon than there are in some maternity wards.   If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups, the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd. Just avoid it during the warm weather season because no one should spend $12 on a meal and feel the need to devour it as quick as possible just to avoid a fly infestation.  They are now open for breakfast too."}
{"text":"I am SO in love with the banana split sandwich!! Great food. Great service. Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this hot spot in Gilbert, AZ. The farm fresh ingredients make everything on the menu delicious. The Ahi Tuna sandwich is my go to almost every time. My husband loves all the burgers and hot dogs. Don't miss out on the best onion rings your ever going to have. The salads are delicious, especially with their green goddess dressing. I haven't tried their pizzas yet but they are definitely on my to do list. Their breakfasts are great too. Fresh fruit on the waffles and pancakes! Relax under the trees with the rest of the patrons. It's great to share your table and meet new people. Kids just love it there too. Real chicken breast used for the chicken tenders! It gets busy but don't let the lines out the door fool you, they are fast and if there is a little wait, it's definitely worth it. The staff are the happiest and friendliest for a group who don't get tips, although they do deserve it."}
{"text":"Always a nice place to go.  Doesn't rock my world, but I'm never disappointed with the food either."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of their tuna ahi sandwich and their fontina burger, along with their fried zucchini and garlic fries! Be sure to get there early during the weekends or after the afternoon rush!! Not going to lie I love the farm grill more than Joe's BBQ! Friendly staff, great surrounding neighborhood and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I don't get why people like this place.  The food is very average.  It consists of burgers and fries and hotdogs.  Nothing to see here."}
{"text":"We order the ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings and beet salad for lunch and homemade lemonade. Great outdoor atmosphere and we noticed a lot of people brought their dogs to have lunch with them. Needless to say the food was all off the hook. If my wife says that one more time she's going to be hanging from a hook out here in one of the nice trees. All kidding aside that he to know was absolutely outstanding sandwich and onion rings were very very good. I didn't particularly care for the beet salad but I don't like beets, my wife loved it. If you like lemonade the homemade lemonade is absolutely outstanding not too sweet and not too tart."}
{"text":"The wait at this place is ridiculous.  Food is not all that great considering the wait!Called for a pick-up and told it'd be ready in an hour but over an hour later, still wasn't ready.  Needs to be more choices in this area and maybe they won't make their customers wait forever as though there is nothing better to do."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place was incredible.  We were visiting from out of state.  There was a large line to order when we got to the restaurant.  I wondered if it was worth it but we decided to wait.  We waited between 30-45 minutes to order and it was completely worth it!  The food was amazing!  We loved the atmosphere!  The service was great.  Next time we are visiting, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for my sister's birthday as a new place to try after hearing about it on the Food Network channel. The vibe of the place is really special and unique, feels like you're at a private farm. The food was amazing!! I decided to order a salad just so I could sample all the home grown veggies from the farm. The strawberry lemonade was also top notch and came in a very large cup! After lunch, we walked around the fields and visited the coffee shop next door. The only negatives for me was the really long wait time (almost an hour) at 2pm in the afternoon on a weekday and how far of a drive it was for me. Overall, great experience...would go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We ordered everything that was featured on Diner, Dives and Drives.  I know what you're thinking, what groupies we are?  Couldn't help it.  Onion rings were great, even the next day as I nuked them up in the toaster oven.   You must try the garlic fries.  I simply could not have enough of the garlic fries.  I'd be happy if I can just have the garlic fries, next time.    My husband loved the fontina burger.   I liked the ahi sandwich, but I wish it was a bit more rare.  It said 'rare' on the menu but it not the sushi kind of rare (barely grilled on each side kind of rare).  It's a tad more cooked than to my liking.  The asian coleslaw is not your typical kind of coleslaw.  They add a very nice touch to it, making it light, with a slight asian flavor, but the maker is the mild wasabi mayo.  The mayo simply put, is the BOMB!!  The pizza was also good, could have used a little bit less of the bbq sauce.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"*3.5* My friend, son and I had lunch here recently. We got there at lunch peak hour apparently since the line was outside the door! It moved at a decent pace. We got BBQ chicken pizza, Farm burger with onion rings, kids grilled cheese, order of sweet potato fries and drinks. Since it was my birthday, my lunch was free which was a nice surprise. Food was ready in a timely manner. My friend enjoyed her burger, my son grilled cheese was very good, on thick Texas toast but the portion seemed small to me( half a small sandwich)  I mean, with childhood obesity kids should be eaten less, it was perfect for my 19 months old but I don't know for a 10 yr old. The BBQ pizza was good, but not blew me away good. I think I'll order a burger next time. Sweet potato fries were good and the portion this time was huge!!! Didn't like the sauce they came with.  Like others mentioned before, the layout of the restaurant make things a bit chaotic when is crowded.  And I agree with a prior reviewer, they charge $2 extra to sub fries for something else, but then give you only half a portion???   I will like to come back to try the burgers and breakfast."}
{"text":"My family of very picky eaters, including a gourmand snob, found this restaurant at the top of our Yelp search. We were there for dinner around 6:30 and found a substantial line to order, which moved with satisfying speed. The food is ordered and picked up at a window like fast food, but is more like a gourmet restaurant. We had the hamburger and the chicken sandwich. Both were juicy and flavorful, the chicken marinated and tender. The setting included a lot of trees, very pleasant. Check out the bathrooms for a giggle."}
{"text":"One of the very best spots in the east valley. Great outdoor options and checks every box for good food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is definitely worth the wait   Go early this is a neat area to walk around in.  I have the beat h burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"Add the New York Giants sandwich to the menu permanently please!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was OK , atmosphere was VERY cool!! I will go here again and try something else to eat. The staff was super nice and there was no problem getting a seat. It's on my \" visit again\" list.."}
{"text":"Oh Wow!  That is all I have to say to this wonderful Farm Grill !!!  Great taste and lots of food.  I'm very impressed with the service, the great outdoor setting with the 2 Huge shaded trees.  I loved the Strawberry lemonade and my Salmon plate was so Delicious!!!  My hubby had the Baby Back ribs and could not finish them- lunch for the next day!!  We will be back to try more yummy items."}
{"text":"My kids (even the 3 year old!) ask to go here all the time! We've enjoyed everything we have tried, and we love the overall setting. Only 4 stars, because the food is good, but not spectacular... and it would be much more enjoyable if I didn't have to share my food with the flies!"}
{"text":"After having great shakes and burgers here, you can wander the community gardens at Agritopia! The only things holding me back from giving five stars are the long lines and lack of substantial indoor seating. Be prepared to wait a half hour and eat your food outside."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, food was very good, the flavor of the burgers are the best maybe due to the freshness and varieties of toppings, but burger I had was a LITTLE dry, nothing horrible, but just a little dry.  Onion Rings are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Farm Grill.  The food tastes great and they try to their ingredients are local.  You can generally get in and out of there fairly quickly even with a medium-long line.   It is very nice the drink machine isn't pressed up between the line and the wall like it is at Joe's BBQ.  Joe also gives back to the community, one way he does this is by offering a customer appreciation day where everyone gets a free meal.    Try the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, it is my favorite menu item!"}
{"text":"Checked out Joe's after hearing so much about it.    Pros: great ambience if you go in the evening and sit outside,  friendly staff, good food  Cons: limited menu if you don't eat pork  There was quite a line we waited in but it goes by quickly.  You order your food at the counter and they give you a buzzer.  Restaurant pricing might be a bit higher than necessary. Hubby ordered the fontina burger with fries and said it was very good.  I ordered the veggie pizza and it wasn't memorable.  Loaded with onions fyi. I ate it but I would never crave it.    Not a place I would think of returning to but wouldn't refuse to go back either."}
{"text":"Joe's boyhood home is now the foodie mecca of Gilbert.  Set next to idyllic farm land with a park-like atmosphere in the dining area, you'll feel like you just had the best backyard barbecue of your life.  What's good here?  You name it.  BBQ ribs?  Check.  Burger? Check.  Pizza?  Hot dogs? Salad? Tuna sandwich?  It's all exceptional, even the onion rings will knock your socks off.  A lot of the ingredients are fresh off the neighboring fields and everything is made from scratch.  Joe, that knock on the door is me coming over to your house for dinner."}
{"text":"Always satisfied with the service and selection and quality.  Although owned by the same person to my knowledge as Liberty Market that I did not review favorably.  Joe's Farm Grill is run smoothly and the prices are more in line."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Everything is really good!  My only complaint is the prices. For 4 of us, we order 3 adult meals, upgrade 2 with the garlic fries and drink water and it's nearly $40. Seems like everyone should at least get a drink for that. Adding some garlic sauce to fries shouldn't cost over $2 each.  Not sure we'll keep coming when the kids are bigger and everyone needs their own meal."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've only been twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast, but it is exceptional. For the price, you receive a good portion and quality food. During my most recent visit I ordered the Belgian waffle with fresh fruit, and after all the debating, I'm sure glad that is what I ordered. A large Belgian waffle topped with the freshest strawberries, blueberries and blackberries I have tasted along with the best whipped cream for $6.99. I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Atmosphere is amazing with both inside and outside dining and the farmhouse feel is certainly in tact. Inside dining is inside an old living room with a fireplace and outside dining is by the farm with picnic benches and trees providing shade. Quality, fresh food, great atmosphere and a reasonable price. My kinda place."}
{"text":"Some people must not get out much.   Don't get me wrong, good was good. Enjoyed the fresh ingredients.   The line. Why have 2 windows, but have one closed at dinner time on a weekend? That's ridiculous.   Is it good?...yes.   Is it amazing?....no  Is it worth standing in line for.....eh  Everything seemed to lack flavor. It was good, but expected a little more spices and flavor. Healthy food doesn't have to be bland. I shouldn't have to dunk my sandwich in ketchup to add some flavor."}
{"text":"Food was great! Farm fresh ingredients. Pulled pork was delicious and the ribs were fall off the bone good!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is so relaxed, totally family friendly and the food is usually really good.  I was really bummed that I ordered my son a pizza from the kid's menu and it came out burned on the crust and underneath- so it was inedible, even by the standards of a 15-month old. They won him back with the sweet potato fries from my meal, but I wasted money on his meal.   I will still give it four stars because this is are first issue since we have been coming... But now we will be coming less, because who screws up a kid's meal?! Mess up on mine if you are goinf to, but not my son's."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in all of the Phoenix area. Delicious food and a great atmosphere make this one of the most casual yet enjoy your pool heating experiences we have found so far. Took my wife and mother-in-law and family TV there for a nice delicious breakfast/brunch. Really enjoyed the sausage and gravy biscuit that was the meal of the day along with meat & potatoes scramble, Green eggs and ham and pancakes for the fam, plus an order of Apple fritters for our breakfast \"dessert\"! Recently, they've added new waitstaff and more, casual inside and outside seating. Really good for kids/families m with lots of open Space! This is our go-to place to take out-of-town friends and family or just to have a relaxing breakfast/lunch/dinner for ourselves. Keep the good food coming!"}
{"text":"This place is really fun and different. The food is a little pricey for what you get, in my opinion, but it tastes sooooo good. The pesto burger rocks, garlic fries, and the BBQ chicken pizza, are also good. Your timing needs to be good, because the place can get packed quickly, with lines out the door. The wrong time of year, and the indoor seats are noisy and cramped, and the outdoor seats are abuzz with flies."}
{"text":"Good options for vegetarians. Cute outside atmosphere- picnic tables. More like a cleaner version of fast food. Order at the window and they serve you at the table. The restaurant is very clean and updated."}
{"text":"Visited Joe's grill last Sunday and absolutely loved it. The food is very good and a really good property to hang out in. Be ready to stand in a long queue to order though."}
{"text":"I had been here once before and remember having a great burger. Wanted to go healthier this time so I ordered the Wild Salmon Plate (ok, not so healthy on the fries) and a Farm Salad to share with a friend. The salmon was delicious- perfectly cooked and seasoned. I upgraded to garlic fries. These also were seasoned perfectly- one of my new favorite places for garlic fries! The salad is large, fresh, and light with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette dressing (or your choice of several others). Overall a fantastic experience!   -As a pregnant lady, it would be nice if there was more than two single-stall bathrooms...but not a huge deal."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! The food is fresh and delicious and I love eating in the picnic tables outside!"}
{"text":"First time @ Joe's...Excellent food, really neat atmosphere. We tried the Barbeque pork plate and the Barbeque sampler.... both were terrific. LOVE the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Great Food! I love the outdoor dining!!  There were way too many flies!! kinda gross"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a dozen times, clean place, great food. I like to visit when the weather is right to sit outside as the seating area inside is limited and a bit of an echo chamber. Never had a bad meal here. Give it a try...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little easy valley spots! Old fashioned diner food made with fresh local meat and produce. The milkshakes are amazing, very thick and creamy! The burgers and sandwhiches are also really good, very good and the portions are generous. You can eat inside or enjoy sitting outside in a picnic table under the trees. Great option for dog lovers who need a bit to eat after letting the dog play in Cosmo Dog Park just down the street!"}
{"text":"Great place on an awesome piece of property! The food was super light and very fresh.  We will make the drive back there from Estrella Mtn. The food was really really good Eating outside was great even in the rain. Love the trees!"}
{"text":"I think I love this place because it's so close to my parents' house. There's nothing this good in Higley that isn't a chain restaurant.   Great food. Great atmosphere. A bit too popular now, but that's a given.   The portobello sandwich and sweet potato fries are my favorites."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is overrated. Food is average for the price. Every time we go here we wish we would've gone somewhere else, but it's close to home and there aren't a lot of non San Tan Mall options in the area. Make the extra five minute drive to downtown Gilbert unless you want to pay a lot for average food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always loved Joe's Farm Grill! We eat here more often than we'd like to admit, but we have always had a great experience. Their sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. This is a great restaurant for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Winter visitors and locals alike enjoy the casual picnic style in/outdoor dining in Agritopia.  It's  Dog and kid friendly. BBQ pulled pork, coleslaw, baked beans prompt me to return. Remember to visit for a birthday meal on your special day - choice of a free breakfast, lunch, or dinner is a friendly gesture. Gets hectic at noon and 5 so avoid lines by visiting mid afternoon. Nearby orchards with free range chickens and gardens with purposeful scarecrows add to the \"farm\" authenticity. Citrus is generally available at the farm stand but the main farmers market is Wednesday."}
{"text":"Great food. The outdoor eating area is dog friendly. Try the shrimp and pulled pork. Been there 15 times and never disappointed. Had lunch there on my wedding day!"}
{"text":"Nice, basic breakfast or lunch spot if you're just dressed casual but want some good food. Lots of patio tables outside to sit at when the Arizona weather is nice. I tried the Fontina Burger which was featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives and I absolutely recommend it! Also the beet salad was fresh and tasty... Great option instead of fries for no additional price. Blueberry cheesecake was realllllly yummy.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good, very busy each time I've gone. Ordering window is impersonal and I felt rushed but the guy that brought our food to our table was kind and asked if we needed anything else before he walked away. Coconut soda is my fave."}
{"text":"I love the beet salad and date milkshakes. Food is really good and love the atmosphere. Tons of outdoor seating under huge trees. Another good place for big groups and or bringing kids."}
{"text":"Always great food and a fun place to go! I always order their garlic fries, they are delicious. I love the little fly exterminator guy they have walking around there."}
{"text":"Simply a great place to eat. Joe's Farm Grill is my favorite local restaurant and I eat here with the family at least a couple of times per month. When it's not too hot out Joe's offers tons of outdoor seating at picnic tables among the trees. The food is fresh with lots of local ingredients, many from the Agritopia Farm just across the street.  I'm a big fan of many of the regular dishes, especially the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. But one of the best things about Joe's Farm Grill are the specials that feature fresh seasonal ingredients. Keep an eye out for real milkshakes with local, fresh fruit.  Joe's Farm Grill is definitely a local favorite and has been featured nationally on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. As a result, the place can get pretty busy but the line usually moves pretty fast.   If you're in the area for a visit, in my book this is the one place in town you've got to eat."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out Joe's Farm grill for some time and just haven't had an opportune moment to do so. I personally enjoy supporting local establishments and so, I was very stoked we finally made it in. I LOVE veggies! I mean, it's apparent at this point through life that I only eat meat when I'm craving it. So, I've tried a whole heck of a lot of veggie burgers and mushroom burgers. I am never quite sure what to expect and though there are a few joints that have a decent \"veggie\" burger many of them never have exactly what I'm looking for. Up until this point there has  been no mushroom burger that I would order again, anywhere... Typically, if I'm paying attention and see the veggie burger is a Portobello burger or Boca burger, I will change my order....Until now.  There is an awesome outdoor seating area and though it was pretty busy, we sat inside, it seemed like a pleasant spot to enjoy a meal. I went with the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich with side beets and a strawberry lemonade. Holy moly! The first bite of my burger was exceedingly impressive. I could tell the mushroom was marinated or something because it was packed full of flavor rather than just a plain bland mushroom on a  bun. The bun itself was obviously fresh and delicious as well. I'm not sure one can go wrong with a side of beets and they were just that, fresh beets. The lemonade was in high demand and that was really the only thing I ended up waiting for.  I would absolutely go back to Joe's. In fact, I look forward to our next meal there and an opportunity to try some other menu items, although, the mushroom sandwich alone would bring me back again. I didn't make it into the bathrooms but from what I've heard it's worth just making a bathroom trip just to check them out."}
{"text":"I had high expectations when I came to Joe's Farm Grill; from the filming of Diners, Drive In & Dives, the near flawless Yelp reviews, recent Fox 10 morning live shoot and the very modern and clean restaurant. I was not disappointed.  When I was looking at the menu while in line out the door I could not decide what to get, everything sounded great. However I chose the BBQ sampler which came with enough BBQ pork to make a big sandwich, two large chicken fingers smothered in BBQ sauce, ribs and coleslaw.  Even with high expectations I was very surprised.  The BBQ pork was very flavorful and juicy, the smothered chicken tenders were still crisp yet smothered in sauce and the chicken was very tender and even the coleslaw was awesome. Small pieces of cabbage and carrot so it's not unwieldy which came in a tasty slightly peppery sauce.  I was stuffed at this point so I took the ribs home. They look great and I look foreword to eating them for lunch today.  I also ordered a pecan caramel shake which is a current special with roasted pecans and homemade caramel sauce, it was top notch as well.  I tried a sip of the chocolate espresso shake which had bits of espresso beans, wow.  This place lives up to the hype and then some.  I love the hand washing station so you can easily wash up before and after as well as the condiment dispensers including what I assume is homemade BBQ sauce. You can also get huge cups of free homemade ranch to go with your meal from the counter.  Don't let a line at the counter deter you from getting a meal at this awesome restaurant. Enjoy the scenery out back and take a walk around agritopia afterwards.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"One of the many great \"Joes\" places to eat. Nothing is bad here. Breakfast lunch and dinner are all great. My all time favorites include the fontina burger, sweet potato fries, and the strawberry shake. Ribs and waffles are also good for breakfast. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised to see the low rating for Joe's Farm Grill. I think dinging a restaraunt because some Mom couldn't control her kids (though I think they were there today as well) is sort of bogus.  Joe's has a retro theme, so the look ends up being misinterpereted by some. The flies are a problem, though I don't know how you get around something like that in an open air setting. I can't remember if the farmhouse at South Mountain had the same issues, probably because I wouldn't go near it in July.  I dropped by for lunch today. My timing wasn't so good, as they were featured on The Food Network last night. We arrived at 11:45, stood on line for about 5 minutes and ordered. The food came out in about 10 minutes. My wife and I split the Ahi Tuna sandwich and the Portabello Mushroom sandwich. I thought both were excellent, though to hear Guy describe them on DD&D, you might have expected a bit more. The kids got the chicken tenders and mini corn dogs, I liked the way they were fried to a light crisp finish. The french fries were excellent.  $37.50 for a lunch for four was a little on the pricey side, but I expect we will be back again. It will definitely be a spot to go to from October through May."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The outdoors is surrounded by mature and eye catching trees and the garden used to supply the restaurant with fresh and organic veggies. :). The food was great, simple breakfast menu items but made wonderfully!  We will return."}
{"text":"Drove 30 minutes to try this place out. Got the fontina burger and BBQ pizza. Really wasn't anything memorable. Was expecting to get the \"wow factor\", but never did. Definitely a place to take kids, seems more like a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"My meal here today gave me food poisoning. Several hours after eating here, I began having terrible diarrhea. It has continued for the last two hours. I have eaten here frequently over the years, BUT I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN.   Don't know what did it. But all Joe's had to say when I reported it just now was 'if you seek medical treatment and a doctor confirms it is food poisoning we will pay your medical bills.\"  Basically calling me a liar and then blowing me off.   Your food gave me diarrhea. It still is, hours later. Your lack of concern for my welfare appalls me. I won't be back. I will tell everyone about your lack of food hygiene and lack of accountability. Starting here.   I would have liked a refund and an apology, but I would have much preferred not getting sick to begin with. I would be happy to return the half of my large lunch which  I took to-go, and was going to eat for dinner, and now don't dare touch. Uggggh."}
{"text":"Great food, descent prices.  Farm fresh and tasty.  We bring the family here one once a week.  It is our new go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and fun place. Great for kids- Outdoor dining is cool even in the summer under trees in lush green yard. They had old TV shows playing in the bathroom- I hadn't seen Fireball XL5 since I was 6...  I bet this is the first review where the bathroom was recommended!  Great breakfasts. Can be crowded at peak times, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get. The food is pretty good. The pizzas are good and so is the breakfast. But $45 for dinner for 3 is crazy at a place where you have to go outside to get your refills.  I reccomend tskingvyour food to go because the whole restaurant is filled with flies and its pretty gross."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast here I get the Meat Scramble and it's great portions and a very great price! It's great on a nice morning when you can eat outside under the shade and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"What an interesting place! We went for breakfast. The ordering process was a little frustrating. Menus by the door. But we put them back in their bin and by the time we ordered I'd forgotten what I wanted and had to go back for a menu as it was not clear at the window. And for breakfast they ONLY had scrambled eggs.  They must just make up a big batch. I had the Huevos Farm Grill which had scrambled eggs, pulled pork, cheese and salsa verde with 3 fried corn tortillas.  It was super yummy. My friend loved her vegetable omelet.  I loved the decor and the bathroom was super cool and futuristic. And the gardens around were good."}
{"text":"OMG we looove this place, super fun atmosphere very family oriented. We love to come and get breakfast here and sit outside and enjoy the farm!  Both inside and outside seating. The lines do get long when rushes occur... but you get through relatively fast. Since the remodel there's more room inside. They don't have regular sodas which for us is a plus, they have ones made with cane sugar.  All the food is delicious! The customer service is fantastic, and it's super clean! The prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"So, I do love this place.  I can't seem to branch away from the fried zukes and Fontina burger (the pecan pesto is to die for)  but once and a while I will be swayed into getting the BBQ chicken pizza or the thai chicken salad.  My only gripes are that sometimes the line is ridiculously long..so go on off peak meal hours and whenever I go there for dinner children are always running around like a bunch of wild banshees (maybe their parents tricked them into thinking this was a chucky cheese).."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Gilbert. Every time I have someone visiting from out of town I bring them here. The ingredients are fresh and locally grown (either by the restaurant themselves or local farmers), it's super clean and very family friendly. Fast service. And just an overall great experience. Don't let the long line fool you - it will move super fast.  Their burgers are just amazing and so are their salads. And if you haven't tried their breakfast yet you're missing out. Don't even get me started on their fresh squeezed lemonade and orange juice.  I love that they do a free burger day every year in the fall to celebrate their anniversary. Don't let the line around the building intimidate you. It goes SUPER fast. We got through the whole line AND ate our food in less than an hour. Highly efficient. Brilliant business.  You gotta try this place. Bring the whole family! Enjoy the fresh air and beautiful AZ sunshine in the process."}
{"text":"I hate leaving this review because this was our favorite place prior to the remodel. After last nights meal, we are left feeling extremely disappointed. This is unfortunately another example of a great restaurant that decided to expand and go from pick up at the counter to plates and waiters. In doing so they've really let the quality of the food slip to an unrecognizable point. Parts of the order were left out, all our sandwiches were cold in the middle and side items were soggy. This is far from what we've gotten here in the past. I am actually pretty hurt by this because, again, we loved this place including the relaxed ambiance and basket style outstanding food that we came to know. I really hope they go back to focusing on the food and not waitstaff."}
{"text":"Food Network's DDD features lots of AZ businesses. This is one that the bf found, and thought would suit my tastes. He was correct. Apparently they grow their own veggies and then use them. YUM! We are the onion rings, which were super crunchy and flavorful. I loved them. We also had a GINORMOUS vanilla bean cream puff. Someone asked the bf along the way if it was a baked potato. Yes, that is how huge it was! It was decent, the home made fudge was excellent- I would pack that away in my suitcase :) BF tried the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, which had huge chunks of Ahi in it. Apparently, it was quite tasty by the rate at which it was consumed.   The overall atmosphere was amazing, very chill, with a nice picnic layout. I can see how it could get really crowded since the space is quite small. It's worth it! :)"}
{"text":"I've only ordered their hamburger & fries.Because it is the best burger that I have had anywhere!Crispy on the outside and yet succulent within."}
{"text":"Went to Joe's for the second time today. This time I tried their special of the day that was a Gouda garlic burger. It was huge, greasy, and flavorful. I got the garlic fries this time and they were the bomb dot com. If you love garlic you must get them. Last time I went I got the Ahi sandwich and I loved it even more than the burger.  Go there now to eat all the yummy food."}
{"text":"I kept seeing all the pictures of meals Joe's Farm Grill posts on Instagram. Yesterday I saw their BLT egg scramble and knew that is what I wanted for my breakfast birthday. We ordered and went to sit out on a picnic table waiting for our meal enjoying our hot coffee. My BLT scramble was so good. Fresh spinach, avocado, tomatoes, and Feta cheese. The skillet potatoes  were done perfectly. My husband got the Huevos and I was lucky to sneak a bite. We took home some freshly fried apple fritters for my daughter. Nice large portions on everything. Thanks for the wonderful birthday treat! Can't wait to come back for dinner, specially with the weather being so cool in May and being able to eat outside."}
{"text":"Me and the family went here and had lunch. It was great, I had the burger Guy had it was good. Would definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Good spot. My burger was a little undercooked though. Probably not safe but it was salty and tasty so I ate it anyway. :-)"}
{"text":"A place everyone needs to try! If you feel like a great American joint, then this is your destination. The wife and I have been poking and prodding through the menu, from the burgers to the pizzas to the hot dogs to the sandwiches to the salads and yes, all is good here! My favorite thou, their Date Shake. They only make it for a limited time while its in season but it is one of the best Date Shakes you will ever have!"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular dining locations and when family or friends visit, this is the first place we take them.  The food is made with quality in mind and always taste great.  They are very creative and inventive with the menu choices and have occasional specials (various hot dogs during the \"dog days\" of the year - and fish on Friday's during lent times).  They use locally grown foods, as much as possible.  That means fresher foods with no preservatives.  I like the Ahi Tuna, BBQ pulled pork, and baby back ribs best.  The restrooms are cools too."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, but wish we came here for lunch since I'm more of a lunch person.  Anyway.  The best dish was definitely the belgium waffles & strawberries!  I also tried the farm huevos which was scrambled eggs mixed with salsa and ham with a side of beans (not a big fan of beans).  It came with tortilla chips which I liked, but the eggs itself were simply okay.  However, I did love the decor!  The place is literally on a farm.  We sat outside near the big tree (beautiful) and had a nice view while eating.  Don't forget to use their restrooms. It's pretty cool (I know, weird to write a review about restrooms) because it looks like a spaceship inside.  You'll see a flatscreen tv with a puppet space movie playing, and barbie dolls in space capsules in the walls.  Yup."}
{"text":"One of the best and freshest places to eat in Gilbert. I love getting that Fontina Burger"}
{"text":"Really good food at a great price! If your in the Gilbert area stop by! It's awesome you get to eat outside. Don't recommend going middle of the day in July tho. Too hot out"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I am from NY but visit family in AZ often.  I have to make a stop here every time I visit.  I absolutely love their selection of foods.  Everything always tastes so fresh and delicious.   In the past I used to constantly order the \"Buffalo Chicken Sandwich\" which is absolute heaven, blue cheese and hot wing sauce so tasty and not annoyingly spicy and the chicken was juicy not dry.   Get napkins for this one    I recently switched back to being a vegetarian so this past visit I ordered the \"Portobello Mushroom Sandwich\" and it was really tasty, very juicy.   Get more napkins for this one too!     They seem to really know how to marry flavors together well and make fresh tasting, juicy, delicious food.  I also always get their garlic fries which are a dream if you love garlic as much as I do, their sweet potato fries are also delicious.    I took of one star just because the indoor seating area has a lot of flies, it seems it's just due to the environment of it being a farm with lots of fruit trees so I think they just make their way towards the food indoors.. It's not from uncleanliness because the place is clean.  But I feel they can correct this buy installing some kind of anti-fly system.     This includes the bathroom which has the \"Thunderbirds\" show on tv for some reason with collectible dolls in the walls!  So to sum up, I absolutely will not visit AZ without stopping here! the food is too good!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food but.... 1. The wait. It's equivalent to waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland. There were 40 plus people in line with one cashier at 6:00pm. The line went out the door. A man who appeared to be the manager roamed around. At one time I thought he was going to open the second cash register but sadly no. We were stuck in the line.  2. While waiting in line we had a great view of the workers in the food prep area and noticed one guy using a point of a knife to touch a touch screen. Yes that's right...a tool he was using on food prep area was also being used on a touch pad against the window.  3. The person who appeared to be the manager had a full beard and didn't have a food net on.  I am not fully aware of food handling regulations in Arizona. Maybe all of this is okay. It doesn't get an \"A\" rating in my book just from what I've observed."}
{"text":"When I moved to Gilbert a year ago, I was so excited to see a nationally famous restaurant right down the street. Well after building it up in my head for months, I finally got the chance to go.  And it was.... okay.  I'll make this short: The food was okay, the service is fairly non-existent (because of the counter-style eating, which is fine). The atmosphere does save it a little bit though, because dinning underneath the beautiful trees and plants that gave your food substance is pretty cool anywhere.  The place seems a little over-blown to me, and when I ordered my food over the phone the nice lady said there would be a 2 hour wait (which is just crazy, but I really wanted to try it anyway). When I got there and picked up my food, it was cold and soggy like it had been there a while, even though I was early. So on one hand the wait time wasn't as ridiculous as they stated, but on the other hand my food was room-temp. Maybe if they notice an order hasn't been picked up for 15 minutes they could call? I don't know, I'm sure there's a solution.  I will be eating here again, it just probably wont be every Sunday if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"UNIQUE/fun/tasty place.  We were visiting Scottsdale and took a minor detour to check this place out after we arrived at Mesa Airport.  Atmosphere/service: 5/5 This place is basically in farm country, with a community garden you should definitely check out behind it and farmer \"joe\" on the tractor giving us a big smile and wave in 90 degree heat in a button up cotton shirt driving by on his farm which is adjacent to the community garden.  This restaurant is one of a kind.  It's an old building redone in a modern fashion with \"gardens\" and huge trees surrounding it with a ton of picnic tables for you to take your grub outside and chill.  Check out the bathrooms, they are ridiculous with old school movies playing on the tv above the urinal amongst other things. Crowds were large but the lines moved fast, they have their logistics down.  Food 4/5 We ordered the BBQ plate which was out of this world.  amazing rubs and bbq they use was delicious.  Their famous onion rings were somewhat of a let down, they were good but fell short of expectations (especially being featured on the food network).  We also had their coleslaw which was  5/5 and then their beet/bluecheese salad which was also very good. We also had their chocolate milkshake and added peanut butter which was redonk-good.  So many bomb sounding things on this menu I could go back 5 times and still not try everything I wanted to.  I'm into sauces too and once you get your food you can go over to the fountain drink station and there is literally 10 awesome sauces you can choose from.  This food certainly won't disappoint, it could have been 5/5 easily but I have to stick with 4/5 because its not mind blowing, just solid good and was enjoyable.  Next time im in AZ, I'm going back FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"I went here back when I still ate meat. The chicken was delicious and cooked just right. The salad was fresh and interesting. I consider myself a very picky eater, and everything was just right here. The french fries were delicious and crisp.  The prices were good for this type of place.  My friend ordered a burger and fries and also enjoyed her meal.   I love the atmosphere here. It feels like we're not in Arizona, and that is always a nice thing.  I like how it's counter service, so no waiter is trying to rush us out of there.   I would go here more often except that I live in Phoenix now."}
{"text":"A tad pricey but the food is really good. So I love it on occasions. I do get that if they dropped the prices they would be mobbed daily and be way understaffed. A must for foodies and if you just don't care what's in your food this place might ruin you because the quality is so good you will start caring."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious & fresh!! I ordered the farm burger with a side Caesar salad, my hubby ordered the bbq ribs with a side of fries & onion rings. For drinks, we ordered a strawberry lemonade & a strawberry milkshake. Everything is made with fresh ingredients. The pricing is not bad either. I want to go back already!! The area is very nice as well. We took a stroll through the community garden afterwards. Awesome place!!!"}
{"text":"Amaxing service amazing food. When I first moved to arizona this is one of the places my now fiance took me. I had lots of questions which were all answered by my friendly cashier. We had a two hot dog combo with fries and an extra order or fries. Only thing they messed up on was I wanted garlic fries for the extra fries and got regular. Oh well. Drink selection was excellent and food was fantastic.  Total price came to around 13 dollars and some change. That was for two drinks and a combo meal.  The atmosphere is amazing. There's a huge tree and a picnic table. Kid friendly so bring your kids. It's also animal friendly.  Farm is right next door and it's actually a farm where the resturant gets some of its food from. Incredible amazing lovely.  5 stars for this beautiful place."}
{"text":"Great and greasy! The food is good as long as you aren't on a diet. The cattle call line is somewhat more acceptable here at a burger joint than at his other two places.   I have found it very crowded at times so be careful when you choose to show up. Love the Salt Cedar trees in the outside eating area."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Living in ahwatukee it was never quite convenient since I was in Gilbert on a Friday at lunch I knew there'd be a line, and there was... so expect to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes before you actually get your food. Is it worth 30 or 40 minutes? yes! Friendly, helpful service. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was smoky, tangy and sweet--deelish!"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot! Great building/architecture tucked into a fruit orchard with the garden out back, love it! The food rocked, the service was friendly and efficient. I also dig the open/windowed kitchen, a foodie's dream! If you live close go eat at Joe's tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Spent both Saturday and Sunday there. All self serve but it works and the food is fresh and the veggies are grown onsite. Veggie pizza was pretty amazing but the fontina burger left me craving yet another visit!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots of all time. Arizona outdoor eating does not get any better. Great place for a quiet breakfast, great spot for families with kids or dogs, great place to meet people.   Joe's Farm Grill violates some of my food rules; 1) NEVER order a burger made of anything but cow. Joe's Ahi tuna burger is amazing (I AM NOT KIDDING).   2) ONLY order pizza at a restaurant that specializes in pizza. At Joe's they grill the crust and then cover with BBQ sauce, chicken and bacon. Delicious.  Also must try: fried shrimp dinner, apple fritters (breakfast), cream puff with chocolate sauce for desert."}
{"text":"I guess I need to try breakfast. Lunch didn't make a lasting impression. It wasn't bad but the hype made my expectations higher. I will say I was impressed with free burgers on customer appreciation day. WOW !"}
{"text":"Great family place-good food at a fair price. You have a choice-outside in good weather or inside in the AC when it's hot.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the Gilbert area! It's set up with outdoor seating and indoor seating! Beware of the birds though...they are everywhere. Been here a few times and enjoyed the chicken pesto sandwich with pepper jack cheese with a side of the fried green beans! The veggie burger is also a favorite with pepperjack cheese as well and a side of garlic fries. The zucchini slices are good too but i prefer ranch to the marinara dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, but I have to be in a patient mood to eat there.  The lines  are always so incredibly long, but that's just a testament to its tastiness.  I usually get the salmon, which comes with multiple sides.  The piece of salmon is so large and there are so many sides that I can never eat more than half of the meal.  The burgers here are amazing, and who can deny the amazingness of the BBQ?  It's the same stuff as Joe's Real BBQ, so if the line at one place is too long, go to the other one!   I love the air powered condiment dispensers and apparently the bathroom décor has been listed in top ten restaurant bathroom lists before. (If the décor of the bathroom at a restaurant is actually important to you!)  Come at off-peak hours for fast service and ample eating space."}
{"text":"Really great fresh grilled food. I went with a group of 5 people, and we were able to all get different things that we like.. from burgers to pizza to fish and salad. Everyone  loved their meals. I'm usually a salad fan. First time I got the Thai Ahi salad and it was really good. The second time I got the salmon Caesar salad and it was incredible. So delicious!   It's a relaxed atmosphere. You wait in line to order the food and then find seating either inside or outside while waiting for your food. *If you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait in a long line. Week days are still a small wait, but weekends seem to get a bit crowded. (but it's probably crowded for a reason)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It gets pretty busy after 6 most nights, if you can get there before then you can beat the rush.  I have had the pizza, regular burger, ahi tuna sandwich, the bbq pork.  Can't really go wrong with most things here.  I want to try out their breakfast menu sometime.  Definitely check this place out, worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices.  One thing to keep in mind: their babyback ribs sell QUICK so don't be surprised if they are out.  Otherwise the pulled pork and BBQ chicken was very good. P.S. Watch out for the hiding Sentret."}
{"text":"The food here is SO good. They have a lot of choices and it is nice that they have some healthier options as well. Not that I took advantage of them, but my sister in law did. She just ate chicken and asparagus. It can get expensive. I was a little bit bummed when she asked me if regular fries were ok or if I wanted something else. She made it sound like I had choices of what kind of side I wanted, then found that I was charged extra for onion rings. The food we got was delicious and filling, and my wife got a $10 credit because we went for lunch on her birthday. The atmosphere there is cool. The weather was nice so we ate outside, but they do have indoor seating as well. It stands alone so there is nice surroundings and big trees to look at while you are eating. The line is always pretty long when I go, but usually moves pretty quick."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been here for brunch and lunch, and the food is always really good and really fresh. Most recently, I had waffles and bacon. So. Good.   The location and ambiance are also great. I like to think of it as the quintessential Gilbert restaurant: family friendly, with that farm atmosphere. There's plenty of outdoor seating, and it feels like you're eating at the park or in someone's spacious backyard. Across the street there are some community gardens that I recommend strolling through."}
{"text":"It's seems very time one of my favorite places is featured on DDD the food takes a nose dive. That is what happened here. When this placed first open the food was absolutely fantastic. Farm to table who could not ask for anything fresher.  We celebrated birthday dinners, BFF lunches and most importantly let's support Gilbert!   My last visit not so great. How do you mess up a salad. I don't know nor can I explain. Garlic fries soggy and sweet potato fries cooked so hard that I had to take them to management. Of course replaced but with some attitude. Unfortunately I had friends with me from out town who just had to go here. At the end of the meal all I could say was I told you so!  So you ask why 3 stars because this place can get its swag back with something called consistency. That's the Farm Grill I knew and loved!"}
{"text":"Love the Farm Grill. Always fresh and tastes great. The only issue for me is waiting in line and going back up to get the food. I am disabled so it makes it challenging, but they always have staff that are helpful if I am not there with family or friends. Yes, I go there alone because it is very good and I love looking at the huge trees and wishing I could have climbed them as a kid."}
{"text":"Love this place and their food! A friend of mine lives out here and they swore I'd love it! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We so love eating here. When we first moved to Gilbert Arizona from Hawaii, this is one of the very first restaurant we ate at. Delicious!!! The servers are friendly and the prices are great for what you order. We've lived in Gilbert going on 11yrs now and Joe's Farm Gill never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the years and have always loved it. Last night was my first time in since the remodel. I miss the old Joe's :( maybe I just don't like change, but I feel like the old Joe's just worked better, I honestly feel like it would be more cramped during a rush if people are getting their sodas right near the pick up window. I didn't really like the new table set up either, maybe I'm the only one who enjoyed getting my own condiments from the pumps, but it felt like I was having a picnic every time. Now all the condiments are in a tray on each table and the utensils are in one of those metal shake cups - I just imagine little kids licking all the utensils and putting them back in. Yuck. As for food, I received a pager like usual, and then someone brought my food to my table. Weird. I miss the baskets and I feel like the fries could have used another couple of minutes cooking, they were cold and limp. I ordered the fontina burger with no bun which was tasty but I remember it being better before, maybe I just have a sour taste now. I'm not sure if prices went up but my friend ordered the new Gouda stack burger and upgraded to garlic fries and a soda and his total was $20. Yikes."}
{"text":"This place is great. My fiancé took me here for my first time about a week ago and it is now my favorite place to eat. It a little expensive but well worth it. I got the Farm Burger and that burger was 10x better than any burger at Red Robins and that's saying something! Super great place for children"}
{"text":"Salmon Cesar salad was fresh. The salmon was flaky and delicious. Yet the salad could have had more tang/zest. The salad dressing could have been thicker.   Ambiance is good for adults, children, people watching. The big tree in back is an amazing site. All food that folks had smelled good, as we found our table outside.   Even though most dishes are served on  plastic containers that are recyclable and drinks are served in recyclable containers, there was NO recycling on site. So sad. Star deduction for that."}
{"text":"First timer had breakfast. A little pricey but the food was very good and atmosphere was unique (in a good way).   We were there just before lunch started so it wasn't busy at all. The only disappointment was the young robotic staff. A genuine smile and \"good morning\" would go a long way to making this a special place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. Food is fresh and delicious! Great for the whole family! The kids have a great time. Out of town guests love it. Picnic tables outside are great as long as it's not too hot."}
{"text":"What a cool place!!! I've wanted to eat here for years and finally did. I was hopeful that the food would be great as I thought it was a little pricy. Everything we tried was delicious and had so much flavor. My son said his pepperoni pizza was the best he's eaten in awhile. My husband and I shared a bbq chicken salad and gouda garlic bacon burger, they were soooo good. Such good service too, very nice people that work there. Wish we would have had more time to stay and enjoy it more, we'll have to come back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Joe's many times over the last few years. As such I sometimes get a hankering for their rings and the 4B burger. The Farm has such a cool vibe so do eat there and enjoy the food fresh off the grill. I have gotten food to go and it is just not the same. Long live Joe's!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is very different from the original Joe's Restaurant, \"Joe's Real BBQ.\"  For one thing, the decor is more modern, with a family bent.    This restaurant is situated on a real farm.  Well it used to be a lot bigger. There are fields and gardens in the back.  There's a huge grassy area with lots of trees, benches and shady spots so families can bring their kids and let them run and play while they eat.   Families with young kids seem to enjoy it here.  I ordered the Fontina Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  Note the burger runs about $7.99 and includes fries.  To get Sweet potato, you need to pay a $2.00 upgrade fee.  The burger was huge- 1/3 pound!  It was not a shriveled, dry, meat patty that you would find somewhere else. Definitely low fat content, moist and flavorful.  I loved the veggies on top, grilled mushrooms, roasted red peppers, homemade pesto, and fresh greens.  And the cheese was just the right flavor for the veggies.  I also added a multi grain bun which was just right.  Of course the sweet potato fries were awesome.  They came with a pineapple-serrano dipping sauce which was not needed.  These fries have enough flavor on their own.  Fresh food, fresh taste, homemade goodness!  Try Joe's Farm Grill!  Oh by the way, follow them on Twitter! @joesfarmgrill.  I found out too late that they were offering a free fry upgrade that night for their followers.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is about pricey but I enjoy all menu items. Outside  ambiance is pleasant with searing underneath the large salt cedar trees or under misters. Inside is often packed but is in air-conditioning. Drinks and condiments are outside and easily accessible. The bathrooms are a hoot. I recommend them to others. Love the action figures and tv show playing.  As for the food I love the pesto chicken. They offer gluten free buns and are rather tasty. Sweet potato fries are a bit on the sweet side. But with a side or ranch it doesn't matter. My husband gets the fontina burger, tasty as always. I love the banana, peanut butter, pineapple, chocolate chip Sammy. It's so unique.   Other menu items are tasty but these above are our go to. We like what this restaurant stands for: local food where possible. And also take a walk through the gardens out back."}
{"text":"Fantastic. We live in North Phoenix and made a trip down for the day.  Beautiful location - the photos really don't do the venue and surrounding area justice. Great grounds and shaded seating for enjoying the outdoors before the valley hits triple digits. Lots of space for little ones to run and play before and after food.  The food was wonderful. We shared the Apple Fritters, Meat Scramble alongside Pancakes with Berries. A complete hit with our family.  If only it wasn't quite so far for us to come, we would be here every week!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding.  Fun place to look around and experience the area.  Lots to look and in a great indoor/outdoor setting.  The food is worth it, just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast! We walk around the area after and make it a fun little morning! Foods super good and big portions!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for fresh real food! Every time I come here, I always get the same thing because it's my favorite salad ever. I get the grilled portabella mushroom farm salad...and usually with a side of sweet potato fries. The salad is full of all different textures and flavors that blend well together to make such a delicious salad! Being a BIG fan of sweet potato fries, they by FAR have some of the best! You know when somewhere is absolutely fantastic when you regularly crave their food!"}
{"text":"Great food, creative style, good prices, very fun place to dine!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is amazing and love the set up of the restaurant. It never ceases to please my wife and I. It is indeed pricey but definitely worth it. Presentation of their dishes are appetizing and the restaurant is clean. Overall the meals are fresh but don't think it's healthy (if your that individual who cares). There are healthy meals the offer, salads mainly but don't pass up on their sandwiches or burgers. Their menu is very diverse for your taste and I'm trying to get thru the entire menu but I keep getting stuck on their BBQ Blue Cheese Burger or their Pesto Chicken Sandwich because it's SO GOOD! I have yet to try their breakfast but without a doubt, I won't be surprised it's good as their lunch and dinner menu.  If your in the area. Go here!"}
{"text":"I have never had such delightful burgers. I fell in love with their Fontina Burger and Gouda Burger. There is no word in existence that can describe the excellent quality of the meats, vegetables and buns they serve. They grow their own fresh vegetables and make their own famous BBQ sauce. I enjoy their garlic fries and chocolate milkshake as well. I'm not a fan of milkshake but their version has a great texture and taste. Their outdoor eating area creates a picnic-like environment which I have never seen before in Arizona. There is so much good things I can say about this place but it is better if you experience it yourself! If you have not tried this place, you must try it at least once in your lifetime!!!  I have been here over 15 times and not a single thing that I can disapprove. Definitely common food done uncommonly well!!!  TIP: You get 10$ off on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Never had been here, came across it looking at restaurants that had been aired on Diners, Dive-Ins, & Dives. The land was beautiful and well put together. The food was amazing and so fresh. Employees were happy and friendly. Definitely will be returning for not only the restaurant but the Farmers Market."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars... Nothing overly wrong with Joe's Farm Grill, but nothing special either.   I've had lots of people recommend Joe's, so I was looking forward to my first trip out to Mesa to have breakfast with my sons there. My first issue was simply that I went in the middle of summer, and at 8:15 it was already hot out, and all the inside tables were taken. By the time we got our food and ate it, i was more focused on finishing and getting out of the heat, than enjoying my breakfast. None of this is really Joe's fault, but if you haven't been there, you should be warned that the majority of the seating is outdoors.   Secondly, I wasn't really able to enjoy my meal anyway, because of the many flies swarming around our heads and plates. I was constantly shaking them off me and trying to sweep them away from my kids' food. Again, I get it... It's a farm atmosphere, it's outdoors... But be aware if that kind of thing isn't your thing.   As for the food, it was nothing nearly as memorable as the fly situation.   Steve had the kid's eggs and bacon. A couple of eggs scrambled (I wasn't given an option to get them any other way) and thin cut bacon served in a paper French fry tray. The eggs were a little over cooked and \"tight\"' so they were sitting in a small pool of egg water. The bacon was closer to under-cooked and flaccid. The eggs were seasoned and didn't taste bad. The bacon is described as \"Apple cider smoked\", but it didn't taste any different than mid-grade supermarket bacon.   Sam had the waffle and fruit. Right off the bat, it looked the most appealing. A malty, Belgian-style waffle with about a half cup of ripe berries and some whipped cream. No complaints, but nothing magic either. It's not hard to make a waffle, and a bit pricey for what you get at $7 bucks.   I had the Breakfast Burger. It's an average sized, somewhat thin, griddled burger with one over-easy egg (again, I was not asked how I would like it cooked), two slices of the same bacon, and cheese. It was served with lettuce, tomato and pickles, which I didn't use, and a choice of breakfast sides. I asked for Farm Beans, and got breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are  a small portion of those factory sanded, pre-cooked potato cubes, and perhaps my biggest disappointment. When I read \"Farm Grill\", I think skillet made home fries, not Aramark fast food. At $10 bucks, definitely not a solid value.   Again, for those who haven't been there, the food is ordered fast food-style at a window, and you're given a pager to notify you when it's ready. It's not served fast food-style other than the paper plates and plastic-ware, because it took 21 minutes for the pager to buzz.   Overall, it's mediocre breakfast fare, somewhat over priced for what you get (a few pennies under $40 for two kids sized portions and one adult), served in what could be a nice atmosphere if it weren't for the heat and the flies.   It seems like the place might have potential, and it's gotten generally good reviews, so if I happen to be out on the east side on a cooler spring or fall day, I might be tempted to give Joe's a second chance."}
{"text":"My wife  liked her chicken pesto sandwich and garlic fries. I got the BBQ pork platter. Below average taste and flavor, fries were meh, salad was the worst i ever tasted and the ranch tasted like it had been left in the sun. And on that note when someone orders a salad with ranch why do I have to ask for it? Employees too lazy to put it on themselves? The ambience is nice, food is overpriced. Overall I'll stick to the Joes BBQ"}
{"text":"I had the Ahi Tuna sandwich - it is amazing! Generous portion of tuna, sesame, coleslaw, on a fresh baked bun with a side of hot crispy fries. At 13.99, it's a pretty good value for the amazing taste and portion"}
{"text":"Simple, fresh food. Gorgeous soroununding,  good service. Very laid back. Lovely.. A nice place to go for lunch"}
{"text":"Great place. Fresh food, nice atmosphere, just walking distance from my house. Menu is inventive."}
{"text":"Always good and predictable with a diverse menu. Nice family atmosphere. Really great outdoor or indoor seating.  Pretty much a standard once a week place for our family."}
{"text":"I got the seasonal Gouda garlic bacon burger and it was stellar. Tons of great fresh items on there including grilled onions and whole garlic cloves. 1/2 pound burger filled me up with that great bacon! All in all a perfect visit with the family and great food. Love the fries. No complaints from this trip and our group had everything from chicken, burgers, salads to pizza. They got it all."}
{"text":"We go often, great family place and solid burgers/fries. We are lucky to live so close to this outdoor eating venue--inside is just ok, dont go and sit inside!"}
{"text":"Love their atmosphere, with the seating indoors or out. Lots of tables and huge shade trees. Misters for this hot summer days. Heated for the cool winter nights. Friendly and helpful staff. Superb customer service. Food is AMAZING! I always want to try something new but end up ordering my favorite: BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. My husband has tried something different each time we go, and he's never been disappointed. Fresh ingredients, delicious flavor. Shakes are delicious as well, and they have different flavor a depending on the season too. JFG never disappoints! *They also give you a birthday discount of $10 on your bday when you show ID. Check them out!!"}
{"text":"If I had to give stars on food alone no doubt it would of been a 5 star!  However. . . .  We must of went during stay at home/home schooling mommy child time.  Omg the noise and chaos! We decided to enjoy the nice outdoor eating area since it was calmer.  BUT that was no way an enjoyable moment.  I've never seen so many flies at an eating establishment!  And I do mean NEVER!  I am amazed at all the great reviews and no concern for the flies outside and inside this place.  GROSS.  Aren't flies a health concern for anyone?!  Also the inside was pretty dirty. I expect there to be insects when you sit outside but not swarms and swarms. We tried going back inside to the noise but still couldn't escape the flies."}
{"text":"great spot for a quick bite to eat if in the area. love that there was outside seating however we were attacked by flys once the food came out :/ had the burger which was great, and they were out of the ribs so the hubby got the shrimp which were amazing and pulled pork. our toddler got the chicken and fries which was also delicious. we went with my mom and brother and pretty much everything we all got was delicious. wish they weren't so far but the hubby goes there for lunch at times since he works in the area"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is charming.  The outside setting is awesome....picnic tables everywhere and seating inside as well.  Although I felt like I was in school waiting in the cafeteria line to order my food, it took a little while to get my order in but the food was worth the wait.  The menu options are great from burgers to grilled pizza's and awesome salads I was very impressed and had a hard time choosing what to get.  I chose the farmer because while waiting in line saw so many go by....I couldn't help myself.  I was thinking salad, salad, salad.  The farmer burger was delicious!    Please note they do not serve beer or wine or they would get a 5 star rating.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"\"Ordinary food done extraordinarily well\" or something like that, is their motto, and you can take that to the bank.  Joe's Farm Grill is pretty inconveniently located for me (I am in north Phoenix, Joe's is in southeast Gilbert) but every so often...it's worth the trip.  Joe's angle is that it literally is a farm, and much of what they serve is apparently raised on that farm. This translates into basic diner faire of outstanding quality.  Their burgers and fries are out of this world, and their onion rings are possibly the best I have ever had. Homemade cheesecake, lemonade, pizza, all kinds of things on their menu that you would see anywhere but much better than everywhere else.  The location is very clean, and if the weather is nice, their outdoor seating is gorgeous. Even their bathrooms are something to admire (you'll see what I mean)  I don't get out in that area much, but when I do, I always try to get out to Joe's. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Simply good food done well!   Had the burger, ribs and  chocolate shake.  It was very good and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and just go here now. Wedge salad and a large order of fried zucchini"}
{"text":"Foods great and the ambience is refreshing. Literally the outside tables under the huge shade trees is so nice.  My family has tried many items from the menu and they have all been good.  And, they serve Joes BBQ which is the best in the country."}
{"text":"I judge a place by their food, definitely, but even more by how they handle their mistakes.  They recently did a to go order for me, and by the time I got home (far) I found they got my order very wrong. Called them up, and they quickly offered either a full refund or gift card. No questions asked, just the credit, an apology, and an invite to come back.  I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Joes Farm Grill with the entire family tonight. Great food! Everyone liked what they ordered. The only thing that was a problem was the hour and 1/2 we spent in line waiting to order. Great place on the weekend if you have a ton of time. If not, then try another place."}
{"text":"Our family spends every birthday and special occasion here and the food is always delicious!  Thank you for consistently being a family favorite and never disappointing.   Kids menu is a hit, food is always fresh and exceeds our expectations.  We typically end up with plenty of leftovers to enjoy the next day."}
{"text":"Very cool place, lots of outside tables, actual working farm, coffee shop. Just really cool.  Farm to table at it's best.  Also, the burgers are delicious and top notch.  I highly recommend.."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Gilbert.  Period.  If you have kids there is no where else better."}
{"text":"A great local hang out for b-fast / lunch as well as a good place to take your tourist friends.  It was showcased on the show \"dives, diners, & drive-ins\".  All the food is GROWN on site. The combo of foods is spectacular.  Read the previous reviews to get the details.  I LOVED it."}
{"text":"This place was delicious definitely didn't disappoint, so many options from Burger to chicken to pizza and salads. We got the Sriracha chicken burger, bacon blue cheese burger and the special of the day which was a peanut bacon burger, all were fantastic and so yummy, burgers cooked to perfection And everything was so fresh the pricing wasn't to bad either definitely not for the quality you got. Lots of outdoor seating not much indoor"}
{"text":"Love this place. I got their Ahi Tuna Burger and an order of Sweet Potato Fries. Both were amazing! The Ahi Tuna Burger had a nice peppery taste and not at all fishy. The bun was amazing too. The Sweet Potato Fries with the Pineapple dipping sauce were kind of spicy and sweet at the same time. I will definitely be back! Simply Amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a mixed, but overall positive experience here. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and was enjoying the tuna and the slight tang of the wasabi sauce they used on it, but as I was nearing the middle of my burger, there was a mess of tuna tendon. I casually let the girl at the window know and she immediately put in an order to have another ahi tuna burger made for me. I had no problem with the second burger and it was delicious.  I love the atmosphere of this place and the mist they sprinkle really cools you down in the Arizona sun."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is always amazing! Their fresh lemonade is so refreshing! This is our go to spot when we have friends or family in town."}
{"text":"Just a little update. My husband and I ate breakfast here the other day. The line to order wasn't too long, but I have heard it can be out the door some mornings. I ordered the smoked salmon omellet with a side of fruit. The omellet was stuffed an a massive amount of cream cheese and minimal salmon. I found the salmon to be salty and there was simply too much cream cheese that I had to scrap off a big chunk. The fruit was good and fresh. I do enjoy eating outdoors when I come to Joe's, but I find myself trying to get away from bugs and making sure none fall in my food, so I may have to stick to eating inside. I'll still keep the four stars as I do enjoy dinner and the service has always been friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Consistently the best meal. The sandwiches are delicious. The burgers are fantastic. And I love the BBQ chicken flat bread pizza.   Every time I eat here I wish I came more often.   Excellent food. Fair prices"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and environment is fun. You will have to wait a long time in the line but it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for Triple D (Diners, Drive-ins and Dives), I wouldn't have visited this place when I went to go see rent at ASU.  However, this was probably one of my favorite parts of the excursion.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich for myself and accidentally ordered the Ahi Salad for my friend who hates fish.  She ate every last bite of her meal. The sandwich was just as wonderful, but I could always use a little more kick from the wasabi (being the heat junky that I am).  We also ordered the veggie pizza which I was lucky to get a slice of since the table devoured (with good reason) before I had my chance to attack.  We ordered all the different fries they have. Sweet Potato and the Garlic were my favorite.  However, you have to eat the Garlic when it's fresh, since the oil gives the fries a slightly rancid taste if it sits too long.  Finally, I had to have desert (although I don't know where I found the room for it), a chocolate shake.  It was your typical shake, but with the temperature in Arizona, it did wonders to cool me down.   When we were done, we looked at the farmers market and the houses in Agritopia.  I have to say these people have one of the best places to live.  Although I don't like the sun too much, I could easily be convinced to become an Arizonan for this!"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing some positive reviews, reading Yelp reviews, and viewing the Diners, Drive-Ins and Drives segment.    It is indeed a \"Farm to Table\" experience in Gilbert.  Very nice area, and a very neat, well kept farm.  At least you know where the majority of what you're about to eat came from.  This part of the Phoenix metro area was all agricultural at one point.  As the borders of the city expanded, farmland got bought out and became residential areas.  There are small areas still located within these cities that are farmed, and this is one of them.  My wife and I had the special \"Double Swiss Mushroom Dijon Farm Burger\".  It's not on their regular menu and we thought we'd give it a try.  It was a decent burger, but not the best I've ever had.  Needed a little salt.  Can't say it was bad.  We had the onion rings, which is in their specially herbed Panko bread crumbs.  It was fair, but not particularly flavorful.  The fresh lemonade was a very good, tart lemonade.  I had the date shake.  Good, thick shake, but I tasted mostly vanilla--didn't get a whole lot of date flavor.  It was Sunday at noon, so it was a good crowd.  We only had to wait 30 minutes though.  I have to say a good farm to table experience, and I'm glad the food is very fresh.  Service was just table busing.  You order your food at a window, sit at your table, and pick up once your buzzer goes off.  I was hoping for more in terms of flavor though."}
{"text":"My family decided to try this restaurant on a whim and, for the most part, had a good time.  We happen to have come during their celebration of 10 years of serving food here in \"Agritopia\" and it was packed. I waited quite some time in line while my family found a table in the old dining room.    I was able to place my order and specified that I wanted no veggies with my burger.  The food came out rather quickly (maybe 7 minutes). However, they kept the veggie stack off (good) but left the pickles on (boo).   Overall, the shakes were delicious, my burger was just okay, and my family enjoyed their lunch and atmosphere.  I felt that spending the extra $2.50 for a tablespoon of sourcream, some bacon bits, and a butt-load of chives was a bit of a rip, and my three meals (2 adults and 1 child) came out to $29 and change (they were giving everyone 10% off their entire bill).  I will probably be back with my family at another time (this week seems extra busy here).  Just know that this place is a little overpriced IMHO but can be worth it if you want a change of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yum!  We came here on a Sunday and returned on a Tuesday. Enjoyed the Gouda Garlic burger and sweet potato fries with a side of onion rings and tractor soda the first day and the Fontina Burger with zucchini and wild berry shake the next. Definitely the Gouda burger and zucchini and wild berry shake. That wild berry shake is the best shake I have ever had. But it is huge. So share it with someone. I was ice cream sick. It would be nice if they had sizes. The atmosphere is great. Reminds me of Disneyland. Line is long when you come but it's mostly because of the popularity. I think with all the employees maybe they should run 2 registers."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I love the onion rings with the hint of dill- so good! The pesto chicken sandwich is amazing! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"This food taste great and my son loved the grilled cheese so much! It was just perfect for me and my family."}
{"text":"You gotta love a good local joint. Perfect for any type of group (especially families!)! When the weather is nice, pull up a seat on the large, inviting patio. They have lovely vegetarian options, too! My favorite is the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich."}
{"text":"I love when I am town and have a chance to come and enjoy the food and atmosphere!! This is one of my full time favorite places"}
{"text":"Our friends recommended Joe's farmhouse grill after watching it on Triple D on TV.  Upon entering, you'll notice a tv setup with clips of the segment aired.  We thought by arriving at 2 PM for lunch we could bypass the lunch crowd, unfortunately we were wrong.  It's still packed at 2 PM, which must say something about the food.  We decided to order the Burger, Ahi Tuna sandwich, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and a banana mill shake.  Burger - was good, but not spectacular.  However, you could that the ingredients were very fresh .    Ahi Tuna Sandwich -outstanding.  The wasabi flavor complemented the sandwich and this was delicious.  Onion rings - worth ordering.  Sweet potato fries - good but you can get this elsewhere  Banana milk shake - tasty!  Overall, this was a solid meal to which we will come back during our next Giants spring break trip!"}
{"text":"Was an Ok experience, love the picnic tables however not the dirt.  Not sure there is much you can do about the flies being outside.  Would really like to see an area to refill coffee instead of standing in line at the food window behind several people"}
{"text":"The food was good just like it is at Joes BBQ.  However we wanted to enjoy the outdoors so we went outside to eat only to be attacked by flies. We brought it to the bus boys attention yet nothing was done nor did mgmt come see us.  There are no fans or other means to keep flies away.  Not only is it annoying but it is also very unsanitary."}
{"text":"Cute place, long lines, pricey even for being organic. My husband's burger was charred and no pink inside, could've been how busy they were and we didn't want to wait for a new one being it was busy but I could be just fine without going here again."}
{"text":"Even on a warm September day this was a great outdoor eat. The shade and breeze made it so nice. The scenery is beautiful. The picnic benches are a perfect casual feel. Ladies- no heels unless you're a pro in dirt. The ribs were cooked well and the sauce was yummie. My favorite part was the strawberry lemonade and zucchini though. I could have eaten just that. Will definitely be back. Can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"The staff isn't great at time management, but they're (usually) nice. Their bathroom is hilariously awesome (though definitely needs to be cleaned more often). And the food is super yummy. I'm addicted to everything on their menu. I love this place, and it's a great place to hang out with family and friends.   Only gripe? Can we please get a better dessert menu? :)"}
{"text":"The pretty grounds and the relaxed down-on-the-farm atmosphere make this a great place to have lunch outdoors.  The food is casual, tasty and the service friendly.  It is very popular so, you might prefer to go there on off-hours."}
{"text":"I used to adore this place. They changed it and now it feels forced. They took away the normal pepsi/coke option and got this stuff called tractor soda. It's awful!!! The burger price went up and the garlic and onion rings price are serious $ upgrades now . Fontina burger is still the best burger I've had and I love them for introducing me to that combination however now I think i might try to do it myself instead of dealing with the crowds and the cost . I wish they wouldn't have changed. They renovated and now they are charging the consumer to pay for it."}
{"text":"Something tells me Joe is a guy with a plan and is trying to build something special here.   IMO, he did.   This place is a mile from my house and we come here or do take-out often.    The food is really good and there's something good for however you might like to eat.    The ribs are fantastic, and I crave the onion rings (I can taste them now).      Nicely done Joe.   This place is accommodating, clean and has great food!     No matter where you live in the valley, this place is worth swinging wide for."}
{"text":"I would visit this place for the bathrooms alone. I won't spoil it if you've never been. This is a casual joint that's always packed. The food is great. We enjoy the seasonal milkshakes, the Ahi and Portobello sandwiches and the Fontina burger. The garlic fries are just ...eh. The rings and zucchini are good.  That all being said, I don't like eating here in the summer. The outdoor condiments get warm and the place gets infested...I mean INFESTED with flies. Like \"I can't eat here. Can I get this to go instead?\" Flies."}
{"text":"Yummy. We had the waffles. One with bacon the other with chicken. We've eaten here twice and both times were good."}
{"text":"Burgers are bomb!!!  Just moved to Gilbert and was told to eat here!!  Awesome!  Stop reading this and get in your car and go!  Any place Guy Fieri says to go to, I am in!"}
{"text":"First time here and tried the breakfast.  I'd give a 5/5 for atmosphere, feels like someone's house especially when sitting outside and the easy access to the back for drinks and socializing.   Ordered the Huevos de Farm Grill.  Although it tasted very fresh and liked the idea of shredded pork, it was pretty tasteless.  It would been a lot better with soft corn tortillas and salsa w/sour cream.  There was supposed to be salsa in it but I couldn't taste it.  It's a lot of food but gets boring to eat.  So I give it 3 stars and most likely won't go back for breakfast, lot's of better options.  I do want to try lunch here though which seems to have better menu items.  Breakfast menu isn't very diverse either."}
{"text":"Hot dog wrapped in bacon?? Yes please.. the ambience is awesome, staff is freindly, food is even better. If your in the area check it out you won't be disappointed. Supposedly I heard from an older couple I was sitting next to in the barn, the bathroom used to be joes bedroom. Who knows , but I thought that was funny. Oh did I mention a hot dog wrapped in bacon? Clip a tab off my man card thank you.."}
{"text":"Drove from SUN CITY to visit this joynt. The buzz about this place (after Guy Fieri's visit on Food Network's Triple D) is amazing.  You could feel the freshness in the air.  Out near Agritopia, a master-planned community in Gilbert, this place REEKS old-time farmer cookin'!    There was a line out the door, but the crowd was in a convivial mood, so we enjoyed standing in line.  After approx. 15-20 minutes, we got to the order window.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich with a side of fried zucchini, hubby ordered the BBQ bacon blue cheeseburger with a side of fries, and a BBQ chicken pizza to share (and take home for leftovers).  We also ordered a side of onion rings and a cheesecake.  Hubby ordered a sprite, I had their fresh-squeezed lemonade.  The Ahi Tuna sandwich was delicious.  The slaw and wasabi mayo added great flavor.  The bun was fresh, fresh, fresh and probably the best hamburger bun I've ever eaten, melt in your mouth, I kid you not. However, not being a fan of raw fish, I ended up eating around the raw parts, which left very little to go down.  I will get the tuna cooked \"well done\" next time.  The zucchini was really good, but the pieces were so large, they really needed a fork & knife.  The house-made marinara was obviously house-made, and it had very rich flavor, delicious.  The lemonade was a full quart and, believe me, I drank it all.  It was the best I've ever consumed.  Hubby's BBQ Bacon Blue cheeseburger was awesome!  So huge, he could barely get his hands around it.  When he asked me to take a bite, I asked him to cut it in half.  Delicious freshly-picked veggies (lettuce, tomato, and red onion).  His fries were \"meh,\" but the onion rings were da bomb!  Thick-cut, sweet and delicious morsels of onion and fried panko, some of the best I've eaten.  The BBQ Chicken pizza was spectacular, but I thought it would be bigger.  It's definitely enough for one hungry person, but we had leftovers, so it's all good.  Joe, we will DRIVE 60 miles one way to sample your fresh-tastin' goodness!  WE WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed. There was a small line but it went pretty fast. This time I tried the fontina burger, it was a bit messy but worth every bite. The onion rings were also delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting. My husband got a hamburger.  I got the special which was fried fish and fried shrimp.  The shrimp was outstanding. My husband said his burger was \"good\".  I was happy to have a side salad option.  Actually there were 2 side included but I didn't know all of my options.  It was difficult to know the menu offerings. If you get the opportunity, review it before. Since there was a line, I didn't ask too many questions i.e. Side dishes.    I had a blackberry lemonade drink. It runs about $4.  I liked it, my husband wasn't a fan.  I definitely want to go back and try something else.  I caught the breakfast menu about 30 seconds before I ordered.  Not clear if this is served at 1pm but I was interested!  Dining room staff was nice and helpful. Place was busy but still good seating and tables turned quickly.  Tartar sauce was excellent too."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for ordering to-go, because normally I really love this restaurant. In fact, I always bring people from out of town because it's fun and unique and the food is great.   The problem is ordering to-go. Every time it's annoyingly slow. I get they are trying to avoid people calling in to avoid the long lines, but the wait to actually place the order is often 10 minutes.    Then after 10 minutes wait I placed my order. They said it would be 30 minutes.  I paid and finish driving. I got there 8 minutes early and let them know I was here. They informed me it would be 8 more minutes. Eight minutes later it wasn't ready. I had to wait four more minutes.  So 45 minutes for a burger and there wasn't even a line. It would've been faster for me to walk up and place my order.   So the one star review... Management, you are the friendliest woman I may have ever met, and when you're there your customer service skills are evident, and yet your team is consistently unfriendly, and unwilling to make substitutions, and your phone ordering process is terrible. So please, either don't offer to-go orders or do a better job with them.  I'll be happy to update my review when the process has been improved."}
{"text":"Joe's is so good and definitely worth the wait (maybe not in the summer, ha). The food here is always fresh and the staff is always very welcoming and knowledgeable. I love the outdoor spacious seating area and if you have children, it's nice to be able to let them run around. The reason I didn't get them five stars is because we've had a couple problems with ordering out. Our food is usually cold and they don't always get the order right. If you dine in, you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place! When the weather turns a bit cooler Joe's is the perfect place to sit out with the kids and enjoy a burger and the cool night air. Not only is the staff friendly the food is awesome! My little girl loves the mini-corn dogs and we always have a great time."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and always enjoy my meal.  The kids love to run around outside and it gives them something to do while we are waiting for our food.  Although, if you aren't into sitting at a picnic table outside when it is 110 this isn't the place for you especially because it can get crowded and there isn't enough inside seating for everyone.  BUT, that has nothing to do with their food.  I love the garlic and sweet potato fries.  The blue burger is also delicious and the burger was juicy as they should be.  I recently had the Ahi Tune sandwich and LOVED it.  It was different than what I normally get and a GOOD different.  I'm talking the type of good where I'm going to be sitting around and think, \"I need to go to Joe's and get me one of them Ahi Tuna sandwiches.\"  Also BBQ chicken pizza was an A+!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Looking for a cool spot for folks visiting, look no further. Food is always fresh and good. Lines are long and seating is tough sometimes, be warned. Oh, and watch for falling scorpions."}
{"text":"Its hard to lump the entire restaurant into a single review so I am going to review only the most Divine pizza I have ever had. The brick oven chicken/BQ/BlueCheese/Onion.... WOW OH HU SO GOOD... Ill be back and update as I go...."}
{"text":"We go here all the time! Great outdoor venue, nice when the weather is good. The chicken sandwiches are the best here. Also try their date shakes, garlic fries, and PBJ. Would always recommend to a friend!!!"}
{"text":"Good Food - Roomy outdoor picnic tables under a huge canopy of a trees.  Always busy with a line but it moves quickly and all the staff is very friendly.  Parking is a dirt lot to the East.  It is a great place to take the family or meet out of town guests that are looking for a unique and casual dining experience."}
{"text":"How can a hot dog be so delicious?! The wedge salad was good, presentation was great. Lemonades are to die for! Food came out quick. $40 lunch is a little pricey though."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday, plenty of places to sit inside and out. Short wait for the food and Coffee Shop next door. My meat scramble was okay and my husband loved the apple smoked bacon. Will come back, great place to bring kids and out-of-towners."}
{"text":"It was a group of 11 of us we all ordered different things off of the menu & we were all happy with what we picked! I got the Ahi Tuna burger it was AMAZING! I also got the green beans on the side they were delicious with a blackberry lemonade & I tried the butter pecan milkshake! It was alllllll terrific!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but it was just OK in my opinion.  The restaurant itself is pretty cool, lots of outside seating and room for kids to run around.   The food, I felt was OK... better than the majority of fast food places, but nothing over the top or begging me to come back tomorrow.  Two things that sort of bothered me, were the FLIES, ugh, everywhere, even inside, AND - all of the drinks and condiments were located outside, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, was just weird to me. Oh, and the ranch.. was... weird, like runny? And the taste was.. different. I'll admit I am kind of a ranch snob, so it wasn't HORRIBLE, just weird. I feel like if you're gonna gloat about your fabulous onion rings, you should pair it with some decent ranch."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere! I've had their breakfast omelet, salad, and chicken sandwich- all were incredible! The beet salad is my personal favorite! The only downfall is the service can be hit or miss. Many times there are no utensils or napkins on the table and it's difficult to find someone to help."}
{"text":"Sooo amazing! I had the garlic Gouda burger and my husband had the bacon avocado burger. They have organic sodas in all kinds of unique flavors. I tried the cucumber and the coconut and they were both amazing! I wish I lived in Arizona so I could enjoy more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Imagine a farm, now image the stuff that grows in the farm being served to you as you sit overlooking the farm.  That's Joe's.  Excellent food, and they have a guy that walks around explaining food and the history.  Try not to talk to him, you'll end up buying half the menu, but he is very knowledgeable and his recommendations are spot on!    Oh be aware that the wait times are super long, we waited about 30 minutes just to order, than another 15 to get food. I took a walk through the farm at that point.  Ahi-Tuna - Excellent tuna, cooked rare, just the right amount of sauce to give it taste without being overwhelming of the fish. Fried Fish - served on that Friday, I think it's seasonal?  Very well cooked fish, good tartar sauce as well. Strawberry Lemonade, there's lots of chunks of strawberry. It's perfectly sweetened and sour at the same time.  Fried Green Beans - pretty good, could have done without them though Lamb Burger - it was the last day they were offering this, very well cooked mid-rare burger, great tazaki sp? sauce.  My favorite out of this and the Tuna. Onion Rings - herb encrusted - I think it's a bit overpowering Butter Pecan Shake - oooh man this was sooo goodd. One of the most amazing shakes I have had in my life.  Tid Bit - If it's the day of your birthday you get $10 off!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?  From the moment we drove up to this fantastically redone 60s style farm property I was IN LOVE!  They've redone the main house to look mod-retro; like a 60s cafe with milk glass globes glowing above you in what was the family's former living room.  The trees on the north side of the property are HUMONGOUS and equally as breathtaking!  And there's a coffee shop on the west side that was just adorable also.  Oh yeah...did I mention they sit on 12 acres of an urban garden called Agritopia?  They use a lot of that produce in their food.  Ok, I guess I should mention their food.  It's pretty fantastic!  The grilled wedge was perfectly smoky and cool/crisp and their fried jumbo shrimp basket served up shrimp the size of chicken wings.  Ok...I could go on, bottom line...try it out but I hear they can be busy...cuz amazing restaurants usually are!"}
{"text":"Just left and it was my second visit. I really love everything I've ordered so far! The butter pecan shake is to DIE for. You get pecans in every sip, it's amazing. I am not a soda drinker at all but I LOVE the tractor soda and I wish there was somewhere I could purchase it! The only thing I didn't like today was how long everything took. It already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. Our food also came out all separate. We got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15 minutes later I got my pizza."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We arrived on a weekday at around lunch time and the line ridiculously long, but it seemed to move pretty quickly, so it wasn't a huge issue. We all ordered different types of burgers and they were all amazing and not at all overcooked. The serving are huge, and their fresh squeezed lemonade with strawberry chunks is so refreshing. I love the service, the food and it's a lovely place. It's definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"Mmmm....grilled vegetable scramble. Do it.  Joe's is amazing. And they are always busy, so if you decide to come in, plan on standing in line for a bit, but rest assured, every minute is worth the delectable tastes that you will encounter on your first bite.  They also have pancakes that are light, fluffy and YUM. If you are considering visiting here, consider no more and get your booty in for some breakfast!"}
{"text":"A great place to take your family! I've been here many times and every single time I leave like I did the time prior, satisfied. Great tasting food, service is excellent, and the park is beautiful."}
{"text":"Perhaps I went in with overly high expectations, but the overall experience didn't leave a lasting impression.  Pros:  Outdoor seating was beautiful and very family friendly.  Restaurant was clean and the food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time.  Service was very friendly and the staff clean and well kept.  Portion sizes were adequate.  Cons:  For the taste and quantity of the food, it's a bit over priced.  The BBQ Sampler was about $13, and the taste very average.  There wasn't anything particularly special about the food.  The meals wasn't  bad by any means, but it wasn't, \"mmmm, let's come here again\" good.  In summary, it was a pleasant dining experience mostly because of the outdoor seating area, but the food was very average and over priced.  Take two or three dollars off the price of each meal, and it would be justified."}
{"text":"Joes is overpriced and overrated. It's also not worth the ridiculously long line it ALWAYS has. I live across the street and the line is out the door for any regular meal time. Their food is fine, and the atmosphere is fun, but I don't feel it's worth the price or the wait. The best thing to get there is the breakfast. The prices for those are not too bad, and you get a ton of food. Pancakes rival cracker barrel. If you go on a weekday morning, the wait isn't too bad for breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Joe's Farm and Grill three months ago and thought we try it again. My wife has a lot food allergies. Joe's seemed to pass her allergies test with the grilled salmon at the last visit. I had the double Sonoran Dogs. I thought the food was ok.  What we really enjoy is the farm itself. We enjoyed this visit and the last by just walking the farm and relaxing at the prayer garden. Our visit yesterday was a bit more crazy. I guess families and sweet hearts go the the farm and grill. We arrived at 2:30p and the line was out the door. We walked the farm until 3:30p. The line was out the door but only by 4 people. We place our order at 4:03p and found a table outside. I had to go to the bathroom and waited in a line. We sat for 30 min to finally get our food. My wife went with the plain burger since the beef was local and unseasoned with a salad and milk shake. I went with the BBQ Chicken Pizza because all the Yelpers placed a bunch of awesome photos of this beast with a soda. My wife liked her burger and loved her shake. I was rather underwhelmed with a grilled pizza dough with a chicken tender cut up(seriously like a single tender chopped up maybe 1once of meat) and placed on top. Little cheese and a squirt of BBQ sauce. I wanted to take a photo but thought better to embarrass the farm. It's overall flavor was dough because the toppings were missing. Over all food was ok and the wait is too long for ok food that cost almost $30. We tried to get in prior to the dinner rush as we did for our first visit ( 4pm). This could have been a off day for the Farm and Grill. We will likely stop in again for one last try to make our final thoughts. The farm grounds are too cool not to visit."}
{"text":"We came to Joe's Farm Grill for my mother's birthday lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy! I was surprised at how on top of things the staff was; as soon as an indoor seating opened up, someone quickly cleaned the table off for the next. The food was great! My husband had a protein style burger, I enjoyed fried zucchini, our children had kids meals and they were a good portion size. For the price point we will prefer coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"I would disagree with anyone who says this place is overhyped. Love the farm-to-table emphasis. Love the laid-back vibe. The food was creatively prepared and damn tasty. Try the beet salad."}
{"text":"Hooray for fresh food and inventive recipes! The best time to visit Joe's is definitely in the winter months, as the grounds are beautiful to explore and there are picnic tables all over the place! Indoor seating is limited, but if you come during a less busy time, you'll most likely get a seat. The soda fountain, condiment bar, and restrooms (which are awesome) are also outdoors. Joe's Farm Grill is modern, fun, and definitely makes me feel as though I am stepping out of Arizona and onto a beautiful New England property.   Atmosphere aside, the food is very good! The menu offers a big variety and most (or all?) of the produce is grown on site. My husband loves the Ahi burger with wasabi mayonnaise, while my favorite so far has been their hot dogs. I was less than impressed with their wedge salad, but eating a meal that is less than exceptional is fairly rare here. Milkshakes and fries are also phenomenal at Joe's.   Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants to go to on a beautiful day. I know this review will get muddled with the rest of the outstanding reviews, but I knew I had to review a place as unique, delicious, and special as Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"Meh...had the green eggs and ham. Hubs had the big breakfast. Was okay--how can you go wrong with breakfast, though.  But I gotta admit that the fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome.  For the overall price, however , considered this restaurant overrated."}
{"text":"Yum! We love it :) Everything is good. We just tried the Grilled Wedge salad, and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go when my family is in town. They have awesome burgers and some good barbecue selections.  My favorite is the southwest burger with a side of onion rings. My boyfriend is a big fan of their date shakes.  The style of the restaurant is that you stand in line to order, then find a table and wait with your buzzer for food. Then you go pick up your food when it is ready. So, it is a pretty casual atmosphere.  They also offer breakfast that is apparently pretty good. I've never gone myself, but my visiting family members have and they have enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere here! A month ago my husband took me here for my birthday, because of course you get a free meal up to $10 worth on your birthday! We had breakfast and it was outstanding! The potatoes were seasoned so nicely, so yummy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant of all times. Even my kids pick Joe's Farm to go eat for their birthdays"}
{"text":"So I took my family visiting from out town there and they were happy. You do get a good amount of food for the price and if you are smart like us, you can each order something different and be able try some of everything. I did get to experience the sweet potato fries this time...pretty good! They were a bit thinner cut than I would have liked but they had great flavor. Still I recommend coming to check this out if you are in the East valley, its one of the most fun flavorful places to be!"}
{"text":"Just had to throw in my 5 stars.  Just go already."}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on the Food Network about a year or so ago and never beforehand that it was right in my neighborhood. What a pleasant surprise! This place has a small indoor seating area with many outdoor tables (with misters in the summertime). You walk right in to this old farmhouse, order at the counter, and take your pager to your table as they freshly cook each item your group orders. They are co-owned with Joe's Real BBQ (in downtown Gilbert), which means their BBQ menu is beyond amazing- the pulled pork was to die for :)  Just to the west of the restaurant is a small coffee shop, which makes this an ideal date destination... post dinner coffee gives you plenty of time to chat."}
{"text":"Expensive, help wasn't informative regarding order, onion rings were cold. Burgers and chicken sandwich were very good"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. When I ate meat, their hamburgers were amazing. I usually order the portabella burger instead and I don't miss the meat at all! Their sweet potato fries or garlic fries are incredible. Go on your birthday and get a $10 credit! For breakfast, the green eggs and ham are delish!"}
{"text":"\"Common food done uncommonly well\" is their motto, and I think it fits perfectly.  You'll find a lot of typical American fare, but each prepared with a special twist, such as the buttermilk pancakes with applewood-smoked bacon and bleu cheese.  You'll also find many unique menu items such as the Fontina burger, which is made with roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto and Fontina cheese.  Whatever you decide on, you can be sure it will be expertly prepared and very tasty.  Some of my favorites are the breakfast tacos, BBQ chicken pizza, onion rings, sweet potato fries, any of the salads, and the malts.    Some other really cool things to note about Joe's Farm Grill are that much of the produce is grown in Agritopia right next to the restaurant.  You'll find many seasonal items are from the farm as well.  Also, the building itself was the home that Joe Johnston grew up in.  It has been remodeled quite a bit, but the original walls and even fireplace remain.  If you've never been, you must give it a try!"}
{"text":"Quality food & atmosphere. Joe does it right. Usu get a burger."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Joe's from North Scottsdale for 5 years because it is seriously THAT GOOD! I love how fresh and flavorful the food is here. From the Burgers to the BBQ to the salads and shakes. You cannot go wrong. The Farm restaurant has recently been renovated with more seating and restrooms."}
{"text":"I took my son here for his birthday meal since they give the birthday person $10 free.  I got the salmon carder salad and it was amazing. I loved it!   The milk shakes are also terrific. In the summer during lunch you can wait a bit for a table since it is too hot to sit outside. Also, during the winter at lunch expect long lines. But this restaurant puts out great food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and healthy!  If you like dates, make sure to try their Date Shake.  They do have gluten-free options that are also delicious!  I usually get the Ahi Tuna burger, but I have also had the Fontina burger.  Either one is delicious!!  Their beet salad is amazing... if you like beats, it is a must!  They have recently remodeled and the changes are great!  A lot of more seating area inside, but can still enjoy the outside seating if compelled.  Their fountain drinks are not the usual ones and worth a try!  They offer fast service with amazingly delicious food!  It is not very close to us, but well worth the drive!  Parking might be a little challenging, but they have open some areas on dirt where people can park."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Gilbert... No contest."}
{"text":"Love this spot. The menu is full of farm fresh unique food with lots of options for vegetarians. The restaurant is very clean with a modern funky style. Staff was great, food was tasty, and we will absolutely be back when visiting the area.   I can see why this place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is great and they are a pet friendly establishment. Win win..."}
{"text":"The only thing that avoids the 4th star is the lack of veggies in their menu (aside from \"just salads\"). But if you are in the mood of a burger or ribs, and also a nice place outdoors this is the place. The taste of their products is fresh and they do feel recently harvested.  If you are not US born (like me) and used to have always veggies with your meet...you'll miss somehow here. Good for a meat craving day."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here before and enjoyed it very much. This is the first time I had breakfast and we were all very disappointed. I had the Belgium waffle w 2 sausage links added 2 eggs scrambled and a fountain drink. $15 for everything.  Something was added to my eggs that gave it a different taste and texture that I did not enjoy. 2 different types of pancakes were ordered, the buttermilk were the only ones anyone liked. My son in law had an omelette that he could not eat because of a funky taste. My waffle should have cooked for another minute or two."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Was a little disappointed about how many things were missing from the menu (fruit cup, pizzas, etc) but the Gouda garlic Berger and the beet salad were amazing. Loved the out door area and walking through the garden."}
{"text":"Went to Joe's for Mother's Day. Food and atmosphere were amazing. Love this place. In fact, thinking about it makes me want to go there now.  Yep, I'm going there right now."}
{"text":"I saw this place on the Food network and decided to try it out last time I was in town.  The food was very good and very fresh.  The ahi sandwich was to die for.  Don't come during lunch unless you want to wait in a very long line."}
{"text":"The first time my wife and I went I wasn't super impressed.  The first time, I had the combo hotdogs. They were good but not worth the drive.  This past week, my parents were in town and they love ddd. So, we gave Joe's another chance and it was great.  Most of us got the ahi sandwich.  It is a ton of ahi, served rare with a great wasbi mayo and slaw. It was one of the better sandwiches I've had in a long time.  Also, I'd highly recommend the onion rings, they are a must. After lunch we walked over to the coffee shop for a cupcake. The baker there was on cupcake wars and they lived up to the hype. The red velvet cupcake was the best I've ever had.  They were the type of thing you would order a dozen of, sit in a room by yourself and eat them all without telling anyone."}
{"text":"I like Joe's Farm Grill and it seems to be the place where our family tends to always meet since the kids can run around and be noisy. But I find it's a tad bit pricy for the food. I also think the food is too greasy and I haven't found a salad that I love. My husband loves Joe's Farm Grill, he's a burger lover, so he is a big fan. I love the onion rings but couldn't eat there all the time. It's a nice treat. eating there on my birthday is fun because you get a free meal. I just think it's over priced. My kids don't like their food either."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I have wanted to check out Joe's Farm Grill for a while. We have friends who live in Agritopia, and have mentioned Joe's to us. Each time we've wanted to stop, the parking lot was overflowing, and so we didn't stop.  We finally made it to Joe's on a Sunday morning. Joe's is located amongst other buildings, and is a little difficult to locate. When we finally found it, we walked in, and there was a server at the door to greet us, he was pleasant, when we explained it was our first time in, he took the time to explain how the process worked. They have plastic menus by the door, and also an electronic menu by the ordering counter. When you make your way up to the counter, you can select a beverage from a cooler by the counter, there is juice, Naked smoothies, and bottled water. They also offer coffee, and fountain beverages. After reviewing the menu, I decided on the breakfast tacos. 3 corn tortillas filled with eggs, and they give you your choice of bacon, sausage, or chicken. There is a green sauce and sour cream. The tacos are served with a side of farmer beans, I also chose an orange juice.  After placing our orders, we found a table, and a very short time later our food arrived. The tacos and beans looked appealing, but the taste was not. I felt the tacos lacked flavor, as well as the farmer beans, the orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious.  Joe's prides themselves on using local, organic produce and cage-free eggs which is great, but in my opinion the breakfast needs more flavor.  I loved the décor. The inside was large, clean and bright. There are picnic tables for family style dining outside if you choose.  I am not letting my bland breakfast experience deter me from Joe's, as both my husband and I agreed to go back and try something from their lunch menu."}
{"text":"One day, about three years ago, I wanted some fries. I wanted them badly. After a while on the internet I found that Joe's Farm Grill supposedly had the best fries in town, so I went, expecting nothing more than some good fries. What I got, was an almost religious experience. I am now a convert to whatever this Joe guy is selling.    Joe's Farm Grill is so grand, in fact, that I find it kind of hard to review. A delicious, locally owned restaurant that was featured on Food Network attached to a beautiful farm where they grow their vegetables, plus an award winning cupcake/coffee shop and some of the coolest bathrooms I've ever seen. I could write three pages on it! But I'll make it simple, because there are plenty other reviews to look through. I have never had anything less than great here, whether you're looking for a burger and fries or some ahi tuna, Joes is here for you like a charismatic cult leader. If you haven't stopped by Joes, punch yourself in the face, then head on out."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I expected. Slow service and all our food came out cold. We asked if we could get it fresh and hot and it took 10 more minutes and it was lukewarm. Awesome. Will not be back. Too expensive for average food served cold. I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I think the high reviews are solely from hype alone. Oh well. Now I know."}
{"text":"We love their food! Locally owned and operated, locally grown, this is a win for all, and we fully support them. Must try is the grilled bbq pizza, it's their signature. The sauce has the perfect sweet flavor and compliments the onion. The shredded chicken is not dried out either.  I have to say though, my favorite item on their menu is simple- the grilled cheese sandwich. Best grilled cheese I've ever had. Perfect blend of cheeses with a perfect amount, which compliments the bread. If you are a fan of grilled cheese it's worth driving from anywhere to have Joe's version.  Be sure to try their beet salad as well. Who would have thought beets would be make perfect salad."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is definitely cool, you have to go to the bathroom here- no joke!  It is usually pretty busy and the food is expensive, but it's always worth a visit.  The food is fresh (the reason it's more expensive I believe).  I have had the BBQ pizza which I thought was so-so, farm chicken sandwich, pecan shake (seasonal and amazing), the fried fish, love all of their variations on fries and had a hot dog one time that was pretty good too.  Overall I think the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Awesome products! I have tried over 9 different items from there menu so far and all I can say everything was delicious but my favorite of all is Ahi tuna witch  is the best grilled tuna sandwich I have ever had period !"}
{"text":"This place is great. As you enter you feel like you went back in time. The menu has so many options. The staff is always friendly and the food is really good. It is my son's favorite burger place and that says a lot because he loves his burgers."}
{"text":"I love the Fontina Burger. Best hamburger ever"}
{"text":"Decent food. Not wordly good but it's ok. Kind of overpriced. The place has a lot of character and it's pretty unique."}
{"text":"My new favorite food joint! The food tastes so fresh and flavorful. I love this spot for a burger, salad, chicken sandwiches or lemonades. The place is clean , the wait wasn't that long for food and the service was amazing. With my boyfriend and I the total came out to around 30 bucks , but it was really worth cost. I can't wait to return. We walked around the Garden after our meal, the view is beautiful."}
{"text":"I got lucky because the Lamb Burger was a special. It was absolutely the best burger I have ever had in my entire life. The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly, but unlike a regular hamburger it had a lightness and savoriness that was unique. I had the side caesar salad which was just lathered with delicious caesar dressing. A bit too much dressing for me but still tasty. I also tried the garlic fries which smelled amazing and tasted even better. I do NOT eat onion rings, but I couldn't resist trying theirs and boy, they were awesome. Finally, my boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna Sandwich which was worth the trip on it's own. Take the drive...it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Pros: good burgers, shakes and fries -- really good!  Cons: overcooked ahi tuna (was chewy), average onion rings; burgers/sandwiches hastily assembled and hard to eat.  Stick with the burgers, fries and shakes, very disappointed in rest.  I want to try pizza next though."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come here as many times as humanly possible.   The vibe of the place is great- super cute and has a kind of farmers market feel to it. Like a community spot- which I love!   We just barely made it in for breakfast at 10:56 (ends at 11) and I am so happy we did! I went with my bestie and she ordered two pancakes (omg so fluffy) bacon and eggs. I ordered the green eggs and ham and added mushrooms.   Green eggs and ham is everything I want in a meal. Scrambled eggs with cheese, ham, and PESTO. Honestly any chance to eat pesto and I take it.   Cooked perfect. Extremely flavorful. Wishing I didn't live an hour and fifteen minutes away from it."}
{"text":"Cafeteria-style dining, farm to table ingredients, and fancy organic sodas on tap! This place was driving 49 min to Gilbert. You must try one of the fried sides. They are seasoned and come with house made ranch dressing that is excellent. Super family (and dog) friendly place."}
{"text":"We drove an hour. We waited in the 50 person line. Our mouths watered.   Owned by the same people as Joe's BBQ, this place was great with awesome selections! No one in my family complained about their meal, which is ever so rare. Joe's Farm Grill offers selections for breakfast, then the rest of the day offers burgers, sandwiches, pizza, ribs, lots of sides, salads, and more! What else can you ask for? All of the items seemed to be of high quality and extremely tasty!  The environment of the place is great. It feels as if you are in a mix of a place is disneyland thrown in the midwest. You just have to be there to understand. There were more seating inside than out, which is awesome during the winter. I can see this being a bit iffy during the summer though. You walk up in a line to order your food, then wait around 10 minutes for it to be made.  For food, I personally opted for BBQ Ribs with a Side Caesar, Fries, Garlic Flatbread, and a Peppermint Shake at around 25 dollars. This was as expensive as it gets. The burgers and salads were around 8 dollars each. The ribs were fall off the bone and very messy, but oh so worth it!  Overall, Joe's Farm Grill is a must for anyone to try! Now, what are you doing reading the end of this review? Leave your place of residence. Get in your car. And go to Joe's Farm Grill. NOW!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was excellent. My wife had a the Gouda burger which was awesome. BBQ ribs were good. Would highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Joe's has been hit and miss over the last year for me. Some days they knock it out of the park with some of the food. Then the next time its average and there is a problem. So it gets 3 stars instead of a solid 4.  It does get crowded at the typical feeding hours, especially weekends. Plan ahead as the wait for food can be over 45 minutes.  Problems I've had, filled wrong order for to go, got home and found it was wrong and overcharged for what I did get. It was resolved by manager on the phone but still frustrating.  Another time my food sat for 20 minutes before they got around to paging me. Very frustrating. The flies have returned, I eat inside and am still constantly brushing them away from my food, I just cover food with a napkin until I get to it.  Some staff are wearing shirts with anti fly logos, but they don't seem to be doing much fly eradicating.  Address the fly issue. I worked on a horse farm and there are ways to discreetly address fly issues.   Good things: the fried zucchini and onion rings are great.  The Chicken Farm salad is great when they get it right. However I've noticed the chicken serving seems to have gotten smaller. The beets are a good addition to the other veggies in the salad.  Milk shakes are good too, they do offer special flavors often."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's the perfect setting for wiggly kids but you still get FABULOUS food. You cant beat that!"}
{"text":"Fun place to take guests.  Different menu.  The fried shrimp is to die for.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awful and a Greece pit. There hamburgers used to be great and now they have no flavor. Fries were cold. Kids meals was also cold..  a waste of money and had to eat elsewhere. We through our food away after a couple of bites"}
{"text":"We are new to the Gilbert area and have been hearing great reviews about Joe's plus its right down the street from our house. We took our daughter one afternoon after school. My daughter had a chicken sandwich, the boyfriend had a bacon cheeseburger and we shared a BBQ chicken pizza. Everything was decent, if not a little pricey. We also bought a strawberry lemonade which my boyfriend said was way too sour. A nice experience but not one I see us repeating often due to the price."}
{"text":"Two of us spent $33 for dinner and we got a hamburger and a fish special. The food was only mediocre. It turns out that the hamburger is cooked to rare. Apparently the menu says that but I didn't see it. The hamburger was red and slimy inside. I can't imagine how it passed the Health Department regulations for temperature. The fried Zucchini was not crisp. The shrimp were actually too big and just uninspired.  The fries were not tasty. I like the McDonalds or Burger King fries a lot better. Having said the above, we did like the cod and the cole slaw. Needless to say we were unimpressed and will not be back."}
{"text":"I went here for my daughters birthday and her meal was on the house! I got the sweet pork BBQ sandwich with sweet potato fries...amazing! I like the feel and culture here. It is a great famiky enviornment with seating and play areas outside. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"This was my go to spot in Gilbert for a fresh burger or thin crust pizza but now I even love Joe's for breakfast! Their motto \"common food done uncommonly well\" could not be truer! Some of my favorites are the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger, the BBQ Chicken Pizza, and the egg & potato breakfast tacos. All 3 are out of this world! My fiance and I have eaten at Joe's more times than I can count and each time the food has been fresh and fantastic. We have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best place for a salad, burger, breakfast around! There's a reason it's on Food Network...it's AMAZING!  The staff are friendly and very accommodating, the food is incredible. The sweet potato fries with the pineapple dipping sauce is out of this world! Not to mention the portabello mushroom salad and sandwich, Ahi sandwich, etc. Besides that, it's on a farm area, so the kids can run around in nature (where they get their vegetables) so it's such a great environment!"}
{"text":"Well that was interesting. I had heard so much about this place, my parents were in town, like to try new and local so here we go.   It is a walk-up window order system. Got there around 6 and the line was clear out the door. It took a really long time to get to the front because they just had one window open.   53 minutes later and a free milkshake later we get our food. Something got screwed up with our order. Ughhhhh. Why me...?  Finally we eat. The fontina burger was delicious. Beet salad yummy. Sweet potato fries were average. Garlic fries, deelish.   Oh and there are kids running around everywhere. Screaming and crying. Everywhere.   So overall, food good... atmosphere and wait, not so much."}
{"text":"Great food! Try the new things. Whatever it is, try it. Never a let down! It's awesome that it's close to us too but would drive a distance fir this place"}
{"text":"Food is great. I love their outdoor seating. It's a refreshing atmosphere. The food is a little bit on the pricier end, BUT it's fresh and the quality gets two thumbs up. It's a popular place, so don't be surprised to find the line out the door."}
{"text":"if this is your first time order from the items highlighted on the menu.  I was in PHX for one night and went based on yelp reviews.  My father and I ordered from the featured items (to DIE for Ahi Tuna sandwich and sweetpotato fries for me) and the others in our party did not.  We were munching away totally happy not to be eating at yet another identikit chain joint while they miserably played with their food."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious here! I've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner and never been disappointed. The pancakes are honestly the tastiest pancakes I've ever had. Another great thing about this place is if you go on your birthday you get a $10 credit to spend on a meal. Def recommend!!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to visit. The food is slightly above average but the ambiance is so unique and quaint. It's a great place to bring visitors... and the coffee shop is amazing."}
{"text":"Take a freaking cool A environment with sweet trees and citrus growing all over the place on a beautiful piece of real estate, and then add in abnormally delicious food with a really unique flair to it and you have JOE'S Farm Grill.   I would go there even if their food was mediocre because of the cool atmosphere that the \"farm\" provides, but the food is like the cherry on top! Do yourself a huge favor and order the garlic fries. Make sure you don't have any hot dates lined up for about a week or so because the effects are long lasting, but it's worth it for an occasional guilty pleasure.  **UPDATE:   You can't go wrong with whatever you order. I've had multiple burgers, sandwiches, the Sonoran Dog, Carolina Dog, ahi tuna sandwich, the BBQ sampler plate, and they're ALL ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience yet!  The line can get long, but that's a sign that they are doing well.  The line was the longest part.  Once we ordered, it took less than 10 minutes to get our food.  So from getting in line to getting our food was 40 minutes.  Not bad for a Saturday evening dinner.  The onion rings are out of this world.  Crispy, flavorful, and the onion actually stays inside the ring when you take a bite out of it.  Definitely a family favorite!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Unique place, very affordable.  No beer, which is a bummer.  The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty.  However, can't give it any more than 3 stars because it gave me food poisoning.  I think it was just a fluke...but still."}
{"text":"Okay...time to update my review.  If you haven't visited Joe's Farm Grill, you're missing out.  The concept is great.  A family farm turned into a touristy farm-to-table restaurant.  The family turned the house they grew up in into a restaurant and it's still surrounded by a wonderful vegetable and fruit garden.  They have also added so many other amazing things to the property, such as a winery, a coffee shop, a craft brewery...but I will review those separately.  My point is that a visit to Joe's isn't just about the food...it's an experience.  BUT, of course, I'm going to review the food as well.  The concept is fresh food.  I believe their original concept was to use everything they produced, but as they have expanded, they have reached out to other local producers.  I had been here on a few other occasions, ordering various menu items, but was never quite wowed.  That is until my birthday this year.  You see, they offer you a free meal on your birthday up to a $10 value so I had my kids take me here.  As we waited in line, we reviewed the menu trying to decide what to order.  A short time later, a woman walked out of the kitchen to let everyone know the specials of the day.  She pointed out that the specials were also on the screens at the front of the line, but from the way she described them, we were sold.  We went with the Gouda Garlic Bacon Burger and OMG...one of my top five burgers ever! We also got the garlic fries and I probably wouldn't order them again because they were way too garlicky but that's just a taste preference.  But oh that burger!!  The service was also exceptional.  The cashier wished me a Happy Birthday, of course, since I was there for my free meal.  He also asked if we had the burger before and when we said we hadn't, he let us know that it was one of his favorites.  I can see why!  I already mentioned the woman who came out to tell us about the specials.  Well, as we were enjoying our meal, she was walking around from table to table to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal. Such great customer service!  I really have no complaints and urge everyone to check it out when in the area.  I really don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took my 9 year old there on Saturday...super packed with hungry people.  Service was good, line was long, waited in line for 20 minutes.  Food was plentiful and tasty... American burgers and fries.  The drinks were a little funky tasting but refreshing.  We would go back."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with the 4B burger or the killer Ahi tuna sandwich . I take all my friends and family here when they come out from Santa Barbara."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Have an incredible selection of fresh food. You definitely won't find any frozen fries being thrown into a fryer here. everything is made from scratch and worth the short wait. I love sitting outside when the weather is good. You will want to keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"We had a tour here and the manager Clayton was awesome! The food was great and the customer service was excellent. I had the pork tenderloin sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm not one to sit up on a pedestal and tell you to eat organic.  Honestly, I don't care if there were some high powered fertilizers used to grow my tomatoes if they're fresh.  And that's exactly what you'll get here - fresh.  They harvest their veggies from the large garden out back which you're free to walk through before or after your meal.  The food is varied and there is something for everyone.  The salads are large, the sandwiches are filling, and the sides are all very good.  The only downside of Joe's is the price.  You'll probably be looking at $30 for lunch for 2 especially if you choose to have dessert or a shake (you should have a shake).  All told it is a fantastic lunch option and a great place to take out-of-town visitors, especially in the cooler months!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is a fun and family centric place to eat. It's got great options and produces high quality food that tastes like you're paying for a 5-star meal. They have a fun outside patio that shaded by large trees and overshadows an actual farm, located just next door. Joe's Farm Grill is a great option for delicious food, a great atmosphere, and great philosophy on both food service and the community."}
{"text":"Overated. Food basic because \"farm fresh.\" Service lacking. Patio is dirty and chaotic"}
{"text":"Great place to have a hearty breakfast. So many great options but my favorite in common go to, is Joe's big breakfast.  Their strawberry lemonade is my absolute favorite and will order that with any meal.    The best thing about this place, beside the food, is the outdoor seating. Very kid and pet friendly."}
{"text":"I depend on Yelp both locally and as I travel. The ratings are usually close to what I'd give them. Over the years, Yelp's penetration in Europe has grown -- which is making a more important tool for me. On my first trip to Copenhagen, I found a great little Italian restaurant that I'd never found without Yelp. Now, the hotel concierge has it on their list."}
{"text":"We always have great food anytime we are here !  I can't believe I haven't written a review yet !  Expect to wait to order and for your food but... it totally worth every second !"}
{"text":"Great food excellent service!! I frequent this place regularly with my wife and kids. We are able to ride bikes over to it and enjoy dinner or breakfast on the large patio out back and take our bikes over to our table!!!!   Ahi Tuna sandwich is amazing along  with Joe's Big Breakfast for the early rides..."}
{"text":"Love this place - the local atmosphere and the set up is awesome. Such a great gem right here in GILBERT!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I ordered the BBQ pork plate the portion was HUGE, I couldn't finish it all!!! It was so delicious. Pricing is extremely fair!!! I love the seating area outside, its like having a picknick!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this restaurant from several different sources and all recommended it.  First, let me say it isn't easy to find if you are unfamiliar with the area. However, once you locate it, it is worth it.  Being from the Midwest and growing up on breaded pork tenderloins, my friend and I decided we would try the pork tenderloins at Joe's. Wow! This is the best I've had outside of Iowa.  The size was not for the faint-hearted. As a side, my friend ordered the onion rings and I ordered the fried green beans. Both were very good, but be forewarned,- you have to really like garlic (which I do) if you get the fried green beans.  There are so many other good-sounding items on the menu that we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"It's ok. Reminds me of a cafeteria. The food is just ok. Not great. You have to wait in line for food then find a place to sit and then get your food   The prices are a bit high.   Check it out for yourselves but do go in with high expectations."}
{"text":"Amazing food and hang.   We went at 11:30am and there was a wait BUT ITS WORTH IT!   My buddy got the lamb burger and was in heaven. I got the salad and it beats every other salad you can get. Tons of veggies in it: beets, bell peppers, corn, + more. Fries were standard and good. Tried my friends fried zucchini, very good.  Cheesecake very good.  And the owner or manager working was more than helpful and kind. Her name is Summer. She made sure we had everything we needed.   And man, eating outside in the beautiful weather in the shade just topped it off perfectly!"}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible fly problem. Outside is a constant swarm, inside is 2 or 3 per table.  GROSS!"}
{"text":"Once again come on Guy you must be eating different food then they serve me... I have given Joe's farm grill two try's now and not impressed with the long lines to everything there... Frist visit ordered the same meal guy did Ahi Tuna Sandwich (Grilled rare, wasabi mayo Asian slaw with fries I also bought a order of onions rings... Well I was waiting I was so lucky to watch a loop of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives of Joes's Farm Grill on tvs they have there... My number is called and I get my food from the window the ahi is not rare at all so over cooked the oinion rings are so greasy and are not good this guy bummed... Second trip I have to wait 20 people deep out the door for lunch I order the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger (6oz, thick cut apple wood smoked bacon, blue cheese, hand breaded onion rings and Joe's real BBQ sauce... Once again it was not this meal that I was hoping for it was just ok really greasy and filling not my kind of meal... I will go back one more time in hopes that the 3rd will be the charm."}
{"text":"I came here for Father's Day with my family and my cousins family. It was spectacular. We ordered a feast of food that range from rib sandwiches onion rings samplers you name it. Only thing that bugged me was eating outside because there were so many flies, other than that everything was cooked to perfection and I love coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Very cool place with great food! Just wish parents knew how to control their children so others can enjoy their meal. This is a restaurant not the city park."}
{"text":"Would leave them 0 stars if I could. Put in a 7 person order and they did not bring me my meal. This place sucks."}
{"text":"A LOT of hype surrounding this place because of Triple D (the Show on Food Network)  Anyway, been here for breakfast and lunch and always looking forward to coming back.  This morning all the normal breakfast foods were loved.  My kids love this place and are always happy with breakfast.   I love the pulled pork sandwich & ribs and everything else I have ever had here.  Truly a great place.  I have not tried the pastrami and some of the other stuff that has made this place famous, but I will eventually get to it.    This place has a really great environment too - good for kids.  They do have seats inside if you are wondering.  You do not have to sit outside if there are open tables inside.  Every time I have gone there has been places to sit inside.   Go try it if you have been thinking about it.  Really great food and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a great place to bring your kids and let them run around while you enjoy watching them and chatting with whomever you are eating with. It's very casual and the food is great. I've really only had one bad experience, but I've been here so many times with great experiences that I can't hold it against them. I definitely recommend it if you have kids. Not so much for a date or anything like that."}
{"text":"Boy is this place popular,,,when i drove up,i thought there was some sort of event happening looking at the long line. I persevered the wait and the environment was well worth it. With the right kind of weather its as cool a place as you can hope for. It has a huge tree that provides it great character. Folks with their pets and some with their exotic birds provide a great add on. The food was good,although i found everything from the ribs and the shake to be a little too sweet. Still i will reiterate the ambiance will keep bringing me back here. I understand its a family place,but addition of a beer option in the outdoor setting would be a super addition"}
{"text":"Great eats.  A little something for everyone.  Nice service and decent prices.  We try to visit regularly."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for our weekly lunch and it was a really cool dining experience.  It's very no fuss, it's set up like a fast food place, you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window.  Then they give you a buzzer that will go off when your food is ready while you go pick a place outside to eat.  The food is amazing!  You can tell how fresh everything is and it's cooked great too.  I can't wait to go back and get another great burger!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place has great burgers and the sweet potato fries are excellent. They have all kinds of organic options which is awesome and it has a nice little outside area that is great for families and good people watching. It's in a fairly secluded and quiet area also.  You pay a little bit more for the organic foods that they raise there, but I think it's worth it. Definitely a destination in the easy valley that's worth driving to. One way to save money is to share the order of fries since they're pretty big."}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious! Friendly!  The owner Joe,  I just love him.  He is a humble Christian man. Thanks you Joe."}
{"text":"These guys deliver EVERY time.  Such great, respectful service, fun environment and fantastic food.  The menu has so much variety and something for everyone.  Appreciate their commitment to excellence.  Can't say enough good things about Joe's."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly staff. Always packed so go early!! I love good breakfast so keep it up y'all :-)"}
{"text":"I had heard all the hype and read all the awesome Yelp reviews of this place so I decided to try it out for my birthday. It's pretty awesome how they give you a $10 credit toward your meal (must be on your actual birthday). I ordered the Fontina burger which includes bell pepper, mushroom, and fontina cheese. Upon first bite, I could immediately tell the difference from other establishments in terms of freshness and taste. Normally bland lettuce actually had a fresh taste and crunch to it! The cheese brought me back to my trip to Italy in terms of quality! It really does make a difference when you use locally grown ingredients. For dessert I ordered the German Chocolate Shake which was downright heavenly as well.  NOTE to Vegans: Don't let the meat pics steer you away -- they have vegan options too!  My family is coming out to visit in about a week and I cannot wait to introduce them to Joe's Farm Grill!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  The food is great!  One of my favorites is the Farm Burger.  The most amazingly fresh greens!  This is a great place to bring the family.  After dinner, my kids love to run around and play with the other kids around and the parents can have time to hang out.  Don't forget!  You've gotta come here on your birthday!  They'll knock off $10 from your bill to say Happy Birthday!  Awesome place!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Joe's? It goes without saying that this place is great. Their garlic fries put Gilroy to shame, the onion rings are devilish, all of their shakes are top-notch. Then there's the beet salad and grilled veggie pizza...I could go on forever.   This quaint farm house turned restaurant really has it figured out.   And I always go next door to the Coffee Shop for an after-lunch/dinner latte."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Fontina burger is amazing! Along with sweet potato fries and vanilla bean shake. High quality food with delicious ingredients. There is tons of outdoor picnic tables to enjoy the AZ sunshine. If the line is long don't worry it goes fast and short wait time for your food too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  The garlic fries and shakes are the best!  I love their banana pudding shake!  Their pesto chicken sandwich and chicken caesar salad are delicious.  The wait can be long.  I recommend ordering by phone and picking up at the pickup window during busy times.  You have to pay by credit card in advance but you can bypass the wait and still eat there if you want."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Priced right.  I go there every chance I get, especially on my birthday."}
{"text":"Delicious Farm Veggie Burger, and my husband raved about his BBQ Pork. The lemonade was to die for as well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a couple weeks ago when I had family visiting. I was really looking forward to breakfast as their waffles looked so good but we got there 10 mins too late. We stayed and got lunch instead, it was really good! I got the chicken strips and fried zucchini. So good! We can't wait to go back and try their breakfast. Loved the outdoor seating. And the employees were all really friendly. There was an elderly woman there with a service dog and I was very impressed with how attentive and caring they all were with her. Will definitely start coming more regularly!"}
{"text":"Just before the new year my husband and I took my dad to Joe's.  My dad is a big fan of triple D so Joe's was the perfect place.  The line was really short and just as we were ordering, we noticed all of a sudden the line was about 20 people deep.    We ordered EVERYTHING!  I got the burger w/ cheese and sweet potato fries.  My husband got the chicken BBQ pizza, dad got the ahi tuna sandwich w/ sweet potato fries.  Of course we just had to get an order of onion rings (featured on triple D show) and two vanilla milk shakes.  I have to say that hands down my favorite thing was the BBQ pizza.  It has the perfect balance of chicken, bacon, blue cheese crumbles all drizzled with Joe's BBQ sauce...mmm the best.  I would also say that the sweet potato fries are worth the upgrade price and I didn't leave a single one on my plate...sweet, salty and no too crunchy.  Seating is limited when its cold outside so I recommend beating the dinner rush like us."}
{"text":"Quintessential Gilbert. Thank you Joe!  Fram Grill serves fantastic meals in a cozy space suited for both indoor or outdoor seating. Regardless of party size, the Farm Grill can accommodate you! There awesome picnic tables scattered outside, many of them situated under large shade trees to keep you out of that AZ sun. If air conditioning is your thing, then there are plenty of indoor seats that provide a much cooler climate during the summer daze.  If you've dined at one of Joe's other restaurants you know the food will be good. All ingredients are sourced locally, and many of the veggies are farmed right behind the shop in Agrotopia farms. You can walk over after your meal to watch them harvest the greens, spices, veggies, etc. And let me tell you, when you are biting into that freshly grilled hamburger you can taste how fresh those onions and leaf lettuce is! It's awesome. The salads are massive in size and super fresh. There's a couple of BBQ items that are delicious too.   Drink options are fun. The organic brand Tractor Soda is served here and they offer fun and unique carbonated flavors such as Cola, Root Beer, Ginger Beer, Cherry Cream, Coconut, Blood Orange, Lemon Grass, Meyer Lemon and Cucumber. They are awesome!! (You can also grab a traditional canned soda if you're not feeling adventurous).   Breakfast is served here as well, and there's a great kids menu for both breakfast and lunch. Joe has really built up this corner of Gilbert- there's an awesome coffee shop steps away from the Farm Grill if you'd like a nice espresso after your meal. Grab an award winning cupcake there if there's any room left in your stomach! Walk a few more paces and visit the new hangar co-op space. You'll find cool wares and food there too!  Such a fun, family friendly experience at Joe's Farm Grill. You're missing out if you don't make a trip soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger joint I've been too. There's nothing I've tried that I didn't like. I LOVE 4B Burger and my wife usually gets the Fontina Burger with a gluten free bun and extra pesto. Don't miss out on choosing  from 4 different kinds of fries or grab their famous onion rings!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER EVER. I had the Fontina burger with zucchini chips & it was great. Tastes like a real cookout burger made with tlc. The zucchini was pretty good. Homemade marinara. So so so good. My roommates both had Bacon BBQ burgers; they liked it."}
{"text":"The Saturday afternoon we stopped in with our dog was stunning, weather-wise. This, of course, meant that the rest of the world also read the many positive Yelp reviews and knew it was the perfect day to stop into Joe's. Why waste a sunny, cool day inside?  I waited in the half-hour-long line while Husband sat in back with the dog at one of the picnic tables once the line started getting inside. There was a worker dude who would helpfully hand out laminated menus to us line-standers and answer any questions we had. He highly suggested the Fontina burger, but I already knew what I wanted: a cheeseburger with sautéed onions, a side of onion rings and fried zucchini, and a chocolate milkshake.   After I ordered, I was given a little buzzer/beeper thingy for when the food was ready. It took just long enough for me to check out their super clean bathroom with the dolls in the walls and the doll movie on the tv before the food was ready. YUM that milkshake! I really liked my cheeseburger, but Husband wasn't too impressed. We both liked the onion rings, but left a lot of the fried zucchini in favor of drinking our milkshakes (he got vanilla bean). My biggest problem actually ended up being the ranch that we requested for the sides... it tasted really off. The consistency wasn't right and it didn't compliment the food at all. I am a firm believer that onion rings need to be dunked in something, so I ended up dunking in my ketchup. It worked, but I wished for something better.  There were a lot of other dogs lying around under picnic tables, so that was pretty cool to see. There is also a bird group that gathers (I'm pretty sure they were parrots, but I can't say for sure. I know they were very colorful and friendly!) some weekends out at one of the front tables while they eat. Parents and kids would wander over to talk to the bird handlers, which was neat. Definitely a family AND dog friendly place."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood next to JFG, so I've been here a handful of times. First, be prepared for a long line, any day of the week.  I've had the ahi tuna salad, but if u want an ahi tuna salad go to a sushi restaurant, I don't really recommend that from JFG.  I'm a big fan of the hot dogs, recommend them. Strange tho, that they dont serve a chili dog, or have any chili for that matter. But be warned - they always seem to send me immediately straight for a bathroom, if you know what I mean.... Or maybe it's just me. The BBQ pizza flatbread was a little on the bland side. The date shake was okay, the shakes in the middle of nowhere Dateland, AZ are better. The pumpkin pie shake, however, is delish - recommend highly.  The food is decent, but pretty expensive for just \"decent\" food, and really long lines. At some point I'm sure I'll go back, since I live right next to it and people who visit always want to try it and see what it's all about because they saw it on Triple D. Rumor has it, that they have good breakfast, which I've never tried, and somewhat interested in."}
{"text":"We ate here with our two kids a few days ago.  My wife had been here before, but I had not.  I loved the food.  I had the BBQ bacon burger, my wife had a simple grilled cheese, and my oldest son had corn dog bites.  We all loved our food.  The food wasn't the best I've ever eaten, but I liked that the restaurant was different than your normal restaurant.    Really enjoyed ourselves.  Will be back."}
{"text":"What a great concept, great place for kids and a great atmosphere. The food is pretty good but a little dry on the chicken, staff was friendly and looked organized. I will deff come here and eat again and cant wait cause the weather is so nice to enjoy outside. also the coffee house next door is great try it"}
{"text":"Wow! That sums it up. Great food. The fried shrimp are giant tender and juicy! The garlic fries were delicious. Fried green beans are my favorite. I was not a fan of the fontina burger I ordered it because it was a diners drive in's dives favorite.  I am still giving this place 5 stars there was nothing wrong with the burger, it just did not suit my taste. I will definitely go back. Cool place!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I had a regular hamburger. It was very average, the only reason this restaurant gets hype is because of the atmosphere. I added a star just for that reason, because the outdoor area is cute. The second time I went there I thought I'd try their farm veggie burger. What a mistake... That was the worst veggie burger I have ever had in my life! It was bland, the rice in it was overcooked, I could only eat one bite. The first one they gave me was burnt, so I told the cook. All they did was cook me another one, and it was still bland and disgusting. I would have ordered something else, but I didn't have the money to. That's another issue, this place is overpriced. I'm not sure if I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Super super yummy!  Traditional authentic American food.  I like authenticity, fusion creations can be a bit salty when the chefs try to keep the flavors together.  But farm fresh right to the plate is exactly what I appreciate about this place.  The burgers are big, the shakes are milky and basic, and the fries are awesome! Consistently delivering good quality food.  I like it."}
{"text":"Overrated. Food is meh. Expensive for what you get. Nothing has ever really impressed me. I feel like both of the other \"Joe's\" establishments are way better (Joe's real BBQ & Liberty Market) - I'd rather go to those any day."}
{"text":"Everything was super fresh. And the food was very delicious. Portions were good as well. When we first arrived there was a little bit of a line, but you can tell the servers have a lot of practice and were able to move through the line very smoothly.  As we were eating we noticed that the line was even much longer, burnt the time we finished eating the line had once again disappeared.    We will be heading back there for sure, and soon"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and, honestly, I don't understand the fuss. Maybe because it was featured on diners, drive ins and dives? The food is good, but not smack your mama good. A fairly simple menus with family- friendly dining is what you'll get, nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"I will say the food is AMAZING! The butter pecan shake and garlic fries are wonderful - I am alway down for that combo! However, my husband has experienced problems when modifying his order. Normally he gets a chicken sandwich with just meat, cheese, and lettuce. He will ask for second piece of chicken to add to it - and every single time they seem to not get it right. I personally love the food enough to come back, but if only they can get our order right!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a burger and sit outside in the shade under the trees. Very laid back and kid and dog friendly."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day, it was great! They do an excellent job of getting you through the line and taking your order even when it's packed! The food was delicious and came out fast. Servers were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love the Ahi Tuna burgers -  cannot forget to mention those garlic fries."}
{"text":"Would have given them 5 stars, but they only have 2 restrooms for the whole restaurant.  But, aside from that, the food is great, the service is awesome, and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of my husband's favorite restaurants and we love that we can eat outdoors here.  The menu has a lot of great food and the quantities are large, so often my husband and I will split one thing and get either onion rings or the garlic fries.  We love their BBQ Chicken Pizza, too.    Any of their burgers and salads that we've tried are good.  So yummy.  And, they are always so friendly.  That is why there is often a long line to get into the place.  Even though, the line does move quickly.  This is a great place for the family to eat and for dates with my husband with the kids.    The food is delicious.  The ribs are cooked differently than Joe's Real BBQ, but they are delicious nonetheless.    The atmosphere, surroundings of Joe's is also very comforting and peaceful.  We love Joe's Farm Grill.  And it's not too far from where we live either!"}
{"text":"Great food, Quick service and a great location down town. Keeping it simple. Great place for a lunch meeting or after work hanging out with friends and family. I loved the ribs!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the first time I went I got the chicken sandwhich and thought it was ok. But the second time I got the burger that was on tv with onion rings. It was AMAZING!  If your going to go somewhere because they are famous for something get what they are famous for!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to come for a local restaurant! It was featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives and is worthy of its feature. I personally like the chicken sandwich, the grilled cheese, and garlic fries. My husband loves the buffalo chicken sandwich. Sometimes there is a long wait, but it is worth it! There is something for everyone in the family and has a very fun atmosphere. The picnic tables in the back under the trees are perfect for the family to hang out and enjoy a yummy dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many are crazy for this dive.  I have eaten lunch there many times when working in the area.  The food is good, but not remarkable.  The line to get in the place is insane - way too long and way too slow - which is the reason for my 2-star rating.  I've yet to find a restaurant worth waiting this long in line for - this one included.  The decor is definitely low class dump.  The dining room is packed at lunch, often with screaming kids.  There is seating outside, but the Arizona summer makes this downright dangerous.  Joe's is best if you can do an early lunch and I mean EARLY.  Getting there at 1130 doesn't cut it.  Try 1045 or 1100 unless you like wasting your lunch hour standing in a line out the front door.  Eat there if you must, but there are many other better options within a couple of blocks."}
{"text":"A group of us went to eat at Joe's Farm Grill. This is the epitome of a non fancy dining experience! To be honest, it was crowded, we had to wait in line, and the decor is not something to write home about, however, the food was good. Rather than write all the comments given to me by my companions, I have chosen to write some of them down verbatim.  \"The ahi tuna sandwich looked really good, and one of our party really enjoyed it. The burgers were nice and big, and I couldn't believe the size of the fried shrimp. The ribs were really tasty, and the pulled pork was some of the best I've ever had. All in all, a good time was had by all.\"  \"I've also never seen a bathroom with a television in it before! Quite the experience.\"  \"The grilled salmon platter was delicious. I could have taken home a tub of the garlic aioli, it was so good!\"  Its a bit of an unusual experience to go there, but it's a great place for families especially with a bunch of kids.  3 stars for quality and amount of food."}
{"text":"My family visited for the dad and my dad was set on trying this place.   One of the coolest places I have been to in Gilbert and the scenery definitely made the meal. I ordered the ahi sandwich, bbq chicken pizza, farm burger. For the sides we had fried green beans and garlic fries.  Between me, my mom, and my dad we all had different favorites so I will just say everything was really good. We finished our meal to milk shakes which were also yummy and walking around the properties.  The entire experience was awesome and really made the visit with my parents extra special"}
{"text":"7/07/10  Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?  Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my \"recent\" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!"}
{"text":"Went to Joe's on a whim and it payed off!  The food was diner fare with a twist on modern. Many have stated before the fontina burger is OMG! Oozing with fontina cheese, mushrooms, red peppers and farm goodness. So get it, you will be grateful to cows.  I was eying the people who ordered pizza and almost asked for a slice to try...but alas bad form.  Will I go back, sure...the drive is a little daunting but the food is oh so appealing."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I took my girlfriends that were visiting from all over the country to Joe's Farm Grill - after taking them to a bunch of fancy restaurants in Scottsdale no less. Joe's beat out the competition across the board. I highly recommend the farm burger with blue cheese and grilled onions. And don't forget to substitute with sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"\"Hidden Gem\".. Very Tasty and Reasonable prices...I will Definitely be returning..Relocating from The Midwest..I'm Soo Happy to have FINALLY!! found some Decent food in Az.. Joes Farm Grill is just as Awesome!"}
{"text":"People were extremely polite and professional with big smiles on their faces. Both my wife and I ordered the Farm Burger and we both absolutely loved the burger and fries. The young lady warned me about the level of heat and spice on the pepper jack cheese and I was pleasantly surprised. Extremely good food and very nice staff. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I heard everyone rave about this place but I was disappointed.  The wait in line to order was almost 30 min.  To me that is ridiculous when you can walk into another restaurant and get served immediately.  I also thought their prices were high when their food was just okay."}
{"text":"Last Sunday, second day in the Phoenix area...  Blame Yelp for this review... I would have never found this attraction on my own!  Joe's Farm Grill is housed in a Tomorrowland-like building construction with Glass and Steel framing that was pretty popular during the 50s when architects during that era deemed the use of a lot of Glass the wave of the future. A \"get-it-yourself\" fountain drink dispenser is located outside the building... which makes it available for the people sitting in the outside Patio and at the Picnic Tables... but it's kind of a hassle for diners inside, that do not prefer the \"fresh air\". As I walked into the establishment... I was very surprised to see another Disneyland-like feature seen only at amusement parks...  a snake-like waiting-line area. I had to pinch myself... Where was I? Disneyland or Gilbert, Arizona?   The actual Dining area is divided into two spaces... the front area has a dual function of being an ordering area and a dining area; there is also a rear dining area more suited for larger groups such as families separated by a see-through wall.   First impression after ordering and being handed a beeper to notify us when our order was ready... Dang, it's HUMID in here! At 10am on a Sunday, with the restaurant only 2/3rds full... the humidity was a little irritating... I would not like this place later in the day when occupancy reaches 100% and the temperature reached 110 degrees.  FLIES, FLIES... and more Flies!!! This was my second observation... In the waiting time for the Buzzer to go off, I had performed the following entomological analysis... You have two kinds of this nuisance at Joe's Farm Grill... Before you get your food, you get buzzed around your dome by these real-small flies that are attracted by your body orifices. Then... after you get your meal, the small guys disappear and then you have to deal with larger flies that are attracted by your food. I don't know which ones were worse... the Big Flies going after your food, or the Teeny-Weeny ones trying to use you as a human incubator for their progeny. Yes, I had THAT much time while waiting for the Beeper to start Flashing! All this despite the Orkin fluorescent Bug-Killers! Take me out of this friggin' Healthy Outdoors!   SWAT! SWAT! SWAT! Now for the Food Review...   PLASTIC PLATES???  All entrees are served on Black Plastic plates - another AMUSEMENT PARK feature!!! When I picked up my meal for my friend and I, I thought to myself... \"Joe's Farm Grill is actually receiving 4-Stars... for using Plastic Plates?!?!\". Of course, the plastic must be recyclable or environmentally friendly. I don't know of any other restaurant on Yelp that can get away with this without getting penalized in the ratings...  Pancakes & Fresh Fruit (**** 1/2 $6.49) Stack of Four, Fresh Fruit, Whipped Cream and Syrup. Smaller than average Pancakes, but the Pancakes were made just right with very good consistency; Fruit consisted of quite a bit of Blueberries, Raspberries, and Strawberries. VERY, Very good.  Meat & Potato Scramble (** 1/2 $7.99) Skillet Potatoes, Bacon, Sausage, & Ham with four Cheeses. A less than memorable Scramble... maybe because it was SALTY!!! Healthful? NOPE!   This Scramble could have been the Freshest Scramble ever... Would have never known that with the Saltiness masking everything.  Iced Tea (*** $1.99) All you can drink in a smallish cup... if you get it yourself... OUTSIDE... in the 110 degree HEAT!   Afterwards, my friend and I walked outside, to get away from the architectural masterpiece I refer to as a humidifier, where the most impressive part of the restaurant location was... the humongous Trees! But, I have to wonder why anyone would Picnic underneath these trees, though... You have to wonder why all the limbs are supported by HUGE steel Stanchions, as large as the limbs they're supporting, embedded in the ground. And... hasn't anyone that pic-nicked under the trees read the warning signs for falling branches and the danger of climbing on said branches?  Last observation... which is the most disconcerting... With the restaurant 2/3rds of capacity.... only two couples of \"color\"? Look around you when you arrive at Joe's... you can perform the math yourself. Unfortunately, I notice things like that...  I also noticed quite a few reviews that mention the TV show, \"Diners,  Drive-In's & Dives\"... When has a TV show been the arbiter of what is a good restaurant? Frankly, I'd rather \"find\" my favorite dining establishments myself.   I really admire the idea of Self-Sufficiency and Sustainability in the Joe's Farm Grill which supposedly results in better Health for the patrons and Fresh Produce for the restaurant. Does this result in \"good\" food compared to \"other\" less-healthful, non-sustainable restaurants? Regrettably, No."}
{"text":"Everything that we tried on the means was soooooo delicious! You could really taste the difference in the quality of food. The staff was kind and our food came quick. The atmosphere was was fun. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food but pricey. Was excited to go there for my birthday and have to say the staff ruined it. We called ahead to see if they had pizza (the only thing there my little one will eat there) and were told they did. When we got there 20 minutes later were told they that no pizza and were all but laughed at when we explained we even called ahead and were told they did. No offer to help and no manager to be found. Huge disappointment and epic fail for the staff and their condescending attitude."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! This place is just an absolutely awesome place for breakfast!  My friend had the Green Eggs and Ham and I was jealous over my perfectly cooked Belgian Waffle with fruit. The ambience is amazing ; you sit outside next to the beautiful garden where the spices and veggies are growing.  Another Triple D find right in my neighborhood!  I'll be going again and again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic onion rings! Outrageous tiger shrimp! Ridiculous sweet potato pie & blueberry-bourbon cheesecake! Don't walk, run to this establishment for tastilicious entrees!"}
{"text":"A walk around the Riparian Preserve had given us an appetite, so we stopped in here for dinner. As soon as I saw the Yelp sticker on the door, I knew we were in for a good meal.   Above the ordering counter are TV screens featuring the episode of DD&D they were on. It was because of these (and my general level of starvation at the time) that I was willing to cough up the funds for an $8 burger.  While it wasn't as mouth-wateringly delicious as a BluBurger, it was certainly tasty, as were the sweet potato fries. My friend ordered the ribs, which she loved, and which have fed her for several meals since. Also, the regular fries are deelish.  One oddity is that all the drinks and condiments are outside. I wonder how the mayo holds up in 115° weather?"}
{"text":"Cute touristy spot. Prices aren't too bad, but there's a LONG line almost all the time so be prepared to wait!   Great place to take pictures.  Nice looking coffee shop next door - haven't visited yet but it's on my list."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere and delicious food! The bathroom is definitely a must see, you would never expect it."}
{"text":"Joe's is my favorite place in Gilbert! Farm Fresh food, fun atmosphere, and great service. What more could I ask for! I try something different every time I go, but I always get that blackberry lemonade! So fresh and delicious. Living less than a mile from here is dangerous! Keep killing it Joe's!"}
{"text":"Joe's is awesome. It's a great place to go for a mom's lunch when you have to bring the little ones cause they can play outside. The food is good (except the fried stuff is on the greasy side - esp the fried green beans.) I love getting the beets with goat cheese and the grilled veggie pizza. It's just a fun, casual hang out.  -- Oh, the bathrooms are cool, and I love the outside handwashing station."}
{"text":"Food is great! Big portions and worth the money. Lots of variety and a really fun atmosphere. It's really nice to sit outside. The lines can be long though so be prepared!"}
{"text":"First time I have ever eaten at Joes Farm Grill  I have eaten at Joe's BBQ, which has great food so I was expecting the same...... Well I got better. We had breakfast and it was delecious. By far the best bacon I have ever had. I got a waffle as well and it was so fluffy and tasty. I have yet to try the lunch and dinner menu but the breakfast will keep me coming back. Outdoor seating is nice and if its to warm inside is avaliable as well :)"}
{"text":"We lived about a 1/2 mile away from the farm grill and would pass it almost everyday. it always looked like an interesting place  and knew the ingredients were fresh with the huge field right next door. After we saw it on food network, we knew we had to go check it out. We were not disappointed at all.   The first time (of several) that we have been, I got a burger with the bleu cheese on it ( I can't remember the name of it off hand) but it was cooked perfectly and I made the perfect choice of having onion rings instead of fries. OMG they were good. We have tried almost everything on the menu with that original burger and onion rings being my favourite so far.  When people come into town, we usually try to take them to the farm grill and no one has ever had a bad meal or walked away disappointed. if someone asks me where to get some good food, I instantly think of Joe's Farm Grill.  Oh yeah, the drink station and bathrooms are cool!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Shakes are awesome. Deep fried green beans are my favorite. Everything is fresh, local, or organic. Worth the trip. We love to bring a blanket and eat out on the grass. Family friendly."}
{"text":"I used to like this place quite a bit. Food was never anything amazing considering the price but was decent and the ambiance and atmosphere was always pleasant plus my kids enjoyed the sights and sounds. Ate here a few days ago following the remodel and aside from a little more indoor seating was surprised to see nothing else had really changed. Still one cashier who was rude and some good menu items now gone. Also, did the burgers shrink or buns grow?  Food quality was rather lackluster.   The worst change however was the absolutely horrific drink selection. The tractor soda is without question the nastiest stuff ever created. I looked around and 99% of people were drinking water or tea and anyone who tried the organic fountain drinks immediately dumped them out. Joes farm grill will survive off name and reputation regardless of my review but man what a disappointment it is now. My wife and I agreed the day we were there that there was no longer any point in going there and added it to our list of places we no longer need to visit. On the plus side I'll save $50 bucks on lunches and add minutes to my life doing other things then waiting in line for mediocre food and drinks."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but worth it.  The atmosphere here is all the best things of living in Arizona.  A neighborhood bar, local food, outdoor community seating and the DATE SHAKES are to die for!  Whether you are there for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a snack this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday and it was great!  I had the grill cheese and salad both delicious. The atmosphere is really cool too. Nice to eat outside. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally went here with some friends for dinner tonight after wanting to check it out for a long time.  The BBQ chicken pizza lived up to the hype.  The same for the chocolate shake.  I also really enjoyed the sweet potato fries though I still think the Breakfast Club's are the best in the known universe.  I also snagged one of my friend's onion rings and it was pretty darn good, too.  I'll be sure to get those next time.  The quantity and quality of the food is definitely worth the price.  But the decor inside was disappointing.  I would recommend coming here on a nice afternoon so that you can sit outside.  Absolutely do not come here on a winter evening like we did since we were all freezing and our food got cold fast."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible this place is. The food is so fresh they grow it mostly on the farm there. Sashimi grade tuna sandwich was out of this world. Great place to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the last few years and tried something new each time. Nothing has ever wowed me. It wasn't bad, but nothing outstanding. I keep going back thinking they were just having a bad day, but most items are just bland."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill was recommended by a friend who went their twice on their last visit to Arizona.  She raved about the food and the date shakes.  Yup, DATE SHAKES!    So during our Spring Training trip to Arizona, we had to go to Joe's Farm Grill.  A heads up - there is a long line to place your order.  But, the atmosphere is so nice and with good company, the line moves along nicely with great conversation.  If you have little ones, there is plenty of space to run around and they even supply sidewalk chalk to help occupy them.  If you can, grab a menu while you're in line because if you're like me, you're not going to be able to decide what you want right away!  Tempting gourmet burgers, sandwiches and salads... pizza and BBQ... fresh beet salad and DATE SHAKES!    I chose the Seared Ahi Sandwhich which was delicious.  I would have liked the tuna to be a little more rare, but the condiments and the bread more than made up for the over-cooked tuna.  And the date shake did not disappoint!  It was so refreshing and lightly sweet!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree first & foremost with the FLY INFESTATION theory! they really really REALLY need to control it, being indoors doesnt stop them at all!! last time 2 of us went there it somehow came up to $50 which was insane! they are good but....  coleslaw is very very plain/flavorless, i still eat it. the ribs are very good, shakes = good, atmosphere good. I do have to agree it does get very loud sometimes, generally quiet and not busy in the early afternoon. OH DO NOT I REPEAT, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING FOR THE FRIES i substituted onion rings they added on $2 more and gave me like 5 onion rings!!! I do like the fact they seperate the trash/plastic/recycling etc.. im sure ill be back WITH MY OWN FLYSWATTER!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So the management of Joe's contacted me about my experience.  They genourously offered a giftcard for a revisit.  I can honestly say that shocked me tremendously.  While Joe's is a pretty far drive for me, I thought it only fair to give them a second shot.  My second experience was definitely better than the first.  We switched it up and tried the pizza and fish sandwich. had to get the onion rings also, to see if the ones from my first visit were unusually bad.  I am happy to report that the food this time around was much better.  The onion rings this time around were crisp and fresh.  The ingredients are fresh, and you can definitely taste it.  Overall I believe my first experience was a random fluke....I guess every place has a 'bad day.  Overall I would give Joe's 4 stars, BUT, customer service is huge, and I appreciate being contacted regarding my prior experience, so the 5th star is for excellent customer service."}
{"text":"joe's farm grill is the perfect substitute when i am in need of joe's real bbq, but low on gas. this place is right next door to my regular caffeine fix (the coffee shop) and close to my humble abode. the owner, joe, has essentially bottled up retro dining mixed with great service and sold it.   joe converted his old home into a fresh, order-at-the-counter style grub hut. the menu has all the essentials: ribs and pork sandwiches, chicken everything, hot dogs, grilled cheese...and sides galore. the fountain drinks and condiments are located outside (restrooms too!). be patient with the poor mayo. it comes slow, but steady.  i've only been here a handful of times, but so far: so wonderful. the pulled pork sandwich tastes just like the one at his bbq restaurant. the fire-roasted broccoli is a yummy side. i like to eat outside under the misters and soak in the children's laughter as they frolic to their heart's content. the farm grill has such a wholesome vibe. it's a good day in the neighborhood at joe's!"}
{"text":"So bummed about my experience today.  Usually I would rate Joe's Farm Grill a 4 or 5, but today I was greeted by a shock.  The usually delicious pesto chicken salad is a bite of flavor and wonder. It was with this expectation I phoned in a to go order today.  When I got home I found the sandwich burned.  The only tasty today is char.  :(. Everybody has a bad day, so let's hope today was it."}
{"text":"Cute cute location and atmosphere.  Eating outside here for lunch on the tables is very serene, and it's a nice stroll outside to look at the different gardens the farm has.  The onion rings were very crispy and flavorful, and I had the tuna sandwich which was a very big portion and very tasty (albeit messy).  I wasn't impressed by the strawberry milkshake, which did not have enough strawberry flavor to distinguish it much from a vanilla shake.  The prices are a bit high, but the ingredients are high quality."}
{"text":"Overrated. This place is obviously unique scenery-wise. It is neat that they use local food that was grown around here. The burger is what I had. It was decent but didn't blow me away. I heard the chicken is good though. I would suggest not sitting outside unless you want flies all over you. (This could happen to be just this time of the year). The place is usually packed which may force you to sit outside."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent a perfect afternoon at Joe's enjoying the beautiful weather. Lots of outside seating under the trees provided a great time. She has driven past this place and always wanted to stop, but finally got the chance while we were waiting on her car to be serviced. I have only been one other time and it was a few years ago. I always think it is further from our house than it really is.   We arrived and the line to order was to the door, but it moved quickly. They had two lunch specials that day: a pork tenderloin sandwich and a Gouda bacon garlic burger. We ordered one of each. She had the beet salad side and I the onion rings. The onion rings were huge, and the beets were not that bad either. I tried to eat the sandwich normally, but it was so huge. I tried to fold it over, but ended up just eating it with a fork and knife. A lady came around while we were line and announced the specials. I am not sure if she was a manager or the owner, but she sold it. While we were outside she came around two times talking to people and making sure everything was good. Excellent personal touch of customer service. She also talked up the pecan milkshake so we had to get that before we left. Great place and I am already eager to go back."}
{"text":"i like dis place.  so, please know that this place can get very crowded. its also on the \"expensive\" side, in my opinion. the good news is, they have a ton of seating and they give you a lot of food so you do get what you pay for.  i have ordered a veggie burger with a side of fries here twice. it is awesome and super filling. a good veg option. the fries are yummy as well! BUUUUUUT  the fried greens beans tho  order them. my brother got them as a side with his burger and i wanted to eat. them. all.  SO GOOD. i'd also recommend the onion rings because they are crunchy and seasoned to perfection.  my son and my dad love their milkshakes. my mom loves several of their salads. i think you cannot go wrong if you bring a bunch of people here, there is something for everyone"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, once for coffee/breakfast at their place in the back and the next for dinner to sample the burgers I had read about.  I love the ambiance here and the casual dining on picnic tables outside on their lovely grounds, and the food is a notch above decent, and fresh, for sure.  We will most likely be back, just because it's a cool little spot with good food."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing! The atmosphere, fresh food, and relaxation! The Fontana burger was the best and I would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to come out here after seeing it on a episode on the Food Network. We were pleasantly surprised that the line moved so quickly and fortunately for us the weather was really nice so sitting outside was a bonus. We ordered a chicken sandwich for the MIL, a Ahi Tuna Salad for the wife and I got the bacon, garlic gouda burger.   My only real gripe is that I asked how the burgers were cooked. I was initially told medium rare, and then told no that it would be pink. I told them I was OK with that just that I hated overcooked, dry burgers. Unfortunately when the burger arrived there was no pink and it was more on the medium well side. Enough toppings on the burger to help out, but disappointing as the burger itself was on the dry side. We had 18 mo old with us who was non-stop so we didn't bother having it remade. We'd try them again if in the area. A bit expensive though as it was $51 for three people."}
{"text":"Enjoyable burger not quite worth the drive. Drove from Arcadia, to Gilbert to finally try Joe's Farm and Grill.  I had a BBQ Burger which was very good and the fried zucchini was tasty as well.  Both my wife and I were disappointed with the fries, as they were luke warm, soggy, and clearly not made to order.  The setting is also very nice as they have both indoor and outdoor(shaded) seating.  However, in order to have a great burger joint great fries are a must.  I do not think we will make the drive again."}
{"text":"The line to order was SLOOOOW, but food was pretty great. I had the burger (the fontina... I think...) it was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. It was very good. My girlfriend ordered the thai salad with no dressing, which they messed up on, but they fixed it quickly... it was pretty delicious as well."}
{"text":"Trying too hard... they changed their soda fountain to a odd organic brand. Fix the pancakes and coffee. Even the staff won't drink it. They go next door."}
{"text":"Okay, a lot of reviews on this place so I will get right to the points.  Pros: 1. One of the best American Grill style restaurants you can find in town, maybe the best. 2. Great atmosphere, sitting outside is nice when its not hot. 3. Food is very fresh. 4. Food comes out quick once its ordered  Cons: 1. Long lines, expect long wait just to order when its busy. 2. Not the cleanest restaurant that I have been to, I can see its hard to keep all tables/chairs clean when they have so many customers. 3. Possible long line to fill up the drinks 4. Only two family restrooms, line again!  Bottom line, I do recommend this restaurant to everyone, must pick a not so busy time."}
{"text":"Joe's atmosphere gives off this uncomfortable vibe like you're enclosed from the rest of the world. But the food is the freshest food I've eaten anywhere. I had the 4B burger with garlic fries and a vanilla milkshake. Unreal. Every part of the burger was bursting with fresh flavor. The garlic fries and milkshake were perfect complements. Others in my party had the rib and pork combo that had a very strong smokey flavor. Overall, an excellent place to enjoy the nuances of earths finest foods!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. The outdoor seating is great for keeping a toddler occupied and we absolutely love the garlic green beans. The garlic fries were good too but if you have to choose go for the beans!!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine's parents live in Gilbert and he had recommended Joe's Farm Grill when I told him I'd be in town...and I'm glad he did. This is my 4th time here and every time I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The food is amazingly fresh and the service is great. I've tried my fair share of food and I'm yet to find something that wasn't great. The onion rings are a standout item that I would definitely recommend and the Fontina Burger is also a staple. I've eaten next door at their other restaurant named 'The Coffee Shop' and I loved it just as much. I've heard great things about Joe's BBQ, but haven't had a chance to give it a try yet...but it's next on my list."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Joe's Farm Grill, not just because of the food (utterly amazing onion rings), but also because of the surrounding location.  There are huge, interesting looking trees, beautifully kept grounds, and interesting architecture.    It can be quite crowded, which takes away from the ambiance.  But if you go during off hours (in our case, Superbowl Sunday - hey... no Cards... no point in watching), the crowds are minimal and the grounds are very peaceful, which makes it nice to enjoy the food and the mild February weather."}
{"text":"Food is really good & fresh  The seating area indoors smelled pretty bad an was off putting . Really should eat outside anyway to get the full effect . I would go back again but not when it's 100 plus degrees outside"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere. Great for large gatherings. But sometimes it's crowded & hard to move around inside. Go early!!! I also feel the food is a bit overpriced. But they do feed you for free on your birthday!"}
{"text":"This is disappointing for the price. Nothing compared to Joes BBQ. Wont be back. Carl's Jr has a lot better burgers and cheaper. The Farmhouse in downtown Gilbert's coleslaw puts this coleslaw to shame.   Expensive, $34 for two people. For that price we should have had a server. We had to ask someone to clean the tables.   Place is styled like a food court at a theme park but at least there you get better food.  Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food very farm fresh just make sure you are prepared to wait in line if you go during prime time on the weekends. I have never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I loved the feel of this restaurant. When you first pull up you see a huge line. The line moves pretty quickly though. You get to sit in a wonderful area and have fabulous food.   Great spot for kids or if you want to bring your dogs.   The milkshake was to die for."}
{"text":"what a great place. good food and friendly service. but the best of all is the Farm. you can see where all the fresh herbs come form that go into your food. and what a great place to bring the family and guests form out of town... the pizza is to die for.... WOW !"}
{"text":"Went 2 weeks ago and it was delish. The whole gang talked and ate and laughed. A warm breeze blew, the food was tasty and way reasonable. Chandler/Gilbert, AZ has a lot to offer. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Savored every bite of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries. Cole slaw had a little too much onions for my taste. Guy Fieri's recommendations were right on.  My hubby enjoyed the Fontina Burger another must have according to Mr. Fieri. Great place to hang out for great food.  Don't let the lines fool you... It moves fast and worth the short wait. Very casual, so come ready to sit on picnic tables around there grassy lawns. Oh their Medjool Date shake is a perfect sweet treat to your meal. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My sister is not adventurous when it comes to dining experiences.  Her idea of good eating is to go to a restaurant she's been to a billion times to order the same item over and over.  So getting her to eat anywhere that she's never been is hard work!  I convinced her to try out Joe's Farm Grill with me today.  I drive by it on my way to work and on my way to the dog park on a regular basis and was curious about the place.  Was it a farm?  A restaurant? A produce stand?  But I'd forget about looking it up as soon as I drove by!  Well finally I looked it up and was delighted to find out it was a retro-style casual eating place that had (also) featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  So, I named dropped Guy to my sister and she reluctantly agreed to try it out.  I had the fontina burger (dip it in ranch AND ketchup!) and the onion rings, while she had the grilled cheese sandwich and chili fries.  Everything was fresh, hot, not greasy like you'd expect, and amazingly delicious!  Afterward, we walked across the lot to The Coffee Shop where I had a yummy iced latte and we both had \"glam\" cupcakes.  This place is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner.  It's definitely kid-friendly, and even a fun and casual place for a date!  I could even see the potential of throwing a party outside in their patio area.  As for my sister?  She's a total convert.  As soon as we got home, she was on the phone with her boyfriend, gushing about the delicious place we'd just been to, with its retro layout, delicious food, and the too-cute coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is great, the food is delish! Plus, they have sweet potato fries, my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night we decided to have dinner at Joe's Farm Grill.  Apparently this used to be an old house turned \"Dinner\".  My friend kept telling us how great this place is, so we thought we would give it a try.  It's and interesting place but honestly wasn't much different than going to In & Out Burger (walk up - place order -  pick up at window).  It did have a few stylish décor items and kitchy concepts like the soda & sauce fountain station outside (next to the bathroom).   The food was pretty good but my friend got the pork dinner (Shredded Pork, Cole slaw, and he \"upgraded\" his fries from regular to sweet potato, and a drink) and it was over $16 so kind of pricey.     The grounds are cool, because they have a coffee shop next door and it has a sort of  \"Retro\" feel to the whole place.     There did seem to be a TON of kids there, screaming, etc but I guess that's because it has mostly outside seating, or maybe that was just the night we went.    Would I go again?  Probably because the food was good, but just a little concerned about their pricing.  I don't mind spending money on food, but it just seemed overpriced for this type of establishment."}
{"text":"This place is really, really neat. It's a great place to bring the family and let the kids run around. The landscaping around the restaurant is fun to check out, and it's great for a post-meal stroll to work off some of that great food.  Their food is good. It's solid. It's tasty American staples that you absolutely can't go wrong with. But you know what? I can't taste the difference between locally-sourced lettuce, organic lettuce, artisan lettuce, or really much of any sort of lettuce. This place's claim to fame is that they use local ingredients, and ingredients which they grow at their own farm. And that's cool! Support local business!!! And maybe some people can taste a difference between what they purchase at Fry's and what their next door neighbors grow... and to them, I say \"COME ON DOWN AND TASTE PARADISE!\". But my tastes, unfortunately, are not quite so refined. Their food is still great here- a nice slice of Americana with dishes that are timeless and classic. And those onion rings... yeah, those things can win an award or two."}
{"text":"Yeah! Joe's Farm Grill!!!   I like smaller portions, so the kids meal is perfect for me. I get the chicken strips, which come with french fries. My husband likes the Fontina burger and sweet potato fries.   The drink and condiment station outside is pretty cool too.   My favorite part? The bathroom! I know it sounds weird, but check it out. It has a TV mounted in the wall that plays vintage puppet movies, and framed Barbie and G.I. Joe dolls. Again, weird in description...but cool in real life!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, great coffee, great views, great prices. And I love that it's local. You've gotta check it out."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....    Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...  Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!    If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area.."}
{"text":"I'm a vegan and always on the lookout for places to eat that serve good food without meat or dairy. A friend of mine told me about this place when I was visiting her and I decided to try it.  Wow! Vegan burger and fries that taste SO GOOD! I have returned several times and always had a good eating experience. And outdoor seating with birds and trees round out my really great impression of this eatery"}
{"text":"Great food!  The potatoes were really dry, but the rest was good, including the service."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is great, especially when the weather is not too hot and you can sit outside. The food is great, although the line is sometimes quite long."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with the outside seating areas on picnic tables. It was a very relaxing dining experience. The onion rings were crunchy and great tasting. The sweet potato fries were also very good. Our party ordered pizza for the kids (ate every last bite), the Fontina Burger (very good pesto); the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, and the Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich. Nobody wanted to share so that means everything was good. I will plan on ordering the Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich to share among everyone next time. The seasonal Butter Pecan Shake was great also."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! If you can find it. This place was a little hard to find if you have never been here before. The sign is not where the restaurant is. We almost went home because we thought they had gone out of business or something. As we were heading back toward the freeway we thought we would just swing around back and there is was hiding behind some giant trees. I am so happy we found it. I got the regular burger and fries and it was super yummy and fresh. I also got the dark chocolate milk shake and it was out of this world!!! Even the cherry on top looked like they had marinated it themselves. My husband got the special, which was some kind of fried pork chop sandwich. My daughter got the pizza, which I tried and it was delish. If you have time take a stroll over to the community garden and look at the plots. Or hope in your car and drive through the darling neighborhood that surrounds the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Joe's Farm Grill!  The food is tasty, service is great and the environment is fun. We usually sit on the back patio. It has heaters in the winter and misters in the summer. And it has easy access to the drinks and condiments. On the day of your Birthday you get $10 off your meal, just show your ID. My favorites are the veggie pizza and fontina grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Amazing location! I love the extremely friendly staff they are always looking for ways to help you. The food is SO GOOD! Best American food I've had around this area. An absolute must go if you're in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife and loved it! Really neat restaurant that is located at a farm that also has orange groves, a vegetable stand and a coffee shop. Great menu that has burgers, chicken sandwich's, ribs, dogs, salads, and much more. All of the food is fresh and made daily. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had the regular grilled chicken sandwich. I also order grilled squash with mine and the wife had fries. There is also an all you can drink beverage bar. Items such as milkshakes and bottled drinks are available too. The food was great! The meals were fresh off the grill and are filling.  Seating is available inside and outside. There are picnic benches located around the restaurant outside. We sat at one located under a huge Pondarosa pine.  There is also a coffee shop on the grounds and it smelled wonderful inside! The fruit stand has an honor system to pay for fresh vegetables and fruit. Great experience and would go back. Oh, and the manager came by and wanted to make sure we were happy with our meals."}
{"text":"We don't venture out of my 3 mile radius often, so this was WAY out of our way (in Gilbert) but my bf had seen this place featured on a tv program so... I was SO impressed by the amount of outdoor seating and the grounds. The format for ordering was very efficient. Very little wait time for our meals. I'm not a thin crust pizza fan, i generally prefer extra cheesy greasy pizza, but there was definitely a difference in the fresh toppings right down to the pepperoni. The burger we shared was nearly on the \"steak\" level it was so tasty. After our meal I looked up the history of the restaurant and the \"community garden\" next to it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the whole concept.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. The line is not quick and somehow I always spend more than I think I should here. But great food. Burgers are good, ribs are good, salads are good.  Haven't tried a bad thing yet."}
{"text":"Decent but not great chicken bfast tacos.  Green salsa not flavorful or spicy.  Wish it had some of the famed local veggies on it or something.  The Joes Farm beans were very good.  The grounds are amazing, you really do feel like you're in a farm.  The other food looks great, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and SO happy to find this hot spot that has excellent quality delicious food. Love that mostly everything is natural/ organic but still super yummy. Quality of food is very important to me because we have children. I hope to see this restaurant open in SAN DIEGO!"}
{"text":"Was taken here by a client, who swore it was great.  Before we got in, he asked - do you know Yelp.com?  I said yes.    I love places like this.  Not high on price or high price atmosphere.  I love great food.    This place delivered.  Our dishes included: -  Grilled Cheese (was amazing) -  BBQ Chicken Special - Excellent!! -  Grilled pizza - huge and amazing -  Burger - also amazing.   The surroundings are fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been stuck between three and four stars for a while.  During the course of my sister's stay at a hospice close to this location, I was a regular patron here for a few weeks.  Family from out of town were excited because of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives so I spent much time here.  TWO stars for service:  when I double checked my $140 carry out order, about five items were missing (no apologies, only excuses).  My aunt had problems a few days earlier with a partial dine in order.  On a separate occasion, I only got an order of onion rings to go because I had just eaten at the cafe.  My cousin's were so tasty, I had to get some for my hubby.  I had to ask about them after 15 minutes of waiting (with no line and an empty dining room) and at least this time I got an apology and an excuse as I watched them drop my forgotten rings in the fryer.  BUT the coffee shop gets five stars for service and food!  Very courteous and knowledgeable!  Love the prairie bread that was recommended for my club!  Because all the food is so delicious and deserves TEN stars, but the service left me hanging, I gave this place three stars.  The girls that take the orders are very courteous, the people that shove the  food at you are the ones who need to work on their people skills.  I will more than likely eat here again when I make it to the east valley because the food is just that tasty!    If I was forced to choose: I'd rather get ten star food with 2 star service than phenomenal service with a bowl of poop.    Favorites: Sweet Potato pie, Onion rings, Asian salad with seared ahi (FYI: the ahi is pre-seared and served cold atop the salad), RIBS ARE OUTRAGEOUS, milkshakes, Mexican coca colas, burgers.... Basically it is ALL AMAZING  The whoopie pies at the cafe are scrumptious!  And anything on prairie bread!!    Helpful tip:  double check your order BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE WINDOW"}
{"text":"I saw this place on diners. Drive-ins, and dives hoping to get the bbq chicken pizza. Unfortunately they didn't offer it that day so settled on the ahi sandwich and zucchini fries. By far the best fried zucchini whatever I have ever had! My friend got bbq chicken salad and fried green beans. They were pretty good. You can tell the quality of ingredients is something you don't get at a typical restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good but it's pretty pricey. Nothing special about the food. Seems like typical backyard summer BBQ food."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Burgers are awesome.  Especially with the baked potato fries.  Loved sitting outside.  Great family place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the burgers, my daughter said the best she'd ever had was the pesto burger.  Another had the fontana and the pesto was preferred.  We read the onion rings had to be experienced and they didn't disappoint.  We had the strawberry lemonade -made fresh - yum!  Also, the beet salad is an unusual menu item and so tasty!  We then went to the coffee shop next door (same grounds) and had to die for cupcakes!  Extremely busy because the place is so unique and such good food.  We went prior to noon on a Tuesday and got in quickly; around noon, they were lined up out the door, but they get people through like a fine oiled machine."}
{"text":"Fontina burger is where it's at. The BBQ chicken salad is pretty tasty as well. It's a great family place but is also an easy and quick date night for young couples. My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times together and it's always consistent and delicious!"}
{"text":"Usually a great place to eat, last time around my girlfriends burger had three sharp, inedible chunks in it. Told the staff and they just looked bewildered and said they would mention it to the manager. Not a great way to handle a complaint IMO..."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The style of the place is fantastic. The grounds are really cool. The bathrooms are A+++. The soda fountain area is extra nifty. At risk of sounding like a tight-wad, value certainly isn't on the menu, at Joe's Farm Grill.  Sure it's affordable, but say.. I feel like grabbing a tasty salad, i'd throw down a few extra bucks for a tip, and go to somewhere even more awesome, like Pita Jungle.  Finally, I'm not the biggest fan of \"family friendly\" establishments.... Joe's is always swarmed with 40,000,000 screaming, shrieking children... which I suppose is what one should expect when dining in the UltraBurbs.."}
{"text":"What a waste of time!  Horrendous line on Saturday evening 2/15/2014, a few minutes over an hour standing outside then in a crowded lobby.  One order taker, and that's all there could be because there is only one window to order...another window where you pick up your food.  So, a long wait would possibly worth it if, and I mean IF, the food was good.  The Farm Burger was absolutely nothing to write home about.  5 Guys, Habit Burger and In and Out Burgers are dramatically better than Joe's Farm Burger.  The lamb burger was so rich, it caused my wife stomach distress for two days after.  The full rack of ribs was dry and the sauce was non-exceptional.  Garlic fries were garlicky, too much so and the onion rings were just onion rings, nothing new or better.  Sitting outside in the evening was chilly--they do not offer heat lamps.  Prices are on the high side, especially considering the quality of the food.  I have no idea at all why people wait in line for an hour or more to eat this food.  Just because Guy Fieri visited the place does not a great dining experience make.  Joe's Farm Grill is a phenomenon way past it's time.  Even if you live in Gilbert near the restaurant, you would be better served to find another hamburger or rib shack."}
{"text":"Unique place with FRESH food! Be prepared to order and pick up your own food then eat out in the picnic area. Indoor seating is available, but there's not much. The restaurant is right across from Agritopia - a farm, and they grow a lot of their own ingredients there. I always get a fresh date shake when I go - it's extra sweet, but yum!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill never disappoints. The food is always so fresh and gives a \"homemade\" feel. I came with my family and my daughter threw our pancakes on the floor and they didn't hesitate to make us new pancakes to replace them even though it was no longer lunch time. We were really impressed with the management and the service."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time on Saturday and totally loved it. Some friends had been recommending it to us, and we had seen it driving by, but it wasn't until Saturday that we actually got out there. I was totally impressed by the atmosphere (we sat outside because the weather was nice and the scenery beautiful, but there is inside seating also). I had the bacon burger and it was delicious -- can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the place inside & out is neat.....but the food is average at best...and expensive for what it is...."}
{"text":"Have to say Joe's didn't disappoint.  Loved the fact that everything is fresh and either comes from their farm or close by.  Tried the garlic fries, burger, beet side salad, farm salad with green goddess dressing (I've had better) and the bbq burger with blue cheese and onion rings...everything was delicious!  I wish I had had more time to sit and order more food.. I highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"We stayed in Gilbert for an extended weekend for my brothers wedding. After the wedding festivities, we had a few extra days to unwind and soak up the warm Arizona rays while New York was still getting a few passings of snow. As my sister, her fiance and I are all Food Network fanatics, we searched for Triple D places in the area. We like going more so for the novelty, but if you ask me, Anthony Bourdain is far, far superior to Guy Fieri. However, I love the opportunity to eat where so many people have said 'you need to go here.'  Which is how we came across Joe's the day before our departure. We arrived just as the breakfast menu switched for the lunch and decided to get everything and then some that was featured on Triple D. My sister got the Fontina Burger with sweet potato fries, her fiance got the BBQ Bleu Cheese Burger with onion rings, and I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger with garlic fries. We also ordered 2 caramelized banana milkshakes, a BBQ chicken flatbread pizza and a strawberry lemonade. We were very hungry.  I fell in love with Joe's even before my first bite. The ambiance alone was enough to sway me. The open farm area, Agritopia, the ancient and massive trees in the picnic area.   The food didn't take long, and before I knew it my fork was scraping the bottom of my tray collecting the droppings from my burger, since it was just so massive. I'm always a bit skeptical when ordering fish when somewhere landlocked, but wherever and however Joe's gets it's tuna, is done the right way. The spicy wasabi mayo spread on the bun with the purple cabbage was just all so beautifully blended together.  I immediately became obsessed with the garlic fries. They did not hold back from laying on the garlic or Parmesan. You didn't even need to have a fry with the toppings to get the beautiful and fragrant taste. Interestingly, these fries taste similar to another Triple D place I've been to, The Red Sparrow in Queens. So, while I will miss these very much, at least I know where I can get my fix.  The caramelized banana shakes was super rich, like a thick liquid version of a bananas foster. I saved most of it for after the meal and couldn't finish the whole thing, but know that I so dearly wanted to.   Part of the reason why I couldn't finish the milkshake was because of the flatbread pizza. By the time I finished my burger and fries, I was already stuffed, but charged through to have my share of the pizza. The flavor was crazy, smoky, and I'm thankful the flatbread was crunchy and not soggy like so many places get wrong.  We finished eating before noon, and for the next few hours, while walking around Scottsdale, I felt full the whole day. We had a late dinner, and even at that I ordered the smallest thing on the menu at the place because I was still so full.  Before leaving to the airport the next morning, we grabbed my grandparents and took them here for breakfast. I ordered a waffle with fresh fruit, super simple, but so well done. My only gripe was the maple syrup, but perhaps because I live close enough to get Vermont maple syrup at any time, I'm a bit spoiled. Either way, there was nothing bad about this. Even the coffee was strong, which was the first time I had strong coffee in Arizona. We also enjoyed the apple fritters, I was not expecting them to have the chopped up apples inside, but it was unique.  By the way, my grandparents had a lot of fun, and loved the kitty that came and visited us as we ate under the big tree. The lucky cat got a few pieces of bacon from them. They also let the cat clean their plates.   I will recommend this to any family or friend who visits the area in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Good tasting food. Good atmosphere. They were out of a few menu items so that was dissatisfying. But the overall meal came quick and tasted fresh! Will be back"}
{"text":"It's a family favorite for us, just go before or after the crowds. Food is always fantastic and fresh. Pesto chicken sandwich w/ sweet potato fries and a fresh Lemonade never lets me down.    Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"A fun restaurant with sitting inside or outside. I had the fontina burger and onion rings. We all loved the onion rings and the burger was great. One of my daughters got the pesto chicken sandwich and loved it. Another daughter got one of their September only \"dogs if summer\", the popper dog and it was great. It was spicy and very unique. We all shared the dessert dog and it was great too! The hot fudge was delicious. My son got the bbq chicken pizza and enjoyed it. My daughter got the grilled cheese and it was lacking. Overall the food was great. They also give a free meal to anyone having a birthday and once a year have a free meal for customer appreciation. It's a great place to eat and the customer service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh food from a family that knows what they are doing.  Sourced locally (mostly) in the middle of agritopia this place has the food network blessing, so you have to be prepared for the crowds.  I can't get away from the garlic fries, they are spot on."}
{"text":"worst service ever, the teenage girls that were working made their lunch before my salad and chicken sandwich which took 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. I had driven by many times but never ventured into this joint and I can see what the hype is all about. The location itself is absolutely gorgeous; massive trees in the back patio area where families were sitting under enjoying the shade. Beautiful garden area also in the back. The food itself was just as advertised; fresh, delicious, and huuuge quantities. I had the chicken sandwich and there is no comparison to free range non hormone ingested chicken. The flavor was great, it was grilled perfectly to juicy, succulent bliss. Be warned, the portions are pretty large. The onion rings were a meal unto themselves. Do yourself a favor and get some fresh pink lemonade here. My only knock is how friggin' pricey it is ($20.00 for a chicken sandwich, lemonade, and a side of onion rings?!) but besides that everything wan fantastic. Employees are also just as nice and helpful as can be. I will be back many times."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! The atmosphere was extremely inviting/retro/fun, and the food was just to die for. Service was fabulous - all the servers were very kind and attentive, but OH MAN THAT FOOD! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great family place! There is plenty of grass gated outdoor areas for the kids to run around and burn off some energy.  I get the salmon every time, and have never been disappointed.  For a drink.. they have the best lemonade! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love This place!! Great food, and they have vegan options !! Omgosh I can't rave enough about this place. If your from a small country town, you'll love it here!! Bring The kids !! Tons of room for them to play. They bring in exotic birds every Sunday if it's not to hot or rainy!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, I am wondering if it has been taken over by new management...  I order three entrees. I received two both with the wrong sides and one cooked wrong. Sent it back recooked wrong again asked if the would take off the side that I never received they argued then finally did it.  I am really hoping this is just an off night for them but if I am going home hungry they get one star."}
{"text":"Food was good, no doubt. We visited twice and tried a wide variety of items. All of them tasty and well prepared.  But the prices are ridiculously high for what you get. The indoor seating area was pretty bad. Fairly messy and dirty. And the constant fight against the swarms of flies made eating here a chore rather than a pleasure. Outside seating looks better, but when it's 110 degrees out, inside is the only option. The cafeteria style ordering system was very slow and seems very inefficient.  It's  unlikely we will visit again even though the food was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here several times most recently for my free birthday meal. Yum! Got there (thankfully) right before the dinner rush. I ordered the fontina burger with garlic Parmesan fries which did not disappoint! My sisters joined me, one ordering the fontina burger with sweet potato fries and the other, one of the pizzas. The pizza was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is the place to go for something when you are tired of traditional American food. The building is modern and funky, the surrounding green space is cool and inviting, and the food is reliably good.  Order at the walk-up counter and keep up because the line can move quickly. The line can be long during busy hours, so I try to avoid peak times, especially because the wails of poorly managed children echo painfully loudly in the high-ceilinged counter area. (And unfortunately, there always seems to be at least one family ignoring a screaming kid in the place.) Once you've placed your order, you can take the order-is-ready buzzer and go find a seat inside or on the patio or yard seating.  I've tried a number of things on the menu, all of which have been good. The Ahi sandwich has a generous portion of perfectly seared tuna. It was too much food (and the wasabi dressing was a bit to spicy for me) and the meal turned out to be a drippy mess, but I liked it.  The barbeque chicken pizza is good but usually too wet (I like pizza crisp), and I also recommend the pepperoni pizza. The Asian salad is delicious; Joe's salads definitely show off how fresh all the ingredients are. I recently tried the ribs and pulled pork platter. It was big enough to feed two adults, and both meats were excellent.  The best item on the menu is the sweet potato fries. It's a large portion of not greasy (maybe baked?), mildly seasoned thin-sliced fries with a mango/pineapple chutney on the side. I upgrade to them at every opportunity. I also suggest keeping an eye out for seasonal/special items; I once tried a date shake and it was fantastic.  The bathrooms always seem to be extremely clean and have a fun, funky decor. Display cases with old Barbie and G.I.Joe style dolls are built into the walls, and an in-wall TV shows what looks to be old Thunderbirds (marionette) episodes on continual loop."}
{"text":"Love that this gorgeous restaurant is walking distance from us. All of the trees and gardens make it a gorgeous place for photos or to just enjoy the outdoors. The food seems rushed sometimes because it is always pretty busy... But the waffle with boysenberry syrup is usually worth the wait."}
{"text":"I do like this place, but I think it's received a lot of hype over being on the diners and drive-in show.  If you go on peak hours you're almost waiting 20-30 mins in line.  In most cases when I drive by the line is out the door 30 people deep.  The best thing on the menu for me is the ahi tuna burger.  Everything else is meh."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Arizona! Food is all delish! I've never ordered anything I didn't like. My personal favorite is the Ahi Tuna sandwich. I also recommend the Fontina burger. The flavors are incredible! If you're feeling like a salad, try the salmon caesar, it's super tasty! I can't say enough about the homemade pickles! I could eat a bowl of them, always order extra! The fries are superb! I love sitting outside most of the year. Kids can run around and play while you enjoy a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"They must save the good stuff for Guy.. started off bad with the girl taking the order.. what? Is not a proper term when you can't hear a customer.. try sir or mam next time. Got the buzz food was ready but only half the order was complete. The breakfast burger was no better than a whopper with really good bacon.. maybe next time I'll see if Guy wants to ride with me"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time.  It's a fun, family-friendly place.  I was with a Meetup group, and we sat outside.  I had the bbq chicken salad with no dressing.  (I bring my own that I make at home.). The person who took my order asked if I wanted the bbq sauce on the chicken, and I said \"no, on the side please.\"   The salad was excellent!  The chicken was grilled perfectly and not slathered in a bunch of butter or oil.  The burgers looked so good as did the huge onion rings.  And one lady got a milkshake.  She said it was wonderful!  We all enjoyed our meals and the ambience and plan on returning.  It's also a place I'd take out-of-town company because it's just a cool place!"}
{"text":"Love the location. I meet here often with friends. Great for pleasing everyone. I usually get the Fontana burger. (Idk how they spell that) and the hubs gets the fried shrimp. I hear the pizza is good but the oven is usually closed.  Also, staff walk around with a \"salt gun\" to kill flies. GREAT idea. Love it. But a little too close to me while I was eating.   Delish. And fun environment!"}
{"text":"Great place with great food. Love eating here. Their tuna salad is delicious. Love their burgers."}
{"text":"great food, great fun country atmosphere. a little pricey but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Came here around 4pm to grab an early dinner after our long day hiking. There were people eating there but not crowded. They have outdoors and indoor seating and a parking lot. We ordered in the front and seated ourselves. We were given a buzzer for the waitresses to find us and deliver our orders. My boyfriend and I had our own burgers with sides and shared a 32oz strawberry lemonade. Lemonade was very sweet but is fresh squeezed. I had the southwest burger which had pepper jack with ghost peppers so I was very thankful the cashier warned me because I replaced it with regular Swiss cheese. I also had a side of fries which was complimentary with the order. The burger was definitely filling and generous. I wasn't able to finish my order because it was such a thick burger. Patty was juicy and the veggies were fresh. Not bad but not the best I've ever had. The totally came out to be around $31 for two people. Their bathrooms are located outside of the restaurant by the outdoor seating. Clean bathrooms with Barbie dolls and TVs inside which was interesting. Not bad and Guy Fiery visited and has his favorites there too."}
{"text":"We love Joe's. A little pricey, but the food is good and consistent. Out favorites are: buffalo chicken, burger, onion rings, shakes, and fried shrimp basket"}
{"text":"good fresh food-fun with a group on a nice day-get there early and prepare to wait-always busy-always a line-"}
{"text":"Everything was amazingly fresh and made right in front of us. The portions seemed small, but it was so filling and satisfying we couldn't finish our bbq plate, or the ahi sandwich. Just like home cooking, but better. The meals were quickly and deliciously prepared, and seasoned just right."}
{"text":"So, I have been to Joe's two more times and each time I had the grilled chicken with Pecan Pesto sandwich.  I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars based on the absolute loveliness of said Chicken sandwich.  Wow.  Go.  Get it........taste it and you'll be hooked too!  Go now, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Fresh!! Food is delicious it is always fresh and straight from the farm. I love the fontina burger with garlic fries! It gets busy if you're there right at noon or right at six. So go early to avoid the lines"}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick service and fun atmosphere! Joes farm grill has it all! Their blackberry lemonade is wonderful, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me just say..... O.M.G. This place is the BOMB!  I'm from Southern California, but once I saw this place on Triple D, I knew I had to visit my brother in AZ to hit this place up! My brother and I both got the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with fries and a soda and milkshake for dessert. It was so so so delicious. Better than any restaurant I've been to in all my 16 years of living. I love love love that all the ingredients are fresh, and it shows. The restrooms looked so cool and modern. I had a flashback of my love for barbies when I was 9. I can't wait to go back for spring break and get stufffffffed. I love their little condiment bar they had outside with the BBQ sauce from their BBQ place. (IDK the name but my bro said he loves it!) I'm not sure if I'm, going to try anything else on the menu, because I love the tuna so so so much.  My only con would be: I was sooooo full afterwords, I could barely move, but I love love love their food.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Is heaven possible on Earth?  Yes.  How do I know the answer to such a question?  I came to Joes Farm Grill today and found it!    I am a fan of Joes stuff, and came here today to see what it was all about.  I really wanted to just go to the coffee shop, but after setting foot in here for the first time, I realized how close these two places were in proximity to each other, and decided to go to both!  I stood in line and ordered the hot dog basket and it was tasty.  I also got a drink as well, and really enjoyed my meal here.  I dont know how he does it, but this place is perfection.  Next time my parents come in to town, I'm taking them here.  amazing."}
{"text":"Bacon cheddar burger was dry, overcooked and flavorless.  Fries were cold.  Onion rings were cold and had the texture of a cardboard box."}
{"text":"It was good...but not great. On my first visit, I had a waffle that was not fully cooked all the way through. Thought I would give them a second try and had the bbq chicken pizza which was completely burnt on all the edges but the rest was really good. Hot dogs were the best food I have had there. The buns are amazing and the fries are really good. I will be back to try more items on the menu but only for lunch, no more breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've actually been here once before several years ago. So long ago that I forgot about the long line. The food apparently wasn't good enough to remember after all this time.  But when I got my burger today it was actually pretty decent. As were the onion rings. I guess the thing that irks me is the long line (that goes out the front door) and only ONE register open. Really? And then the bill is $28.00 for one adult and one kid's order...A bit steep.  The place is really clean which is a big plus. Oh and the restrooms are outside..."}
{"text":"Food is generally pretty good, and portion sizes are decent but I always leave feeling like I overpaid and waiting too long.   Never had a bad experience, but never had a terrific one either... Just doesn't live up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with high expectations. It's a really cute looking restaurant and we were excited to finally try this place out. Then we walked inside... Flies! So many flies!! We could not enjoy our food because the flies were just so overwhelming, we just wanted out of there. In retrospect we should have ordered our food to go after I swatted the 20th fly off me while waiting in line. I hope they fix this problem soon, until then we will not go back. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Joes BBQ for a long time now.. so when I heard about this place my expectations and excitement was huge!'  Sure enough the drive over from north west mesa was worth it. Everything from the parking on the unique looking pavers from the tall trees said this place was special!  The friendly young lady at the counter tossed out a suggestion for the Buffalo chicken sandwich and I went for it. Now here is the kicker.. I firmly dislike anything that has to do with blue cheese.. So when i received my amazing looking platter and inside the burger there it was I almost took it back.  I tried it anyways rather than order something else or scrape it off.. and WOW. My taste buds loved it! My girlfriend knows I talk a lot.. well I was all but quiet for once as I finished every bite lol   While out side the place has a very warm, back home, family feeling, just a very positive experience! I was told this place was amazing, looks like Ill be saying the same thing to others!  One thing I was hoping for on the wonderful drink station was the red cream soda you have at the BBQ rest.. but the tea was well enough to put away my dismay.  Home run for the joe's crew, this place brings it all together :)"}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh, fabulous lunch spot. Service is always great, weekends are super packed but they know what they are doing down there and get you fed regardless. My pick whenever I have family or friends in town for an outdoor casual lunch. The BBQ chicken pizza is incredible and if it's not a cheat day the farm fresh salads are equally as yum!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food.   Had a chance to meet Joe the owner the other day and he such a nice guy"}
{"text":"The location is excellent! Lots of big trees and shades.  The food is quite good. I tried the Fontina burger and it was both delicious and full-filling. I loved the grilled mushrooms and their green sauce (?). The burger came with a side of fries, too.  The service was self-served. You could sit inside or outside. Great view.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"***Update**** their breakfast is also sooooo good!!!!!!  Nothing beats Joe Farm Grill! They have the best burgers in all of Arizona and I am surprised to say they also have the best chicken tenders of all time!   The fontina burger is the best burger you will ever get in Arizona! There's a lot of burgers out there that are super fatty, super juicy, and maybe provides you a huge burger or something but the Fontina Burger is something different! It's so fresh and delicious and the multigrain bun just adds so much texture to the overall burger. The cheese is excellent along with the fire roasted tomatoes and pesto sauce they put on the burger!  I also get my fries with sweet potato fries!  And my gosh, those chicken tenders are THE BEST! I've had chick fil A, Ive had Cane's, but they all taste the same. They're good, but Joes Farm Grill is WOW!!!!!!! It's so crispy, so juicy, kinda has the same texture when you bite into fried catfish or something! It's out of this world, and I wish I can have them every day of my life!   They're also a lot of other stuff that's on the menu that I heard it really good like their pizza! I'll have to try that stuff next time. The shakes are okay, and have some pretty interesting seasonal flavors but I definitely prefer their organic fountain sodas! Made from real cane sugar and no additives, I love the coconut flavor and the blood orange flavor.   I HIGHLY recommend going to Joes Farm Grill! It's worth the wait if there's a line, and it's definitely such a nice family friendly atmosphere!   Tips:  1) ask for a multi-grain bun. It tastes a lot better than they're normal buns they use, unless it's a pretzel bun or brioche bread or something 2) sweet potatoes fries are probably my favorite side compared to the other fries 3) you can ask them to cut your burger in half in you're sharing when you're ordering at the window  4) try the sodas, they're very unique and organic I believe  5) now that they control the sauces, you'll have to ask your server for what you want when they serve you their food, so ask for a lot, they don"}
{"text":"Just walking to the front door got me excited; there are outside picnic benches so your ankle-biters can run around out there and not bother me as I dine inside!  Woo hoo!  I had imagined more of a sit-down & order kind of place, but I support ordering and picking up your food at the counter so there aren't waitstaff hovering around.  (Nothing against waiters, I just prefer a more casual environment!)  And casual, inviting atmosphere they have.  The young lady working the register was one of the nicest people I've ever interacted with.  The food was exactly what I hoped for: fresh and flavorful.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad, with tasty mixed greens, roasted poblano peppers, and lots of other good stuff mixed in.  Sure, my food was ready fast, but this isn't your typical fast food pile of iceburg lettuce!  If you have time afterward (and it's not too hot), take a stroll around the place, admire the flowers and plants, maybe even pick up some fruits for veggies they have for sale out back!  It's on the honor system!"}
{"text":"WAY TOO MANY FLIES INSIDE.  Disgusting. So distracted by them I couldn't say how the food was. A real shame, waste of a very charming place."}
{"text":"First time we were there. Not to impressed. Ribs were pretty charred. My burger patty was just about raw. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat, almost as good as Joe's Barbeque"}
{"text":"I had the chicken breakfast tacos.  Good bargain, with coffee, only 10 bucks.  Tacos packed with chicken, which made them a challenge to eat, but that's a challenge I like!  As in all things Phoenix, the question is - would I drive 50 miles round-trip to eat here?  Yes, I would. Not every day, but for a once in a while special treat."}
{"text":"Today I received a call from my sister asking me what were my plans for lunch. Honestly I hadn't thought that far yet. So I acknowledge and ask her to call me when she is on her way or at least close by. I figured by the time she arrived I would have a place selected. Naturally I opt for Joe's Farm Grill for two reasons: 1) she said she was buying and 2) for the fact I had never been there.  We jumped in her new car and speed off like two kids chasing down the neighborhood ice cream man. As we pulled up we noticed the Joe's Farm Grill sign and what appeared to be a combination of a large vertical bush and very large tree that resembled a hand flipping the bird. Well it looked like that from our angle. From the looks of the place they had plenty of outdoor seating in the front and back of the place. However today being as windy and rainy as it was we parked ourselves inside. Inside at the counter there were three windows and each window had flat-screens nested above it. Not sure what they were for because they all were off, but I suspect during their peak times it may display the menu. I walked up to the first available window which was the only one open at the time. With the kitchen noises in the background it made it a little difficult to hear. That was pretty much our only interaction with the staff aside from the brief interaction at the pick up window.  When my sister was handed her cup the teller quickly mentioned that the soda fountain machine was located outside. We both turned and looked at each other and paused for a moment and thought, Outside? We walked towards the seating area and we noticed a door to the outside and just steps passed the doorway reviled the fountain machine and sauce dispensing stations. Groovy. Just slighty beyond that is a unisex bathroom which has dolls in small display cases embedded in the walls. Two by the toilet and one by the sink. Also strategically placed is a flat screen monitor above the urinal (plays movies about dolls from what I saw), which you can also watch while on the commode. The best part was a small sign implying \"Use the lock button for privacy\" for those not used to having locks for the bathroom.  I have read about Joe's Farm Grill before and every time I review their menu the Fontina Burger always catches my attention for what ever reason. Perhaps because it comes prepared with roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto and fontina cheese. Joe's Farm Grill is known for their use of locally raised and natural beef which is a major plus. Also they have a nice selection of cheeses: American, Cheddar, Swiss, Fontina and Blue of course. For the health conscientious customer they offer any of their 1/2 lb burgers with multi-grain buns upon request. Last but not least all burgers come with a side of fries which can be substituted for an additional fee, but cooked with trans-fat free oil no less.  I decided to follow my instinct and ordered the Fontina Burger, but decided to upgrade my fries to onion rings and opted for a strawberry shake. My sister ordered the Farm Burger with the fries and water. Seeing that the place was not busy we chose to sit in the front dining area.  It wasn't long before our buzzer began to vibrate and like a well trained ninja I spring out of my seat (tip toeing through the air) and within seconds I was at the pickup window. Did I mention I was starving? Both meals were served in black baskets lined with tinfoil. The aroma alone had me hypnotized and the roasted peppers had me salivating.  Typically I reach for the condiments and begin to pour on the ketchup, mustard or what have you. This time something told me to give it a whirl as-is. Just add the lettuce, tomatoes and red onions and try it as-is. So I go with my instinct again and I am glad I did. Wow! Juicy, tender, flavorful and delicious. The combination of the arugula, pesto, red peppers, mushrooms and the fontina cheese hits you all at once like a fierce side kick to your taste buds. I am talking about (Whack! Pow! Bang!) as if I were in an old batman episode.  This was one heavenly treat and I must say that I found a new favorite. The Fontina Burger takes first place knocking the Haunted burger down a notch. The onion rings on the other hand were ridiculously crunchy to the point of over crunchiness. To put it simply I should have stuck with the standard fries because those were awesome.  I almost lost a hand as I kept sampling my sisters fries and the shake, oh the shake... wonderful. I love shakes especially when they are made with fresh seasonal fruits. Delicious!  I liked the fact that I did not have to add anything to this masterpiece. It was perfect as it was served, hot, juicy, tender and wonderful. I was very impressed with quality of the food and the establishment is fantastic. I honestly wish I had known about Joe's Farm Grill much sooner! Thank you for the great experience... expect us back real soon!"}
{"text":"So yummy!!! Got the bbq chicken salad and the fontina burger. Also the strawberry lemonade is a must!!! Also,  the beet salad was so yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't care who you are, this place is the best....best everything!   Ima let you finish.....but Joe's shakes are the best of alll time!   No seriously their shakes are the best. I have had the vanilla and strawberry and couldn't stop talking about them for days after. Yum!   Joe's is another one of those wonderful places that have been featured on Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives. Joe's grows just about all their produce right on the farm so its more than fresh, and all their meats and everything else is Arizona grown or as close to it as possible. They have a great outdoor picnic type seating area outside, or indoor seating. Great for the family and your dogs. Next door they have Joe's Farm Cafe, with some of the same food as in the restaurant, great coffee and tea and other sweets. Then probably my favor tie part, they have a little farm stand where they sell what produce they have available at the time. Last time I was there I got some cherries that were out of this world good! It is an \"Honor System\" stand where you pick out what you want then put your money is a little lock box and then go on your merry way. So cute!   When you go out there I will recommend the BBQ pulled pork (they have award winning BBQ sauce), any of the salads, the BBQ chicken pizza and/or the season shake."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area and this came up as a Gluten-Free option, so we jumped at the opportunity to try something new.  When we pulled up, the line was out the door. We decided to brave it though and a manager came out and asked if we wanted breakfast or lunch. My boyfriend responded, \"I'm not sure\" to which the manager said, \"Well, breakfast ends in a minute so here is a lunch menu.\" Not a problem at all. Until another party arrived behind us and when they were asked the same question, they were lead to the front of the line to enjoy the breakfast menu while we waited in line.   After waiting the longest to order the food, we sat down and shortly after, our buzzer rang and our food was ready. Well, mostly. The two milkshakes we ordered were not prepared and we had to wait additionally at the counter for them. Good thing we did because they were the best part of our meal.   My hot dog and fries were cold. So cold that I thought they had been sitting in a fridge. My boyfriend's pulled pork was also cold. And surprisingly, his coleslaw was warm. He did say that after heating up his pork at home, he enjoyed it.   A sign said if the meal was anything less than five stars, to let them know. But I was not about to hold up the line at the pick-up counter because I was unable to find an employee.   Disappointing and since we don't live in the area, we will not be back."}
{"text":"We love, love, LOVE Joe's Farm Grill. It is the perfect place to dine if you have children. Having all the space to run and play after dinner is so nice for them and really special, because not many places can offer something like that. The menu is wonderful, and the specials are even better. My family has been here countless times and we have loved everything. The milkshakes are awesome, burgers are juicy, and the veggies are so fresh!   It's delicious food and a really fun place for our kids, can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"We live pretty close to Joe's, but have only been there several times.  The food is always great; however, waiting in long lines is not something I like to do.  There are just too many good restaurants in the area to justify not waiting a long time to place an order.  Additionally, inside seating is prime.  This can be a problem when it's really, really hot outside.  The Coffee Shop is a good place to have breakfast, and the Monsoons are really special.  All in all, Joe's is an above average place; you just need to get there when it's not so crowded."}
{"text":"Great fresh and eclectic menu using locally sourced ingredients.  Great locale.  Locally owned, reviewed by DDD, etc., etc., etc.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I love Joe's farm grill! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is fun. It's nice to walk around the farm after eating too."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere - sorta retro trendy. If you've been to the Joe's real BBQ in old town Gilbert, then you know the setup here, grab your food and choose to eat inside or outside in the family friendly open-air 'back yard'. I prefer the latter, built out of an old farmhouse (I understand it was the owner's childhood home) there lots of mature trees, green grass, not to mention the small working farm behind the restaurant really helps to  transport you back to a time when this area wasn't a sea of cookie-cutter homes and Walgreen's on ever corner.   Enough about the place, what about the food. I'd say if you're looking for BBQ go to Old town, they have it here, and it's good, but it's not the same. Personally, I think the grilled pizza's really stood out, noticeably fresh ingredients really were a flavorful surprise - definitely not the 'Mall-food' someone else here had mentioned.   I enjoyed it and Joe's Farm Grill it's a perfect place for a Sunday afternoon lunch with the family to get out and enjoy a beautiful Arizona day!"}
{"text":"Best ribs and waffles ANYWHERE. Fun to sit outside. Go here, you will like it for sure!"}
{"text":"Finally had time to have brunch here and I'm glad I did! My friend and I got the Belgium waffle and breakfast tacos. The tacos were amazing! We got chicken on the tacos which I was surprised how good it was. Love the rustic farm feel and looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"WOW...... Over the past summer, my family toke a road trip and drove from Houston to San Jose CA.  On our way back to Houston, we stop by Joe's Farm Grill; we found this restaurant in Guy from food network show called Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. You can't almost go wrong with that. Guy does have good taste for food. The foods are excellent and the portion is great. I am a big eater and I can't finish the BBQ. My daughters can't finish their sandwiches. We have so much food left that we ate them for dinner at Las Cruces, NM. The price is great. It is so worth the money. We will eat there again when we in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"Always has super good food with an awesome environment.  The employees are always on point and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. My husband and I went, We had Farm Burgers, garlic fries, onion rings, a milk shake ORDER THE MILK SHAKE, and a fried banana split sandwich.  The food was amazing, the vegetables were crisp and perfect. I would drive the hour from one side of town to the other for this place any night of the week it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for a few years now and the food is still good but the quality has gone down a bit. I usually order the ahi tuna burger. Portions are large so I end up taking food home.  My complain about this place is there were too many flies inside the dining area. I don't know if its the carpet that they don't clean, the tables they don't wipe down or the smelly kids who have no manners and eat like barbarics and leave a mess around. It was definitely hard to eat when you need to shield your food and the place smelt like feet.  This place is definitely noisy since there are too many kids around. Would pick a different place for date night or sit outside away from the noise."}
{"text":"This is a great establishment with high quality food.  I've only ate breakfast here and it was delicious.  I recommend trying the \"Big Joe\" meal for $9.99.  You get two pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, and potatoes."}
{"text":"It was well worth the 40 min drive during lunch hour.   Loved walking through the garden with my dog and seeing many fresh veggies.   Definitely, we'll be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Normally Joe's is a 4 star experience but we were super disappointed in their new beverage fountain drinks. The selections are off brand and no diet choices. The one 'light' cola selection is awful.  Food was still good, my wife had the Ahi Tune sandwich and it was cooked too much. I had a great buffalo chicken sandwich and it was good.  This is not a cheap place to eat, but it is normally worth it. But having to buy a can of Diet Coke after you already spent full price on a soda does not make for a great experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere at Joe's Farm Grill. I love the beautiful surroundings of the pecan trees and the quiet sounds of nature when enjoying the meals outside. On the inside its very interesting as the restaurant was actually the house in which Joe's family lived, of course updated and transformed with a modern feel.  There is a wide variety of tasty american meals to choose from. Everything that I have ordered has been excellent and I would encourage all the locals to visit. It is a non-traditional and interesting place to bring along some friends for lunch.  If you are in need of a pick me up, take a walk next door where there is also a place to enjoy coffee, tea and delicious muffins!"}
{"text":"The MOST DELICIOUS AHI TUNA SANDWICH everrrr the food was soo delicious and I couldnt stop saying/thinking it the entire time I was eating. SOoo delicious. Make sure to try the onions ring as well..it seemed as though they fried it in a batter filled with garlic which made it a million times crunchier. yummm i want it nowww...Also..i feel like ordering the sandwich and just eating the fish would be well worth it as well...the mixture between the fish and the wasabi mayo..omy..to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Friendly staff and the food is fantastic. You have to get the onion rings if you go! I like the set up as well, seat yourself concept. Makes it a lot easier"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great for the young boy to find friends and run around before, during and after our food.  The kids choices are not as great as I would want. Full size grown up food is always amazing.  The grilled bbq pizza is good but it is hit or miss on how burnt the bottom is. :(  The farm is a treat. We spend more time on dinner when we are here. Life slows down for us a little.  Get a malted vinilla shake. Sooooo worth it.  Garlic fries/green beans are overloaded with garlicky goodness. Can you tell I am hungry as I type this?   A bit pricy to eat often for us. But we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and the taste was awesome.  We have eaten here many times and it has never disappointed us!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue I can find in the Gilbert area. Lots of variety and the serving sizes are generous. Staff is very friendly and always makes sure to get the orders right. Only downside is that walk-in dining can be a hassle...line always seems to be out the door, so I recommend takeout instead. Overall great place."}
{"text":"Going a little down hill. Place is getting dated and becoming less clean. The food is still good but it's a little more expensive than it's worth. Not always quick service. I'm sure with a little work this place can be just as awesome as it use to be, but right now I will pass it up."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3.5-4 stars.  Really cute establishment. I was told that this place was on that drive-in and diner show (whatever its called) and I could totally see why. There's a huuuge tree and a bunch of picnic benches outside in the back that would be perfect for a cooler day.  First off, the strawberry lemonade is soooo good and refreshing on a hot day! Must get!  I got the 2 hot dog combo. Make sure that you tell them what toppings you want on it! My favorite hot dog was the one with pulled pork, bbq sauce, and slaw on top. It was delicious and enough to fill me up! The garlic fries are also great."}
{"text":"Man happy birthday to me I came for the $10 off birthday deal that Joe's offers and came away with much more  First of the location is around some fields/orchards and something you don't see too often in Arizona. Ordering was quick and they have electronic telly things that remind you when your foods ready  The seared ahi tuna came with some of the best rings I've had and I got a strawberry milkshake as well. The ahi was mammoth with almost a lb of pure tuna. The panko breaded rings were on point. The shake imo was just ok, but it doesn't hurt that it's made with better ingredients then other shakes elsewhere. (Sonic's I'm lookin at you)  Overall the scenery, peeps, and food is worth the trip. (Big fan of the ordering system as well)"}
{"text":"Excellent for Gilbert.  Truly excellent.  For Gilbert.  The sweet potato fries were excellent.  The wild salmon (I should have asked from which river) was a little dry, but the seasoning was quite good.  Five stars for the restrooms."}
{"text":"Love the old farm ambiance and old building that is now converted into a restaurant. You almost forget you are in Arizona, because of the green grass and aged shade trees. It was a nice change without the zeroscape gravel or cactus landscape you commonly see all over the Valley.  There was a line out the door. Grab a menu while you wait in line under the Easy-Up tent. There was only one cashier, then a second cashier showed up for about 5 minutes, then it was back to one cashier again, even with the perpetual long line.  Place your order, pay, they give you a pager, find a table and wait until they buzz you. When they buzz you, your food will be waiting for you from the pick-up window, but show them your pager and place it in the basket.  There were flies while I waited in line. There were flies near the beverage station, flies inside, flies near the restroom. Flies everywhere. Gross!  I had heard great things about this place, so I pretended not to notice all the flies. All of the swarms of other people eating there must not had been bothered by all of the flies either.  Seating is available inside or outside. They had unisex restrooms just like their other place, Liberty Market, but at this location, there were only two restrooms. However, there were sinks for hand washing available outside, in case you just want to washy-washy.  I love onion rings and  don't eat much salt, but I though that the onion rings were a little of bland for being some sort of panko flavored o-rings. They weren't greasy. It was $4.99 for an order. I think I would order them again if I ever came back.  BBQ Chicken Salad was pretty tasty. The greens were fresh, I guess from their farm? Dressing was made from scratch.   I think most entrees are about $8-$10. Three entrees, plus o-rings was about $36. I think their menu items are made of fresh ingredients, so I don't mind paying more for fresh.  We sat inside, which was so loud from a large group of very loud old people sitting at the next table.  Glad I tried Joe's Farm Grill. The walk around the property to the coffee house next door is very pretty."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite lunch spots on a Sunday. We love to bring the kids and sit outside enjoying the weather. Everything on the menu is farm fresh and grown in the garden close to the grill! Highly recommend the chicken pesto burger and sweet potato fries, yum!"}
{"text":"Both times I've been here have been long waits, but the combination of a unique atmosphere and good food have always been worth it. Definitely worth your time-I've had both the Fontiga Burger and BBQ Chicken Pizza.  FYI, the BBQ here comes from Joe's Real BBQ-still good, but you may want to order something unique to the grill."}
{"text":"I am not as enamored with the food here as others. Sure it has fresh ingredients, but it also has flies and dirty lettuce. No thanks. I can go to Joe's BBQ to get the good items on the menu, the ribs."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is the best, my favorite is their Garlic Fries, eveything we have tried their is awesome."}
{"text":"This places constantly deserves a 5 star. This is the second time I have taken a client into the restaurant and they have commented about how nice it is to have the owner walk around and see how everyone is doing. I have to stop them and point out that's the manager Summer not the owner! Great customer service, great food."}
{"text":"I never go here alone because I like introducing friends to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time. This is for several reasons:  1) It's a beautiful farm atmosphere in what some consider \"the middle of the desert\" 2) It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, and I'm a sucker for Triple-D 3) A fresh and tasty take on fast food 4) Unique wacky bathrooms 5) Must-see pneumatic condiment fountain  In fact, one of the times I visited, it was \"Triple-D Month\", which meant they had a lot of promotions relating to their appearance on the much-heralded Food Network show. You could even score a $10 gift card if you showed up dressed like Guy Fieri. I might've been able to grow out and two-tone the goatee, but since I'm bald, I'd never be able to pull off the spiky-haired thing. I will admit, I was tempted to \"borrow\" my neighbor's blonde kid and costume him up just to save a couple of bucks on the fine burgers here.  All the item menus in red type are the meals featured during The Blingy One's visit, so I've been working through them one at a time. I give a thumbs up to the Fontina Burger and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, but I'm not terribly crazy about the sweet potato fries with the pineapple-serrano dipping sauce. I did fall in love with their garlic fries however, and have to recommend them dipped in the Joe's BBQ sauce (available at the fun-to-use pneumatic condiment fountain).  You can't go wrong with a visit to Joe's Farm Grill... even if you're not pulling up in a bitchin' Camaro."}
{"text":"We are lucky enough to live basically right accross the street.    The food is great. Love the thin crust pizzas and the sweet potato fries. They grow a lot of their own veggies. They seasonally sell dates at the farmstand that are GREAT.   You get your food free on your birthday.  Gets very crowded on the weekends!  the dessert is just OK, but the shakes are great!"}
{"text":"Everything is tasty , the tables are always clean and manager will always come and ask if you need anything else. One of my favorite places in Arizona. I love love love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and a great farming community. Checked it out after watching diners drive-ins and dives, was not disappointed."}
{"text":"well since i so enjoyed The Coffee Shop at Agritopia, I decided to try Joe's Farm Grill at Agritopia last night.  OK I was really excited to try the food , even though I feel the fries are on the pricy side, I upgraded to garlic fries with my hot dog basket. My roommate ordered the BBQ pork sandwhich I love how the drink station is outdoors with all the condiments that's so cute we ordered our food to go , but maybe we should have eaten it fresh because my hot dog was sorta dry and I didn't much like the garlic fries  My roommate, on the other hand, loved her BBQ pork sandwhich, she said it was the best pork she ever had.  I am going to try some of their other food in the future and eat it fresh and see if I like it any better."}
{"text":"Unlike Cassandra, I love kids and brought 4 of my own to Joe's. We all loved it. Fresh tasty food, great outdoor seating and lost of room for the kids to play with all of those dogs etc. The ahi tuna was cooked right and the slaw on it was amazing. The french fries might be the best I have ever had. The Chocolate shake was good but a little too rich for my taste. My wife said that the Buffalo chicken sandwich she ate was the best chicken sandwich ever. Her ice tea was amazing. My eldest daughter had the grilled peanut butter and banana split which had chocolate chips, pineapple, strawberries and of course peanut butter that was very different but great! The only drawbacks were the sweet potato fires ( not bad but I have had much better) there was only one condiment and drink area and that was clear on the other side of the fairly large area of land and the lone garbage can was also quite far. The pluses obviously are the tasty fresh food and of course plenty of room for kids to play and bother Cassandra."}
{"text":"I wanted to move to Agritopia when my ex and I were looking for a big old house in east Gilbert.  I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.    Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.  Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.  The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.  Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Gilbert. The food is amazing prices are good and there's always something fun going on. There is a cool coffee shop next-door to that I always check out when I'm there. My daughter loves to go there because we have got to see a real live horses and exotic birds on random days when we have lunch"}
{"text":"Joe's is a hidden local place that only people in chandler/Gilbert/Mesa seem to know about and Scottsdale/Phoenix folks are seriously missing out!! The food is fresh and the atmosphere is an experience of its on. I've tried the pizza and chicken sandwich... BOTH ARE GREAT! My boyfriend gets their burger and absolutely raves about it. We moved 30 minutes away from Joe's and talk about this place weekly!"}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Johnston,  The trifecta that is Liberty Market, Joe's Real BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill are bad for my diet.  I'm not saying it's your fault but if the food at your fine establishments were not so darm fresh and tasty, I would be thinner.  I crave your food.  And when I went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time it was so good, I went back the very next day!!  Obviously you love what you do and we reap the benefits so thank you!  But my waistline does not thank you.    Sincerely,  Lynn W."}
{"text":"My first time here was better it had been about 6 months. This time my ribs were lukewarm and the cheesecake was not spectacular like the first time I had it. Sent the ribs back and got a bacon and blue cheese burger, it was pretty good. Just an OK experience,I'm not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here since I knew about DDD.....even after all this time you'd be suprised how crowded it was--on a Tuesday night at 7!  It's all right it was pretty efficient and worth the wait.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and garlic fries.  The garlic fries were awesome!  Crisp, perfectly seasoned and not greasy.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was equally as tasty, the chicken breast was butterflied, grilled not fried and was larger than the bun.  Just enough buffalo sauce, some thin celery slices and some blue cheese dressing.  As a surprise to hubby took home fresh banana pudding--he said was was awesome!  Only downsides--it was little cool last night so the inside seating was taken quickly--they did have heaters outside but still a tad brisk.  The farm concept is wonderful until the wind shifts--country perfume we used to call it in Virginia--"}
{"text":"omg what more can i say about this place i ate here on a recent vacation and thought the food was amazing i love the way the restaurant was set up it made eating there enjoyable the portions are huge and yeah its expensive if you eat with more than two people but i think its worth it  defiantly a place i would eat at again  :)"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast , love the outdoor seating when the weather is nice .  Long lines but it moves fairly fast"}
{"text":"This place deserves a fiver.. Went with a buddy to try it out and both of us landed slam dunks with his ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings and drink (bit expensive at around $20) and my '4B' burger (with fontina instead of bleu) with sweet potato fries (around $12).. Have to mention that although my burger was great, I had a bite of the tuna and know I am getting that next time!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place.  From the chicken pizza, to the shrimp to the amazing breakfasts, Joe's has become a staple of ours here in Gilbert.  The kids can't get enough of the farm atmosphere and we can't get enough of the food; which there is plenty of!  It may be a little pricey, but they give you your money's worth both in quantity and quality.  Don't leave without trying one of their delicious shakes.  Keep it up Joe's and we will keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"My friends, the breakfast here is second to none. Try the apple fritters. They are heaven in your mouth. The only knock on this place is the location...2,000 miles from my place is too far."}
{"text":"Disappointing. First visit, the place was extremely busy so I overlooked the quality of the food. Second visit was fairly slow, but the quality was equally as poor. Ahi was overcooked, burger overcooked, fries too salty, onion rings too greasy."}
{"text":"I took a trip out of urban Phoenix from the wave of restaurants and automobile exhaust to \"saborea estos ricos Tacos de Huevos.\"  Three soft- corn tacos filled with potato, egg, shredded cheddar and bacon, with salsa verde, sour cream. And side of farm beans. Here you find in the back yard lots of grass, picnic tables, children laughing, playing, mature trees, just a wonderful place to dine.   Eating is seldom this absorbing, this bracing on the urban farm. The plots closest to the restaurant are for field crops.The production is utilized by Joe's Farm Grill.  Can a farm morph into a most alluring and impressive restaurant worthy of the highest accolade a critic can award? You know it hombre."}
{"text":"I am a FAN! love this place and have for a very long time. My favorites are the BBQ chicken pizza, fontina burger, garlic fries, pesto chicken sandwich and the Sonoran dog. SO good. Great outdoor seating. Beautiful scenery, greattttt for kids. good prices! and you get a free meal on your birthday. I will say try to go before or after typical lunch time on the weekends because the lines can get really long. The area outside is large and great if you have little ones that like to run around. After your meal, I suggest getting a coffee or a cupcake at the coffee shop that is right next door. Then walk around the farm area after. Its a nice escape from the busy world and soak in some quality time with your family. Enjoy yourself! I always do there."}
{"text":"Staff was attentive, fast and very friendly!   Food was super disappointing and overly priced.  I was expecting to be wowed from what I have heard about the place but kinda let down.   But totally worth 3  because of the Superior customer service and atmosphere! (Bathrooms were cool) And very clean."}
{"text":"Omg this was the best Farm Burger... and the Onion Rings Good lord!!! My husband got the Ahi Tuna Sandwich!!! That it was around 8 pm but the fish was still fresh and the flavor from the grill was just yummy! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great, sustainable, and tasty!  There was a line out the door, as usual, but it moved relatively quickly, and it gave us time to look over the menu while we waited.  We ordered the Fried Zucchini Slices and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. The milkshakes looked very tempting, but we decided try them some other time. We went and washed our hands (they have an outdoor washing sink; hooray!), and sat down with our buzzer to wait for our food.  Granted it was busy, the food did take a little while, but it gave us time to use the restroom, etc. Seating was plentiful; there are selections of benches and regular tables.  With my Tuna Sandwich I ordered a side of fruit. The fruit amount was tiny; enough to fill one of those little to-go containers for salad dressing. Eh, fruit is expensive, I get it.  When I picked up our order I noticed I forgot to request a multi-grain bun. I asked the server at the window if I could get a new bun. She was very accommodating and allowed me to get a new bun.  The food was delicious. I like that they use honey in their slaw instead of refined sugar. The entrees were well portioned, but as I mentioned the sides are a little on the small side. Ahi tuna usually is served as a smaller portion because of its high cost, but the size of the cut was enough to fill out the bun!  I would recommend this place for its fresh food and great atmosphere. Although the prices are a little on the high side for a \"grill\" joint, it is healthy and you are supporting your local farmers."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Gilbert. My family and I eat here at least a couple of times a month.  The prices are a little high but you're paying for the amazing quality of the food. Every dish we have tried is amazing. They recently remodeled as well and the new design had a much better flow. Their outdoor eating area is also very nice and was expanded along with the inside. The restaurant is very family friendly and they cater for food allergies too.  They have also upgraded their drink selection to sodas completely free of high fructose corn syrup!  I do not have one bad thing to say about Joe's and look forward to my next meal there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Salmon, fried zucchini, garlic fries, burgers, wedge salad, shakes, and BBQ pizza are all favorites. We had breakfast there once and it was great too! Be sure to check them out on your bday too!! Also, this may sound random but the bathrooms are very unique!"}
{"text":"I seen Joe's farm grill on tv so I said let me give it a try. First couple of things I witness was cleansiness 2nd. Fast and educated. I ordered the grill chicken with there home made farm fresh jumbo battered onion rings that were divine. You gotta try their seasonal pumpkin shake. It's to drive for yes i said take the drive for. Great classic bathrooms."}
{"text":"Always has great food but this \"Tractor Soda Co\" has GOT to go. They're all-natural, organic, sodas. That may sound good in theory, but the flavors are too exotic and just simply DO NOT taste good. Plus it causes a traffic jam at the drink station because you have people trying every soda, hoping to find one they like, which normally doesn't happen. Give the people what they want, Joe! Bring back the Coca-Cola products!"}
{"text":"Returned to Joe's on Valentine's Day for breakfast.  It was fantastic as usual.  The food was great and the atmosphere very pleasant.  They were very busy but even the crowd was polite.  We really enjoy the ample seating and all the trees.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Took the recommendation of Gouda burger - it was perfect. Wife had the Chicken Ceasar salad and fresh lemonade also very good. Garlic fries were incredible. A little pricey for lunch but so good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  I love their bbq bleu cheese burger. They have awesome fries, their bathrooms and really cool and I like all of the condiments available to help yourself with.  Last but not least the atmosphere and ambience are amazing! I live this place."}
{"text":"On a recent long weekend in Phoenix, we enjoyed our final, and best, meal at Joe's Farm Grill. This is a truly unique concept. Food is cultivated on the adjacent farm property, or sourced locally whenever possible. As the menu states, it's common food done uncommonly well. Quality is the watch word.   Food is prepared and served in a central building where you wait in line to order, pay and then are given a beeper device which signals you (in short order) when your meal is ready to be picked up. Seating options are inside, outside in a covered area immediately adjacent to the building or throughout the grounds (in an orchard kind of setting) at picnic tables. There were seven of us there on a late Sunday morning, the weather was sunny and about 70 degrees so we opted for the picnic table, which could not have been more pleasant.   Breakfast is served till 11:00AM, followed by burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza, Bar-B-Q and sides until 9:00PM. A kid's menu is also offered. Our group choose a variety from the large number of menu choices, and without exception everyone was happy with their selections which included the farm burger with cheese and grilled onions, the Thai chicken salad, the Ahi tuna sandwich (rare with wasabi mayo), excellent rosemary dill panko onion rings, farm milk shades (that day offered in Agritopia Medjool date, pumpkin, as well as the more traditional flavors) and for Izabel, our granddaughter, corn dog bites.   This was a thoroughly satisfying dining experience all around, and will be my first meal on my next trip to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is nearby.  It is a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  A casual, diner-type atmosphere, with food orders submitted at a front window and orders collected at another.  This place is a draw, and consequently the line at the order window can get to be a little long.  We think up to a 20-minute wait is worth it.  The coffee shop in the same parking lot is a great place to hang out, and it too has a great menu for a small coffee shop."}
{"text":"Joe's, I want to love you but I don't. I think there are two types of people that go here. People that know the food is average and people who are in denial because of its geography. Your food is extra \"meh\" with a side of \"Hmmm.\"  We have been here many times. The set-up is terrific. We make the trek and take our dog to nearby Cosmo Dog Park... then hop over for pizza, hamburgers, salads, etc. (I think we've tried just about everything... to no avail. How do you screw up BBQ pizza??)  Since I may sound like a Negative Nelly, I will say I dig the milkshakes.  So why is it so popular?   This is a haven for East Valley apologists who want to have a signature restaurant to call their own but don't want to drive into \"the city.\" Look into your hearts, people of Mesa / Gilbert. Enough of the charade. You saw it on Food Network and you're happy there's some place there with a line out the door."}
{"text":"Food is really good, and portion sizes are amazing but I always leave feeling like I paid the right amount and the wait was worth it.   Never had a bad experience, but always had a terrific one either... Just lives up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"First off let me tell you I am a big fan...they have Motorcycle Parking right out front! Unfortunately I got there around 11:45am and they stop serving breakfast at 11am. What the Hell? I am all about breakfast, and would have loved to try some of their Yummy selections...that is for another visit. The place is pretty awesome, and they are totally smart with the technology. There is a video monitors that show menu items being made, the place on Diners, Drive-Thrus, and Dives, and full copies of the menu. This is a great thing to do, as I am all about something to occupy my time while I wait. I had the Fontina Burger and the Pesto that was on it might have been some of the best Pesto I have had. Fries were hot and crisp. The condiment station is laid out well, with a little sink to wash your hands right there (everyone take note...wash those hands). The ingredients were nice and fresh, bun grilled to perfection, and it was a beautiful sunny day out, so we sat outside. The restrooms were super clean and very unique (TV above the Urinal, and action figures above the Toilet, it is UniSex by the way).  I will so be back to try Joes Farm Grill again!"}
{"text":"After countless reruns on Triple D, Joe's Farm Grill became a pit stop during a business trip. The building is unique in it's layout and decor, looks like a diner from the Jetsons. Great food and definitely fresh! Will come back if in town again."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating at picnic tables, which is perfect during our cooler months.  Have only eaten breakfast here, but it's always been great.  Only downfall is long line to order and have to pick up your food...personally I like to be served, but that is just the style of this place."}
{"text":"That's what I'm talking about! So this place has had some dishes featured on DDD which is a good sign but not necessarily a guarantee of great food. Well it did not disappoint. Really good barbecue and some creative excellent dishes. The Ahi tuna sandwich was a stand out. Really appreciate the quality and freshness. Nice environment too with outdoor seating in a park like setting. Bobby Chay knows good food and Bobby Chay likey very much."}
{"text":"If I were a good critic every experience I've had at Joe's Farm Grill would be rated a 10 on friendliness of staff... expediting my order... and food quality was excellent. So on my review I would say get down there! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I love the environment too! It has a great friendly staff and great food to match!!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place. I always take visitors here and they also love it. You simply can't go wrong. Some of my favorites are the portebello mushroom burger, veggie pizza, tuna sandwich, and sweet potato fries. You should def come here on your birthday because you get a $10 credit toward your meal."}
{"text":"Something happened with the new upgrade...im not sure what it is :(  But while the environment is awesome and i love the farm vibe, the food quality seems to have gone down a lot.  I tried a little bit of what everyone had at our table and it was such a disappointment.  The fried shrimp tasted greasy and lacked flavor, the fried zucchini was floppy, the french fries were cold, the pizza was tough.  The whole new soda machines are really awful, none of our kids like the flavor of the homemade sodas. Its such a shame because we use to love this place and now we no longer do."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is a wonderful place to grab lunch, I was there the other day and they have a wide assortment of healthy meal options that are out of this world. There's nothing better than knowing that you're getting a nutritious meal as well as beautiful scenery to go with it."}
{"text":"Healthy food that tastes good!? I've found the Pink Unicorn of everyone's dreams! Seriously, they will adjust any menu item to keto friendly, and there is literally something for everyone here. The best part is leaving satisfied without feeling guilty!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Bay Area for the last six years and when I moved to Arizona, I had my doubts on the food here.   Joe's Farm Grill exceeded my expectations of breakfast and lunch food items.   What I got:  Fontina Burger. Rating:  4/5  BBQ Chicken Pizza. Rating:  4/5 Farm Burger. Rating:  3/5 Sweet Potato Fries. Rating 4/5 Traditional Eggs. Rating 4/5  The Traditional Eggs are unlike anything I've ever ate. Its light, fresh, and has doesn't leave you with that heavy breakfast feeling. Unlike IHOP or Denny's, its feels very healthy and the feeling where you've got all the protein in your diet to start the day.   The BBQ Chicken Pizza was also great - It's huge enough to share for two people. It's a flat bread pizza that I'm also a huge fan of!   Overall, this is one of my favorite breakfast places in the Phoenix area. It has also been in featured on the Food Network and a place where I take visitors."}
{"text":"Not too expensive but not too good either.  Only had their breakfast (egg tacos). It was flavorless.  I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Super fresh. Like spicy? Get pepper jack on something. Order green goodness dressing on the side. Portobello sandwich, burger, Buffalo chicken sandwich, zucchini side... Very tasty and affordable."}
{"text":"Great area. Lots of kids running around. Definitely a family place. The menus has options for the whole family! Overall the food was pretty standard. Nothing outrageously great but a good place to go for verity"}
{"text":"My family came here on a Saturday to celebrate my birthday.  They advertise a free birthday entree on your day of celebration.  I even showed the guy who took our order my drivers license, and he wished me a Happy Birthday.  When we got home home and looked at the receipt, they had charged us for my meal.  I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries but when it was delivered the server had to take it back because it wasn't a veggie burger.  This place is always super busy and just feels disorganized.  The food is good and we really enjoy sitting outside.  It's great for kids to be able to play while you eat too.  I just wish the staff could do a better job of getting things right."}
{"text":"Had the bbq pizza. Not bad. The crust was wonderful. The sauce was good but the randomly place bleu cheese chunks detracted from the flavor. The ahi tuna sandwich was good. The slaw was large. The bun got a little soggy. The vanilla shake made with real vanilla bean stole the show. Very good"}
{"text":"Hands down the best local restaurant in Gilbert! The food was fresh, the service was great, and the food didn't take long at all once I ordered it. It is a great atmosphere and really cool how the farm is right behind the restaurant. It's not pricey at all and a great place to take the family, I would suggest going later at night around 7:30 or 8 because if you go earlier than that you will be waiting in line for a while!"}
{"text":"Food not worth the wait. Stood in line for 50 minutes just to order. Saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line. Mentioned just how busy they have been. Saw the obviously long line and didn't do anything to address the situation. Yep, the entire time only one of their two order windows was open. One.  I guess I'm the sucker and the joke's on me."}
{"text":"We used to go here quite a bit and just recently visited again. I will break it down to the pros and cons.   Pros: Beautiful outdoor space Good quality food  Cons: Inside eating area was dirty/out dated Customer service is definitely lacking  Long lines (only one cashier at lunch time)  About customer service:  My salmon was raw on the inside. Not under cooked- it was raw. I took it back up to the counter and they gave me attitude. The guy said \"that's the way we make it here.\" I felt as if I was inconveniencing them. They said \"we can make you a new one but you're going to have to wait- there's a lot of orders ahead of you and the salmon takes time.\" I waited, and waited. Everyone in my party was done eating already when I finally say down to eat. I think for the reputation they have they could do a better job making people feel welcome. I didn't actually kind having to wait- but I do mind the way I was treated.   Also, there were so many flies and Mosquitos when we were there this last time. They are re-seeding the lawn and there were puddles of standing water.  In the inside dining area there were stains all over and it smelled musty.   I might wait some time to eat there again."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place to pieces. I always order the BBQ sampler and shrimp platter; I'm Greedy. The wife absolutely loves their fresh hamburgers. Their BBQ flatbread pizza is delicious also. It's a very popular restaurant so expect a wait. It'll be well worth it."}
{"text":"I demanded a \"no chain\" place for dinner. My dad requested something light. My mom...well, she wasn't picky.   So my brother, SIL and a couple other locals suggested we go here. Had I not pigged out earlier in the day, I would have ordered one of the burger or sandwich options. Instead, I ordered the BBQ chicken salad minus the dressing. For something I was expecting a side salad size, it was a big size bowl full of greens (spinach, arugula and romaine lettuce mix), BBQ chicken pieces, some corn, and tortilla chip strips. I loved everything about it but unfortunately couldn't finish. I stole a handful of my dad's hot and crunchy sweet potato fries. My mom liked her BBQ chicken pizza but there was just too much of it to finish. And she can eat for a tiny person. The wait wasn't terrible but get in defense mode when scoping out a table on a crowded night. It's at least a four person place: 2 to wait in line, order, and carry/manage the food, while the other 2 eyeball where the next empty table will pop up. And break...."}
{"text":"Grilled Buffalo Chicken sandwich rocks. Kids loved the Grilled Cheese as well."}
{"text":"Fun to find this gem in the midst of sprawling Phoenix (thanks Drive-Ins, Diners and Dives!).  Fontina burger was great! Nice story behind the place, too.  Makes you feel instantly connected to it."}
{"text":"Great food experience!  Visited recently to a great menu in a farm atmosphere.  Indoor or outdoor dining.  Met or exceeded my expectations for a delectable lunch.  Get there early as the line get's busy about Noon.  Other businesses on the farm including a great microbrewery called 12 West Brewing.com.  Taking all my peeps there for lunch and a beer hop next week.  Unlike any other dining experience I have experienced and the food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"This is our first review after a few visits to Joe's. Every time food has been pretty exceptional. However, the only disappointing thing is both times I came for the portobello mushroom sandwich they were out of mushrooms. The grilled ahi tuna is fantastic and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What an excellent surprise! Just needed a place for a bite to eat and an impromptu family reunion and ended up in the perfect spot. Smack in the middle of the desert and lo and behold there's a farm and picnic tables, green grass and autumn leaves falling off trees that you can stomp in and crunch. Of course it was the day after Christmas but in Arizona the weather is always full of wonderful twists.  It's definitely a Farmstand concept with a bit of a modern twist. Reminded me of the roadside farm restaurants back east. The menu is large and filled with old and new favorites, all made with fresh ingredients. I had a burger that while perhaps a little on the done side, tasted fabulous. You know it'll be good when you see the perfectly misshapen form! The buttery roll is always a plus. Everybody was able to satisfy their cravings from a beet salad to veggie burgers to peanut butter and banana sandwiches. And since we were able to eat outdoors, even with a pretty gusty wind blowing, we could have conversations and really enjoy our family gathering without the noise level you find indoors. The grill for pizza was out of service, so we didn't get to try it but I'm pretty sure they'll be a return trip."}
{"text":"My favorite place to meet up with friends for lunch or grab a burger for take out. I've never had a bad meal from here. I love the outdoor areas where you can dine and hang out with friends. You can take a stroll through the community garden too and check out the new Barnone crafters mall."}
{"text":"We order some appetizers and some desserts. The food looks like it was prepared somewhere else. I thought it was overpriced."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere.  Didn't care for the very long line.   Food was good, but not great.  I had the Fontina burger and onion rings along with coleslaw.  My daughter had corndogs with fries and and my wife had a garden burger.  For desert my wife had a dark chocolate shake and I had the vanilla bean shake.  I'll try the coffee shake next time.  Update:  I went again and had a pepperoni pizza...meh.  OMG, you have to come to checkout the insane bathroom here.  #creepybarbiebathroom   Update2:  Went after the big remodel for breakfast.  Food was good.  Wish they would have updated their scary bathrooms.  See this video if you don't know what I'm referring to-- https://youtu.be/78Yj3QPGEyU"}
{"text":"I always feel so good when I eat here! Fresh food, and a wonderful atmosphere, I love getting the peanut butter, chocolate chip, banana sandwich thing and sitting outside and feeding my crust to the birds. DInner and a show! The iced tea is pretty good as well.   The only problem with this place is the line is sometimes so long because of how great it is!! :P"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends and my family the service was good and we got there just in time because there was line behind us that formed out of the door. The menu was simple and easy to read. The food was pretty pricey for what you got. For a kids meal and two buffalo chicken sandwiches we paid around 35 bucks for it. The food was ok the French fries were drenched in salt and the chicken we got with the kids meal was terrible my kids would not even eat it, there was no seasoning, no flavor and it was dry I would give this place another chance  just because of the atmosphere it had a good old school feel to it and if you sat outside it is pretty open to where the kids could run around."}
{"text":"Great American food with fresh ingredients. Wonderful place to take the kids with tons of space to run around and plenty of kid friendly menu choices."}
{"text":"I love Joe's. They have an amazing atmosphere with super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Every time I go there I have a great time! Keep it up Joe's!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Anytime friends or family come to town they all favor this place. The food is the best, definitely quality you can taste.  I recently had the best service ever with a worker there Nannette!  This place keeps getting better!  I love the shrimp platter with onion rings. The cheesecake is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I took my niece here for lunch on my sister in law's recommendation.  They grow the produce right there on the farm.  You can walk around and literally see where your food comes from.  I had the fried shrimp which is a treat for me.  They were awesome.  Flavorful breading.  We had sweet potato fries (served with incredible pineapple salsa)which even tasted good the next day cold at the airport with the seared ahi to go that was cheaper and a million times better than airport food.  Katrina had the portobello mushroom burger.  I had some and it was cooked & dressed perfectly.  The coleslaw was fresh & tasty, the fried zucchini were excellent.  The portions were so huge we could only eat about one third.  There is outside seating under the mister & I will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent selection, One of the best bbq chicken pizzas I've ever tasted,  Delicious fried green beans, Very friendly bunch of kids they have working there.. They just have to do something about the flies. There were hundreds of them. They'll eat your food if you're not careful.  My grandma almost went Super Saiyan on the dang things! Don't take a date or your grandma here, get takeout instead. They have a picture of Guy Fieri on the wall and even he's swattin them flies away."}
{"text":"Delicious food! My favorite is the farm burger with a side of onion rings. The BBQ chicken pizza is great, too. Lines are long but staff is efficient enough that the wait isn't too bad. The tasty food is made to order and ambience is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Excellent food, everything tasted great.    I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich & Garlic fries.  They use only hormone-free, natural grain fed chickens, which is maybe why the meat was so tender.  Tossed in hot wing sauce, bleu cheese and some nicely cut celery, it was like eating hot wings in a sandwich.  And it wasn't just quickly slapped together and tossed down the line, these guys took their time.  Also, I'm a big fan of iced tea, and whatever it is they're using here is superior to most.  I was a little annoyed at first paying $14 for a chicken sandwich & fries; but when I sat down and ate it, I felt like I really got what I paid for...a damn good chicken sandwich.  I will most likely return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch sometimes and I always have a great experience. The food is amazing and it's a fun environment . It's something different and unique. They have picnic tables outside with large trees that provide lots of shade. Also, I love their Sweet Potato fries!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for a quiet and peaceful meal. The setting is under big trees and you can choose to sit inside or outside. Great meeting place for the ability to share with each other in a calm and pretty setting. The food is amazing and the grounds and gardens are such a great addition."}
{"text":"Excellent food and well worth the wait in line. The food was very tasty. Plenty of unique options on menu to order. There is both indoor and outdoor eating options. More room outside on picnic benches. Very reasonable prices and good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"I come to Arizona at least once a year and every time I go visit Joe's Farm Grill; I always get stares from the customers and sometimes the staff. Maybe its because I'm a small Asian girl who goes in with a white friend (not trying to be racist at all) who's about.. 6'3 and I'm only 5'0, and a group of other interracial people, but ya know, I guess it was bound to happen.   We walked in during the night time and it wasn't crazy busy. Hot but not crazy busy. We ordered the Fontana Burger, Onion Rings, Garlic Fries, BBQ Chicken Pizza and two chocolate shakes. Bill came out to be around.. $50ish I believe.. or even higher than that--I can't recall. I had high expectations of this place for the food Guy Feiri had and said about them. Boy, I was deceived.   The Fontana Burger we had was dry and tasted bitter. I loved the fact that they kept saying their veggies were grown fresh and yes, I love that but I don't think it went well with the burger, especially for its cost. The onion rings were large and crispy but the inside was raw and when I bit into it the onion came right out. Batter still intact but the onion came straight out. Garlic fries were amazingly good yet still extremely oily from its cooking process. The Chocolate shakes were too very very delicious, rich chocolatey taste not too thick not too viscous with a nice little hint of bitterness in its after taste. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was the only entree that kept it's hype from DDD; moist, full of flavour and an orgasm in your mouth. Was truly delicious now only if I could add some sort of hot sauce on it to give it a spicy taste. I always keep coming back to this restaurant because its just one of those restaurants you hope to get better every time you go visit. It stayed relatively the same.  I sometimes doubt what Guy Feri says about certain restaurants sometimes its either a hit or miss. But if you're ever in the area and aren't on a serious budget give this place a try. This place might not be for me but it might be for you."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the food network raves.  Ordered various items, including BBQ pizza, BBQ pork plate, portabella mushroom sandwich.  Also did the Peanut butter bananna split just to say we tried it.  Nothing really jumped out as being above average.  Pork was average, sandwich average and pizza was as well.  The pb&bananna split was not good AT ALL.  It was mostly the thick texas toast, and very greasy.  (we got it to split for dessert)  The only thing that was really better than average was the fried zuchinni.  The breading was light and flavorful and they were not at all greasy.   The parking was bad, but the atmosphere was kind of cute.  Different than any place I'd been before.   All in all, if you don't live in that part of town, I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times. When I'm craving the perfect, juiciest burger, I drive half an hour a way here and I'm never disappointed. Everyone is always so friendly and seems genuinely happy even at the busiest times. I have Celiac Disease so I have to be really careful about gluten and cross contamination. They actually have a gluten free fryer (whoop whoop) and they always tells they will do the best they can to avoid cross contamination. I've never been glutened there so I'm very thankful for this! In short, it's one of those places that I'd be surprised you had a bad experience. You might wait a bit in line but I just avoid busy hours. Afterwards, we always walk over and get coffee from The Coffee Shop. It's just a perfect day for me."}
{"text":"Freaky great casual atmosphere!  And don't miss the bakery next door. Great outdoor and indoor seating, we plan to go back for breakfast with the dogs!"}
{"text":"Perfect for family gatherings or date night! Our meal isn't complete here without an order of the garlic fries YUM! We have not had an item on the menu that isn't delicious, but we highly recommend the BBQ sampler! Love this place and has friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"Funny my burger didn't look like the add pics it was bright red inside. Scary for a hamburger. Will not be going back,and the line to order is slower than Disneyland."}
{"text":"Not entirely impressed. My fiancé got the the buffalo chicken sandwich and I got the pulled bbq pork sandwich nothing but fat. Waited quite a bit of time to get my greek? Fries( cant remember what kind they were) after my meal but when I did I found a hair in my food. When i approached the cashier she was apologetic but when she gave me my money back she was still wear the gloves she was handling food in.. Ew"}
{"text":"I constantly rave about this place to my friends. Usually what gets them going is the fact that I mention that this place was on Food Network. I remember seeing the show and being very interested in trying it since it was nearby. My favorite thing about this place is of course the food. It is all grown on their farm and if it isn't, it is locally grown and organic. The food wows my every time. I love it. My all time favorites are the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, and fried green beans (although I no longer see it on the menu, which saddens me). I have also had their burgers and I can seriously tell the difference between their beef and beef from other restaurants. To explain how I can tell the difference, my family bought a cow years ago and had it cut up to produce various selections that we split with another family. To me, a lot of beef tastes disgusting except for what I buy straight from a butcher AND from Joes Farm Grill. That alone is my reasoning for instantly loving this place. Joes Farm Grill has many different food selections to choose from and I suggest trying all of them. All are very delicious in their own right."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times over the last couple of years.  I had always wanted to try it, since I frequented Joe's BBQ, but it's so far out, that I never found myself in the area.  I went there once with a friend from out of town who saw it on TV and had to go there, so we made the trip.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, some garlic fries and a drink.  It took a while to get the food, which is fine since that way you know it's fresh.  I was really looking forward to the garlic fries, as it's one of the things I love about Gordon Biersch, so I wanted to see their take on them.  Once we got the food, we actually were fortunate enough to get a table inside (this was in June).  I was disappointed that they didn't have fresh lemonade like Joe's BBQ.  They had that 0% juice Minute Maid stuff.  Then no Dr. Pepper!  I am surprised that for the money they charge for a small drink, you get the totally basic Coke fountain with Mr. Pibb.  The burger was good, but nothing to write home about. It was fresh, the cheese had good flavor and the bacon was good.  It was the best part of the meal, which was unfortunate because the garlic fries should have taken the cake, but were so loaded up with oil that they weren't that enjoyable.  I don't know how to describe the feeling, but once you get about 3/4 through them, you end up with a soup of sorts and it's tough to finish them.    I was hoping that it would be different the next time, but they're consistent.  I won't say no to it if I'm in the area and someone wants to eat there, but it's not good enough to make the drive from where I live in Central Phoenix.  I'll take Joe's BBQ first.  It's actually cheaper for more food."}
{"text":"Fast service on our order...we called ahead and it was ready to go when we got there 5 minutes later. Free wifi. while you wait. Got the salad with chicken on top and onion rings. **Krunchy** onion rings!"}
{"text":"First stop coming from San Diego,CA! The line was long but don't let it stop you from trying their delicious food! I ordered the ahi tuna sandwhich with a side of their GARLIC Fries. Both were delicious!! My boyfriend got their goat cheese stuff lamb burger with a side of Greek fries and was also very good! Definitely recommend this place. They have a variety of fountain drinks, milkshakes and lemonades! Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. Great customer service!!! Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Really cool concept- they use local ingredients (some picked right outside of their front door). We went for breakfast and had the a) meat and potatoes and b) chicken and mushroom scrambles. These were BIG portions, so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"They gave us $10 off because it's my birthday! Went for breakfast. Loved the setting. Lots of outdoor seating under big trees. The bacon & sausage are really good. Def get their apple fritters! My waffle was ok. Husband liked their potatoes. We want to go back for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"The concept is really cool, but the food was pretty average.  Joe's was highly recommended by friends.  We got there about 6:30pm on Monday.  The line was long, so we had a chance to review the menu and history.  When we got to the window and started ordering, they then told us they were out of most everything except burgers, grilled chicken & fries So, that's what we ordered.   There was no pizza, no BBQ, no onion rings, etc.)  Wish the would have told us while we waited.  Heck, they had fancy TV monitors promoting their products while we stood in line.  Why not tell us the update before getting to the window!?!  And, it was just OK... basic grilled chicken either on a bun or on-top of a salad.  The dressings were nothing to write home about.  The menu promised greens from their farm.  Well, sorry to say, I've grown & purchased local, farm fresh greens and Joe's tasted pretty mass-produced and bland.  My biggest concern would be that we arrived OFF season and waited at least 30 minutes to order and they were sold out of half of the menu.  I shudder to think what it would be like when the whole garden is full (meaning 4x more crowds than last night.)  Go for the concept, but be prepared for a long wait for basic food."}
{"text":"I drove all across town just to get one of their hot dogs. When I got there they were out at 1 in the afternoon. So I settled for a pork tenderloin sandwich. It was seriously the worst I've ever had. Dry and tasteless. 5 years ago this place rocked, lately every time I come here I'm let down. Have they changed owners?"}
{"text":"Such a great place to take the family. Love the outdoor seating and fun bathroom :) I just wish they had more options for people food allergies/celiac, other than that it's great!"}
{"text":"Lousy service, food is ok IF they have what you want.  I showed up today, wooed to go here by the description of the Ham & Cheese fritters.  So, arriving 10 minutes after they opened at 8 - they were out.  No \"sorry\" - just \"we don't have it, but it's on the list to be made.\"  Good to know.    Maybe one of the two cooks on break or the cook who kept running back and forth to the bathroom texting on could have made some.  I got something else (only because the counter girl made me feel uncomfortable, becuase I was taking too long thinking about a plan B) - it was ok.  Service was mediocre - counter girl just set on our empty drink cups on the counter, forcing us to reach inside their stupid window while she watched.  The maintenance guy (after a good 30 minute BS session with another maintenance guy) proceeded to stink up the outside (how hard is to stink up the outside?) using ridiculous amounts of stainless steel polish.    I was visiting friends, who said they don't go becuase it is always crowded. Every time we drove by this week, the parking lot was empty.  10 minutes after open - you are already out of stuff for the after-church breakfast crowd - now I see why.  Most TV stars make it becuase they are great actors - this TV star acts like a great restaurant - but really - I would pass.  Stick to farming, Joe.  EDIT - I was contacted by their General Manager within hours of this review being posted.  That is some quick response, and he seemed genuine in making things right.  It does not change what the visit was like, but I will give them another star for the effort to fix things so quickly."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner ordered a BBQ pork sandwich with a side of slaw .. every time ive came it hasnt been bad but today they decided to serve COLD BBQ pork .. no exaggeration but the plate was hotter than the meat was.. great service ! Poor food quality ."}
{"text":"It's a ways out there, but worth the drive. Very family friendly. We went on a Saturday and were dismayed by the very long Disney-esque lines at lunch, but we had driven so far...! My BF had the Chicken Caesar salad and I had a salad with ahi. We shared some fries. All of the food was done really well and there's no denying the produce is just-picked and wonderful. The outdoors seating is really nice if the weather's cooperating."}
{"text":"Foods good, but it's lunch rush and you have one window open taking orders while you have a line of people going out your doors...... why??"}
{"text":"Good food - the wait to order seems to need a little improvement. I understand speed of service and keeping the kitchen on time, just a long wait to order."}
{"text":"Came across Joe's Farm Grill during a work trip to Gilbert. I was impressed by the amount of great views and not to mention Guy Fieri approved! This place can be somewhat difficult to find as the building is surrounded by trees. What first appeared as a line out the door, quickly was shorten as the service is fast here. Menus are strategically placed before you enter the front door so you can view the selection as you wait in line. Staff member went around greeting everyone and asking if everyone was good. Appreciated that their staff immediately cleaned down tables as soon as parties left.   Plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. Great for big groups. Loved the picnic tables underneath the trees. Both kid and pet friendly environment. Also, very interesting unisex bathroom! Dolls displayed behind a case and a tv in front of the men's stall! Only thing I wish they would fix is the amount of flies both inside and outside. =[ I initially sat outside to enjoy the scenery, but was quickly turned off by all the flies. I thought by moving inside I would escape the flies, but I was wrong. There were not as many flies as outside but was really annoyed that i had to constantly hover my hand over my food to deter the flies.   Fontina Burger ($9.99) was point. Perfect amount of crisp on the bun, tasty patty, and generous amount of pesto. The sweet potato fries (extra $2.50 charge) were great and included a sweet tasting dipping sauce that completed well. The fresh strawberry lemonade ($3.99) is enough for two people to share.    Tip: Make sure to grab napkins before you sit down. There are no napkin dispensers on the tables."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat for someone out in the east valley. Good food but there always seems to be lines here. I guess that's a sign of good food but I would avoid this on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from my dad in Arlington, Tx. He had seen an episode of Diner's, Drive Ins, and Dives, and thought the food looked really good. Since my brother was in town, I thought going to eat here would be something to do in my dad's memory. I had also seen the Diner's, Drive Ins, and Dives show about this place and thought it looked worth a try. After reading some of the reviews I must say I believe they are buying into some of the hype created by the aforementioned show. We went around noon, so we expected it to be busy, but the line to order was like standing in line waiting to board an amusement ride, as you circle through metal line dividers. You grab your menus from a menu holder up by the window. You figure this out on your own by the way. So after about a 20 minute wait, we get to the window. The woman taking our order could have cared less. Her hair was long (past her shoulders) and not tied back, or clipped up which I think isn't a good idea working around all that food. She was obviously not having a good day and got the order wrong. I didn't realize the order was wrong until we were outside at the fountain drink place. Thankfully my daughter went back inside to clarify the order. There was another line at the fountain drinks/condiments area, but again, it was lunch time. They give you a beeper that signals when your food was ready. Our beeper went off, we gathered our food, and went to sit inside. There were plenty of people sitting outside, but being that it's June in Arizona, inside felt a lot better. This was especially true for my brother visiting from Seattle. He had almost melted in Texas due to the humidity, lol. My daughter had the grilled cheese, and sweet potato fries. She liked them both. My brother had the farm burger, and I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza. We ordered garlic fries, and onion rings on the side for all of us to sample. The pizza was ok. Granted I expected it to be phenomenal after watching the TV show, but it was just ok. The garlic fries, and onion rings were good. My brother said the farm burger was good as well. Now, the dark chocolate shake was heavenly! I ordered one of these as my dad loved chocolate shakes. He would have loved it. It is a cute place to eat as it's has such a retro feel to it, but the line was something my dad would not have enjoyed. After looking at some of the pics reviewing this restaurant, and reading the reviews, I think breakfast here looks really worth a try. The food is good but the experience was a little lacking. FOLLOW UP-ALL IS GOOD. Truly a business shouldn't  be judged by one less than stellar experience. I still haven't tried breakfast yet but plan to do so soon. Joe's Farm Grill is a breath of fresh air and originality in a world of chain franchises."}
{"text":"Like Joe needs another review... My two cents are: we ate here twice in three days. In the land of Yelping that says it all.  There are millions of restaurants to try on vacation and why go back to the same one? Because every single person in our party of four LOVED it.  This place can handle a crowd.  Don't let the line out the door scare you. It moves quickly and is also a sign of the goodness to be had here.  My recommendations: sweet potato fries OR the sweet potato pie. Do not get both on the same trip. (The fries taste sweeter than the pie if you do that.) Both are insanely good. The pie is veggielicious. You can tell they mashed those taters from Joe's garden today! The Fontina burger also is \"the best burger I ever had\" and he got it on both our trips there. :)  We liked sitting outside both times. We got to meet exotic birds on our Sunday lunch trip. A man had brought several different species.  Macaw \"Buddy\" gave me a kiss!  Memory- Priceless!"}
{"text":"Very delicious place. It can get really packed and they only had one cashier working so the line moved slowly. The food was delicious and has a good vibe to it"}
{"text":"Great place! Good food, the outdoor seating is so nice and kid friendly. I love their green eggs and ham and their breakfast tacos are yummy. Also love their pancakes.  We usually never find seating so we always bring a picnic mat because you will always find a shady spot on the grass picnic style! Only problem is there are a lot of dogs! We went there for mother's day and a party showed up with 10+ dogs and one of them came and stuck his mouth in my plate. They also barked up the place and it was a bit annoying considering we were sitting on the grass. Needless to say they were peeing everywhere just arms reach of our food. I think Joe's should have a limitation on how many pets you can bring. Don't get me wrong i looove dogs and cats but sometimes it's just too much. turns into a petting zoo. Great for kids and i have a 20 month old daughter but just for sanitary reasons there should a sign that ratio of humans to animals should be at least 2 to 1  Otherwise i love this place and the food."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Beautiful scenery, calming atmosphere, tons of outdoor seating. My bbq chicken salad was great and the sweet pt fries were delicious. It was very crowded on a Tuesday during lunch time, which I was not expecting. We got there at 12:30 and waited a half hour in line. By 1:30 the line had died down completely. I would recommend not coming during peak lunch time unless you're ok with the long wait. I loved sitting outside, especially with the orange trees blossoming. Smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"I love their black bean burger. So good. Sweet potato fries are a few extra bucks, but worth it."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! The service was fantastic, enjoyed our lunch so much that we are going back for dinner! Strongly recommend the new Gouda Garlic Bacon Burger Stack!"}
{"text":"MMMmmmmmm...what isn't to love about this place!!!! a MUST VISIT for any local or a local with out of town guests.  ANything you order will please you - promise.  (oh - and check out the bathrooms - very cool)"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is. It's regular fast food. My ribs came out cold inside (twice). Fires and onion rings weren't fresh. The rest of the items were meh. First and last time here."}
{"text":"Joes is a favorite of ours.  It's always good food with a homegrown menu and that farm raised feeling.  I've never had a bad meal here.  It's definitely not fine dining being out on picnic tables but it's also pretty reasonable in price.  We stop by regularly."}
{"text":"Been to Joe's several times and last time out it was like the rest fantastic.  It's typically busy so don't let that scare you off.  Food is great.  You can't go wrong from breakfast lunch or dinner choices.  Best outside seating in the valley with the picnic tables and the enormous trees.  Worth your time for sure and don't forget the apple fritters"}
{"text":"I've run the gamut on onion rings... from two days ago experiencing the worst at Pete's, to today experiencing the best at Joe's.  These people were on their A-game tonight. The pulled pork & baby backs had such a flavorful smokey essence, while the chicken strips were an amazing taste combination between chicken parm and BBQ sauce.  Did I mention they have the best onion rings ever?  A great example of a restaurant that doesn't skimp, rather display an eye for detail. It takes more prep time, but it's worth it, and it shows.  The shrimp basket was very good, and the homemade cocktail sauce was the crowning jewel.  What's better than a surry with a fringe on top?  Howz about a hot dog with an egg on top.  Delectable!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. The beet salad was uniquely wonderful taste. Sandwiches and cheese pairings wonderful. Large portions so you can share. Very busy, so be prepared for a long line.   There is a gluten free bun on the menu, however they were out of stock on the day we were there."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years but met a friend there for lunch & went to the coffee shop for the first time. I wanted breakfast & they serve till noon where as the other part serves breakfast till 11:00. It was so yummy! Had The Mediterranean scramble. It was delicious with a nice fresh salad on the side. The ice coffee was great. Going back more often even though I live in Chandler & it's not that close. But worth it!"}
{"text":"This time of year is perfect for joes farm grill  The place is perfect to eat outside  Perfect for family with small children  The food is so good , we had their garlic fries They are so good, salmon salad, and a delicious burger And the weather is perfect !"}
{"text":"Yummy! Check out the 4B burger, onion rings, and a milk shake if your waistline is up to it! The BBQ chicken pizza or Carolina Dog is nice change of pace if you've sampled the rest of their menu. Note the homemade pickles! They have panko-breaded chicken tenders, too at a really good price.  If you're tempted by the ribs, I'd recommend getting them at Joe's Real BBQ instead. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Went today. Not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake. The reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing TRAINING so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles, lettuce etc, all the garnishments. That alone took a good 5 mins. Meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold. Also the fries.  Then they called us up, I alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over it.  Burgers were cold, fries were cold. Had to send it all back. UNREAL!!!!  I have been to Joes at LEAST 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been HORRIBLE.  So disappointing. This place used to be great!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant several times.  It's a counter-order place, just so you know what it is before you get there.  Food has always been outstanding, unique, and TASTY! Love it!"}
{"text":"Main Points: -Great casual fare for breakfast, lunch, or dinner -Unique venue, fun to bring visitors  Review: I'm giving this place 5 stars, because in the category of casual food, this place is great! They have some tasty burgers and flatbread pizza that'll leave you full, garlic fries that are totally addicting, and delightful shakes.    My absolute favorite menu pick to get at Joe's is their waffles and ribs on their breakfast menu.  I'm not even a waffle person but their waffles are perfection, lightly crispy on the outside and salty sweet.  Add ribs on top, and it's pure deliciousness in your mouth!   Finally, the venue itself is a fun atmosphere with picnic tables amongst the shade trees, plenty of grassy area for kids to enjoy, and quirky bathrooms. Note that if it's too hot/cold outside, there is inside seating as well. Just be aware that when there's great weather, lines can get  long but they seem to move pretty fast and you can always call your order in for pick-up. If great tasting casual fare is what you're looking for, then Joe's Farm Grill won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is awesome! I tried the 3B (buttermilk, blue cheese, bacon) pancakes the other day. Very interesting! Love all the fries! The ahi tuna sandwich or the pesto chicken sandwich are to die for...Stop over at the coffee shop next door for a cupcake."}
{"text":"We love the food, both breakfast and lunch/ dinner menus never disappoint! But try the coconut soda - you're welcome."}
{"text":"OK,, there are a few items to \"grade\" here...  Location. 5* .. The locations and outdoor seating are is very nice for AZ desert. .. Definitely a plus. Cleanliness. 5* .. Very clean and kept clean even during busy traffic times. Staff. 5* Very nice and knowledgeable staff ready to help and answer questions .. Now down to the food. 4*.  BBQ Pork plate. Pork was pretty good, and above average for flavoring, not directly needing additional sauces to be added, served with a garlic \"bread\" more like a fat tortilla, (not a fan of the bread), side Cole slaw was , fresh, but ehhh as far as taste.. I would do the Pork again..  Sonoran Dog. Split bread grilled dog in some beans n cheese, etc,, now here's an 8 dollar dog.. or was it 9?.. but definitely very good and would prefer that over the bbq pork. Side Onion Rings,,ok, one of the best items i tried here, and possibly will be one of the most memorable onion rings I've had in a long time.   Will i be back? that depends if the patrons here are the same at all times.. There were 4 different families not watching their kids like it was a playground, one of which blowing on a survival type whistle,, wth.."}
{"text":"Be careful with substitutions.  Substitutions: Not a fan of how they up charge vegetarians. Most places don't charge extra for a vegetarian substitution. If you take a non-veggie burger here like the Fontina Burger and substitute for the veggie patty, you pay $2 more.  The fact that this happened on my birthday made it all the worse. There were a number of vegetarians in our group.   Food: The veggie burger was typical. Garlic fries were good and quite garlicky. Onion rings were good and had a subtle hint of dill flavor.   Not sure if we will be back given the extra charges for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Don't let the long lines or a couple of one star reviews deter you from trying Joe's Farm Grill in Gilbert.  I went there upon a friend's recommendation and I'm glad I went. I got there about noon and there was already a line out the door. Initially there was only one cashier taking orders but then another cashier line opened and the line went a lot faster.  We only waited about fifteen minutes which gave my friend and I enough time to peruse over the extensive varied menu. You can choose from burgers, salads, pizza, chicken and grilled cheese sandwiches and also milkshakes.  The cashier who took our order was very warm, friendly and welcoming. We ordered the farm chicken sandwich with bacon and grilled onions on multi grain toast with a side caesar salad and it was wonderful. My friend had the grilled vegetable pizza and she also loved it and ate the entire pizza even though she is a petite woman. We shared a chocolate milkshake.  There is plenty of seating indoors and outside. We also thought that the prices were very reasonable considering the high quality of the food. Our bill came to about $ 25.00 and we left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food and even better desserts. Prices are reasonable and food portions are the perfect size. They find the seats for you so no need to worry about the long lines."}
{"text":"Good for and friendly folks, reasonable prices and a great location in the little organic farm area.  Great farmers market across from them also."}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for her birthday brunch and we got 10 dollars off her meal. I got the breakfast tacos and coming from south Texas I was a little skeptical about how good they could be but I was quite impressed! It was reasonably priced, too. Pleasant atmosphere with a lot of covered outdoor seating. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.  Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.  This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.  I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, yeah...I am. I come here from time to time when I want something different and simple. I've been coming here more for the breakfast than the lunch/dinner with my hubby when we want to just have a nice moment to ourselves and eating outside to enjoy the time underneath the big old trees. I really enjoy their coffee, though sometimes it's a pain to wait for the only carafe available at one time. A suggestion would be to put out some kind of coffee bar like they do with the condiments bar and fountain drinks area (and have more than one carafe of reg/decaf out). MUST COME AS EARLY AS YOU CAN because the lines will be outrageous, especially on the weekends!  Their fresh fruit garnishments are fresh and delicious and I do like the taste of their syrup and Belgian waffles. I'm not a fan of the piece of flatbread they put on the side when you order the meat and potato scramble because it's really just that - flat, but not tasty. I think it's out of place with the rest of the meal. My hubby likes the waffles and fruit (as do I) and the Joe's Big Breakfast. He likes his breakfast with a variety on the plate. Oh! I forgot to mention that the other breakfast I enjoy is the Chicken and Mushroom Scramble - totally fresh and delicious! Since I mentioned the kiddos, they really enjoy the chicken tenders...not greasy, they're flavorful and super super fresh!  The prices are a little steep when it comes to the food and the size of the portions (except for Joe's Big Breakfast), but it's farm fresh and I'm okay to spend just a little bit more when it's just me and the hubby. If I wanted the gluttony and bring the kids along, we'll go to Black Bear Diner to satisfy the portions and prices which we enjoy very much. But I'll definitely still keep coming around here..."}
{"text":"This is one of my facorite places to eat in the ENTIRE valley. The location is inconvenient for me as I live in the Biltmore area but I can't resist. Everything is so fresh and clean and the atmosphere is warm and inviting and very family (and pet) friendly as there is ample outdoor seating. This is a feel good place with the nicest workers. Your food is done in a reasonable amount of time and it never dissapoints. They know what they are doing. They need to open another location... perhaps on the west side. It would do great. The lines are ALWAYS long but trust me.. it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is that the lines can be really long at times, but it's always been worth waiting for the food.    I'm loving all the food, morning, noon and night! Can't go wrong. The food is fresh and different. I definite place to add to your places to eat on a regular basis. It's great to take someone for the first time to let them experience AZ in a different way.    The food is so good, it is delivered in a casual atmosphere you have the choice of eating indoors in what used to be the living room of this farm or outdoors in a patio setting or under the trees on picnic tables. This place is good for young families.  Oh you have to visit the restroom, it's a bit entertaining!  LOL!  Check it out, and let the world find out what  you think!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've had a bunch of different menu items and each one is worth reordering. The garlic fries are great. In the winter time they have really pretty out door seating, there are nice areas to sit around, and a large tree for kids to climb. There isn't anything too faulty about this place but nothing that merits a 5 start rating. But it's one of those unique spots the are great for out of towners, and it never hurts to mention it was on TV."}
{"text":"We love Joe's Farm Grill!! I've had the Fontina Burger twice now and it is delicious! I love sitting outside under the big trees. There is a fun feeling about this place. The fries here are not my favorite, so I like to get a side Caesar salad instead at no charge!"}
{"text":"i finally made out to Joe's farm grill for the first time today.  we both have been eating healthy at home for the last couple of weeks and decided to treat ourselves today! we both ordered the farm burger and the sweet potatoes fries and we shared some onion rings...oh my, these bad boys are crazy unhealthy for you but so good.  this place did live up to the hype and the burgers were both tasty and fresh. give it a try if you are in the mood for gourmet fast food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool, but the food is mediocre. I ordered the veggie pizza and friend got the BBQ platter with garlic fries. The best thing was the garlic fries. The pizza wasn't good and the BBQ was average. Next time I think I'll try a burger with the garlic fries."}
{"text":"Diamond in the 'burbs! This place is a great experience.  They incorporate great architecture, great restaurant technology, great variety of indoor/outdoor seating areas and the food is WONDERFUL! If you haven't already gone here, GO! And try the coffee shop, too!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food, in a casual setting.  The only thing disappointing would be the flies.  They were everywhere while we were trying to eat dinner."}
{"text":"Great great great place for kids! They get to run around while you enjoy a relaxing and delicious meal. The food is fresh and tasty. The menu has a lot of options for everyone, and the food is just overall fantastic! The service is fast and friendly. And sometimes they hold family friendly activities there. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Love the atmosphere. It's a perfect place to go to get the family together and go for a quality breakfast or brunch! I really like the outdoor setting and location."}
{"text":"Last night I went with my motorcycle club out to Joe's for dinner.  It was really out on a farm.  This place is very far but the experience was worth the drive.    I ordered the Fontina Burger that had roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto, and fontina cheese.  The ingredients were fresh as they grow their own vegetables on the farm right there.  The fries that came with it were cooked well and very good as well.    There is room to eat inside at a community table or your own table and there is a huge area outside to eat on benches as well.  Overall it was a great experience and I will go back because there are several other things on the menu that looked very appetizing."}
{"text":"Very different building. Cool vibe. Food was good but pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places as a vegetarian! I order the veggie burger and sweet potatoes fries  and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious and simple! The wait can be a little long at times but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The great thing about Joe's is that even though they were busy - and they were busy - they were still helpful and the food was good and the service was great. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I've only been once and it was in the middle of a remodel, but i wasn't impressed.  Besides the ambiance, I wasn't impressed. I thought it was more of a sit down restaurant, not a place with food on a paper plate."}
{"text":"Great food! Love this place. Love sitting outside, when cool enough, and looking at the tree."}
{"text":"So so food.  Seriously,  nothing special. Hate the atmosphere.  Fly's everywhere.  No air conditioning inside. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious meals straight from the farm! They have sandwiches, salads, shakes and ribs! I tried the BBQ Pork Sandwich and a oversized portion of onion rings. I was super full but couldn't say no to the best onion rings on the planet!   My boyfriend order a full rack of ribs and finished the meal by licking his fingers clean. I liked the outdoor seating and view of the family farm. I know this restaurant has been approved by Guy Fieri of Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but just so you know it's Lauren Lizzle approved, as well."}
{"text":"I like this place. Bbq sandwich is good. They have homemade drinks, soda, lemonade and root beer, very delicious. I always get their cornbread it's very tasty, sides are made fresh.  The chocolate chip cookies are bomb but a little pricy. On your birthday you get free $10 to eat.  Can't say it's the best bbq I ever had but still very good."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point. The pepperoni pizza wasn't any better than frozen, microwaveable pizza I've bought at the market. All I could taste was the charred crust. Maybe it was our fault for not getting their house specialty BBQ chicken pizza, but if they char the crust on that as much as they did w/ this, then I'll pass on that as well. The description actually states that there's a slight char (since they grill the pizzas), but I would hardly describe our pizza as being slightly charred. All we could taste was the char.  The Fontina burger was good. The veggies were fresh (as they are grown basically in the backyard of the restaurant) and each bite was just tender and savory. I really enjoyed it.  The onion rings were crispy and flavorful, but I wouldn't get the chili cheese fries again. Nothing special there.  They have a ribs and waffles combo that I'd want to try if I were to ever return.  BTW, interesting bathroom. That's all I'll say about that."}
{"text":"Love me some Joes Farm Grill! Such a fun environment and a great local feel! The food is always so awesome! Wish it were a little less pricey, but I get it and will always go back!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this newly renovated place a 4 simply because in the few times that we've come back there has been one specific little prick that takes orders that cannot be bothered to greet customers appropriately; the line is freaking out the door and I literally wait while this guy turns away from us & starts a new convo with the girl next to him whom is trying her hardest to ignore him and actually do her job! I ask him \"are you done now?\" And he stares blankly at me &  says \"yeah\". As my boyfriend is giving his order he turns to the line cook guy and starts talking to him!!! He didn't put the correct order, but luckily the screen faces you as you order so we made sure he corrected his careless mistake! The food here is delicious, a bit pricey so I honestly hope they work on their order taker because everyone else is pretty on it. The managers are super friendly and walk around, checking in. Cool place especially when it isn't 347 degrees outside and you can let your child run around"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and welcoming ambience!  Such a treat!  Lives up to the Diners Drive Ins and Dives fame!"}
{"text":"I liked the idea, but i got the shrimp and it wasn't the greatest.  I think trying the hamburger may be a better idea next time."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place always has a line to order your food. It is so good! No matter the time of day, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Joe's Big Breakfast is the best - the pancakes especially are uber delicious. For lunch or dinner, I would highly recommend the Chicken Pesto Sandwich. Drool. Yum."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and the toddler. We all enjoyed the ahi, the sweet potato fries and something else unmemorable, but not bad. Everything was good and as we sat and ate we looked over the menu and thought about what we'd like to have next time. The toddler had a ball running around the grassy hills afterwards playing. We were hoping the produce stand would be open but we were there the wrong time of year. Isn't that always the case? We'll be back Joe.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the fresh local food! Everything from the staff to the food is wonderful! I make a point to eat here every time I'm back in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Been here several times in the past and always very good, but tonight was  disappointing.  Got there around 6:30p, waited in line for approximately 40 minutes to be told they ran out of veggie burgers at 7:10 p.  Being vegan, my wife and I have limited choices and  their veggie burger is one of very few choices we can have and it's excellent.  We found a few other items we could have and they were good but not what we really wanted. When I spoke to the manager and asked how they could  run out of veggie burgers around 7p, but have plenty of regular beef burgers,  his response was something to the affect that it was almost 7:30, getting late, and  they had a supply and ran out;   As a professional, his response was unprofessional.  When I asked if he could compensate us in some way, he stated there was not much he could do. We  told him we are vegan, we had limited options and he tried to offer us salmon or a milkshake!    Usually I would give the restaurant 4 stars but tonight Customer service was poor."}
{"text":"Above average food does not justify mediocre service. The women taking our order was clearly distracted to the point of being flippant when we ordered a pizza that is one of their staple menu items. She informed us that they were all out. When I pushed further wondering if they had  run out of pizza she said \"just out.\" She had no good explanation just a literal shoulder shrug. We ordered from the BBQ options and burger options. Never received our beet salad.  This was not a busy weekend night, it was Monday.  We tried to give them a chance to redeem their poor service when returning to order a milkshake and once again complete disappointment.  We'll try again sometime with hopes that we get the A team next time. WWGFD? (What Would Guy Fieri Do?)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and fresh. A great place to sit outside and enjoy Arizona's beautiful weather during the Fall and Spring."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service.  Really, have no complaints.  Their sweet potato fries and burgers are our favorite.  The portions are fairly big so we end up splitting most meals."}
{"text":"My favorite are the breakfast tacos! Everything I've tried here has been delicious. A little pricy but worth it especially every once in a while. They have a lot of grass space for kids to run around and some trees that even I want to climb... Not sure if they actually let you climb them."}
{"text":"Stick to breakfast or brunch for this place. Dinner ain't that great. Had veggie pizza....no flavor or zest to it...at least it was not greasy. Also sample the bbq pork...meh at best. I wish they should have used a better sauce. Though the fried zucchini and the ginger ale was good. Seriously sticking to breaky."}
{"text":"As an update, dark chocolate milk shake + french fries for the win!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delish but on the pricey side. Tried the BBQ platter , grilled salmon , sweet potato fries , garlic fries , chicken strips and beat salad"}
{"text":"I have visited Joe's Farm Grill several times and I always leave happy. The food is fresh and tasty. The wait can be long at peak times, but there is a nice grassy area with picnic tables to sit at while you wait (when the weather is nice). I ate breakfast at Joe's once, and it was great."}
{"text":"This place is frickin awesome!!! I could write a whole page on this, but I love the atmosphere and I love the food and the prices are pretty good, but the vibe and atmosphere is the best. The staff is second to none, unbelievable. This place must breed great employees at all of their restaurants. I look forward to going back many times."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places in the greater Phoenix area that is a must stop when I'm in town.  I found this restaurant from watching Diners Drive-ins and Dives which had never led me wrong.   I wish I could give a more in depth review but this is one of those places where I get the same thing every time I go. I always have gotten the cheeseburger with fries and a Coke. A family member of mine tried the onion rings and claimed that they were the best he has ever had.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  We came here after seeing a posting on FB giving the fried pork tenderloin an excellent review.  Being originally from IL, my husband and I are always looking for places to get this beloved sandwich.  I wish I had my phone with me when we were served this greasy, stomach upsetting mess.  The pic would have proven what we got was not even close to the sandwhich pictured on FB.   First of all, the fried coating was not the normal golden crunchy as all tenderloins are.  The coating was an odd darker brown with pools of grease settling in the dips.  It was literally sliding off the pork due to the amount of grease between the meat and the coating.   I really think this tenderloin had been cooked earlier then when we ordered it the chef threw it back into the fryer that was filled with inadequately temperatured oil.  All this for almost $18 (2 cokes and 1 sandwich) The manager was unavailable....will be sending an email!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Been coming once every couple months for years now. Favorites are the shrimp plate and the Sonoran dog.   But please, please go back to decent soda. That new stuff is cute and I'm sure very organic, but it's just not working. The diet cola (the only diet option) tastes awful. It and many of the other flavors foam up like a science fair volcano. Seriously, it's like 20% liquid, 80% foam, 100% lame. So much it would be funny if I hadn't paid $3 for a drink. I get the organic angle, but that stuff is too far."}
{"text":"Ambience = A++; It really is a beautiful setting and the perfect place to go when the weather turns nice.  We even drove around the neighborhood a bit to get the lay of the land.  I hadn't been in that area since it was all farmland in the 80s.    Food = B; We both had burgers.  There really wasn't anything special about them, which is not to say they weren't good... they were.  I'm more than willing to go there again and try something different - something more \"authentically Joe's\".  The fries were again, unimpressive.  The drinks were a little on the bland side; my first go was a Dr. Pepper which was flat.    Service was relatively quick for how many people were there.  My husband said the bathrooms were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent fried shrimp with crispy (cornmeal?) batter; cute decor and friendly employees."}
{"text":"I was here from out of town visiting friends and one of them recommended coming here.  I had been eating fast food for days it felt like so I did want something that was a bit \"healthier\".  I liked the concept and thought everything was pretty well made.  I had the Ahi tuna burger and it was perfect - good amount of tuna, done perfectly rare, etc.  I also got beets on the side.  It was quite a lot of food.    I thought the prices were reasonable enough - the only odd thing was it was kind of an in between restaurant -  it wasn't fast food since you had to wait for the food, but it wasn't a sit down restaurant either."}
{"text":"The food is good and ambience is nice. The problem is the restaurant has a fly issue. My wife and I were eating outside and we got swarmed with flies. I had to take my food to go. Flies also entered the restaurant and were in the kitchen. This definitely ruined my Friday night experience"}
{"text":"this place is like having picnic only you dont have to bring the food.   Its fresh all their produce and meat w/ the  exception of the tuna come locally or from their organic farm. ITs fresh, fast and relaxing there. i love eating outside. it has a huge tree that is awsome that you can sit under, but becareful, there is a sgn that says falling scorpians. but if it does fall down maybe they could fry it up for you! hehe."}
{"text":"I was here over the weekend while visiting family in Phoenix.  The food was great, very fresh, reasonably priced and it was a perfect atmosphere for families with kids or even a date.  I wish we had one in my part of the country, but for now, I'll just plan to make it a stop again when I'm in town next time.  I had a cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake and it was all that I could wish for!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by this place. I had heard so many good things and decided to try it out. I asked for my burger well done and got a medium rare burger and then got a sassy response when I took it back. When I finally did get my food it wasn't even that great! Did we just catch them on a bad day? Maybe. But it was enough to make me not want to go back."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this place!! We love the food (chicken fingers are a family fav) and the environment. We don't care for dill in our ranch but that's manageable! Very family friendly!!"}
{"text":"Go-to items include: seared ahi sandwich and crispy chicken basket. Chicken bAsket is not to be mistaken for the traditional tenders you get. These are actually large pieces of juicy breast with panko breading. Pretty awesome. The Caesar dressing is also extra anchovy-y which is the way it should be. Ask for it on the side to savor the flavor.   I'm not big on the BBQ even though its sister location specializes in it and is carried over to their menu. It's nothing special to me. I like Rudy's BBQ better.   Need to come when the date shake is in season. Sounds interesting to try.   Avoid coming on weekend nights, line too long."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, transport yourself back in time to this quaint farm grill which offers high quality food, fresh ingredients, killer burgers and an atmosphere that is one of a kind.  Good place for breakfast as well.  Family owned restaurant goodness.  Only drawback is the line, however good things come to those who wait."}
{"text":"Brought dogs to the grass after the dog park! Food is excellent. Excellent food, to reiterate!! Great location!"}
{"text":"This place was far from where my friend stayed (West Side), but it was worth a trek out.  The place is clean and the food is made fairly quickly even with the lunch crowd.  On a hot day, you can sit outside under the misters, but I'm from Cali, so this AZ heat it not for me, even under the misters.  Food: Fontina burger with blue cheese was fresh.  The burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The blue cheese definitely enhanced it.  I like the different options for your sides.  The garlic fried were a big too greasy.  The beet salad is a nice refreshing touch.  The strawberry cheesecake from scratch that is not on the menu was just OK.  The fried okra was overly fried.  The BBQ pork sandwich looked tasty and my friend enjoyed it.    Bottom line: I enjoyed the food and it's worth a try."}
{"text":"As a Gilbert resident I feel liked it's almost my duty to like this place, but's just plain overrated. 30 minute wait for cold fries, dry ribs, soggy pork. The coleslaw was actually pretty good. Gilbert has much better options, this is for tourists who don't know any better."}
{"text":"Love Joe's!  We took the kids for a late dinner, the weather was just right for burgers, fries and a shake.   The burger was fresh, the tuna was cooked just right, medium rare and the Garlic fries were worth the trip itself.   My only complaint for this trip was that I forgot to order the Garlic Fries and when I asked the girl at the window if I could add the fries to my order which was almost ready she said that I would have to go back through the long line. I mean come on, really.       Update:  I was contacted today by the manager who addressed the issue i had with the Garlic Fries.  To be honest it was not a show stopper, I just wanted to be fair and include the entire experience.  I was impressed with the Manager's effort and concern for good service.  I added an extra star based on this.  Thanks for reaching out Anthony!  Joe's is a very hip, relaxed, progressive (for Phoenix that is) and fun little dive and when the weather is right makes for a perfect ending to a busy work week."}
{"text":"The hot dog was small and rested in an oversized dry bread roll. The burger was generic at best. The onion rings were amazing. The shakes were generic at best and undrinkable while using a straw; they don't offer spoons so don't order a chunky shake or prepare to take it home to get a spoon. The food was overpriced and generic. The dining area was infested with mosquitos and I was bitten 5 separate times within a 45 minute meal.  In short, not worth my time and not worth the hype."}
{"text":"I came here almost a year ago but never wrote a review. This place serves hot, fresh food. They grow the food on the land behind the restaurant. It was so good that I went back multiple times to try different items on the menu. It's a bit of a drive from Tempe but I think it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. There's so much variety on the menu, you should be able to please anyone. I've never had anything I didn't love from here.   The staff is very friendly, and they are usually timely getting your order out. If you're here on the weekend or other peak times, you'll probably be waiting in line for a while to order. I've waited as long as 1hr08min on a Saturday or Sunday lunch.   There is indoor and outdoor seating; most of the outdoor seating is large picnic tables under beautiful trees looking out to the neighborhood farm where the restaurant gets most of its produce.   My favorites: Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Fontina Burger, Ahi Salad, Garlic Fries  The shakes are amazing, too."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, it's a hidden gem! We keep going back for breakfast but need to try it for lunch as well. You wait in line to order and receive a buzzer for when you're food is ready, then pick it up at the window. So it's efficient and you're not dealing with a waitress. I've only ordered their Breakfast Tacos with sausage, they're delicious with great flavor. They come with a side of beans that's unexpectedly great for breakfast. The seating is very casual and kid friendly, you can sit inside or outside. The place is always full because their food is so good - I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"i went on saturday for dinner; line times went like this: from the cashier to the door: 20 minutes. from the door to the T of the sidewalk, 25 minutes.   good atmosphere with nice people sitting about outside on the picnic tables. lots of kids playing chase and such, too.  burger with mushrooms/bacon: good (but pricey for a basic burger) onion rings: good!. fries: neh. you've got to season them yourself. peanut butter banana thing: excellent. date shake: decent? it's more like a milkshake with date shavings rather than a date shake.  the food is good for the price (albeit a little pricey). the wait sort of kills it unless you're the type to pine with anticipation to whet your appetite? that's fair...pretty much...given that there's only one ordering station and for a large-ish-looking facility, one grill station.   interesting note: you get a buzzer after you order for pick-up notification. works out by the back trees."}
{"text":"Good food good service and they do a lot for the community, if you enjoy eating here also try Joe's Barbeque. Same owner"}
{"text":"Saw the episode of Diners Drive Ins & Dives, and was very disappointed with the food both times we have gone there.  First time we went for breakfast but it was close enough to lunch that I ordered a burger.   The burger was way under cooked and the garlic fries had about 1/4\" of oil sitting in the bottom of the tray.  We decided to go again last night for dinner knowing that the food had to be better, but we left pretty unsatisfied with the quality of the food, and the care in preparation/presentation of the food.  I ordered the hot dog with the pulled pork on it and my wife ordered the garden burger.  The garden burger, according to my wife, lacked any true flavor on it's own.  Very thin and the whole sandwich just looked like some beginner cook put it together.  My hot dog was warm at best, the bbq pork was just thrown on there with some type of scooper and had cole slaw just dumped on top of that.  The bbq pork tasted like it was from the day before and the temp also matched that.  We paid $27.00 for both our meals and 2 sodas, for that price, I expect that they take more pride in the making of the food and at least make sure it is served hot.  Food Network should do a follow up show, but show up unannounced and see what they thing then.  Sorry, not going back to this establishment any time soon."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service the food was really good and I love you atmosphere. I would love to go back for brunch or breakfast that mean you look really good"}
{"text":"Super fun experience especially during fall/winter when you can comfortably dine outside in the picnic area. Gourmet grill food....hotdogs,  burgers and sands."}
{"text":"Have gone a great many times. Delicious food and great vegetarian options. Sometimes can get very crowded though and in the summer bugs are a problem. Beautiful area. Delicious."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Joe's.  There were 6 in our party and we all enjoyed our late lunch.  We had the B4 Burger, pulled pork sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, salmon platter, grilled cheese sandwich & grilled cheese pizza. The food was excellent, especially the B 4 burger- cheddar cheese, blue cheese, onion ring & the best burger I have had in a long time! All of the sides were delicious as well.  The strawberry lemonade was the bomb!  Find a picnic bench under a tree and enjoy! What a relaxing way to spend the later part of the day!!"}
{"text":"The BF and I went here this morning for breakfast (but ended up getting lunch). We went to the coffee place next door before we went to order breakfast...oops....breakfast was over when we got back. Boo! So we got lunch. The BF got the crazy banana sundae sandwich cuz it was the most breakfast -y item they had. I had the pesto chicken sandwich with a side caesar salad. My sandwich was pretty decent, although the chicken had a burnt ish flavor. The cheese and pesto were good. The salad was pretty good, although the dressing was concentrated in one area of the salad, but nonetheless it was tasty. The BF's sandwich was strange. The strawberry and banana were cold and the other stuff was hot.... kind of weird. It came with fries that were nothing special....threw most of them away. The best part was the pretty farm, trees, and general surrounding of the place. That was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went here twice once for dinner and once for breakfast. Not as good as I expected especially the prices were ridiculous for what you got.  The trees and scenery are just beautiful. They just need to work on food and prices"}
{"text":"Customer service here has been crappy lately. Food comes out incorrectly, employees have no clue what is going on and no manners. Today I called to place a to go order and they apparently just stopped doing those because they were too busy-- aka they can't keep up with their job. It's disappointing because the food is good."}
{"text":"Went in looking for the Date Shake. Unfortunately,  it's seasonal and wasn't available and their shakes aren't listed on the online menu.  However, my fiancé  and I grabbed a late lunch.  Fontina Burger with onion rings and the Farm salad. Fresh and tasty. The highlight of the meal was the onion rings! The best we have ever had! Light panko breading, not greasy, crunchy, amazing! Defintely a must try!"}
{"text":"My kitchen is getting tiled so I was unable to cook tonight. So sad, Not!  Went onYelp looking for a new place to go.to surprise my husband after his first day on a. new job.   We pulled up and immediately felt like this was going to be a great experience. People were eating at nice picnic tables outside and kids were playing in the grass. The smell was amazing as we got out of our car. Excitement building!  We walked in got a menu and watched all the yummy food being advertised on the screen. I kept changing my mind with each item featured.  Good thing line was short or I would never had decided. I settled on the pork plate with 2 orders of beet salad. The pork was tender and flavorful. The beet salad was great, with a mixture of golden and red beets and a hint of mint. Joe's Farm Grill is definitely getting added to our favorite places to eat list."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in a great location.  Bench sets outside for a nice warm day and inside if you want to stay cool.  This is my first time here and won't be my last.  Ordered pretty much what guy ordered on diners dives and drives I mean why not. Excellent ahi burger and wedge salad and the strawberry lemonade fresh and delicious.  A must try don't miss it if your in the area"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh, non-boring comfort food. Reasonable prices and helpings that will not leave you hungry. Maybe wishing for more but not hungry. Little bit of a wait at lunchtime but the line for ordering moves quickly. BBQ is terrific!"}
{"text":"A little confusing to find as it is located in a complex of buildings one of which is a coffee shop. I have had this place on my radar for a while. I had some time to kill early on a Sunday morning so I stopped in. Normally it is ridiculously crowded, but early on a Sunday it wasn't the case. Upon arrival you order at the counter like a fast food joint. They being out your order minuets later. I ordered the Huevos de Farm Grill. This is scrambled eggs, cheese, and pulled pork in a verde sauce. It came with a side of fried tortillas and farmer beans.  The main dish was ok. The color was less than appealing. It was green and with everything mixed together it looked gross. I put a little barbeque sauce on it. It changed the color a bit and added a nice smoky sweetness. The beans I could have done without. Not much flavor, but Tabasco helped out.  To be fair, the wait staff was great and I did order Huevos de Farm Grill for the first time. It was ok, just not something I was crazy about. Next time I will order from my comfort zone. The burger and onion rings look like a winner."}
{"text":"I normally come for the Coffee Shop's cupcakes, but today Joe's was the stop.   I ordered the Sonoran Dog and and Carolina dog. Both were excellent. The pulled pork on the Carolina dog was perfect texture and the BBQ sauce was very good.   The onion rings were soooo good. Dill seemed like an odd seasoning but tasted awesome. They stayed hot crunchy and you could tell they were cooked in fresh oil."}
{"text":"I cannot write enough positive comments for this place! We have been here countless times! The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is fun and unique! LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"So I come to Az several times a year. Being from Chicago, where we have the best restaurants in country, it's hard to find GOOD food. I would give their food 5 stars, but their service and cleanliness no stars!!! I was there last night with my wife and we ordered the food. It was cool outside so we sat inside, but we could not find a clean table. When I asked one of the girls if she could wipe down some of the tables, she reached under the count and pulled out a towel from a bucket of water and handed it to me! I was so stunned, I did wipe the table. The floor is littered with paper napkins and food! There was a half slice of piece of bread under our table. Now our order was done, except I ordered ribs, they where good and pork combo. They ran out of pork, so the same girl who handed me the rag, told me they are making more and She will bring it out to me. She never did. Regardless of how good the food is here, in Chicago, the city would shut this place down for uncleaniness. hope the owner reviews this and addresses these problems, as the food was very good and has the possibility of being an excellent place it managed properly."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm just now getting around to reviewing Joe's.  Lately I eat here more than I eat at home!  This is the quintessential non-chain eating experience.  Joe's grub isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for, and Brak would FAR rather pay more for good grub than suffer with a \"bargain\" meal.  Joe's delivers great value despite the high prices, because the food is that good.  I've had lots of things on the menu and loved all of it.  For some reason, I'd avoided the BBQ chicken pizza for a long time, probably because I've had others that weren't so hot.  Then I caught the clip on DD&D on Food Network (search for \"Joe's Farm Grill\" on youtube to see it), which featured the pie, and realized that if Joe was serving it to Guy Fieri, then it MUST be awesome.  Well, I'm here to tell you, it is freaking awesome!  Currently my favorite meal on the entire planet.  I'm getting a hankerin' for one right now, just writing about it.. despite the fact that I had one yesterday!  If you're anywhere in the area and haven't been to Joe's, do yourself a favor and get your ass over here, you will NOT be disappointed.  A solid 5+ stars on the Brak-o-meter."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to please the taste palette. Even though the drive may be far, my wife and I try to come here at least once a month.  She gets the Ahi tuna sandwich. The crunchiness of the coleslaw salad adds a refreshing taste to the already fresh tuna, which is grilled to perfection.  I get the bbq chicken pizza. Their homemade bbq sauce compliments the grilled flat bread and farm fresh chicken.  Everything is good here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Joes Farm Grill! The food is amazing, and the patio is so relaxing on a cool day. My favorite dish is the BBQ pulled pork sandwich (I actually prefer this one over Joes Real BBQ) :)"}
{"text":"Green eggs and ham breakfast and the blue cheese burgers are terrific meals. His review is a few years old but I noticed that I never completed the post. It's still memorable. I'd like to travel to AZ and visit this place while I'm there. The customer service is excellent and I love the owners mentality towards his guests. I think each of his locations offer a free meal on a customers birthday. I've traveled to several states and I enjoy eating at local restaurants and Joe's is the only place I've seen that offers this service."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup.  I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!"}
{"text":"Decided to return here as I wanted something different for lunch. I was looking for a Sonoran dog. JFG has that covered. I paired that with some garlic fries. It was busy but only a 5 minute line. Somehow I managed to stay under $10 which was a pleasant surprise considering my last experience. The fries were good but I think GB is better for that. The dog was very good and filling, glad I didn't get a double. JFG will stay on my list just not top 10."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today!  Outstanding food & service! This will be my go to especially on Wednesday's because I work in that area"}
{"text":"Another instance of hearing people talk about a place for years before I got there. I live in CenPho, and making the trek to Gilbert happens every few years for me. Until now. My boyfriend lives out there, so I am starting to check places out now. I love the Farm. The restaurant itself reminds me of the architecture of a drive-in snack bar. It's wide open with a lot of glass. There is a long, family-style table in the main room. There is another room off that, and a ton of picnic tables outside. I had a burger with garlic fries. I still think of those fries! My burger was cooked perfectly, as I like my meat rare. My favorite parts, though, were the root beer floats, and the bathrooms. You make your own root beer floats. They give you the cup with the soft-serve ice cream in it, and you go over to the pop machine and add as much as you want. So cool! I really want to take the tour they offer here. I grew up in the country, and after living in the city for 11 years, it's quaint for me and reminds me of home. (Upstate NY)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, period. Awesome atmosphere, great place to hang out outside. Fresh food from the farm. It's  no little pricey, but it's worth it if you can spend a little more on lunch, very reasonable compared to a lot of places that have really good food. It won't let you down. Go here and try it for yourself"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and portobello caps!"}
{"text":"food was good-however, I wanted coffee.  was told by counter person that I had to go to the coffee shop adjacent to the restaurant and it started to rain.  So I took a soft drink to go w/ the meal.  then I see:  cream, sweeteners, sugar and stir sticks!  There was a very small pot of guess what???!!! Coffee!   Dear counterperson, when someone asks you directly for coffee and you have it, why did you tell them they'd have to go to the adjoining coffee spot on the property in the rain? Plus, for my veggie burger/side/drink and my husband's burger/side/shake-our bill came to $30!  It was good and great quality-but it was a bit steep."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Arizona, the fontina burger and some garlic fries...top it off with a date shake...amazing. The picnic like atmosphere makes it lots of fun. Definitely a place to visit if you ever find yourself in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This farm to table at its best!!!! I tried the Fontaine burger the combination of flavors were right on point!!!! My husband had the bbq he was really happy.  I gotta be honest what I loved more than the food was the homage soda!!! I had the cucumber soda amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I just don't like the food.  I live walking distance to this place and really, really want to like it but just can't.  Atmosphere is nice, but I think the Coffee Shop next door has better food.    I usually get the pesto chicken sandwich which is very good, but for $10 (french fries are extra), I'd rather eat off a plate and not out of a plastic basket.  I've also had the BBQ chicken pizza - burnt and had to saw through it.  My kids don't like the food either.  The kids pizza is always burnt and the grilled cheese is made on Texas toast - okay for some kids, but mine didn't like it."}
{"text":"We finally made it to this place, and it was fresh and delicious! I had the chicken sandwish, and my husband had the Asian thai salad. We also got a side of the beet salad because our friends said it was a must try there. We were very happy with the speedy service, the fresh food, and the laid back atmosphere! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Joe's FG!  I think that it is probably a little more of an emotion pull than anything else.  My hubby and I almost bought a house in Agritopia, the neighboring subdivision.  I had dreams of riding a cute turquoise Vespa with my little dog in the basket to Joe's, the coffee shop, and Cosmo dog park.  It is SO Pleasantville slash Edward Scissorhand's neighborhood and I love it!    We have been there many times and always bring out of town and new to town visitors here.   It's always a great story and people love that a lot of  the food comes from the farm.  Where else can you go that there's a TV in the bathroom showing some strange vintage video cartoon?  My favorite thing on the entire menu is the garlic fries!  They are a must but make sure that EVERYONE in your party at least tries them if they are going to be in close quarters to you for the next several hours.  This is especially true if you are going to be driving together!!  Everything else on the menu is great!  Love all the burgers, the pizzas are good, my hubby loves the beet salad, the portabella mushroom sandwich is flavorful and satisfying and if you have a sweet tooth, make sure to try the french toast, peanut butter, banana, chocolate chip, pineapple, strawberry sandwich!!! After that, don't forget your shot of insulin!  The ice cream is okay...I'm more of a hand scoop ice cream fan. I haven't had the shake but whenever I go, it seems like everyone else is having one.  I prefer to walk next door to the picture perfect coffee shop to get a special bakery treat.  Take your friends, take your kids.  Don't go for peace and quiet.  This is not a romantic can't see your meal it's so dark restaurant.  You go for the atmosphere, you go for the food!"}
{"text":"Fun place with great food.   Prepare to stand in line when preparing to order as they are packed!    Be sure to use the restrooms the decor is outstanding."}
{"text":"Pros: cool location / atmosphere (especially when the weather is nice), my thai tuna salad was \"hardy\" / full of crisp fresh veggies and the sweet potato fries and dip were delish; the date shake is my all time fave shake (when it is in season)  Cons: my salad was lacking flavor (dressing wasn't doing it too much justice); kind of pricey for burgers / fries (my salad was a steal for $13.99 though)  There are a few popular things in Gilbert that have mass followings and this place (and its sister restaurant Joe's Real BBQ) is one of them. If crowds bug you, DO NOT go at a typically busy time (Thurs - Sunday).   We went on a Tuesday night and it was not busy at all and we experienced wonderful customer service (multiple managers asked us how we were doing, another employee overheard my sister say you have to go to the window to get ranch dressing and he was quick to offer to get it for her).   I think I am in love with the idea of this place more than the place itself. I like that you can sit outside at picnic tables under huge old trees overlooking the massive Agritopia garden. There's always kids running around playing.The coffee shop next store is super cute too with a large assortment of cupcakes each day. But the food (outside of the date shake) is just sort of \"meh\" for the price."}
{"text":"I disagree with Alexander C. I can't say enough good things about the Fontina Burger. Oh my goodness. The flavors go on and on! And I can never finish it, the thing is so darned big. The foliage on the burgers come from their Organic (according to the owners,but not certified) garden right on the premises.  And the fries that come with are super yummy. Definitely worth the $8.99 price tag. And for the sustainably-concious consumers, the menu states that the beef is local.  I've been to Joe's Farm Grill at least a dozen times and being a sad creature of habit have only ordered the one meal because I had hoped for more Organic choices.  The customer service and atmosphere is great! No limit to the outdoor and a good amount of indoor seating too.  I definitely recommend them. They are at Ray & Higley just off the 202. It's still a bit of a commute for the Queen Creeker and beyond, but the closest healthier fare that we've got.  Side Note: Be sure and visit the bathrooms at Joe's Farm Grill whether you have to \"go\" or not. Hint: Prepare to be transported to the future (or past)"}
{"text":"They did not have great tasting food it was ok but i wouldn't spend $10 on a single cheeseburger. The place smells like dead fish and there is a giant tree full of scorpions, it wouldn't kill them just to call Terminex to get rid of them. I overall hate this restaurant i would never go there ever again."}
{"text":"Cant complain. Very good food at the typical price you would expect to pay for a place with some weird food combo's.   Never a bad idea to go to joes farm grill."}
{"text":"Every year for mothers day I go with my family to Joe's. This place is the only eatery I can think of that is worth a 20-30 minute wait. Most of the produce is grown on the farm and the food is amazing. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Gilbert,AZ...Great food and amazing environment!!! Everyone needs to come to Joe's"}
{"text":"Preface: I don't watch Food Notwork.  I'm a reformed Zonie, now living the the Bay Area (obnoxious, I know..) and a fan of good food.  During my last trip to the land of AZ, I found this place on Yelp and asked some of my friends if they were aware of the place.. Almost everyone I asked highly recommended some dish there, so I had to try it.  Highly recommended was the waffle and ribs breakfast, which I didn't try.  We stopped in for lunch and I had the grilled wedge salad and sweet potato fries.  The salad was a good reprieve from my previous week of gluttony from visiting my old favorite places (Yoh, *bertos!).  The topping to plant matter was good, but I was a little bummed that the \"wedge\" was a halved head of lettuce instead of a wedge and the grill marks were fairly light, almost non-existent.  Despite that, it had all the smokey and bright flavors that I was hoping for.  The sweet potato fries were tasty and plentiful, served with a sweetish/savory but too-chunky-to-get-on-the-fry pineapple-serrano dipping sauce.  Somewhere else in the mix was this HEAVENLY date shake.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  I really liked the building and the surrounding areas.  It's surrounded by a community garden (awesome) which you can see from the outside seating area or walk through.  I remember when there was mostly only agricultural plots around there, and it's keen to see this place keeping true to the roots of the area.  Overall, AZ definitely appears to be upping it's game with new eateries and this is one of the new bloods breathing life into the culinary scene.  I look forward to trying more of their foods."}
{"text":"Another yummy dinner at The Grill! This time I didn't even have to wonder what to eat- I knew I wanted a burger. A burger I did have! Also split some onion rings with the daughter, which have a unique seasoning to them. YOU CAN'T STOP EATING THEM. The seasoning is a drug, I'm sure of it. Daughter is in love with the vanilla bean shake with malt, and her friend had the Pumpkin spice shake which she said was very tasty. It's a little overpriced (does it really have to cost $40 for three people to eat dinner at a grill? No, it doesn't.), but that makes it even more of a treat to go and get some food, since we don't go very often. :-) Today was also their 4th anniversary- so happy Anniversary to them! So glad they are in the area!"}
{"text":"Good food but not \"awesome\" as someone told us. I do have to say that it was fresh and the people were really nice.  Had the BBQ pork sandwich - missing some flavor in my opinion.  I would go back though."}
{"text":"I've been before and it's really never been great. This time, I got the Farm Burger and was, again, not impressed. The flavors weren't a good blend and the bun was extremely soggy within a minute or two. I even had them add bacon but it just wasn't as good as a burger bought elsewhere. The fries were average."}
{"text":"When the weather is nice, Joe's Farm Grill is a great place to enjoy a casual picnic dinner under the shade of some enormous salt cedar trees.  At Joe's you place your order inside a vintage 1960s farmstead building.  Don't let the line deter you - it will give you time to study the menu and read about the history of the farm.  After you've ordered, they'll give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready.    I went with a group, which gave me an opportunity to sample several of the house specialties.  My favorite was the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich with strawberries, pineapple and chocolate chips.  It sounded bizarre enough that none of us wanted to take a chance on ordering it, so we agreed to get one to split.  It was so amazing - with crispy toast and bursting with fruit and nut flavors - that I instantly regretted not ordering a whole one for myself.  If you try one, I recommend substituting some crispy sweet potato fries for the regular ones that come with it.  These fries are served with a delicious pineapple and jalapeno relish.  For my main dish I got the fontina burger.  The pecan pesto nicely complemented the fontina cheese and grilled mushrooms, and the burger came with a generous stack of garnishes like lettuce and tomato.  With this one I'd substitute in the garlic fries - I could sit down and eat a whole dish of these scrumptiously seasoned beauties for dinner.   The only thing Joe's could use is a craft beer list, but you'll need to settle for soft drinks because no alcohol is served here."}
{"text":"You go for the great ambiance as much as you go for the delicious food.  It takes you back to a simpler time.  I would recommend anything on the menu, except the hot dogs.  Those are nasty."}
{"text":"This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!).  The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes.  It's a really cool space!    You order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields.  The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network.  Food-wise, everything here is good.  Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes...the list goes on.  Side Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!)."}
{"text":"I am so excited to live near this amazing restaurant.  It was my first time here, so take my 5 stars with a grain of salt, but the food was great for the price and I really like the modern storefront against the farm-scape behind it.  I had the Fontina burger with the onion rings because both were (according to the menu) featured on triple D.  Both were excellent. The layering of flavors on the burger was excellent and the onion rings had just the right amount of breeding for me.  I like a thin layer of breeding that's crunchy with a tender onion inside and I was not disappointed.  My wife had the chicken sandwich and fries and said it was really good, but honestly I was too busy favoring my burger to notice.  We got out of there for around $30 for two meals and drinks and I think that's pretty reasonable.  Overall, it was great and I will be adding this to my 'regular visit' list."}
{"text":"Fast food quality, with high end restaurant wait times.  My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where \"maybe\" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.  Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.  I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those? No, so I will never return here and I will chalk up all of the recommendations for this place to, suburb folks that have never experienced real dining."}
{"text":"I've only came to Joe's twice so far and both times, I've had an amazing experience.  I first came here with my friend and I had ordered BBQ Bacon Blue Burger with sweet potato fries.  I must say, I love me some good sweet potato fries and this place did not disappoint.  I could've done without the fruity dipping sauce though.  Anyways, after eating here the first time, it left me craving another try almost right away.  The second time I came here, I brought my friends who were visiting from Colorado here.  Everyone tucked into the food and it was delicious.  I had the ribs and they were definitely finger-lickin' good.  Yum!  I can see why Guy Fieri gave this place such a great review on Diners, Drive-in and Dives."}
{"text":"Gouda garlic bacon burger is awesome! The contains burger is even better.  They're under construction with expansion,  but there are plenty of tables outside bit the shade."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite hidden gems.  Joe's has an excellent breakfast menu and everything they serve is fresh.  This is an awesome place to people watch.  It is great for families.  There is plenty of room for everyone, it's mostly outside and spread out.  They do have inside seating but why in the world would you do that in the beautiful part of morning, summer or winter.  There is plenty of shade everywhere.  This place is worth going out of your way to visit!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is a jewel on the southeast side of the Valley. From the retro 60's farm decor to the reuse of the old farm buildings to the top-notch food, Joe's is worth a trip from any part of town.  My wife and I had been to Liberty Market, one of Joe Johnston's other restaurants and we wanted to try Joe's Farm Grill. After a trip to Schnepf Farms, we decided it was a good opportunity to try Joe's for lunch.  I had a Fontina burger with fries and I was highly impressed. The burger itself was juicy and flavorful, without being greasy. The meat itself is lightly season with a mixture of herbs and spices, probably including salt, pepper and thyme, but I don't know for sure. Regardless, it made for a great patty. The mushrooms, red pepper, and arugula on the burger were fresh and yummy. I would have gone a little lighter on the pesto spread, but it was good, so I won't nitpick too much.  The fries were done just right, cut to a good size with the skin on and fried to perfection...crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My wife had garlic fries with her meal and claimed they were the best garlic fries she's ever had. I tried some and I'm inclined to agree. The garlic seasoning mixture was done very well and wasn't loaded too heavily on the fries, nor was it too skimpy.  I look forward to returning to Joe's for many meals in the future, especially for a breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see the low ratings for this place. I think it's fantastic!!  There's still not a whole lot going on in this area. It's still cow-town, farming central for Gilbert, although a lot has popped up recently. When this restaurant rolled into town, I was thrilled.   First, they try to get all their produce from their local farm 1st. If they can't supply everything for their restaurant from their farm, they buy from local farmers 2nd, and then (and only then) will they go out-of-state for their produce. Also, their meat is naturally raised from AZ. Local produce + local meat = are you kidding me?!?! They deserve 5 stars for that alone! They also have recycling bins for your cups and plates. If more restaurants would follow suit in these aspects, do you know how much waste can be saved, or how much this BOOSTS our local economy, or how much healthier we would be as a society? Supporting business that buy locally is not only FAR nutritionally superior because the transit time decreases, but people generally don't get a side of pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and antibiotics with their meal when you buy locally. So, A+++ for the fact that Joe's Farm Grill has gotten on board with this and really taken it above and beyond what most establishments in this price range are willing to do, or even want to do.   I didn't know they had naturally raised meat until I caught it on the Food Network, and that made me even happier. I've always been amazed at their charbroiled hamburgers- they've been some of the best I've had. The fries are groovy too. I've had a salad as well as the grilled cheese. The salad was large and delicious but there was something lurking in it that was making it taste \"strange.\" I think it was just my own personal preference though. The grilled cheese had Fontina in it, and as I found out the hard way, Fontina is gross. I should have known...I don't like weird cheeses on traditional American white trash food. They taste like dirty socks in my mouth. If I knew what Fontina tasted like I wouldn't have gotten it, that's my bad.  It's more expensive than your average fancier burger joint, but nothing too outrageous.   It's fun to sit outside on a cool day under the gigantic trees, and look out to the farm and houses think to yourself that one day, not too long ago, all of it was farm land as far as the eye could see."}
{"text":"This has become a place that I want to try to visit when I'm visiting my sister in Arizona.  It's located in an area in Gilbert called Agritopia and they try to use as much of the locally grown ingredients as they can in their food.  This place can get really busy and the line can get long during peak meal hours.  The setup is you order at the counter and then find a table to sit at.    Popular things on the menu are the BBQ pulled pork, ribs, and burgers.  I recently had the chicken pesto sandwhich, and it was delicious.  I also love the onion rings and sweet potato fries.  They also have milkshakes that are good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located down the street from my house and I finally had the opportunity to stop by (don't know why I waited so long). I cannot begin to tell you how AH-mazing it was! I would highly recommend the Salmon and fried zucchini."}
{"text":"I had the \"waffle and meat\" and I got some killer waffle and meat.  First for the food.   Usually belgian waffles are so heavy that you take four bites and you're done. Even for an eater like me, they are tough to put away. My waffle here was light and I ate the entire thing. Bonus: didn't feel like a tub o'lard after, either. Was just-right kind of full. The meat I picked was ham and I love that I got a big, thick slice of it. Lots of flavor, not lots of grease. Sweet and salty magic, is basically what my plate was.  My dad had the pancakes with fruit. Same thing: light and fluffy. He put his away, and he and I are about the same size. Yeah, shut up.  The cool part, other than our great breakfasts, was the setting. Living in a gigantor city, it was really nice to be able to go a place and feel like you're somewhere else. Being on a farm isn't something you get to do every day, here, and it was kind of a fun adventure.   I'll be back for breakfast, fo sho."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to see the newly remodeled Joe's Farm Grill and it is just beautiful :) We arrived at 12:30 and ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fries always my daughters favorite.Gave the  deep fried green beans a try for the first time and they were delicious and had a soda from their new soda mixer that has amazing new flavors . Topped it off with a strawberry shake for my husband and we all had a very nice treat. The staff served us at our table which was so nice our waiter was so sweet we really appreciated his attentiveness . They now have booths and lots of seating and the wall decor is so pretty. It is  always so nice to stop into this place . Thank you Joe's Farm Grill you never disappoint us!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town and maybe in the whole Phoenix metro. All natural ingreduients from local Agrotopia!"}
{"text":"Quick customer service story: I called in a pick-up order, and was put on hold and forgotten. I called again and the same thing happened. Needless to say I was frustrated, but when I sent an email about the situation, they owned up, apologized, and covered my meal for me.  That says a lot to me. I appreciate their strong customer service."}
{"text":"i had never been before but was very impressed.  got the ahi salad and it was substantial- not just in size, but in variety of vegetables.  the place's draw is the locally grown vegetables.  everything was awesome and tasty.  the big complaint- flies.  we were inside and flies were driving me crazy.  that's the only reason i didn't rate this a 5.  food is awesome"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my absolute favorite places to come eat. I love the outdoor area and the location of the restaurant. Unfortunately after the renovation it's gone down hill. My boyfriend and I came here to eat today and had one of the worst experiences ever. Our food was cold and the soda selection now is awful. They no longer have Pepsi/coke products but a different brand with sodas such as \"coke with cinnamon licorice flavor\" or something to that extent. It was disgusting. We then ended up buying two bottles cokes which we had to open with our knives because they didn't offer to open them. Multiple people were going to the counter asking for a bottle opener as well. My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich with extra fries and it came out with no bun but a pita on top???? And less fries than my ONE order of fries. For $34 for 2 people to eat I would think everything would be amazing but it was average at best. We're not picky people at all and I'm so sad to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill in the Agritopia community was the perfect setting for our first-ever meal in Gilbert. We enjoyed dining al fresco while basking in the sunny weather and just the perfect dose of cool air. The restaurant has an expansive back patio where four-legged companions are welcome to salivate while their humans enjoy their food. You have to go up to the counter to order and they bring your food to your table. My partner-in-dine opted for the BBQ Chicken Pizza and I the Fontina Burger. We both devoured our food with gusto. The restaurant prides itself in utilizing most of the produce from the Agritopia gardens. I loved the roasted red peppers and grilled mushrooms in my burger. The burger also came with a side of garlic fries. I had to pay extra for the garlic fries and they were awesomely good. I also got a seasonal medjool date milkshake which came in a tall metal cup.   The farm-fresh food, yummylicious milkshake and open-air setting all made our lunch an experience to remember!"}
{"text":"The setting is pretty neat right on the farm. The Fontina Burger is exceptional. The garlic fries were decent but I'm not a fan of skinny fries in general, they would be much better if they were thicker.   The only real problem with this place is they need more registers to ring up customers. The food is prepared very fast once you make your order, but getting there at 11 it took about 20 minutes to get to the register to order. By the time we left at 12:30 or so the line was huge.   But I highly recommend trying them if you are in the area, I wish they were closer to me."}
{"text":"I love this place cool atmosphere, great food, and variety. There aren't many places that I have seen in AZ like this place. I have been here four times and have had a pleasant experience every time. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"While the food is good, the patrons certainly took away from our experience, quite the rude and pretentious set. Definitely not the restaurant's fault but just be aware, for a family friendly place not alot of people willing to hold a door open for a woman struggling with a stroller!   I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries, delicious! My husband went with the chicken pesto sandwich, he loved that as well! The tables were cleaned quickly which is critical for such a busy place (even at 8:00pm!)  Good experience overall, perhaps next time we will try take-out and surround ourselves with a nicer bunch!"}
{"text":"Went back today after receiving a gift card from the owner from my previous bad experience. The food was so much better than last time I was here! Had the Greek sausage dog and the flavour was great! Also ordered the sweet potato fries and they were excellent as well. My girlfriend ordered the farm salad and she was pleased with the size of it and the amount of different ingredients in it. The ranch sauce they served is some of the rl best I ever had and wonder if it's homemade. The only complaint about this visit was that there was some trash/used utensils on the ground, but it really didn't take away from the experience. Will be going again!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great outside seating for families with kids. We got the veggie burger and it was really good. Definitely would get a again. They forgot to make one our items we ordered and the guy took it off our bill without us even asking to do so. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I already loved Joe's but recently I accidentally ordered what I thought was a portobello mushroom sandwich, but it was actually a burger. (I'm a vegetarian) They switched out the meal for a veggie pizza with no fuss. Thanks Joe's!"}
{"text":"Hubby found this place on Yelp, kudos to him! The food is as wonderful as the setting. We really enjoyed sitting outside under the trees on the picnic tables - it reminded me of some wineries I have been to.  The first visit I had the BBQ chicken pizza, hubby had the amazing fontina burger. That burger was spectacular. It has 6 oz., roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, field greens, farm-made pecan pesto and fontina cheese. I think its the pesto that makes it so special, but hubby thinks its all of the ingredients together that makes it.  My second visit I got the fontina burger, without the red peppers, with bacon and once again; it was outrageously delicious. I also got the fried green beans which I loved!  One thing, I wish they served beer and wine. Other than that this place will not disappoint, so fresh, so delicious! I will be back for MORE!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Food is always good, never bad. Love the ribs and hamburgers. Zucchini is special too."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here!! Wow.  Came here on Friday night with family and was really diggin the upscale dinner vibe with the out door park kind of feel.  They have outdoor picnic table seating and have newly renovated to create more inside seating. Having been on Diners, Drive-in's and Dives, this is a hoppin place.   We arrived around 630pm and the line was out the door.  We were told to order the onion rings-which i did with my Sonoran Dog-hot dog wrapped in bacon topped with beans, sour cream, cheese and jalapeno slices. Delish! Definitely not a disappointing hot dog and the onion rings were big and crispy. My bf ordered the Gouda Garlic Bacon Burger Stack and wow, it was huge! The flavor was amazing, it is one of the most popular dishes here.  They have their own organic soda (I liked to cola because it had a lot of cinnamon flavor), a couple different lemonade flavors and milkshakes.  Really enjoyed this meal.  When in town, I will be coming back trying a burger or something from the smoker next time. Make sure to give yourself time to wait in the long line.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"The best burger spot in Phoenix area. I need to come here at least once when in town."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, after hearing such positive reviews. The line to get in was ridiculously long and we waited about 30 minutes before we got to order, but the food came up really quickly after that. Downside: it's pretty pricey and the burger that I got (Southwest) was actually a little bland. But everyone else in my party got BBQ and said it was awesome. I tried their garlic fries too and they were really good - very garlicky but what else would you expect? All in all, I'd come here again but order something different. And be prepared to stand in that long line!"}
{"text":"Joe's is one of our favorite places to go. It was a bonus when picking our house right down the road. We love the fresh ingredients & menu options, and the kids always have a great time running around outside.  I love that they give you $10 off on your birthday so it's one of our regular birthday stops. I definitely recommend the fontina burger and for kids the chicken strips."}
{"text":"I have a weird love-hate relationship with this place. I love the food, but I hate the atmosphere and theme that screams \"Down-home farm fresh food that your middle-upper class family will adore\" or in other words, \"Our food is down to earth but our prices are not\"... or \"A slice of rural America, but pumped into a desert for the wealthy to enjoy.\" I think you get my point.   Regardless the food is still incredible. The burgers are delicious, everything tastes fresh, and the portions are massive. Some of the best onion rings I have ever had.  Back to the infuriating atmosphere. They were on that Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and show and will not hesitate to tell you at every opportunity. I challenge you to find a 10 sq. ft area anywhere in the restaurant that doesn't mention it somewhere. I don't understand since it isn't any of those things. It's an upscale hipster eatery with a splash of retro design. It's new, expensive, and insanely busy. It's basically like a food truck lost its wheels in the middle of a patch of non-native flora.   Still I know it seems like a lot of complaining for a 4- star review, but the food is REALLY good. It's worth standing in a 20 minute line with people you would make fun of at a little-league game."}
{"text":"Friday night so very busy. Line was out the door. They are so busy in the kitchen there is no time or enough staff to keep up with cleaning/wiping tables. Loud place due to being so busy. Food was ok-some different items though, such as the ahi tuna steak sandwich. Not impressed with customers having their dogs at their table right outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"So delicious! I always enjoy their seasonal salad with green goddess dressing. The only down side is that there's no option to pre-order for a quick pick-up. The line is typically long.... But worth the wait!"}
{"text":"SO good. Had the curried chicken salad with Asian slaw and beet salad (see picture). All were great and very fresh tasting.   But the best thing about Joe's is the date shake! I know it sounds like a bathroom crime scene waiting to happen, but it's more than worth any possible collateral damage. Definitely get it if its in season."}
{"text":"We just recently moved into the neighborhood so we figured we'd try Joes with all the great things we've heard! To our surprise it was horrible! Our daughter has special needs and will only eat certain things so I asked if they could do a peanut butter sandwich and I was told they could not. I asked if I could have a piece of bread and a side of peanut butter and they said all they have was toast so I said that was fine. When I went to the window to pick up our food the toast was no where in sight and it took an extra 10 minutes just for ONE piece of toast! When I asked for the side of peanut butter it took 5 people to go back and ask the manager because they said that they didn't think they could give me a tablespoon of peanut butter for the toast I ordered!!! That took and extra ten minutes! On top of that my other daughter ordered a milk shake to split and the lady only made half the milk shake! It was just a horrible experience, won't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Everything we have had has been great!  We stop in several times on our trips to Arizona.  Unique dining experience.  Joes farm grill was featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives."}
{"text":"We originally were heading over here from breakfast but missed the cut off which begins at 11, and opted to have lunch here. There certainly are a variety of items on their lunch menu but their breakfast looked the most enticing of it all. Be weary, with the spacious property and trees, parents believe it's okay to let their children run wild without supervision. This isn't necessarily a big problem, nor has anything to do with a negative on Joes Farm Grill- but definitely takes away from the ambiance and enjoyment of the farm setting and the greatness of the food!"}
{"text":"Visited multiple times and had positive experiences each time.   Their burgers are filling and fresh. This will most likely become my go-to spot when I'm craving a hearty burger.  I was full half way through my burger but I could stop eating because it was just that yummy and fresh. I can't wait to explore more of their menu's items!   I went in for brunch another time and order the ribs and waffles. Not such a positive experience with that item. The small amount of meat that was left in the ribs struggled to stay on as the plate reached my table. Both good and bad. Good, because the meat was tender and flavorful. Bad, because there was barely any meat on the ribs. The waffles were just alright and I thought they could be revived with their syrup, but I was wrong. I wasn't a fan of the watery consistency of the syrup and the taste resembled nothing close to great syrup.  Regardless, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love JOE'S FARMGRILL!!! I love ANYTHING Joe has!  He is a great business man with his customers in mind!  Thanks Joe for your great restaurant right where your roots were planted!  It is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hamburger joint.  I have driven past many times and finally had the opportunity to give it a try this past weekend.  AS you can see from the 700 plus reviews...this place is popular.  The line was long but went very quickly.  My husband ordered a hot dog and fries and I went with a burger and onion rings.  In really thought it all was very tasty!  I LOVE the atmosphere here...from the diner type of appeal to the farm feel as you pull in.  I can't wait til it cools off a bit as sitting outside seems perfect.  Nothing fancy here....but calm and casual...my cup of tea!   The  coffee shop next door looks great as well so that may be my next venture.  the family also owns Joe's real BBQ and Liberty Market.  I may venture over to Liberty Market as well ..it seems they have this food thing down.  Side note, I spoke with the mgr while we were there and while I forget his name, I have to say, the guy hustles and is also so friendly...opening doors for people and stopping to say Hi, but not in an annoying way...."}
{"text":"How does a burger joint not have pickles?? Overall good though, different atmosphere, Spicy Thai Vinaigrette dressing is really good!"}
{"text":"Joe's Farm Grill is one of my favorite places to eat in Gilbert. They have fresh and tasty food, great customer service and a casual outdoor atmosphere. My favorite is the Ahi tuna burger."}
{"text":"I really like the food and atmosphere of this place. They also give you an $10 credit on your birthday (as does Joe's real BBQ). I have been here many times and have never been dissappointed. If there is a down side to this place, it is just that sometimes their greens aren't very plentiful... that's all ;)"}
{"text":"Clearly I've missed what all the hype is about.  Went by the place at around 1245, parking lot was full and there was a line out the door.  Left and came back about an hour and half later...no line, lots of parking.  Ordered the farm burger and 2 hot dogs...that and two drinks....$23.    Hamburger -- nothing special.  Came with two leaves of partially brown lettuce and two rather anemic looking rings of red onion...not two slices...two rings.  Hot dogs -- actually not bad.  Came with onion and \"homemade\" relish.    Fries that came with the above we ok, but again nothing special.  So what's my assessment?  - Nothing special. - Way expensive. - Odd that they're a \"farm\" restaurant but yet they had such sad looking produce. - Glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't be a happy camper if I did. - Places to get a better burger...especially on a price to quality ratio...In and Out, Five Guys, Fudruckers.  One final point that ranks somewhere between weird and disgusting.  The drink/condiment station shares the same drainage trough.  So when you're down stream from the condiments getting your soda you get to watch ketchup, mayo, ranch dressing, etc float by you as you get your soda.  Kind of a nasty sight in my book."}
{"text":"Best garlic fries hands down ! The milkshakes are pretty good, i recommend be there about 20 min before your lunch break because lines do get long."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to er in Gilbert AZ, really unique farm fresh from the property. Love the variety and vibe."}
{"text":"Love the food but I have one issue-the tip calculator on the iPad for payment is totally shady. $16 tab, hit 12% tip, and that's somehow $4.12?  I don't mind giving a generous tip but when it's totally sketchy it sours the experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  The food and service is excellent and I like it because of the surroundings, and with the local connection to the community, I even that much more drawn to them.  A must visit in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Fresh and fresher! Grilled wedge salad was so good. They used a small head of lettuce and then just cut it in half. Chunky blue cheese dressing and smoked bacon made it sensational. Eating outside is wonderfully inviting by their picnic tables under their citrus trees."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out this place for a while and finally had a chance to on a lovely Monday afternoon for lunch.   Pros-  Fresh, tasty food Pretty outdoor grounds Indoor/outdoor seating Kid/family friendly Good service  Cons- Long line/busy Long-ish wait for food Flies harass you if you opt for outside seating  If you're like me and have a hard time deciding between some of their awesome looking side items here's my verdict: garlic fries take a strong 1st place, onion rings 2nd, and fried zucchini 3rd. I didn't care much for the flavor of their ranch dressing as it tasted pretty bland.   I'd also recommend going next door to the coffee shop over ordering their iced flavored coffees that were just ok.   I see why this place has so many great reviews. Definitely a winner in terms of food and ambience."}
{"text":"Every time I am asked to go to Joe's Farm Grill, I am in.  I really like this place.  The food is good.  The staff is friendly.  The location in Agritopia is gorgeous.  The bathrooms are really kitschy cool.  Tonight I had a burger with cheddar cheese and sauteed mushrooms.  It was good and seemed bigger than the 6 oz patty they promised.  I couldn't finish it all, especially since I added garlic fries to my order.  You can rightly assume where my priorities were.  I, once again, reek of garlic.    I love being able to sit outside in Summer.  They have a lot of shaded seating.  The only thing I cannot stand is I am always swarmed by bugs while I am eating.  The last time I was at Joe's, bees would not leave me alone.  Tonight, the flies were extremely annoying!  Of course, I know that's a hazard of eating outside on a farm.  It just reminds me I should bring some kind of insect repellant next time I want to dine there!  It's important to me to support local, Christian businesses.  This is one I will keep coming back to!"}
{"text":"I definitely liked this place, but there are a few reasons why i had to give it 3 stars instead of the 4 I initially intended on giving.  I'll get the negative out of the way now so I can end on a good note.    First of all, the layout is just kind of silly.  I totally understand that this is an olllldddd building, so you work with what you're given.  That being said, the entrance/exit is too small and the condiment line backs up into that exit.  It's really frustrating that people feel some need to create a single file line to get sodas, napkins, utensils and condiments when really, there is A LOT of room to share.  It's a really long condiment bar!  Second of all it's way out there for us.  Living in Downtown Phoenix makes the trek out to Gilbert pretty rough sometimes.  Finally, they wouldn't let me sub a smaller version of the green bean fries for regular fries, even though I was willing to pay more than the normal sub fee.  On to the good... The grilled cheese I got was really yummy.  It was made with really thick Texas Toast style bread, had some great cheese on the inside, and it was toasted/grilled just right.  It was a very hearty grilled cheese!  The green bean fries that I wanted just a single sized portion of turned out to be like 3 pounds piled high in a basket!  They were really good and garlicky, and for only 5 bucks a great value.  However, I really just wanted enough for myself because as it turns out, I continued eating them until I made myself sick.   Overall, I liked the place, but it seems to be constantly busy and I just don't like getting crowded when I'm trying to eat a nice relaxing meal outside."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices, the only low point is that u have to be ready to wait about 20-30 min until you can order the line is always super long. The upside to that is that the food is awesome."}
{"text":"So so glad yelp reminded me about this place.  Its really a farm grill, on a farm and so fun to eat at.  I like to walk around the place after I'm done eating ribs and waffles for that old time feel.  Quaint, charming, and good eats nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has become a staple for us when out of town guests came. Great atmosphere and the food always tastes fresh! A place you must go if visiting Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood on a Thursday afternoon and just had to try this out since I believe it's the only Joe's restaurant I haven't tried (often). The look from the outside was great and covered in orange trees. Once you get out of the car, you forget suburbia is so close. It's truly an urban farm. We walked into the retro former Johnston home and walked right up to get our food. The menu had so much to choose from that I got a special bbq chicken sandwich and garlic fries. The garlic and herbs were pulled straight from the farm, diced, and spread over the fries. Awesome.  My friend told me I had to check out the bathroom, which was something out of the Jetson's or Buck Roger's. I don't know what old skool show they were playing (something from the 60s).   Out back was a huge huge tree with tables all over. I loved the sign that said to keep off for fear of falling and scorpions. Lol. My 5year old definitely stayed away. We walked around, took pictures, ate, and checked out the gardens by The Coffee Shop (which I will hit next time).   Thanks again, Joe!"}
{"text":"Here's the irony: I give it two stars b/c I just really hate going here, but I recommend you check it out at least once. The burgers are really high quality, the other food is fresh. But this place has such a d-bag feel to it, and it's always so crowded that it's both not fun and a little dirty.  The place is authentic and has a good story behind it. Leave yourself enough time to walk the grounds and the adjoining community garden.  And it's expensive (which means you pay too much for it, not that it's high value). I think I had a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a serve-yourself-at-our-outside-in-the-heat-fountain drink, it it set me back like $14."}
{"text":"Do not, and i repeat do not go there for breakfast.  The Belgians would be appaled by the so called tasteless Belgian waffle, the apple fritters barely had any shreds of apple and were actually mini dough balls practically as heavy as a baseball, and the veggie omelette n coffee were just eh... That was not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Location: it is located right next to the farm with home grown lemons, oranges and many diff types of veggies etc. The restaurant doesn't have a lot of seating in the inside. However, there are quite a few tables on the outside. Parking is a bit tight but still have plenty of parking. Be prepared to park on the dirt.   Food: This is my first time coming here to try their coffee and breakfast. I ordered a Latte and waffle with berries. Coffee is so smooth and the waffle is by far the best waffles I've ever had.   Rating: I will definitely come back here for their breakfast and coffee again."}
{"text":"Wow, that was a pricey meal!  a small pizza and a burger with lemonade cost us 30 dollars.    A nice place to visit and check out. Once. But the price/value is a little askew for me.    I did love the lovely outdoor patio and my burger was fantastic.  I tried the Fontina burger.  A creative and tasty burger, but I think the Fez Burger is the best \"creative\" burger in the Valley.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed mine bunless to save a few calories and carbs.    The pizza was not very memorable, but we did order the pepperoni pizza.  It tasted just fine.  They must have one of the coolest restrooms in the Valley.  Very neat.  Definitely remember to wash your hands before you eat.  Return Factor: 20% Kid Factor: 80%"}
{"text":"I got the Carolina Dog and swapped out the french fries for Sweet Potato Fries.  The dog was good, very messy but the pork had great flavor. I was extremely surprised at how small the portion of Sweet Potato fries was.  It was $2 more to change to the Sweet Potato fries and I literally got about 20 fries.  They were delicious but definitely not worth the extra cost.  We each got a sandwich and upgraded our sides, he got a shake and our total was $30!  It is decent food, and a quaint atmosphere outside but the prices leave much to be desired."}
