{"text":"Pizza sauce and crust was flat with no taste. Owners were not very friendly."}
{"text":"With having three kids in the house we differently eat a lot of pizza. By far the best pizza I have had in the area. We moved in a couple blocks away and this will for sure be a walking distance dinner spot for us. Oh and the wings amazing. First place I have asked for extra crispy and they understood what I meant!!! Loved it! And the fact that its family owned and they are super nice just made it even better."}
{"text":"I feel lucky to have finally eaten some of Lucky's Pizza on Beardsley & Lake Pleasant.  The pizza was fantastic, the bread was awesome, the sauce was great, even the pepperoni had a seasoned flavor to it.  I have to say that it was some of the best pizza I have ever eaten and of course the ranch was good too.  I did order wings and they were OK.  Atmosphere was casual as it was in a strip mall with business's closing as I was still eating the pizza."}
