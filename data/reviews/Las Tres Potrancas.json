{"text":"Came here with my gf on a date and it was so horrible! an employee gave us rude looks and had a bad attitude, she seemed very annoyed when we asked her questions about the drinks. And she didnt put any ice when we asked for extra... Not coming back here again :("}
{"text":"Came back because they are close to my house and am pleased to say that this experience was much better. Beers were cold, food was good and the staff was on point. Hopefully they are paying attention to their reviews. Keep working..."}
{"text":"This place is a bar that happens to serve food, plane and simple. It has a good vibe with TVs and nice intimate setting.    The beans are good with chips and their salsa is good too.   You can't complain about $1 tacos Tuesday or $1 margaritas on Wednesdays.    They have 4-5 beers on tap but they just have 2 available every time I go there.   Extremely slow service and sometimes your waitress is high on Purple Stinky Punch lol..   I keep going there cause of the beans and chips/salsa and the boo's"}
{"text":"Definitely not a place for food,  unless you're already drunk.  Menudo is extremely below average.  I've had better at filibertos and food city.  Beans and rice were horrendous. Worst I've had by far."}
{"text":"Coolest place in town great food great drinks... Plus the best and coolest bar tender I ever meet named Ashley.. thanks for the best service and the best deals... I appreciate it very much!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos and a really good michelada.  The service was very slow and there were only two other customers.  The beer selection was also very weak.    The chips and salsa were on point.  The carne asada and pastor tacos were also very good and only a buck a piece if you buy 16.  Well worth it.  Dont come here if you dont have time to wait.  Cause you will be pissed.  Come here if you have time and want a good taco and good michelada."}
{"text":"Met good people, great atmosphere, sports, live music, DJ, and karaoke, great food, awesome staff"}
{"text":"I'm not the one to write reviews but nobody deserves to spend $70 on canned beans, frozen tasting fries and uncooked yet burnt burgers. Service was horrible, my husband had been craving a Sonoran Hot fog and it never came .. .. according to the waitress \"the cook forgot \" no refills and getting a napkin was like asking for a n impossible. I was so disappointed to spend my family dinner, time and money. Ugh live and learn I guess."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! A perfect place for a margarita and Mexican food on a Friday night. Ashley was our server and she was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, we all had burritos and had to take most of it home because the portions were so big! It's definitely more of a bar atmosphere and they have the music pretty loud but it's a fun time."}
{"text":"Wednesday's are the best!!! $1 margaritas! Chips and salsa are great too! Service was a little slow and they only have 1 high chair that was in use the whole time. Tacos where really good too. Defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"The reason I gave this place a low score is because they always running out of beer! Ask for Ultra, out...ask for Coors light,  out...Miller-light, out...Dos X's, out but they have Budlight or Budweiser available. The 2 gangsta beers I don't car about! BUT one of the staff by the name of Ashley is really nice and attentive, that's why I gave it a 2 star, because of her.  Stock your beer up people! Lol"}
{"text":"Great place but, the service is horrible. Took our guest that come from out of town, it was embarrassing."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday, so it wasn't very busy. The food was good tho and service was great."}
{"text":"I give them no rating service was horrible. First of all we went in wanting some tacos and the waiter tells us they don't have carne asada so we are like ok and ordered wings and a bucket of beer. Then the dj walked in 15 minutes after we placed the order and the waiter comes and tells us it's going to be like 20 minutes because the cook had to make the wings from scratch. So we are like ok 20 minutes we can wait, 40 minutes waiting the waiter walks out from the kitchen with a plate of wings and we are oh cool finally and she takes the plate to the dj. So I go and tell the waiter cancel the order and charge us for the bucket of beer and she said ok then comes to the table with the bill and she charged me for the wings and and still no wings. I told her I just said cancel my order dj gets his wings before us and you charge my card after I told you to cancel it. Then she comes back where she charged my card twice and still no wings after we waited already for an hour. Then I ask to just give me cash for the first charge and that turned into another issue finally I had to ask just to give me receipt where the first charger was canceled. Long story short not going back all we wanted were tacos and drinks and we  walk out hungry and overcharged."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The food is good but very slow with Service every time. Great drink prices and specials."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots feels like home. Love the service not to mention there food very authentic Mexican food keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Been waiting 15 mins for food. No waitress has come to refill beers. They didn't have hotdogs, even though its a special. And half my table wanted ceviche which they didn't have either! But the atmosphere is good, which is a plus."}
{"text":"The customer service here is terrible! Waited about 10 minutes to get someone to our table. The waitress couldn't take our drink order (3 sprites) because she didn't have a pen. Food was really good but limited Combo opinions. I had to pay extra for beans and rice on both entre's I ordered and they were pretty skimpy on the beans. Shift change took place before we were done and we were not notified. Had to go to the bar and ask for our check. I would love to go back because the food was really good but not sure it's worth the lack of customer service in my opinion."}
{"text":"I tried the food here and it was great. Very cute place in a non-descript location. Kind of intimate in size."}
{"text":"After taquitos and beer closed down this new place opened up and it is honestly amazing. The dollar margaritas are just a plus and taste so good. The beer mugs are so cold which makes for great tasting draft beers. Servers could be a little more friendly but they are very attentive. The place is clean and the tacos are delicious! I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
