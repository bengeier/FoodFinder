{"text":"Great location, right by the park.  Cafe offers some basic food (e.g. Sandwiches, pizza, hot dog, burgers) but it's not a greasy joint nor is the food straight from a fridge.  Good for families, sports groups to hang out and grab something to eat.  Nice dining patio and a large chalk board for the kids.  They also have an ice team stand in front of the store.  Staff is pleasant but just a bit slow."}
{"text":"OMG where do I start .. the place is located in a beautiful water front park just by the rapids the menu is  just fantastic   mouth watering display of words of all their tantalizing ingredients, and from what i tasted i believe that the chef is passionate about what goes on every dish , but here is where the problem starts this greasy spoon has everything on the menu from burgers to general tao the women working the front of the house destroy what the chef is trying to claim in his plates .. they are rude little PreMadonnas that have no clue about the dining experience their service skills are straight  out of ghetto hand book .. Do recommend you going to this place just makes sure your meal is for take out !"}
{"text":"I noticed this place years ago but never stopped by until recently.  They're the only place I know of to have Bilboquet ice cream, made with 100% natural ingredients (their vanilla hard ice actually has vanilla seeds in it). They also have regular soft serve vanilla and chocolate ice cream and sorbet.  They serve American-style sandwiches, subs, burgers and pizza and Chinese-style soup. They've got a nice selection of poutines (their bacon poutine is their best one) and a nice dessert menu..  Enjoy a meal inside their restaurant or on their terrace across the street from the riverside."}
{"text":"Me n my boyfriend loved this lil gem!!!!!!!! So regretful it took us this long to come and check it out, being that we've lived in the neighborhood for almost 3 years now.   We were just guna get some ice cream, but when we went in we were invited to sit on the terrasse and they would come and serve us at our table...so we did. We ordered a 1/2 pitcher of sangria and shared the 2 hotdogs n fries platter (only we upgraded the fries to a poutine for 2$ more). And then, of course, we got that ice cream we came for.  Hotdogs were good, but came with do-it-ourselves toppings. The poutine was great, but coulda used more gravy and definitely tasted better with a generous salting. The sangria was nothing special but highly appreciated on a beautiful waterside terrasse such as this one. The ice cream...so many options but we opted for the child's formats of soft serve and I took mine with sprinkles: perfection!  Service was quick and friendly but a bit confusing as we had to order our ice cream from the outside window and tip the other girl separately, but no biggy, was worth it and now we know for next time.   And there will be many, many, many next times for this place! We absolutely can't wait to try everything else on the menu! Highly recommend this place!"}
