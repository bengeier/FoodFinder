{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a while and finally decided to give it a go! It's a great place to go if you're looking to hang out with friends but don't want to make a trip downtown! The price was very reasonable, service was quick, food was great, sheesha was great, and the staff was super friendly! We ordered drinks, Apple mint flavored sheesha, the zaatar pizza and fries - everything was great! Will definitely go back. Only down side was that one person ordered an iced tea and we got the can, maybe they can improve on that!"}
{"text":"came to this place to get a hookah. me and my bro in law ended up ordering a grape flavored hookah. they served it with the cubical coals (first time I've seen this in montreal). hookah was ok. very strong, and it did become very harsh. made us a bit dizzy and made it a bit difficult to smoke.   on the positive side the atmosphere here is AWESOME. tons of people. they have an amazing extension under a tent on the side. the scene is really good. haven't tried any of the food or anything. my score is strictly on the hookah though."}
{"text":"Food was really good. We know very little about arab food so were pretty lost at most menu options. Good that they have the set menu for 2 (or 4) where you pretty much sample a bit from every category.   Didn't get to try their shisha but read many good reviews on google. will come back."}
{"text":"The shish tawook was yummy! Their different fries were nice for the kids! The chicken shawarma was nice too but a bit dry ! I loved the shish tawook! Flavours were good!!"}
{"text":"One of the best arabic cuisine i have had in a long time. The good was delicious and the owner are superb in their welcome"}
