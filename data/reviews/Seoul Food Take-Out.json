{"text":"One of my favourite take out spots around my office. It is literally a hole in the wall and they only have one option: take out. They offer affordable daily specials consisting of very homey Korean dishes such as bulgogi, bibimbap, donkatsu and chicken curry. The portions are very generous and the food is very good.  Get ready to bundle up if you plan to come here in the winter as you'll be waiting outside for your order!"}
{"text":"This will be my go to place for lunch when I'm at work.  It's cheap, fresh and delicious and the woman working there was so cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"My and my friend ate bibimpap together. It's really delicious and suitable for 2 people. Moreover, it's sale on Friday. You guys should go to and try some!!"}
{"text":"Like someone else said, this is literally a hole in the wall. It's not a food truck, it's not a takeout joint with a few seats, but it's literally a hole in the wall (I tried explaining this to a coworker and he was like \"what?\")

Regardless, sometimes hole in the walls have the some of the best food or at least best bang for your buck.  I ordered the kimchi fried rice and added tofu and it came to 9.90 incl. taxes.  I've had kimchi fried rice before and sometimes all they give you is kimchi and rice and doesn't even taste fried (it tastes like kimchi w/white rice).  However, when I got back to my office and opened the food container, I was very surprised to discover a heaping portion of tofu (at least 6 large pieces), glass noodles, potatoes and a few other items.  

It was very tasty, not overly powered by kimchi and an enormous portion (I eat 3000 calories a day and this filled me up).  

I also saw they numerous specials as well.

If you have anywhere between $8 and $10 cash and work around the area, I'd definitely recommend coming here.  Cash only."}
{"text":"There just aren't many food options around this area and I'm glad my friend showed me this place. This is a take-out joint and literally a hole in the wall (order through a window). There are daily specials (great value) as well as a lengthy menu of korean specialties. The portions are very generous, the dishes and banchan tasty, and the woman behind the window is always friendly. 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Quick thumb-typed review.  Passed by this place after parking. Saw the lunch specials and decided to give it a try.  It's a take-out window with good,  hearty food.  Kind service,  portions to power from the most diminutive sis to the most gargantuan man! They are there to help workers like us get through the day for value.  A real community-oriented place.  I am grateful they are open and hope they will continue to shine. I will not be packing lunch when I frequent this area - I will be here instead! 

Cute bonus: the inside of the takeaway box has the words \"Thank You\" embossed inside.  Nice touch.  It's an odd,  but encouraging feeling to see such positive words facing you throughout your meal."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. Ordered the Monday special which was called curry chicken but really should be called curry potato and rice because that's mostly what you get. I did find a few pieces of dark meat which was tender but I had to look hard for it. 

Still it was tasty (moderate spice level) and you get a tremendous amount of food for $6.75 tax incl.  if you work in the area and you're looking to fall asleep at your desk after lunch this place is worth a try. 

They have daily lunch specials so I'm going to check out some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Generous portions for a great price.  Take out only. The chicken bowl was very good, and came with potato salad, kimchi, and tofu pancakes. Strangely, the worst part of the meal was also the simplest -- the rice was dry. Hopefully a one time thing as it's nice to have a Korean place around this area. Watch out for the daily specials!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall that is bang for buck! Lunch well under $10 with generous portions. Take out only. I've tried two of the weekly specials: curry chicken (Monday) and bulgogi (Wednesday). Excellent, clean and sweetest Korean lady to serve you. Whenever I forget to bring lunch, I'll be coming here. Feels good to support a hardworking business owner, too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. The woman working there is super friendly and a pleasure. The only downside to this place is it is cash only as of this review. 

But man. So good. Had the mega donkatsu in this visit and it was two full layers that were perfectly cooked. House sauce was great too. Came with rice salad and kimchi for under 8 dollars. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is its cash only. The food is fresh and amazing. Portion sizes are huge! Love the fish special and the chicken stir fry bowl. The owner is really sweet and remembers your orders!"}
