{"text":"I love the place!  It's hard for me to walk past without stopping in to say hi to Jeremy the owner. Some days I stop and get a large bowl of soup to go...few slices of bread ...That's a whole dinner for me.  Don't forget the chipped ham...and the ice cream. Awesome old time Deli!"}
{"text":"Where to start. Food is pretty pricey for how much you get. I ordered a cheeseburger with grilled mushrooms. The mushrooms were cold canned mushrooms, and the bacon was pretty cold as well.  They also had what seemed to be an 11 year old (couldn't have been more than 12) at the most working the register, and it took him about 5 minutes to figure out change what turned out to be 3 quarters and a penny."}
{"text":"Small town diner.  Experience it.  The whole menu is good but I've always been all about the breakfast and ice cream."}
