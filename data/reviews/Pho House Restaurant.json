{"text":"So I stopped by for my lunch break, I wanted to try something different from the usual. I arrived got seated right away and my order arrived a few minutes later. The Pho was absolutely amazing! Everything was very fresh, the broth was the highlight of the show. If your not adding hot oil, I'm sorry my friend but your doing it wrong. Flavors when out the roof! 5 stars, great service, great environment!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Had the shrimp bowl with pork, noodles & quail eggs. It was our first time at Pho and we will definitely coming back. Everyone was so friendly and it was suggested to cater it for one of our work parties! Sounds like a great idea!! Yum! Thanks!"}
{"text":"We ordered Bun Bo Hue noodle soup, Beef Ball noodle soup and deep fried egg rolls.  The portion size of the noodle soup was generous compared to PT Noodles.  The restaurant was bright and clean, the wait staff was good also.  Unfortunately, the soup was very bland sort of water down and did not have strong beef flavor it should.  The egg rolls were crispy but NOT tasty.  I don't think I'll be coming back until the restaurant address this issue."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this pho spot. Only reason why I'm leaving 3 stars is due to the fact that I placed a to go order, and when I arrived 20 min later (which they said it'd be ready in 20) they said they never received the order. So I had to wait an additional 20 minutes for an order I called in 20 minutes ago! And to top off the filet mignonette dish I ordered tasted as if I were biting into ginger. Was not happy with my order this time when I know how good this spot can be."}
{"text":"Great place for Vietnamese food on the west side. Very large and clean compared to PT down the street. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I'm not from the area, but friends took me to this place.  I was surprised by how cheap the dishes were.  I had the number 4 in the pho and also had pork chop with rice.  Amazed at both! Excellent customer service, our waitress was very attentive and food came out fast"}
{"text":"Great food excellent customer service is great! Only downside is when you carry out the food so hot it almost melts the Styrofoam. It would be nice if they invested in better carry out containers."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Resturant and restrooms were very clean. Prices are very reasonable. Wait staff could improve but tolerable.  Substitutions on dishes are a bit confusing to them."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my bun thit nuong Cha gio. Large portion!  Clean toilet. Recommended from a Vietnamese"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had yo! I recommend pho dact biet! Great service too! Thai iced tea was great too! For those that can't use chopsticks they offer you fork utensils. Easy 10/10 from me."}
{"text":"Just had one of my best Pho experiences. Walked in and was met with courteous employees and courteous and attentive though lunch. The broth was very flavorful. I highly recommend this place for Pho soup"}
{"text":"The broth here is great. The spring rolls are on point. Friendly staff. The place is very well maintained."}
{"text":"Consistently great! The food is always delicious and the staff is very pleasant. If you like pho, you must come here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to eat.  I go here 4 days a week their Pho soup is delicious and not sweet, some other places likes to add a lot of sugar in their soup but not this place.  The egg rolls are delicious too!! The service is pretty good, the guy with the long hair is great he never messes up our order."}
{"text":"This place rocks Pho!!!!!! I haven't found any place that reminds me of home but they have knocked it out of the park! It is just like our favorite Pho place back in Denver! Definitely will be back and soon!"}
{"text":"I first came to this location when it was a quite successful Chinese restaurant, that I was sad to see go after many years.  Then came a succession of followers, none of whom did well.  Now, we've got Pho House.  Will it last for any length of time or plummet into the abyss like others that made a go of it here?

LOCATION:

They say location is everything in the real estate world and it seems to prove true for restaurants in Goodyear, too.  Once bustling and full of life, this shopping center almost turned into a ghost town after Fry's (thankfully) shut its doors. The shops are \"low-income\" and the restaurant fits in accordingly with threadbare decoration and low prices (or better put: prices typical for a Vietnamese restaurant).  Whether you like the minimal decoration will depend on how much you like open and airy spaces.  Unlike, say, PT Noodles, which would be too crowded with two tables and would work best as a take-out place only, this place could be filled with 100 tables and still seem empty (exaggeration, I know, but you get the idea).

MENU

Surprisingly skimpy, even for a Vietnamese restaurant.  If you're familiar with the genre, you'll neither be surprised nor disappointed.  Standard pho, rice and noodle dishes, appetizers and sandwiches.  Reasonable prices; very good sized portions (especially in comparison to PT Noodles, which serves \"human\" sized portions and not standard \"American\" sized plates, which could take down a bull elephant).

FOOD:

Hit-n-miss.  The egg rolls (cha gio) are crispy, not covered in grease, and tasty.  The goi cuon (spring rolls with vegetables, shrimp, etc. in rice paper) are tasty and decently sized (though Da Vang still takes the prize for both in size and taste).  Pho portions are huge; the rice entrees also; but unlike their equivalents at Da Vang, PT Noodles and Central King Egg Roll, very well spiced, very tasty and the vegetables crispy (at both PT Noodles and Da Vang, the dishes tend to be watery and somewhat bland, with Da Vang's being almost \"soupy\"). The sandwiches here are ... meh.  A little skimpy on both the vegetable and meat content and they could take a hint from PT Noodles, which -- while their sandwiches are small --- toast the bun, which makes all the difference.  Again, Da Vang's sandwiches -- when they have the bread -- are the best; especially their breakfast sandwich with egg, which I've yet to find anywhere else in the Valley.

If you intend to order sandwiches to take out after your meal, make sure to order them when you sit down.  They'll tell you straight off it takes a long time to make them (I don't know why) and they mean it.  If you intend to eat a sandwich right there in the restaurant, have a book, IPod or the patience to work on your new novel.  You won't be getting out of there quickly.  (By the way, the restaurant does not have wi-fi, but you can access your COX account on your device if you're a customer).

Give this restaurant's iced tea a try!  Like in every other place, I find it has a slightly fishy and bitter taste when you first drink it (it's an acquired taste). But then, it's followed up with a very brief jasmine aftertaste, which is quite refreshing.

Dessert is THE hit-n-miss here.  One of the staff told me that they sometimes have desserts, sometimes not.  Everything is fresh and they don't want to waste food; so you may or may not find dessert.  This explanation is totally logical; but for the average American, totally unacceptable.  Having cravings for something sweet is something I always experience after eating Vietnamese food and I expect a restaurant to be .. well, a restaurant.  Food trucks have revolving menus, not restaurants.

SUMMARY:

While the staff is absolutely friendly, informative and delightful -- and a good bit of the food very tasty and well-prepared, the overall impression one might get at first glance would be something like:  \"they opened yesterday; most of the decoration's in the back room; and their chef told them that if you put more than two pages worth of dishes on the menu, he/she is quitting\".

There's nothing wrong with this place and I'd recommend it to everyone, in spite of some of the negative-sounding comments in my review.  Just don't expect much; don't be in a hurry;
and don't wear a fancy evening gown to dinner and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"The soup and food is great with reasonable prices. Restaurant is also very clean with nice ambience."}
{"text":"I eat at Kauai Pho in Lihue at least 2, 3 times a month or I try to make it as much as I can because:
1) Awesome owners
2) great samien, way better then Hamuras because Pho makes everything natural n healthy.
3) As a steady customer I don't even have to tell them what my order is because they already know me n what I love eating.
4) Their shrimp yellow noodle saimen is plain \"AWESOME!!!\"
I give then a 20 star rating..."}
{"text":"Happy to report that this is the best Ph broth so far in the west valley. Possibly the best to me in the valley. Hopefully they could keep this up.  Service was also great.  They were a little stingy with the veggies but it is not a big deal because the waiter happily brought some more out."}
{"text":"What I love about going to pho restaurants. Easy to order menus and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I had the pho And a couple of spring rolls. I thought their prices were more than fair. There pho probably could have used a few more pieces of beef it was still good the spring rolls were excellent. I am going back today to try the vermicelli and grab a couple more of those spring rolls!!! The people were very friendly and polite and when I went there the restaurant was very clean. I would have given it five stars if they would just put a little more meat in there pho."}
{"text":"I am really glad I found this place!

Fast, friendly service and HUGE portions.  I had the vermicelli pork bowl with egg roll. I have eaten this dish at countless other Pho joints, and Pho house delivers the most pork. Lots of veggies and mint.

Clean, bright restaurant and an A health rating posted."}
{"text":"We come here about once a week. One of the best Pho restaurants we've been too and I have tried quite many! Food is consistently good and the customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"It's an ok Pho place and a tad cheaper than the Pho next to Michael's. The broth was a bit bland. The egg rolls were just fine. Kinda weird to see a corner of the restaurant piled up with supplies, random items and waitstaff personal belongings."}
{"text":"Pho was awesome! Broth was flavorful and clean. Staff was nice and the place was very clean. Will come back for sure. Thai Tea w/ Boba was great too. They also was giving away egg rolls too."}
{"text":"Will be coming back. It was great! Chicken Pho was delicious along with the egg rolls. So fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"I ordered three banh mi, different flavors, asked for no jalapeno on any.  To go, so I didn't really open the bag before I left the premises.  Got home, all 3 had jalapeno.  BBQ Pork banh mi had a decent amount of meat, good flavor, and I'd say was the best of the three.  The grilled chicken & grilled steak ones had minimal amount of meat.  All three were very skimpy on the pickled vegetables, which is one of the distinctive flavors I like about banh mi.  They did use a good glop of mayo on all three sandwiches, which I am not really used to, but not super opposed to.  I'd give them another try, but not on any of the banh mi.  I hope their pho is better..."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in the valley! Best broth flavor and great prices. We eat here at least 2x per month"}
{"text":"The pho was delicious! Best I've had on the west side. 
We did wait about 30 minutes for our food, however. We were told they weren't expecting to be so busy during lunch time, and were understaffed. The wait was disappointing, but we will be back. The place is new, hasn't even been open for a week. I'd expect them to have a few kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food. I felt I got what I paid for, and then some. 

Wife and I both ordered pho tai... The broth flavor was on par with some of the best I've had. Meat, noodles and portions were perfect.

I also ordered the #32 fried rice and pork. The rice was soft and fluffy. Great meat again. Lots of flavor.

Even the iced tea was noticeably better than what most places serve."}
{"text":"Was just scolded by an idiot kid (guy in black glasses) and my wife had to beg me to not give him a piece of my mind right there in the restaurant. I got the last laugh though and I hope he enjoys that tip.

Walk in and ask for a booth and they were all open but dirty as it was right after the lunch rush. Only four people in the place when we got there. Instead of saying let me clean one off for you he says \"there are none available\" and sits us at a table. A minute after we sat down (while placing our order) someone cleared the booth right next to us (less than five feet away) so we stand up and move ourselves over to the booth. We are the only people on this side of the restaurant and the place is almost empty.

The idiot kid sees us move and makes a beeline over to scold us for moving without getting his permission. He states that from now on we need to get his approval before we move tables as he already placed our order using the other tables number. I told the idiot that I would be sure to remind him that we were in the booth five feet away when he brought our food out. At this point my wife knew I was upset and asked me to let it go so I was nice and did. We then had to get our own silverware and napkins because the idiot didn't bring them and walked away.

Typical Millennial with no ability to think on the fly or adjust to change. The kid was really confused as to how he was going to get our order to us since we moved five feet to another table.

Back to PT Noodles for us."}
{"text":"Yum!  There's a lot to choose from as far as Pho goes in the area.  For some strange reason, there's like 4 places I can think of off the top of my head.  We enjoyed coming here but still enjoy our favorite \"old places\" more.  Convenient location just off the highway."}
{"text":"It's a big pho kin deal, my wife loved the place, you get kpop, pho, and thai tea... really good pricing. Good food as well."}
{"text":"I would rate the food 2.5/5. The food was okay. I ordered the Banh Xeo and Pho Xao Chay. Banh Xeo didn't have pork in it and it was not crispy- it was soggy. 

I would rate 3.5/5. We had a party of 4 and the waiter only asked two of us what the wanted and then asked \"is this all?\" Before the rest got to order lol. But he was nice! I think he was confused and maybe training

The restaurant itself is nice and spacious!"}
{"text":"As a Pho connoisseur I'm always in search for the best when I'm away from SoCal.  This restaurant is definitely the most legit in the West side of town in Phoenix.  Excellent broth and ingredients (pho Tai).

I've also had the grilled pork with broken rice, spring rolls, and fried egg rolls. All excellent.

The service is also awesome, they've been busy consistently since opening last year.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For those of you who live in the \"West Valley\", I would highly recommend Pho House. Whether your craving a bowl of Pho, Vietnamese crepe or rice vermicelli, this place will definitely fulfill your Vietnamese craving. Great food and good service, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service is good. Came in at the peak of the dinner rush and was served right away.  The pho is comforting."}
{"text":"I was craving pho for my birthday, and found this spot on yelp. The West side doesn't always satisfy some of my food cravings, but this place definitely is now on my go-to list. The service was great! Everyone was very nice, very helpful, and all smiling. The portions were hearty. And the food delicious! Very flavorful! And let's not forget the restaurant itself...super clean, with the staff ensuring everything is spotless, while not bothering you too much while you eat, unless you need a refill and the occasional check in."}
{"text":"Finally a decent restaurant in the west valley area! Walked in and was greeted very nicely. The service was very friendly and the food was very good. Their boba are my favs! Highly recommend this place to anyone who lives in the west valley!"}
{"text":"What happened to your prices? It went up!! Pho shouldn't be that expensive. It's soup."}
{"text":"Love this little new place for pho. After a rainy morning decided to try this new place out. Glad we did. Food was pretty delicious. I ordered the chicken pho and the bf had a #1. Also ordered a side of egg rolls and spring rolls, I love the fact that u can choose the size of them, which king eggroll doesn't have. The only thing... service was good but I had to keep asking for refills on the drinks. So sad. Used to always having that full with king eggroll. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Big portions, tasty food, and nice service. The server even got me a new drink when I didn't like the one I originally ordered. By the way the Thai tea is amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great and welcoming staff! Its very clean and presentable but the food was even better, so tasteful. We tried the egg rolls, pho, grilled chicken and short ribs. Everything was perfect! They even have boba and all for such an amazing price... Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service... food on point! My comfort food...reminds me of home! Good prices"}
{"text":"I came here for the soft opening, and ended up coming back 2 more times! 
I'll start with the atmosphere: the entire set up has a clean, modern look with 3 TVs, either on the Vietnamese channel or a Korean network. Pho House is also very spacious, and could probably accommodate somewhere near 100. The tables aren't cluttered with the sauces and utensils, but they will definitely provide it for you.
Which brings me to service: each time I came, it wasn't too busy so they were as attentive as they needed to be and provided extra sauce, suggestions, and friendly service. I have heard they get pretty busy around lunch time, so I probably wouldn't recommend hoarding them just yet, since they are new.
Before this restaurant, this area had King Eggroll and PT Noodle. In my opinion King Eggroll is not a huge competitor, though its been around the longest. PT Noodle has good flavor, but a small location. The food at Pho House as of now, is my favorite in our area.

Among my 3 visits, I managed to try Banh Xeo, Pho Dac Biet, Mi Dac Biet, Com Tam Dac Biet, a couple of Banh Mi, eggrolls, and spring rolls. 
The Banh Xeo (like an egg crepe filled with bean sprout, shrimp, and other stuff) was flavorful, especially with the fish sauce. The one thing it lacked was crispness; only the outer radius was crisp.
Their Pho (signature Vietnamese rice noodle soup) has a slightly sweeter base compared to other restaurants, which is my preference. The meats were all cooked well (not well done!) And really brought out the flavor of the soup.
Mi Dac Biet (similar broth to pho, but with a seafood medley and egg noodles) was a daily special recommended by their server, Alex. Although the base is similar, the seafood makes it feel like a completely different dish. Alex also suggested to add the roastes chili oil, which I would also recommend.
The Com Tam (broken rice dish) comes with different sides, so I ordered the Dac Biet, to try out most of them. It came with grilled pork, fried egg, grilled shrimp and some Vietnamese specialty dishes. Its a very wholesome meal for those who like variety.
In terms of the Banh Mi (Vietnamese sanchwiches), I tried the BBQ Pork and the Crisp Pork. BBQ pork has a distinct Chinese influence for the flavor. Its the same as Chashu, if you know what that is. The Crispy pork has a good fattiness and crunchiness to it. If you're Filipino, think Lechon.
The eggrolls are meaty, which I like. Not much to say about it. A perfect pairing with the sauce. Also, the spring rolls are well packed and the peanut sauce that comes with it is a good balance of sweet and savory. 

All in all, I would definitely recommend going here. I've already recommended all my friends!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much and the price makes it even better! Lol highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Visited Pho House this week.  Was pleasantly surprised at how clean and up dated the resaurant was.  Very friendly staff.  Went on a Thursday for dinner and had no problems getting in and served in record time.  I had the fried pork which was absolutely scrumptious.  My husband had the Pho with chicken which was great as well.  This will be our new Vietnamese restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"In search for a different non chain place to eat for lunch today, I found this new gem! It is well located just south of the 1-10. The restaurant is clean and the servers were very friendly. 
I ordered the vegetable and tofu jasmine rice dish. The sauce was very well seasoned and the tofu had great flavor. There were a few too many onions but overall the flavor was great! The shrimp spring rolls are good but the peanut could use some more flavor. 
The prices are very reasonable. Most dishes are ~$6.99. 
Overall great experience so my husband and I will be back to try out ore dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I like the clean new look inside. I have to disagree with the review stating the taste was bland. It was pretty tasty and good and I have had King Eggroll and PT Noodles and I like this place better for the price is right! And the service guys are pretty cool too! It is a Pho House and for what it is to what they serve is right on point in my opinion. It's not an upscale restaurant downtown. I will be coming back when I get a craving for Pho! Keep up the cute smiles, and great Pho!! Happy Eating!!"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious! Good place to try something new and be pleased. The boba was probably the best I've had and I'm a bit of a boba snob"}
{"text":"It's so yummy! I love this place we order 2-3 times a week. I love their spring ring rolls and egg rolls. Vegetables are fresh and really like the broth in the pho. I will keep returning."}
{"text":"Great food and even greater people :)
Pho is delicious and savory!
Taro boba is perfect!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Pho restaurant down the street from this one but I found this on Yelp, so I decided to try it. I got the menu off Yelp and phoned in an order for pick up. From phoning in the order and picking up was about 20/25 minutes, not bad at all. I ordered Pho Tai, Chin (spelling error probably) and an order of spring rolls (well I said 2 orders, meaning 4 but they assumed I meant 2 spring rolls aka 1 order. I should have made it more clear but it's ok)

The pho tai was pretty tasty, a bit on the salty side for me, but the broth was very flavorful. It came with the usual toppings, steak and brisket along with the cilantro, onions, jalapeño, and etc. 

The 3 star rating is basically for the quality of the spring rolls. As I am a huge spring roll person, this can make it or break it for me with your establishment. The spring rolls were subpar. It had WAYYY to much lettuce in it. And it only had 3 half cut shrimps, usually it's always 4 at other places I've been to. The peanut sauce wasn't really that good either. It was really sweet and besides the actual peanut bits, really didn't have much peanut taste. The rolls were very bland and didn't have much taste besides the lettuce taste. I basically dosed it with Siracha sauce. 

From what I saw, when picking up the order, it was very clean and the decor was very modern. I'll likely give this place another try but will probably not be ordering the spring rolls."}
{"text":"We love Vietnamese food. And whenever we have an inkling of a new place opening up, we endeavor to visit it just to see if it lives up to the hype.

Unfortunately, this place was mildly disappointing.

Although, it is more modern and cleaner than most; the food is surprisingly mediocre.

Normally, we have an expectation that Vietnamese food would some type of \"kick\" to it in that the flavors would just permeate our senses. These dishes were quite bland, by our standards, and through our extensive experience.

My beloved wife ordered the stew, and it was definitely not what she was expecting. The meat was quite bland, and the sauce was not as rich as she was accustomed to. In fact, the sauce seemed so watered down.

I had my typical meat and friend egg dish, and it's flavor was so neutered; I had to look twice and verify that this was actually a Vietnamese restaurant and not some type of hybrid fusion cornucopia of asian cuisine that I was unfamiliar with.

Then there was the shrimp crepe. Totally disappointing. The shrimp inside was not flavorful, and the egg crepe wrapper tasted like and had the consistency of paper.

The only redeeming factor about this place was it's atmosphere, and their service. The vegetables were not bad either. They were quite fresh.

We will probably meander again this way some time in the near future to see if we, perhaps, caught them in an off day. For now, the review stands based on our recent experience."}
{"text":"In my 20 years of experience with Asian cuisine, specifically authentic Vietnamese food, I have to say that the food here is very good! I highly recommend the pho and Thai milk tea. Hands down the best I've had."}
{"text":"The day after arriving I needed some pho to survive. It was a very trying day before making it down south there was kayaking and traveling. The day after required beef pho and egg rolls to go. Arrived at restaurant food was ready cruised back home for sunset snack time it was good will do it again in the future. The location is close to the freeway also a plus..."}
{"text":"The pho is only so so. The Dac Biet version had very little of all the meats it's supposed to have in it."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant twice, the first visit was great! Trying pho for the first time, I was a little nervous but it was definitely worth it! Very tasty! I also tried their egg rolls which were delicious! The only reason I am giving them three stars is because their customer wasn't very great. They don't check on you often after bringing you your food. Definitely going back because of the food."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Pho! The food is great and the staff is very friendly. They have the best egg rolls around!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Pho Broth on the west side. I grew up on Pho since my family are Chinese-Vietnamese immigrants and this one is closest to what I'm used to. My coworkers and I do Phomondays and we all love this place the most. I can't really comment on any other food products there because I don't go here for any other reason than the Pho. The Broth is very savory amd deep in flavor. It comes out hot and in huge servings.

Pho House is inexpensive amd a large bowl cost like 8 bucks. The Pho House is clean and the wait staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Walked in craving PHo and place was a disaster with dirty tables and no service at 6pm and 3 tables occupied in restaurant. Turned around after being seated with no service and walked out"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least once a week. The staff is super friendly and recognizes us every time. The pho is amazing and always tastes fresh, as well as the spring rolls. Also the Thai tea here can't be beat. We absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"solid Pho for a solid price, my better half and i very much enjoyed the warm and welcoming staff. We both had the #4 beef pho, she ordered hers with veggies. We thought the portions were fair, and the quality was great. we'll be back."}
{"text":"The rice was dry like it was two days old and the \"red rice\" which is an actual dish was just fried rice. The food was also badly burned."}
{"text":"Good Place For a Quick Lunch

Since we were shopping at Frys Market Place next door at lunchtime, we decided to give Pho House a try and we were glad we did .  

On this visit to Pho House we decided to share an order of egg rolls and combination fried rice. The eggrolls were hot, fresh, crispy and expertly prepared, the eggrolls were absolutely delicious.  I wish I could say the same about the fried rice. The combination fried rice had chicken, pork, beef, and shrimp. In my opinion,  the fried rice was just ok. The fried rice was mostly chicken; which I did not really care for.  However the shrimp and pork had a nice taste. I think next time I will request to have the chicken omitted.

Our first time at Pho House we were pleasantly surprised as it was better than we expected. The food, while not gourmet or great was tasty and the staff was pleasant. Good place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"So good! Went here yesterday, way better then PT noodles down the street! Can't wait to go again the best Pho I've had since I moved from Hawaii. Hope they get more seafood options in the future."}
{"text":"I loved the food,service was great. It was my first time there and the waitress was very helpful. She explaining what each dish was even though it was close to closing, but the best part was that my girls loved the food also."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for pho on the west side. I always get the egg noodle special which is very flavorable.  The staffs are all super friendly and  nice.  They bring the food out in a fast reasonable time as well.  I also love their milk tea here which they do have a boba menu and various tea flavors as well."}
{"text":"Loved it! We were looking for a dinner option that was not a giant chain and this was one of the few options. The meal was delicious! We enjoyed Pho and one of the daily specials for our meal and bubble tea. For appetizers we appreciated both the spring rolls and sausage roll. Tasty, filling, inexpensive - a good choice for a meal in Good Year."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho.  We had shrimp bowl and bowl with shrimp, pork, and quail eggs.  It was our first time to eat at a Pho Restaurant and we will definitely go back.  Very nice personnel."}
{"text":"Just found this place close to where we live and its pretty good. Both times I've went there I was greeted promptly. They were pretty quick with the orders even though they were kinda busy. The prices are reasonable and they had pretty good portions on the entrees. The place was spotlessly clean. All their waiters and waitresses can speak Vietnamese and English so its easy to communicate either way. I had a big order so the young waiter was nice enough to offer to help me carry it out to my car. Anyone who wants to try some Asian food should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Pho & Sandwiches are delicious!!! My favorite Pho place in the West valley. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great affordable pho had the #17 also was tasty but not worth the price. The banh mi sandwich could use more pork but was tasty. Will come Be back for pho only"}
{"text":"What a disaster. Service terrible, my wife hated her food I had what was supposed to be filet mignon but was definitely JAVELINA meat. When we told them there was a problem they demanded we pay for everything and leave. Avoid and go to Del Taco instead."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town. They are always very friendly & the food is amazing! Today we got there 16min before closing time & they were still very friendly. Not only is the food very tasty but it is affordable. I really recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"WARNING!! I was heard this place was good but I was so so disappointed and upset after trying it. I went with a group of 8 friends here, although my food was average, two of my friends got some type of chicken stir fry dish. The chicken in the dish was spoiled and had a rotting smell! And I know for a fact the smell was not from any sauce or spice, it was just plain spoiled chicken! The waitress was informed and removed it from the bill but I think I should of called the county health inspector. And we took my 2 friends to a urgent care for a per-caution for food poisoning and both later did vomit the food up. Obviously I will never return here and WARN others."}
{"text":"Great tasting, delicious and clean pho! Definitely a favorite, moving forward! We have bee here four times now and each time the service was sublime!"}
{"text":"Great service and really good food. Also, to me it was very inexpensive.It seems to be a pretty popular place. At 11:30 on a Saturday the place was 3/4 full. I had a chicken/noodle bowl (sorry I don't remember the Vietnamese name of it) and it was excellent. Perfectly cooked and everything tasted so fresh. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"No service I never going again the pho no favorites just add a lot msg I don't like that"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The pho is delicious and the service is excellent! Added bonus they are close by! Everything is so tasty! I usually come once or twice a week for dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty! Restaurant is clean and staff is very friendly! Will definitely return and will now be my go to place for Vietnamese food in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, 30 mins before they closed.  It was a cold night and needed something to warm me up.  The place is clean and shiny new.  The selection is a little limited compared to the other pho places that I go.  I ordered the #5 beef pho noodles.  It was good, not too shabby of a soup base either.  Coming back to try the other items!"}
{"text":"Wow,wow,wow!!!! Originally from Los Angeles where there are tons of really good pho places to eat.I moved to the west side (buckeye) a year ago ,and have not been able to find a good pho place. I had gone to PT noddles in Goodyear,but
Unfortunately it wasn't that good(sorry). Found this place and talk to the guy at the counter...he said they were only 3 months old...Wow,the food was super good..a lot of noodles and the meat was super good..very clean and friendly establishment...They got themselves a new returning customer for life!!!would definitely recommend to my friends!!A++"}
{"text":"Ordered pho and egg rolls. Pho was ok. More grease than I cared for. They used to have this really bad sewage smell but they got rid of them so it's a lot more pleasant to actually sit in. Maybe next time I'll try to dine in and see how their food is"}
{"text":"My family and I came here before my grandma moved to another state. My grandma's from Vietnam and she's very very picky with Vietnamese food; however, she was soooooo happy with the food. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited this place for a late dinner. We arrived around 8:30pm. Ordered Pho Ga to share and egg rolls. The pho broth was very tasty. All the fixings (ie. basil, sprouts, lime) were very fresh. The chicken had a funny taste to it, which both of us noticed. We just set it aside and had the broth and noodles. The egg rolls were freshly made and tasty as was the dipping sauce. 

The place itself was very clean and the service was quite pleasant. All in all, a good experience. Would have given it a higher rating had it not been for the funny tasting chicken."}
{"text":"Great new spot for pho in the west valley! Food is delicious and service is great. Good option to dine in or take out. I've been recommending it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Even though the food is okay. But the customer service is really really suck. I would definitely come back if the customer service gets improve but I don't think they will. So new restaurant on the way."}
{"text":"Probably one of our worst dining experiences ever! We should've walked out after noticing a weird smell in there! Very, very unfriendly and who gives a glass of water without ice?? They became rude when I asked to alter my dish and when it came out, it was nothing like what I had asked for! My husbands meat in his dish was tough, inedible and undercooked as well! Pass by this unwelcoming to Americans disaster zone!! Take the drive to Scottsdale and go to the Slanted Rice!"}
{"text":"The Pho was fantastic. The spring rolls also excellent. I had a large bowl of Pho ($7) iced tea ($1) and spring rolls ($3). Seriously amazing food for cheap. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well, I am back.
And it will definitely be my and my family and friend's last time back. 

A whoppin' one star! Here's why:
1. Their pho is still good. Not my favorite, but it's still good. Our server was a nice guy. 
2. We order a flat noodle stir fry dish -- so greasy and 60% of it was white onions, not noodles. Did we order a plate of onions with some noodles and shrimp in it??? Plus, our order was placed wrong in the first place, so we had to wait again for the correct order. Our server was apologetic, so that's fine. 
3. I ordered thai tea, but they were out of half & half, for about another 20-30 minutes. You want to wait? Yeah, sure. Half&half gets delivered....eventually, our server remembers and asks if I still want thai tea. Yes, please. Never got it. But I ended up somewhere else after to fix my craving, and I'm super glad I went somewhere else to splurge my money. 
4. Substituted two orders of pho that had eye round steak for beef meatballs in one and tripe in the other. Got charged extra because they said beef meatballs and beef tripe are each worth more than eye round steak. 
First of all, if a bowl of pho w/ steak is $6.99, and a bowl of pho w/ meatballs is $6.99, how is one worth more than the other? Second, TRIPE IS WORTH MORE THAN STEAK?! I know no one besides my father that would want tripe over steak. Third, our server said he would ask if I can substitute and let me know, but he never let me know. Fourth, I eat A LOT of pho everywhere, no joke, and I have never ever had to pay extra. But then again, all the places I go to actually have a menu item that has brisket and meatball. And guess what, it's the same price as all the other pho bowls w/ two meats. 
Anyways, super irritated that the owner argued with me that meatballs and tripe are each worth more than steak, hence they have to charge to make up the difference. Please. 
5. I guess last time I went the bowls were $6, now it's $7. 
6. The spring rolls -- meh. It had so much lettuce in there, and the peanut sauce was very watery. I've had much better spring rolls. 
7. It's still a nice and clean restaurant. 

Anyways, at least now I can narrow down my pho choices a little easier!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Most Likely will be coming back. Price is very good. Nothing to crazy or expansive very simple and basic menu. The service was very good for a Vietnamese restaurant. They checked on us every now and then and refilled our water that something you don't normally get at other ones. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best Pho W of 1-17! I've been to almost all of the Pho restaurants in the valley. This one is on my top 3 definitely."}
{"text":"Outstandingly fresh ingredients and clean flavors! I would gladly eat here every day if my pocketbook allowed it."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying Pho. It was pretty good! It would've been nice to have an explaination of what sauce does what but over all I'd try it again."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strip mall but it is a great find. The chicken pho is absolutely delicious as well as the spring rolls. The dining area was clean with a self service drink station. I will go back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! My nail guy recommended this place I'm so glad he did! It was clean place we ordered the bun thit noung with shrimp n egg roll was delish!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was very clean, very friendly, and very quick and the food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Maybe even great prices!!  We had spring rolls and the Pho which we had seen and heard about forever but never eaten ourselves.  Everything was very good.  I would definitely visit again to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pho! I go here every time. They are always very polite and never get our order wrong. This place is very clean and nice."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome sauce!!!!!!!! I go there everyday because it is just that amazing :) hands down best food in the area!"}
{"text":"Best food I got while in the Goodyear area! Was in town for spring training and the area is mostly mediocre chain restaurants. This rose well above the level in the area despite being in an unassuming location. The bowl of pho was a very generous portion. Everything was very fresh and the space is very clean. Also got spring rolls which were very good. Server was helpful and attentive. Break out of the boring big chains and try this place!"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times so far. The place is clean and very cliche for a Vietnamese restaruant with cheesy Vietnamese singers doing covers of American songs. The place is clean and very bright. I've read some of the reviews about people saying that they have the best broth around. This was my biggest complaint of my Pho, it was really tasteless and left a lot to be desired. It didn't have a strong beefy flavor or any hints of star anise or cinnamon instead it was very plain. Thank God they had Nuoc Beo Hahn Tran. I tried the Bun Bo Hue, which is my second favorite Vietnamese dish, it was good. The broth was a lot more flavorful and the blood cake and pork were good.

The prices are right here... Some of the trendier Pho places are asking for over $8 for a bowl of Pho, here you can get one for a little over $6.

With the 2 other choices within a mile of this place, the owners really set themselves apart from them by creating a bigger, cleaner, cheaper product which is almost on par taste wise."}
{"text":"Good. Right down the street from our house. The egg rolls are really good! Their pho is good too. Good portions. Only reason that I'm giving 4 starts instead of five is that the pho broth could have a lil more flavor."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for an early dinner on my way home from work. Since it was around 4pm it was pretty empty inside. The employees were all sitting around. I was seated quickly and ordered the chicken Pho. Service from my original waiter was not so great, but a few of the girls working came by often to make sure I was taken care of. The food was amazing. I just wish my waiter that originally took my ordered would have acted like he cared for the business considering how slow it was when I walked in."}
{"text":"If u want some good Vietnamese pho that is close in the goodyear area, come here. They actually have a lot of other good food too. I ate the mi dac biet and their com chien and they were sooooOOoOoO gooooooooood. I would definitely come back. Nice service. Friendly. Clean."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We had a little of everything, a pho, spring rolls and a chicken dish. It was all really fresh. We would definitely go back"}
{"text":"The service is pleasant with young staff that is polite and helpful.  The food itself is above average, but sometimes are inconsistent.  It would be the best place if some improvements for the dishes."}
{"text":"Good pho, not the best from what I have had in Arizona but I will say it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good food, wait staff friendly and attentive, very clean, and always fresh! if you like Pho  this would be a must try place..."}
{"text":"Great portion and soup was awesome! New favorite spot for my pho and other vietnamese dish!"}
{"text":"Solid Pho. Very sparing on the veggies and dipping sauce for my egg rolls...just okay"}
{"text":"Best pho in the West valley for sure.. also have had the spring rolls and the bahn mi both are really good to and servers are very friendly"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was bomb. Ordered the Special egg noodle soup. But my all time favorite was the milk tea boba drink!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Ph Thành Restaurant at 17th Avenue and Camelback Rd.  I've tried several different restaurants that serve Pho in the west valley, but most of them were \"meh\" until I tried the Pho House.  Very similar tasting Pho and I'm a fan.   I visit them several times a month and it's great because it's much closer to where I live.  Staff are very nice and courteous.  Sometimes they can become a little overwhelmed during peak times, but not a major issue for me.  If you like chili oil, they have it; it's not on the table, just ask for it."}
{"text":"We just moved to Arizona from Texas and this by far is the BEST pho we've had in Arizona. The beef broth was delicious!  The wait staff was incredibly polite and the atmosphere was clean and refreshing. We will definitely come here again. PT Noodles has nothing on this place."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho, nothing special but I'd go here rather than PT noodles on the other side of Litchfield Rd which charges 30% more for same sized portions.  This place is also clean, huge and spacious!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Pho soup is amazing for starters but if you don't like the soup they have plenty of options!! They have AMAZING egg rolls it's a MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere the staff is always very courteous when you walk in. The food is very good and it's a great price I will continue going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Walked in to look at menu for vegetarian options. Only 2 dishes available. Honestly that was fine because we wouldn't have eaten there. I do try to give the \"hole in the wall\" places a chance but the place smelled horrible. I gave a one star because the hostess was very kind and directed me to another place with better vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the genuine friendliness of the staff, and how comparably clean the restaurant was an hour before closing.

The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Pho real some of the best pho I've had in a while. The waitstaff was kind and attentive the entire time and our food was brought out fairly quickly.

The atmosphere was a little dated, however everything was clean and reflected the relaxed and home style cooking of the pho. 


Any time it rains or I need comfort food I'll be back because it was pho-king delicious... that's all the puns I'll make."}
{"text":"First time eating there and I loved it. The soup was a little hard on clove and ginger but tummy still.loved loved the spring rolls! Definitely eating there again"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho Tom.  Will come again, can't go wrong with this place.  Service was excellent, establishments was clean."}
{"text":"The place is nice, clean, and spacious, however the food is mediocre. I got the Pho Tai and egg rolls. The egg rolls were really good with fresh and crispy lettuce and herbs, but the Pho broth was very disappointing. It lacked flavor and richness that your looking for in a bowl of soup. It did have a ton of noodles, but I left quite a bit since I wasn't a fan of the bland broth. I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Good location, good menu, good food.

This establishment has filled a void in the West Valley: a modern Vietnamese restaurant off the i-10.  I really enjoy the simplified menu.  It makes it easy to choose what you want to try compared to others that'll make you flip the menu 5 times over, and easily covers most of what you will find in a Vietnamese restaurant.  One exception is the dac biet section where I think there should be some more offering.  However, there's a chalkboard at the entrance that has more dac biet offerings that everyone should take a look at.  In fact, I think these items should be permanently affixed to the menu (e.g. banh canh, hu tieu bo kho) with a rotation of limited things on the board.  Please take a look at chalkboard and give it a try - it's really good.

I would love to see chao, bo ne, and canh chua in the future.  How about putting these on the chalkboard?  I'm sure it'll be good.

I wished the cha gio, goi cuon, and nem nuong cuon could be priced lower.  It seemed a little off putting.  Everything else priced on the menu though is spot on (don't ever change it!)

The Pho is the best in town.

Oh yeah, pay at the front after your meal regardless if you get a bill ticket or not.  It's customary for vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"I love how this place looks! I feel like I'm in a pho restaurant in California! 

I ordered the Mi Xao and Banh Xeo.. The food was was average.

Customer service wise, our sever forgot my friends order so he sat there while we all ate our food haha."}
{"text":"Good authentic pho! The rice dish was also quite good, service was fast and friendly. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice clean and friendly place to go for great Pho, service was so prompt and the food came out very fast. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho restaurant on the west side. The restaurant is so clean and the wait staff are genuinely friendly. The pho and the bun bo hue are also on point with their flavors. The ca phe sua da isn't served the traditional way with the little filter, but it comes out perfectly blended with the right amount of condensed milk."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had in Phoenix. My husband had grilled chicken, which was also delicious. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First time coming to this new place. We were excited to try it, however we ended up EXTREMELY disappointed. We were taken to a table and given water, then COMPLETELY IGNORED for approximately 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order. (There were 4 others in the restaurant at the time). We ordered the shrimp Pho soup and Special Entrée that had flat rice noodles, with chicken, beef, or pork. The shrimp soup was mediocre and the Special Entrée was \"special\" alright! It had pieces of liver and some sort of mixed mystery meat. The ingredients listed on the menu did not reflect what we expected to get. After inquiring with the staff, we were told that the cooks assume everyone that orders is Vietnamese and Vietnamese people like those ingredients. Also, we were NEVER checked on throughout our entire meal. We had to get up from our table to find napkins, and sat there with empty water glasses.  We had to literally go get someone to get us a take home box. We will NEVER return to this place...enter only if you want horrible service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"My favorite part of pho is the broth. I could drink that all day and not even miss the noodles or meat/veggies. This place has some of best broth I've ever had. The noodles and meat (we ordered Pho Tai) were good too!"}
{"text":"Great Pho House but they need more wait staff. The two people they do have are way too overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I think they changed ownership. This was the worst experience never coming back always order seafood pho with egg noodles and when I got the Pho broth tasted horrible. It was such a bad experience and we have been coming since they opened."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend, lucky to find this place. I will tell my local friends about it. Friendly service, delicious pho and it was super fast. Free wifi too."}
{"text":"This is a nice place. We have eaten here numerous times. Staff is very friendly and take good care you for service. Food is pretty. They obviously specialize in Pho. Flavors are on point and very satisfying. We will continue to visit here."}
{"text":"Great service and the fast serving. I came in on my own to try some bon bu hue and their egg rolls. I really liked their egg rolls and I think their Bon bu hue is pretty decent and tasty. I won't consider it as the best I've had but it's decent enough for my cravings. My friend raves about this place so would recommend it for a good place to go considering the limited options in the West side"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. We are always greeted nicely by everyone. I always get the chicken pho and my husband gets the beef pho. Their jasmine green tea is my favorite!

Now, I will admit that there are days when the pho tastes a lot better than others but there hasn't been a day when we've been disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean restaurant. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. They try very hard to accommodate you, especially with special orders. My only complaint was that the actual soup wasn't very hot and was tasteless. I had the number one with beef, tendon, etc and the beef was chewy and thin. The tendon was good, but the actual soup was tasteless. It had no flavor. Great prices, very reasonable and the serving sizes were enormous."}
