{"text":"Oh my goodness, this was very delicious. It's small, there's a little bit of seating and it reminds you of a taco stand. The food comes in massive servings of very deliciousness. I've never heard of super fries, who thinks of retried beans on carne Asada fries?? The burrito had to be 12 inches. I couldn't finish it. Even my baby loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing! For 5.80$ I received the biggest and best constructed burrito. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is fine. The only thing I would recommend never ordering is anything with 'cabeza' in it. I love cabeza, but theirs is salty as hell. Completely inedible.  Also, every time I go there things seem to  have a different price(and I'm not talking about the menu prices, I'm talking about the amount charged). The owner should probably watch his employees closely."}
{"text":"Looked like a mom and pop place. Tried it for the first time and it was good Mexican food. I had a beef torta and bean and cheese burrito. Price is cheap and reasonable."}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh. Staff is friendly, and really knows the menu. Nice burnt chili taco sauce. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, good, fast Mexican food. Might be out of the way, but it's worth a trip over. Tons of specials, and variety. Burritos, tacos, menudo on the weekends, shrimp cocktails, etc. The homemade horchata is worth the drive alone!"}
