{"text":"Hands down the best juice bar in Montreal. Their cold pressed juices are freaking delicous and always give me a great energy boost during the day (try the liquid gold, it lives up to it's name). Everything is organic and you can taste it. Their energy balls are pretty good as well. If you're feeling brave I recomend going for a ginger shot, though that's certainly not for everybody.  Keep up the awesome work, so glad you guys brought cold press to Montreal."}
{"text":"Had a super craving for smoothie this afternoon and found this place right next to my department! I had a Açaí bowl with chia seeds ($0.5 extra) and almond butter ($1.0 extra). The whole thing comes up to $12 something which is cheap! The bowl tastes great and I really like the almond butter. The address listed is a bit mislead because the entrance is actually on President Kennedy. :)"}
{"text":"Clean and trendy decor, fun menu, and delicious smoothies/juices! Staff was very friendly and will definitely return soon! (Also, they are super eco friendly and have the cute paper turtle straws!)"}
