{"text":"Nice to have food court options that are not fast food. Had the Super Bowl with chicken and quinoa. Good but not a great value at $12.99. Service was not great although not any worse than what one might expect at a food court."}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever had at a food court.  I ordered the lobster with brie fontina and spinach.  Now I know I'm not getting a whole lobster tail in this sandwich for $11, so I know what to expect.  
It comes with two sides, I choose the sauteed bokchoy, onions and carrots and the strawberry spinach salad with tangerine balsamic dressing.  The helpings were very generous.  My friend ordered the Veg sandwich and requested chicken on it, not a problem.  We get two triple chocolate mousse desserts and  2 san pelligrinos.  I believe after tax it was $35 ish.

I don't spend a lot of time in malls but should I go back to Yorkdale I'd definitely get a lunch there again.  Was really pleased that I got a lovely fresh lunch and two big thumbs up to the employee who suggested the salad dressing, great choice.

Other options for sides were little roasted potatoes, fresh sauteed veg, couscous salad , pasta salad and a regular green salad with tomato and cucumber.

I would suggest they put a little layer of plastic film on top of the desserts so they don't dry out"}
{"text":"This is a sister store of Pickle Barrel, I'd wanted to try it on my previous visit to the food court, but I was hesistant since the main thing about this place is grilled cheese.  

I get it, grilled cheese, I make it at home and I've yet to find a place that makes a really good grilled cheese that's worthy of my hard earned money (I'm not a fan of homemade cooking, if it tastes like I could make it at home, I've spent too much).

While the food court is nice, I find the overall options to be lack luster.  Nothing really fancing calls out to me.  I decided to take a bite and go to Glow Press.  Then there was the problem of deciding to get the regular grilled cheese $7 includes 2 sides, or get a 'gourmet grilled cheese'.  I don't like saucy sandwiches...and I asked the girl for her opinon and expressed my reluctance to try something new.  \"Be adventurous\" She said, and I bit.  I got the \"So Cali\", chicken, red peppers, avocado, monteray Jack cheese, Chipotle sauce on twelve grain bread\".  It's one of Rose Reisman's 'healthy choices'.  

I should have known better, it never pays to be a risk taker.  I noticed the person ahead of me had her sandwich to go, and the box was quite large.  Ok I thought, this is going to be good.  I was wrong.  I got mine to eat there and I got a small sized sandwich (not much bigger than the bread you get from the grocery store) There wasn't much cheese action I'll tell you that and when I mean action, I mean taking a bit and the cheese gets so cheesy that you have to pull your head way back and push the sandwich away to stop the cheesy goodness.  

Not a bad sandwich but not a great one.  Would I go back?  Not for that.  They also have lobster mac n' cheese, and while I am tempted I think I should probaby try making it myself at home instead *Hint: I've never made it before.

They've got some cute mini desserts but at 3.49 for what is literally a big giant scoop of cheese cake or mousse I think I'll pass.  Ah, what am I saying', I'll bite again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My fav so far is the San Fran grilled cheese. What I like about this place is you can get 2 relatively healthy sides to go with your grilled cheese. I usually get the strawberry spinach salad with the tangerine balsamic vinegrette (tastes like gummy bears when combined) and the couscous.  I just wish the sandwich was larger."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why the reviews for this eatery are so bad!  I found the food here decent and a lot better than the other choices at the Yorkdale food court.

We actually stayed at a hotel right by Yorkdale so before heading off to our meetings everyday, we would stop by the food court for a quick lunch.  I must have ate at Glow Press at least four times and I honestly have to say that their food was better than the majority of the other eateries at Yorkdale!

As mentioned in other reviews, a good grilled cheese sandwich is very simple to make, but I felt that the sides were actually the stars of the show.  I actually just ordered a few sides to go one afternoon as a snack and I really enjoyed them for the price!  I pretty much always ordered the roasted potatoes and vegetables as my sides and the staff there would always give me a generous helping of each."}
