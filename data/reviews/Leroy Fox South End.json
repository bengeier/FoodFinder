{"text":"We tried this place out on Sunday 1/28 and the menu sounded delicious but the food was only average. We got the fried chicken and the grilled blackened chicken. I will say the fried chicken with the seasoning on the breading was excellent. I would recommend this dish. The pimento cheese and pita appetizers were also excellent. However,  that is when things became average. The grilled blackened chicken was ok but I could have made that at home. The mac and cheese would have been amazing had the chef not dumped a full salt shaker into the cheese sauce. The green bean casserole was not impressive and would not recommend. The corn bread had great flavor but was dry. Overall this is a cool spot but I don't think I would go back for the food. Hanging out with some drinks would be good but would not return for dinner"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Drinks were amazing and our server was great. Love the spot, except they have terrible music. If the music was better, I'd give this place a 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. We ordered the salmon and chicken fried chicken. We also had the mac n cheese which seems to be heaven sent. I am excited to come back try more things on the menu. The atmosphere is amazing with beautiful decor and a very relaxing vibe. I love how there is a open design concept for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness. This place is amazing - from the atmosphere to the food!! Get as much food as you can, and then take home what you can't eat because it's still so good as leftovers. Only downfall was slow service but it's a brand new place so hopefully that will iron itself out!"}
{"text":"First time at this location and I know they are new but service wasn't great.  I've been to the Cotswolds location and been pleased with their service but not the case with this location.  We were a party of 3 that came in for drinks, a dark and stormy was ordered and should of know when the server looked a little confused with the drink order that we should of stuck to the cocktail menu.  The dark and stormy that was brought to the table looked pretty but the taste was horrible.  They had used Meyer rum over goslings which as a rum drinker made a big difference to the drink and it just sat at the table with the ice melting in it.  Our server never cleared our table and didn't ask about the drink which just soured the experience and we were charged for the drink.  But the cocktails we did order off the menu were good."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Leroy Fox in Cotswold. They have great food and good service. I expected the same at the South End location. First, our server brought two of us the wrong beers, which was fine because mistakes happen. Then I was brought a salad I did not order. I let them know which salad I ordered and the second time they brought out the wrong salad. At that point everyone at my table was halfway through their meal, so I just ate the second wrong salad. We were finishing up our meal and we actually planned on ordering dessert. Our server didn't even bother to stop and as he was walking by he said I will bring the check now, which we were not ready for yet. I was disappointed in the South End location."}
{"text":"Just ubered  here with friends for late lunch only to be told the kitchen was closed for an hour so they could \"catch up.\". Must be nice to be so busy you cannot give service all day.. oh, and there were 3 parties in the dining room. Managers all sitting at one table . Message to management: prepare for weekends! That's your bread and butter"}
{"text":"I tried their buffalo chicken sandwich with fried chicken. The food was really good! I would recommend you try the sweet potato tater tot's with any meal. My only complaint is the service was slow and they didn't seem to care much."}
{"text":"Eek - what a disappointment. I was so excited to try this restaurant after I saw what a cool atmosphere it has. I went in already thinking I would love it and left so utterly disappointed. 
I would still rank atmosphere a 5/5. 
Food, service, experience was all a 1/5. 
The food was just terrible. Nothing tasted good. Chicken tenders were honestly disgusting, the pretzel bites were 100% pulled from a freezer, the fried zucchini was nothing special and too big of slices to enjoy.
Our server was really trying but just failed all together. He was running around constantly but forgot our water and silverware numerous times.
The drink menu was fun and different but honestly just very overpriced.
Really bummed out."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I loved everything about it. The food was absolutely delicious. The waiter was awesome and always checked on us. Everyone in the Birthday party liked their food. I got the fried chicken, Brussels sprouts and cornbread. Hey were cooked to perfection. My friends loved the mac and cheese, shrimp wrap, beets salad and the wings. We definitely plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"This is a cute place near downtown Charlotte. We came around 3:30PM on a Saturday and got seated immediately. The service was not the greatest, which is the only reason they're not getting 5 stars. Our server disappeared for 30 minutes and seemed too busy. The food was REALLY good. I had the buffalo chicken salad and it was perfect. The buffalo vinaigrette was soooooo good. I loved this dish and I'll be back to get it again."}
{"text":"We loved it! Such a nice addition to the Southend.  We ate at the bar and sampled a lot.  It was all delicious. Bartenders are very friendly and attentive, the way we like them. Try it out. Doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes!  I have to say that I was not the biggest fan of the other location but tried this one at a friends urging.  It was very very good and love the atmosphere.  I will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I came to Leroy Fox South End when it first opened. There was mass confusion and our food took about an hour. I chalked it up to \"grand opening glitches\". Since I was in South End, I figured I would try again. BAD decision. We sat right away and then placed our order. We ordered a bottle of wine, pretzel bites and chicken wings. The server poured our wine without allowing a taste first. Our food was dropped off about a half hour later and our server said he would be right back with plates. Well, we never got plates nor did we see our server during our whole meal. Me and my date ate off the serving plate and had to put our chicken bones on the same plate. We were finished with our food and wine. We wanted some more wine, but we didn't see our server to order some more. After another 10 minutes, we asked for our check which was dropped off by the hostess. I am not one to complain, but I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and I expressed my disappointment. After he gave me 3 excuses and a half hearted \"sorry\" he walked away. This place needs a service makeover and lessons on customer service. There are way too many places to eat in the South End to deal with this. PS.. I have often eaten at the other Leroy Fox and have had great experiences every time."}
{"text":"One word...... delicious!!!! I literally went back to this place for the Brussel sprouts! They are absolutely amazing and taste just a great the next day. I could go on and on about those things. In addition to the Brussel sprouts I also tried the fried zucchini, fried green tomatoes, buffalo cauliflower, and the Salmon BLT. I promise I didn't have all of that myself. I shared lol. Needless to say, everything was amazing! Everything was seasoned and fried to perfection. The salmon was grilled perfectly. The food came out relatively fast and the waiter was extremely personable.
The one downside was it was very noisy inside and the music was loud, which made having conversations difficult. We did go on a Friday night so it may be quieter on a week day. My first visit I sat outside and noise wasn't an issue. 

Overall, if you don't try this place and love it, I'll question your taste buds lol"}
{"text":"Food just as good as the original location and vibe/atmosphere even better!  I am not even a vegetarian and the black bean burger was amazing!   Brussels sprouts are on point!  The owner really wants things done right and is there himself making sure it happens!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The manager Adam is the nicest person I've ever met, their food is so good. I had their fried shrimp and it tasted like a 5 star meal, and their Mac and cheese is to DIE for. But their cocktail menu is what gets me, they have so many amazing cocktails and the new plum one coming to the menu in April and the most delicious alcoholic beverage I've ever had in my life! Leroy Fox is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Leroy Fox is HANDS DOWN my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. My husband and I go here all the time - we can't stay away. We have yet to have a bad meal yet. Be warned - they get crowded on the weekends. What to get? The pretzel bites, zucchini fries, sweet caroline dip, pimento and egg (incredible) and nachos are a must.

Bottom line, you'll need to go here multiple times and try different things. It's all amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but it took 40+ minutes to get two sandwiches out to us. And when the check came, we didn't get anything off our check to make up for the lengthy wait. I thought for sure our round of beers would have been comped. We ended up having to inhale our food because we had somewhere to be. 

Not the first time I've experienced slow service there so it will be my last visit for sure."}
{"text":"If a place has wings on the menu, it is usually a great place to start because it tells you a lot. 

I am very particular about chicken wings. I get it...they are thought to be a simple menu item; therefore, also assumed as \"easy to prepare\". So, when I request crispy wings, I expect just that. The wings at Leroy Fox leave me majorly underwhelmed. I assume that this also has something to do with the fact that they showed up about five minutes after I ordered. Now, I'm no chef, but I can guarantee anyone that it takes more than 5 minutes to prepare crispy wings. I believe the wings were parboiled and finished on the grill. ALL the wrongs steps in my concept of a great wing. 

The cocktail saved this review. The \"For Whom the Berry Tolls\" cocktail is amazing. Made with tequila, basil, blackberry and jalapeño, it is a perfect blend of sweet and heat. I noticed that the bartenders take a lot of time and attention with the cocktails. For this reason, I may return...and will update this review per a different experience."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and great atmosphere! The drink was also incredible. I got the whole berry toll and it was delicious! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok- been to a lot of places in south end. I would recommend Leroy Fox over any other I can think of. We have been here 5 or 6 times varying from late lunch to a late dinner. They have excellent bartenders and management. Definitely stop in if you can. Custom drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"do. i. have. to. review. this.

Because, like Nikki, call me selfish, this is my Friday night date-spot, and we like to sit in the same chairs at the bar and now that everyone is finding out about it, I find us sitting a few away from our \"normal seats.\"

The cocktails are always strong and delicious, and they have a decent wine list BTG. 

I modify the salad to be gluten free and usually choose salmon.

My boyfriend loves the burger.

The wings are excellent, too and not breaded.

There are a few kinks behind the bar that need to be worked out with timing. I'd like to see one person dedicated to the well until like 9ish because they tend to get a bit slammed and service goes down. But all in all I think it will get worked out and the atmosphere/walking distance is enough to earn our consistent patronage--and 5 stars.

Cheers, y'all."}
{"text":"Just had Leroy Fox's for lunch. This was my first time here at their second (and new) location. I came for lunch around 12:45 and it wasn't crowded at all. This is a perfect spot for a meal, and literally one block from the East/West light rail station. 

I'm glad we picked this place. The atmosphere was great. We sat outside on their nice patio. Cool Charlotte-specific wall art, which I always appreciate. Music inside was good- good music makes the atmosphere 10x better in my opinion. The bar was clean and they have lots of TVs, so I'm sure this would be a great place to watch the Panthers. 

I got a buffalo chicken salad; my friend got the roasted beet salad. They were both excellent and a good size. Also- the sweet potato tots are probably the best in Charlotte. 

Our service was great, she was attentive and nice. 

I will start recommending Leroy Fox's in SE to my friends who live down here!"}
{"text":"Sat at bar as I was by myself.... and waited. Waited a while for attention from bartender. Waited a while for beer to be served. Waited a long time for food order to be placed. Then the food never arrived. Probably the slowest, longest bar dining experience ever."}
{"text":"Meh. After waiting for a very long time - long enough that we moved indoors as we got cold outside. I was expecting amazing food, and we got food that was good-enough. Slightly overcooked chicken tenders, cheesy grits where the cheese is lazily sprinkled on top, burger was solid but nothing amazing.  The drinks were appreciated by those who were drinking."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  I've been to Leroy Fox's Cotswold location, but this was my first visit to South End. 

With a group of 14, the wait staff managed to make is feel as if we are the only ones there. The dinner happened to be the same day as National Margarita Day !! The silver fox margarita was on the sweet side, but mellowed out once I added a squeezed lime. I will add that although I didn't taste the tequila in the drink (I'm a tequila snob), I felt it afterwards! 

Not particularly hungry, I ordered the chicken tenders. I know, I know not the most extravagant item on the menu, but oh well! They were hot and crispy! I added a wee bit of salt and was pleasantly content. The ranch dressing was a prefect pairing. The mustard sauce was a little pungent and took away from the flavor of the chicken tender. Thanks to KTs birthday, a local gent bought us a few shots and beers! It pays to have gorgeous friends! I'll definitely return to both locations and expand my palate."}
{"text":"Food is decent to above average, ambiance/ location are great but the service and speed ruin everything else.  First visit was slow with sub par service which I chased up to it still being new.  But After a second trip where a late lunch for two took close to 1.5 hours, not sure if I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, starting with Mixologist/bar manager Adam Gautreau! Made me one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. To help me avoid the debate of what delicious drink to order, Adam just said \"trust me\" and went to work. What he came back with blew my mind! It was a berry cocktail with a jalapeño ice cube and it absolutely rocked. While this place has so many amazing cocktails, if Adam is working, be sure to trust him too and he'll craft the perfect cocktail your taste buds are sure to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love love love the bartenders here! Adam Gautreau made our experience so fabulous. Drinks and apps and even lets us pick some tunes. Love this location of Leroy fox!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Zucchini appetizers were good and the honey chicken sandwich was great. We will be back. The dips for the zucchini fries are great. Buffalo blue cheese and ranch. The fried chicken dipped in buffalo honey is the best."}
{"text":"We waited 30 mins for our food order to be taken (waitress circled us 3 times during the 30mins), then 45 mins for our food to come out. Everyone around us got served before we did and people that got there after us got there orders taken before us. The waitress gave us no napkins or silverware until we asked for it. So disappointing! The front staff was awful! Had it not been for the chef/cook that came out and said our bill was on the house, this restaurant would have gotten 1 star because I can't give it 0. We were the only spanish/Latin group and the restaurant was not that busy. I'm not pulling the race card but it really makes you wonder. Awful service."}
{"text":"Love the new location in south end. The food is excellent just like the other location. This location does have a more bar style atmosphere.  Service was slightly off but expected with a new location. I do have one request though. Please remove the shelf over the urinal in the men's bathroom. I hit my head on it. I mentioned it to a waiter and they stated \"we have gotten a lot of complaints about that but they won't take it down.\"  You should listen to your customers."}
{"text":"Food was bomb, specially the Mac and cheese. There was a huge party before me and my date so it took a little bit for us to get service however the manager saw that we were waiting and he stepped right up and got our drinks in. After that the server was right on point with everything. Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"A total 180 from the Cotswold location. We came here for a birthday dinner and had the worst experience at a Leroy Fox to-date. 

The service was slow and unattentive (it was a slow Sunday night) and our food was delivered incorrectly. We ordered the salmon with honey glaze and was brought just the salmon. We informed them that this was incorrect and they brought out a cup of the honey glaze and was told: \"I know this is not what you ordered but here you go.\"

Needless to say, I'm probably never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Leroy Fox is southern home cooking with a cool modern blend. They have a long list of craft beer and a handful of cool cocktails. They food was all delicious! They have a great list of side items that were all definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"South end needed a place like this. Trendy atmosphere and a large bar inside that is great inside for watching sports. The staff were all super friendly and helpful. I ended up ordering the egg&pimento fried chicken sandwich with a side of mac&cheese--both really delicious, really filling, and priced just right. I ended up taking half my sandwich home for lunch the next day. The craft cocktails were a bit pricey ($14) but you can tell there's a lot of detail and care put into making them. I ordered a local beer (which was about $5). They do not serve brunch yet but I'm really hoping the do soon!"}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese I had today at Leroy fox makes up for how bad my meal was at eddie v's on Friday! Hands down best Mac and cheese I've ever had"}
{"text":"Despite the cute decor and hip vibe, I found Leroy Fox to be underwhelming due to the slow service. I came for dinner with a few coworkers around 7:30 pm on a Wednesday night. Our food finally arrived to our table at 8:25 pm. Overall, the food was decent (personal favorite was the brussel sprouts), but not remarkable enough to merit the wait time. There are plenty of similar dinner options all around Charlotte, so Leroy doesn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuum!!! All the ladies in my book club loved their food! And I certainly loved mine. 

Shout out to the chef who kicked his sweet potato tots up a notch and added some cinnamon and maybe a little sugar? Sweet potato tots are typically meh to me, but these joints were GOOD! My vegan brother couldn't stop munching on them from my plate. I almost popped his hand. 

My shrimp Po boy sandwich was also extremely good. The shrimp was fried perfectly with great flavor. Just the right amount of sauce, fresh lettuce and tomato. 

Definitely coming back to this joint. I was told about their fried chicken and I'll have to try that another day. Maybe the next restaurant outing I'll go there instead of my usual Futo Buta. 

Not a fan of the \"private\" room. It's an area with no door right near the bathrooms. Aside from the onlookers, Someone popped their head in offering a slurry comment about a party while we were in the midst of discussing the book we read. Yea, next time I need a private room, I'll try a different spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and to be honest, probably would have never stopped in myself. My friend and I were looking for a place to grab a drink and decided we didn't want to walk the mile and a half in our heels. We happened to be right outside of Leroy's and ducked in for a quick drink. To my surprise, this place is so cute! I love the decorations and the place is large, which also makes it hard to hear when it's busy. What I loved most is that they have a small private room that you can reserve for larger parties. It even comes with it's own tv's. I will definitely be reserving this room for future events and will also be back to get drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Had a great Friday night here! Really good music, great food, awesome atmosphere. Turner was our waiter, he was wonderful! We will be back:)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and cozy. 

My boy friend and I came here for a Sunday night dinner. It was a beautiful 75° night so we sat on the patio. It had lights hung above with wood furniture and TVs. They put on the Cavs playoff game for us CLE natives! We wanted some local NC beer so our waiter recommended the Juicy Jay which was very flavorful and light. I ordered the 1/4 North with a side of mac & cheese and my boy friend ordered the BBQ sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes and sausage gravy. Both were so good, especially the mac & cheese. The chicken was very crispy and the cheese was very cheesy.

This is a prefect place for a nice summer dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow! The food here is on point. First time going & my husband & I were impressed. I Ordered wings with the green bean casserole & it was delicious. My husband ordered the southern chicken sandwich & he was blabbing about it the next morning. The place is in a great location, but difficult to find their name on the building. Lucikly their opened patio helped out a lot. I loved how opened the resturant was & the fact that they had 90's music videos playing on a TV was a conversation in itself. Cant wait to go back & try other menu options.  Our server seemed overly busy & we didn't see her too much which was difficult when we needed something,  but she was sweet & took care of us when needed. Definitly recommended."}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed that my Brussels sprouts were undercooked and very hard, But the Fried chicken was excellent.

I will of course try Leroy Fox one more time, but at the other location and hope for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this restaurant, however, service was horrible. Upon arrival I was told it would be a 5 minuet wait to sit outside, as I'm waiting for over 20 minutes another group who came in after me was seated. When I went to ask how much longer the wait would be, the hostess got an attitude with me because she didn't put my name on the wait list. Once we were actually seated, it took the waitress 15 minuets to acknowledge us, and we waited for our food for over an hour. The manager apologized for our wait and covered our check so I appreciated that. Overall, even though the manager tried to rectified the situation, I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We stopped in to catch the cavs game and to grab a quick bite. There was a wait for a table so we sat at the bar. I ordered the wings and zucchini fries. As did the other two ladies I was with. We aren't from the area so I was looking forward to some great fried chicken.. and they delivered!! The bartender who took care of us was friendly, personable and overall great! The chicken was amazing, spicy and super juicy. I do wish the zucchini fries were a bit smaller. I only got 4 in an order and they were massive! Although delicious, smaller fries would've made for a better bite. I love the decor here! Kind of artsy meets rustic, the mural on the wall is amazing and I enjoyed the overall look. My drink was spicy and had an awesome ice sphere in it with jalapeños frozen inside! I  definitely return."}
{"text":"Rating this a 1 because we had little to no experience here. We walked in on a Saturday night at 9:00 and the hostess informed us that the kitchen was closed. \"Unfortunately tonight we're only serving drinks, someone called out and the tickets were really backed up so we just shut the kitchen down.\" After this short experience (walking in/right back out), and reading some other reviews, I­t­ seems as if the back of the house has some kinks to work out. Not sure if we will go back but if we do I'm hoping I can change this rating from a 1 to 5."}
{"text":"TL;DR Review

Pros:
- Great high quality, delicious food. Possibly Top 3 for Fried Chicken in Charlotte. The price is worth it. 
- Good space and chill vibe. The outside patio is good from happy hour and day drinking on a nice day out. The inside can accommodate large groups.
- It's located in South End in walking distance to mass transit, bars and other restaurants. You can even hoof it to Uptown, it's an easy trek.

Cons:
- Service is kinda eh. We sat at the bar and service was lacking at best."}
{"text":"I will never go to Leroy Fox SE again. This was our second time here and our experience was so bad it prompted me to write a review. Our first at the restaurant the appetizer didn't come out until after our meal. The manager came out and apologized and comped the app, which seemed appropriate. Second visit , we ordered an app and our meal at the same time. App came out no problem but we sat there for 40 minutes after the app came out and no meal. I mentioned something to the server and the management addressed by doing absolutely nothing. The Meal finally came out, mind you we ordered one entree and 2 sides, it was decent food but the wait was inexcusable. The table beside us had sat after us and had already finished their food and cashed out by the time we got ours. My guess is they don't really care about returning customers so I'll bring my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had door dash deliver the roasted beet salad made as a wrap. It was prepared perfectly and plentiful! The goat cheat and avocado made the flavors pop! I would highly recommend this dish as it exceeded my expectations, especially for a take out veggie wrap!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really good service. Appetizers and entrées are simple but good. Will definitely be back here. Bar is amazing plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the sweet potato tots is the great service and sick atmosphere  We sat at the bar and Tiffany was amazing!"}
{"text":"4.5! This restaurant was awesome. The decor was so well done, and we sat outside to enjoy the weather but I can see us hanging at the bar for a date night some time. For lunch I had the pimento/egg fried chicken sandwich and mashed potatoes with sausage gravy. OOoooo the mashed potatoes. I'm a snob and they were SO good. The sausage was very flavorful without being too salty. The sandwich was very tasty but I think the fried chicken would have been a bit bland and dry if it weren't for the toppings. I'll have to go back to double check that . My husband got the buffalo fried chicken sandwich and he said it was great as well. We can't wait to try more of the menu here."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of the zucchini fries !!!!! Also they have an amazing green bean casserole!"}
{"text":"Service was nice but all of the food was too spicy for us to eat. Normally love brussel sprouts but everyone at table agreed they were too spicy to eat. What a waste. Nachos were interesting with black eyed peas but also spicy. No reason to come back but band outside is what brought us in. They were great!"}
{"text":"You would notice the restaurant is a lot larger than it looks. Covering two blocks the restaurant gets more spacious as you go deeper inside. You would notice the rustic Victorian style chandelier and a mixed seating with sofas that look so laid back and informal that makes you feels like you are in someone's home. I love that they had a variety of seating options, the regular tables, high chairs toward the windows, sofas on one corner, high chair tables and bar stools and even booths! Believe me there is room for everybody! The waitress are awesome and extremely helpful! The menu is short and all southern! The fox Den Wings as starters were awesome - but as others have felt, they are a little smaller than your regular BWW. The Leroy's Favorite crispy chicken sandwich was alright but wished could have been more appetizing as it almost looked like your ChickFilA chicken. Thanked myself for not getting the grilled option which would have been even more bland! The sides are a die for! Choose any side and you won't regret ordering it - satisfies you with both quantity and taste! The prices are nominal and not to pricey. A definite pick for good ambience, great service and good food! Oh, wait, did I tell that there is live music too! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Leroy fox is a sweet place to hang. Good atmosphere and enjoyable place. The one in South End is right by the light rail and in a prime spot. The food is good! Some stuff could probably be done a little better but overall it's a good spot. They are best known for their chicken and I agree! Everything chicken wise I've had has been great. Bar menu also on point! Great spot!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot since it's close to our house. The pretzels are so so good! I always like to just get to those and have a few drinks. It's a good atmosphere. Not sure if they do anymore, but used to have a weekly special for sangria. Went last night for the sangria and after we ordered, the server came back and told us the bartender didn't know how to make it. Odd since there was a weekly special for it not too long ago, and also it's a very popular drink. Is there only one bartender? Can google not be used? We had to order something else. Was very disappointed in the service surrounding this."}
{"text":"Food was pretty delicious. The mac'n'cheese side was most notable. It was delicious but almost TOO cheesy! 

I had a Local brew by Sugar Creek that was refreshing and crisp. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich and the mac'n'cheese side and was unable to finish. The sandwich was good but needed a sauce to make it more moist. 

Service was slower than expected at 2:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon but the patio was nice for a warm fall day. I think we will return for the cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food and drinks, friendly service, and awesome atmosphere. Chicken wrap is sooo good. Crab cakes were delicious too, but tiny."}
{"text":"Don't order takeout. They tell you a time and don't process order until you show up. Which makes it pointless for you to call ahead"}
{"text":"Food was very good (especially the sweet potato tots) but BEWARE when ordering a drink not off of the cocktail menu.

I am not a huge fan of cocktails so I ordered a margarita. Signature cocktails were $12 so I figured a margarita would be less, because that is the case at every other place I've been in Charlotte if you order a basic drink that is not on the menu. Shame on me for not asking. Three margaritas and $50 later, I was pissed. Yes, these MARGARITAS WERE $17 EACH. Up until this point I had a great dinner and was excited to come back, now I don't think I ever will because this left a horrible taste in my mouth--literally and figuratively.

The consistency of the the drinks was almost as horrendous as the price. My first margarita came in a normal glass (like their water glasses) and tasted strong, but very good. The next two can in a martini type glass and honestly tasted like I was drinking straight tequila. I had to pour ice from my water into the drink to make it bearable. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather it be strong and grimace through it than drink straight mix, but there is a happy medium.

I could deal with inconsistency and poor tasting drinks if the price was right. But this is not Michelin-starred restaurant. We are not in NYC so it doesn't need NYC prices. NO BASIC MARGARITA SHOULD EVER COST $17."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to watch football.  Not too crowded, great food and drink choices, and never too crowded.  The service at the bar can be a bit slow - I suggest sitting at a table."}
{"text":"Decided on Leroy Fox due to its location and the fact that menu sounded good. Food was very good. All hot and tasty. Had Zucchini Fries, 1/2 North Homestyle Fried Chicken and shared Bread Pudding. Enjoyed all. My only negative was the wait time. This was early Sunday evening and it was mostly empty.  We all just drank the water served but they said twice they would bring out the 6th glass that was missing. Finally had to ask another server. Dinner seemed to take an excessively long time.   Also they plated something incorrectly but they did fix it quickly. 

I would give it another try just because of the food."}
{"text":"I met my daughter for lunch and unfortunately it was a bad day for this location. The service was awful. When we finally got a waitress she seemed annoyed that we complained about waiting, and she was a little snarky too. She took our orders without bothering to write anything down. Well, my order was wrong so I had to wait to get my tater tots, which were clearly sitting around since they were soggy and lukewarm. It took forever to get the bill. Everything was going wrong. My food overall was okay at best. I think my daughter thought hers was good. Fortunately, the manager was excellent at damage control, and genuinely nice about our bad experience, and gave us our meals on the house. It's for that reason alone that I'd try this place one more time."}
{"text":"I ate at this location with some of my bridesmaids yesterday after they found their dresses at Brideside.  We always ate at the one in Cotswold, but it's a bit out of the way. This one is amazing! It fits in with South End, is very hip and we had wonderful customer service along with amazing food! Will be coming here on a regular basis now that it's 5 minutes down the road. Check it out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch, and I must say I was very impressed. Service was solid, the decor is really nice and open. The drink menu looks great although I did not partake. The menu is pretty straightforward but I had to try the fried chicken. Being located down the street from the Coop, I thought it was pretty ballsy to open a place specializing in fried chicken but it was REALLY good. Like for real. Also had the brussel sprouts with bacon which were excellent and the grits were solid. Will definitely be back again for drinks."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken sandwich with brussels...portion size was super huge and food was outstanding!  Watch your head at the urinal as someone thought it was a good idea to install a full size shelf above which about took me down for the count!"}
{"text":"We came the day after their soft opening. Food was delicious. No specials at the time but I think that it will eventually happen. We came again on the next Sunday. Wings, pimento cheese and potato wedges are delicious. Staff is super friendly but as they just opened I would recommend to have patience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Such good comfort food!! I had the braised chicken with sweet potato tots and mashed potatoes. Chicken and sides all had great flavor! Also had a great drink selection with several cocktails to choose from. Gorgeous indoor and outdoor space. Great service."}
{"text":"I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that maybe because I was wearing a green army field jacket that perhaps they didn't see me standing inside their restaurant waiting to be seated. So I went to the restroom and when I returned my wife was still standing still not acknowledged (FYI she was not wearing a green field jacket) 

 I couldn't help but asking the bartenders/servers, \"excuse me, are you guys open\" in my most sarcastic tone possible and it went right over her empty little head. I asked for some menus because no one in the restaurant knows how to greet customers apparently. 

We took our own seats and studied the over priced menu for a few minutes before deciding we weren't giving our money to a restaurant like this. We grabbed our jackets and hit the exit! 

You'd think they'd make an effort to find out why two customers are walking out before even ordering, but that would be giving them too much credit. This place flat out SUCKS! And the staff is inattentive and lack customer service skills."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is amazing. Love the music, the food is great. My favorite is the Salmon Salad. So refreshing and their cocktails are pretty great too."}
{"text":"Our service here was TERRIBLE. When we arrived, my dad ordered a Manhattan. I feel like that is a pretty standard drink to order but the bartender didn't know how to make it and brought us the wrong thing. Once we explained how to make a Manhattan, the drink was good. However, I really feel like we shouldn't have had to walk a professional bartender through making a Manhattan. After we got our drinks, we went 25 minutes without seeing our waiter so we finally flagged down a different waiter to place our order. After finally placing our order, it took TWO HOURS for our food to come out. There was no apology and our waiter didn't even stop by in those two hours to give us an update on our food. The food was delicious, but it didn't make up for our terrible experience. If you look at all my other reviews, they are all 5-stars. I don't ever write bad reviews...but this experience warranted it."}
{"text":"When this spot opened up , I thought it was going to be a little too fancy for my tastes, but don't let the decor fool you . It is a very casual ambiance, even though the inside is what I would call romantic decor ....anywho, the food.

I order a buffalo chicken salad. Sounds basic, but it was anything but. It was fresh greens and vegetables , perfectly grilled chicken that came with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of buffalo vinaigrette ( very interesting twist on a vinaigrette). 

I wasn't impressed by my Georgia Tractor mule ( peach infused mule with real peaches ), but I'm willing to go back and make my way through the specialty cocktail menu possibly for brunch. Yes brunch! And I'd really like to check it out, because the patio is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This place has phenomenal food, excellent service, and a very nice atmosphere.  Tonight I had the bbob Nachos for an appetizer, the nachos were crisp and covered with fresh toppings. For my entree I had the chicken fried chicken with Mac and cheese along with sweet potato tots.  All the food was brilliant, it was so good I couldn't choose what part was my favorite.  I will definitely be back to explore more of the menu.  Thank you Leroy Fox for such a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister. Had a Kentucky mule and fish and chips. It was pretty good. It was Memorial Day weekend so it was pretty busy which led to the kitchen being backed up which meant our food took a while to get to the table.

It's a really nice spot with a patio seating area as well. Lots of TVs so it's great for the NBA Finals. Drinks are OK."}
{"text":"Great place went here for my birthday and everyone here was so nice. I had the zucchini fries they are delicious. I also had the chicken sandwich and the mac and chees which was also great. The owner was very nice also gave me and my friends a round of shots for my birthday I def will be returning here"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles with eggs...enjoyed the atmosphere as well. Made it just in time for brunch. The mimosas were good too."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Leroy Fox South End, I will certainly be going back. The restaurant has a great atmosphere perfect place to meet friends or a date night. While I only had drinks there the menu was extensive. The drink I had was the Quinn City Spotlight and if you don't like bitters it's worth getting just for the presentation I thought it was just a little over priced at $12.99 for a drink in a hall ball glass. The others I was with enjoyed their drinks as well. We got there early so the restaurant was not overly crowded and we were all able to enjoy each other's conversation. As the evening progressed it did get pretty loud and we had to yell to hear each other but it was a Friday night. The server was knowledgeable about the menu although a little slow to bring the drinks back to the table. The age range seemed to be about 25-40. The only real complaint that I was they had many TVs in the restaurant and they were all playing the same thing a little variety may be better . All in all I was very impressed with the atmosphere loved the foxes. I suggest you try it if your looking for a relaxed place to meet friends!"}
{"text":"Ok, I waited to try this place until I had a group of people because the atmosphere looked awesome and WOW! I wish I didn't wait...they had an awesome healthy berry something salad that I ate while I drooled over my boyfriend's chicken and dumplings. Both were delicious!! Service was amazing and the ambience was finally what I've been looking to recreate from my missed days in NY....great place to meetup with friends, thank goodness Leroy's made it to Southend!! We really needed it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the new location...love the decor and open feel to this location! Grabbed a drink and a bite at the bar- the bartenders are super nice and very knowledgeable. The pretzel bites are my go to fav!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking out the location for a weeknight dinner and left wondering what took me so long. The menu was simple and elegant with some classic options to warm the soul. Went with the grilled chicken, mashed potatoes (home made gravy was amazing) and bRussel sprouts (also cooked to perfection). Kudos to the entire staff for the great experience from the hostess to the check."}
{"text":"Delicious food and unique drinks! I love how every drink has a play on words for its name. Inside decor was very nice and the bathrooms were spotless. Their fried chicken is amazing and their honey mustard is so sweet and tangy. I got the \"wrinkle in thyme\" cocktail, I would recommend this drink! Overall great experience, we will be back."}
{"text":"We came from Miami to come to a friends wedding and came across this super cute southern restaurant. The food was amazing! We had fried chicken/green bean casserole & the shrimp and grits with the most amazing bread pudding dessert with a top of ice cream and it was to die for ! The server was very attentive and nice as well."}
{"text":"Came here not too long after they opened, and just like the other location, the sweet potato tots are dank! It's my favorite thing on the menu haha! 

The vibe is a little different here than at the other location though. It's a very open space with a patio that opens into the restaurant via a big garage door type window. We sat at a table inside near the bar and were seated right away on a Friday night which was nice. The space was slightly cramped with full tables all around us, but it didn't detract from the experience. There were also plenty of tvs, so it would be a great place to go on gameday.

I was trying to be healthy so I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad. I was very impressed with the size of it and I was so full that I barely finished it! The fried beets, avocados, and pickled red onions were plentiful on top of the bed of greens. 

Drink-wise, the boo and I started with their Cucumber Basil Lemonade , which we thought was very refreshing and just the right hint of sweetness. Wanting to try something else, we then ordered another drink, the Alexa, and were not enthused as it did not have much flavor. We told the waitress and she asked if we wanted to change it out for the lemonade again.. we agreed and she also comped us the drink!

The service was great and the food was plentiful. I'm excited to come back!"}
{"text":"on a great expedition to decide on a place to din(e), leroy fox was chosen. the shrimp wrap was scrumdiddl(yum)ptious"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! Ordered pimento cheese dip appetizer and southwestern salad, my fiancé got the chicken club wrap with sweet potato tots. Everything was delicious and came out in good time. Great selection of local beers on draft. Definitely will come here often being directly across the street."}
{"text":"Went this past Saturday for the 1st time.. I checked in for 2 got a text for confirmation.. then we noticed that other people were being sat down prior to us. so we went up to the hostess and we asked her what happened and first, she said that we weren't on the list then she realized that.  we were but she put me down for six people so after waiting for at least another 15 minutes we finally were able to sit down.  hostess didn't even bother to apologize. 
Waiter was very nice.. food was OK.. nothing that would make me want to go back.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with great location. I had the chicken pimento egg sandwich. The sweet potato tots were unexpectedly delicious with cinnamon and sugar. Great spot! Hope they start serving brunch soon."}
{"text":"Turner and the food will change your life in the best way possible. That's really all I need to say. 600 stars."}
{"text":"I tried it out because it was in a convienent location and was pleasantly surprised.  We were seated quickly and the service was great.  

The sweet potatoes tots are glorious! All of the food we had was good and I liked the ambience an could definitely see myself coming back for a date or a girls night."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour while tables were available and somehow they allowed a kid to come in and solicit bracelets while people were eating. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I'm sure the owner wouldn't be too happy with that. This is the second time we've had a bad experience here. The first time was with take out food. Probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"WOW! My husband and I came here for his birthday last week and we were very pleased with the experience. The atmosphere was a very nice open concept with bar seats facing the outdoor patio. We ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, the fried chicken, mac n cheese, and the sweet potato tots. The food got better with every bite and we cannot wait to go back and enjoy it again! So happy this is right in our back yard."}
{"text":"We live in south end and finally decided to check this place out.  Wow!!!  Chicken fried chicken was on point.  Get the sweet potato tots and Mac and cheese.  Didn't even have to ask for honey mustard with the tots.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Leroy Fox once, but have gotten take out several times. Each time was great. Their shrimp and grits are delicious and I love the berry almond chicken salad! I've also had the (pretzels - sooo good) and the buffalo chicken sandwich. I enjoyed them all. Service and atmosphere are great too."}
{"text":"They still have a lot of new restaurant kinks to work out, but they are handling them well. I went with a larger group last week and after our apps came out we were told it would be 30 minutes before we could order so the kitchen could catch up. I really appreciate that honestly instead of having our order taken and sitting there for an hour with no explanation. They weren't super busy, but didn't seem to have a lot of staff on. 

Alex was our server and she was amazing!! She kept her cool even with being busy and dealing with a large table. The hostess was also doing a phenomenal job, although I did not catch her name. 

When we finally got our food, it was so worth the wait. Everything I tried was delicious. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich as a wrap and loved the addition of fried green tomato. The brussel sprouts are addictingly good. I tried my boyfriends 1/4 chicken and it was perfect and tender. The mashed potatoes were out of this world. I couldn't stop stealing from my boyfriend's plate. 

Atmosphere is great, love the decor and overall vibe in there. The patio is really nice as well.

The only thing I wasn't super impressed with was the cocktails, but I am sure they will perfect. 

I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly but very slow. We ordered the family style chicken dinner. It was an hour before it came out. The chicken was fried too hard (unless that's their style). The meat was moist, but the outside was near-burnt. The sides (macaroni and green bean casserole) were meh. We ordered 2 cocktails and neither were at all what we expected. As if that wasn't enough, the food ran right through us. It wasn't a pleasant experience and I'm very disappointed. My expectation was higher especially given the reviews. I normally don't write reviews, but this experience was awful and the aftermath  even more so."}
{"text":"I've been to the Cotswold location a few times but never to this one. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was over an hour! It was so packed! But the restaurant is large and we sat at the bar until a table opened up and it was only about a 30 minute wait. The drinks were wonderful, the service great, the food was just ok. It wasn't horrible, but just wasn't a huge wow factor for me. The pretzel app and pimento cheese was delicious. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and tasted the shrimp and grits. The best thing on that menu is the Mac and cheese. A must have for any location!!"}
{"text":"Call me selfish, but I'm pretty pumped that Leroy Fox finally opened up a location closer to my house. GIVE ME ALL YOUR PRETZEL BITES AND QUESO!

I usually get their buffalo chicken salad because I'm obsessed with their buffalo vinaigrette. Today I had to switch it up (very slightly) and go with the 
Honey Buffalo grilled chicken sandwich. I absolutely love the fact that they use pickled green tomatoes on their chicken sammies. My friend got the green bean casserole (a warning: it has a layer of cheese) and I went with the brussel sprouts. I could easily just go there and eat a giant bowl of brussels. I never get the fried chicken here (I just always want other things), but my buddy really enjoyed his 1/4 South. Oh, and did I mention- THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE!

This is a gorgeous spot, both inside and out. I like the outside wall that is covered in Charlotte street names. TVs both in the restaurant and on the patio. 

Make parking easy on the street and download the Parkmobile app."}
{"text":"I was really blown away by Leroy Fox! I'd only ever gotten drinks at the Cotswold location, and I have to give this South End location two thumbs up on atmosphere, food, and of course their signature drinks.

First off, I've FINALLY found a place to watch sporting events that isn't too much of a \"sports bar\" that only serves nachos, wings, and domestic beer. Some friends and I gathered to watch rivalry week football games, and it was an awesome environment! Huge TVs, hopping 360 bar, and they seated us in a half-circle booth so we could all face a TV.

I'm so in love with watching sporting events here now because of the delicious food. I greatly appreciate when a restaurant known for it's fried chicken has banging vegetarian options as well. I had their southwest salad with blackened shrimp and their house pineapple-sriracha dressing. Delicious! They also had some of the most perfect potato wedges I've ever seen (not greasy, crispy outside, thick cut), and really good sweet potato tots. Thanks friends for letting me try your stuff. The wraps everyone else ordered also got rave reviews.

I really loved the ambiance of everyone hanging out on a Saturday night. It felt like a neighborhood joint with great decor, friendly staff, and good cuisine on top of it all! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me, my sisters and my friend tried this place out last night for the first time. If our server wasn't so good to us and the music wasn't decent I definitely would have given this place one star. So initially I was skeptical about this place because I had read reviews that the customer service wasn't that great. I also heard there might be some issues with the service that african american customers receive, and quite honestly I can see where some of the reviews were correct. So upon arrival the hostess was not friendly and her customer service skills were not the best. It was almost as if she wanted us to turn around, to make her life easier, because the place was so crowded. So after we put our name down we head to the bar to get a drink. The bartender initially was decent when he first took our order. However he then appeared agitated because of where we were standing and asked us to move out of the area we were standing so servers could pick up their drinks. There was literally no where else to stand. It was horrible! The drinks on the other hand were almost perfect. I got the cucumber lemon drink (or something like that). There was also a guy who called himself checking in on us a couple times throughout the night (I'm assuming he was a manager or supervisor of some sort). He behaved so strangely all night and could not take a joke. He was definitely not a people person and made me feel very uncomfortable. Thankfully our server was outstanding! I wish I could remember her name. The food was average. We had zucchini fries for an appetizer which were pretty good and came out piping hot! I ordered salmon, brussel sprouts and grits for my meal. The salmon was also pretty hot and so were the grits. Brussel sprouts were grilled and tasty but lukewarm at best. I did like the mix of music and they played quite a bit of new stuff. Next time I go I'll probably just do drinks and appetizers. I doubt I'll sit at the bar unless the grumpy guy is not behind the counter."}
{"text":"We had time to kill before out flight and my husband was craving Southern cooking.  What a great place!  I started with the very berry mule... their tale on a Moscow mule with fresh mashed berries.  Soo good!  We both had the chicken fried chicken with sides of mac and cheese and green bean casserole.  Portion was HUGE! Perfectly cooked and the mac and cheese was outstanding!  We sat outside and that just made the meal.  Wish I had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Went their on a Sunday around 6/7, sat down at a table and ordered beers (which took about 15 minutes) before they decided to tell us their kitchen was closed... 
10 minutes later they come back and say, just kidding, kitchen is open. So we ordered food. Food was average, nothing too special and one of our sides came out wrong. 
Maybe I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and try it again..."}
{"text":"I love the Cotswold location but South hasn't really impressed. I've ordered take out from here twice and both times it's been ok. This time I ordered salmon, Brussels  sprouts and mashed potatoes. The salmon was just ok and the Brussels sprouts were burnt to a crisp and tasted WAY to salty. Will probably just stick with the Cotswold location."}
{"text":"Adam Gautreau is so personable and the drink recommendations are fantastic. Awesome drinks and awesome prices. Amazing patio."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are both great - and the bar is right within walking distance all around south end. The only complaint is that the service is still lacking, its difficult to order drinks/food even at the bar - almost as if the bar needs another 2 bartenders on duty at the same time. There's just too many times my drink hits the bottom before I have to ask them to refill it. The vibe is great and the cooks are awesome, just need a minor fix to the waiting and it'll be a five star bar!"}
{"text":"I love that they've opened up a Leroy Fox closer to my house, so I've been to this one quite a few times already. The service has improved every time - you can tell they're getting in the swing of things. As always, the food is delicious. I do hate that they've gotten rid of my favorite thing for Sunday brunch - the which came first. But their sandwiches are always wonderful, so are the sides & appetizers. I definitely suggest the zucchini fries or the pretzels if you want an app."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken. Amazing cocktails. Beware that everything is fried, though. I got the Brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes as sides and the Brussel sprouts I weren't expecting to be fried, but they were. Not great for a diet. Service was good though and food was delightful."}
{"text":"Let me set the scene real fast before I discuss the food: this location doesn't serve brunch yet, the environment is gorgeous and the servers are very nice. My friend, husband and I all sat at a booth, where we literally watched the bartender stand and talk with his group of friends for the entire 1.5 hrs of our visit (I'm not sure how the female bartenders could stand it? I'd hate to think he's a manager). While I'm all for a good time, I'd highly doubt his boss would have been pleased if he had heard what we did. An entire 15 minute conversation where he loudly discussed last night where he was stoned (I almost wrote the details of his story but I think it would mortify the business and he'd possibly lose his job... I will leave it at \"Pineapple Express\")
Not the classiest.
The food was good.. Mac n cheese was the best along with the fried zucchini. The flavors were all pretty good but I'd recommend they don't run out of two sides (sweet potato tots and potato wedges)on a Sunday lunch. Overall I'd go back to try it for sure... and hopefully the staff is all actually working when I do."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Love this place! Great cocktails and great food with a very cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food is good, not great. Big bar and lively crowd is likely the reason to go here.  I had the fried chicken sandwich was was good, just not so memorable that you want to rush back and have another. Mac and cheese was good, but way short of incredible."}
{"text":"We've been to the location in South Park area and my husband loves their fried chicken. Recently we decided to try this new location. We didn't love the mac and cheese or the green bean casserole but we should've just stuck with the sides we normally get. Overall, though, our main items were great. Service was also great. Drinks were awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before so I though trying it out for Sunday brunch seemed like a good idea. We were sat quickly at a table by the window (nice open lighting) and looked over them menu. It was hard to choose because there were so many deliousious sounding things to pick from. The service was great and the food was yummy. It was a tad bit noisy, but that's kind of how all the restaurants are in Charlotte now. We left completely satisfied, and I even took a bunch of food home for a second meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Such a cool place in the heart of South End! Although I only had wine, the craft cocktails look amazing! We ordered the Zucchini fries and it was really good. I was there for happy hour and there was a nice crowd. Our server was very personable but he was a little in the weeds."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave no stars... we have been here for 40 min and have seen our waitress once. The food may be good, but the wait certainly is not worth it."}
{"text":"Best and only zucchini fries I'll eat in Charlotte. It took me a while to come around to zucchini fries because every time I've had them, they've been soggy and greasy. Leroy's zucchini fried are crisp and crunchy, and perfect with ranch (but tastes great even without it)! I order them every time, and they have consistently been delicious."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Leroy Fox for a while, so I was really excited when they finally opened a location closer to me! 

We went for lunch and were seated right away. The waiter gave us good recommendations. We got the Chicken Fried Sandwich and the Honey Buffalo Sandwich. It seems like they still have some kinks to work out because they forgot the gravy for the Chicken Fried Sandwich and they forgot the blue cheese for the Honey Buffalo Sandwich. They corrected the problem and both were delicious. The Honey Buffalo Sandwich had a bit of a kick. The Chicken Fried Sandwich was my favorite! I would have loved more gravy on it, it was so good. We got the mac and cheese and sweet potato tots as our sides. The mac and cheese was definitely the star of the show. It was some of the best mac and cheese I've had in the south. The sweet potato tots were good too, but they are pretty sweet (rolled in honey, etc), so the mustard on the side was necessary. 

For dessert we tried the banana pudding, the bread pudding, and the toffee tollhouse. The banana pudding was pretty good, but I've had better. It needed more bananas for sure. The waiter knew that I didn't like chocolate after I asked about another dessert, but he failed to mention that they put chocolate sauce all over the bread pudding, so that was kind of annoying. I heard nothing but great things about the toffee tollhouse. 

All in all, it was a great meal and I would say the best fried chicken I've had in Charlotte so far (still need to try Haberdish and the Shell gas station). We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, Have you ever had a meal that was so good you didn't want it to end? That was my experience today at Leroy Fox. I think I made love to each forkful. I didn't even eat it all because I wanted more when I got home. The fried chicken, juicy, flavorful and crunchy! This is the signature for a reason folks! The brussel sprouts, seasoned so well. The mac and cheese was even good and I did not have high expectations about it when it got to the table. And the tollhouse dessert...can you see my eyes rolling in the back of my head? Homemade caramel sauce, perfectly baked warm cookie...my only complaint was I wish it were bigger. I was so impressed and wondering why it took me so long to get there! I can not wait to go back! I have found another favorite!"}
{"text":"I think they still have a few more kinks to work out here, but I had a great time in this new location of Leroy Fox! The Lady and I used to live relatively near the cotswold(ish) location and I've missed it since we moved outside of uptown, but I'm SO glad that we get it back!

So first off, the patio and the lights are irresistible especially from the street. It's gorgeous. Seated quickly without reservation on a Friday night, which is allllways nice. We started out with a drink - got a Cucumber Basil Lemonade which was very nice. For dinner, I ordered the honey buffalo chicken sandwich, grilled, with a side of brussel sprouts. The Lady ordered a side of the sweet potato tots for both of us to demolish. I can't comment on what she got, because it disappeared too quickly. My sandwich was awesome - though not a ton of heat (which was okay for the mood I was in), but all flavors worked very well. The tots, as stated, were obliterated. Didn't even touch the sauce that came with them. 

The reason that I knocked off the one star is kind of two fold. The food, while awesome especially for a casual dinner, wasn't... I don't know, deserving of five stars? It wasn't as good as it gets. And the second point was that The Lady and I ordered a second drink, The Alexa, and it is just *not* good. We were told that it was made incorrectly, and it was taken off the bill and replaced with another Cucumber Basil Lemonade, but I'm surprised that either a) the person who mixed it messed up that badly and hadn't been trained or b) they have it on the menu at all. Just a bad combination of flavors, even our waitress agreed with us haha. 
But please - don't take those as true negatives. There is so, so much good here, and it'll keep us coming back to try more off the menu!!

Oh yea, and as Nikki pointed out so elegantly, they have the good ice with all drinks. Twenty points for Leroy Fox!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here but the service is hit or miss. I've never had an absolutely terrible experience, but even during slow times (with 75% of tables empty) it can take forever to get seated, get drinks, etc. Also they can tend to give really inaccurate takeout pickup times - I get that this happens sometimes, but they range from 10 minutes early - 20 minutes late and it never seems to be ready when they say! Definitely think the Cotswold location shines when it comes to service, but LOVE the food and atmosphere at both - just work on the service please!"}
{"text":"Had the Salmon on top of mixed greens with a honey chili vinaigrette.  It was delicious.  Tiffany, the bar maid had a great personality"}
{"text":"Went to this location for the second time today. I really enjoy the ambience of the place and the food is usually on point. I was disappointed today that I ordered a tea like usual and when I got my check the waiter charged me for 2. When I asked why he said they are required to put in and charge for refills. REALLY for ice tea!!!! I have eaten there and plenty of other places and never play for refills on ice tea...to pay $4.50 because I got refills makes no SENSE!!! It's not like it's any special tea. Crazy and they lost me with that!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Husband says this was the best chicken sandwich that he's had in awhile(bbq chicken sandwich) Mine was amazing- the Pimento Fried egg chicken sandwich. The sweet potato tots were perfectly crispy- definitely on the sweet side. Great server and really pleasant eating outside:)"}
{"text":"South End is filled with gems and this is one!

If you're in the mood for a fun, eclectic atmosphere and good Southern-inspired food, this is your spot. We went during lunch hours and were seated quickly. I imagine that might not be the case for dinner as this is one of the new, hot spots in South End. 

For starters, we had zucchini fries. They were more like zucchini wedges. Massive hand cut and hand dipped slices of zucchini battered and fried to perfection were a great way to set the tone for our lunch. This appetizer comes with two sauces for dipping: a tad spicy remoulade and a classic ranch. The basket is great for sharing; hubby and I could not finish all of ours. 

For my entree, I selected the shrimp po boy. I had settled on the shrimp Cobb salad until hubby pointed out this dish that's one of my favorites. For my side, I could not resist sweet potato tots. My shrimp po boy arrived with lettuce (that I asked not be included) but I could easily remove it without ruining my dish. The po boy was about six inches and had maybe 6-8 golden brown shrimp; you could choose between fried or grilled. It's Southern and so am I so I went with fried! It was very tasty and the side of remoulade added just the right kick. Those sweet potato tots were excellent. Cute little bite-sized sweet potatoes dipped in a hint of cinnamon were the perfect side for my po boy! Be warned... they give you an extremely generous portion. I had to take half of them home for our sons to try because I couldn't hold them all!

Great food. Awesome atmosphere. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"I am blown away by the number of stars this establishment has. 

I was getting together with a few friends last night and they picked Leroy Fox South End, being new to the area, I was excited to give this place a try. I've heard the decor is trendy and cozy but the food isn't anything to write home about. With that being said, I tried to go in with an open mind, but now I understand why I was given such stark reviews from the get-go.

Walking in, I wasn't instantly greeted and waited at the host stand for 5 minutes before I was acknowledged. Finally, I was whisked away to a booth.  Again, it took several minutes of awkward sitting and waiting until our server greeted us and brought us water. Without an introduction, or note of specials he left and didn't come back for what felt like 20 minutes. We didn't order until 8:15 and I arrived at 7:30. This seemed very strange. Other tables seemed to be getting rather good service, so I don't know why we weren't. 

The grub:
+Meh. This is a disaster area for a vegetarian. Sure, there are fish options, but no tofu, sweet potatoes or just general no meats. 
+One saving grace- sweet potato tots. These things were like little balls of heaven. They melt in your mouth and there is a subtle hint of cinnamon! YUM!
+White Wine- served at room temperature. NOPE.

The final straw that broke the camel's back was the check game. I had to request the check and 10 minutes later our server came back with checks for us. Awesome. I paid cash. My total was $12.99 and I left $15. Typically if I leave enough with tip, I say something along the lines of,  \"I don't need change\" or \"the rest if for you.\" Well, I had a few singles and I was assuming (if it was a good server) I'd get change. Nope. He never came back with my change, so that was his tip. Honestly, I wasn't planning on leaving more because the service was so horrendous anyway. 

TL;DR: abysmal service, too loud for a conversation and not very veggie friendly. Will I be back? NOPE."}
{"text":"So this was my second time coming to this location and I will give it a 3.5. The first time service was ok but this last time it was lacking. He started off strong and then he was just blah. A friend from out of town ordered the chicken & waffles and it usually comes with an apricot compote. Me and a friend were telling her how good it was on it so she ordered it. When her food came out, there was no compote. After waving down our waiter she asked him about it, he just responded \"oh we're out of that\" and walked away. Not sure why it wasn't communicated when ordered or once he knew but then was just very uncaring. 
I ordered my fav the Zucchini fries love them with the boom boom sauce and I tried something new with the honey buffalo chicken sandwich. It was good, enjoyed the pickled green tomatoes on it!
I love the setup in the location with the outdoor patio and the huge bar in the middle of the restaurant and the food is always good but I'll stick to going to the Cotswald location for the better service."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Adam Gautreau - are you looking for someone that can read your mind and craft a cocktail that is the best you've ever had? He's your man! 

Come in and see Adam and all the bartenders. The bar is always a blast."}
{"text":"We came here on a regular Sunday night, the restaurant was definitely not slammed. We sat outside and waited for OVER an hour. After about an hour and 15 minutes, the manager came out and promised our food would be served soon. We waited another 20 minutes - still no food. The waitresses were not attentive, leaving our water glasses empty. Both times people in our party have been there before, they got sick from the food. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere, awesome decor, and great customer service! The pimento cheese was delicious (we couldn't finish it but they were kind enough to provide a mini container to take home). The Mac 'n' Cheese is to die for. The fried chicken really hits home. Great selection of drinks and beverages. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!! We had a party of ten which included folks from out of town- I was a bit nervous.  Not only did they seat us sooner than expected, the service and food was excellent! The wait staff and manager made sure to check on us frequently throughout our meal. Highly recommend the wings, mac and cheese, and zucchini fries.  Love the friendly vibe and cozy decor.  Parking deck located on the side street is an added bonus.  I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really fun and the drinks we got were really good. We had issues actually getting our food though. When it came out it was missing sides and then it took forever to get it. We were actually done with the main dish by the time the side came. Additionally we never got the bacon & corn salsa, the honey (the chicken was supposed to be traditional style) or the pickles."}
{"text":"I had been biding my time to check out the new guy on the block near my place in Southend.  Pleasantly surprised to see they were trying out a new brunch menu the same day I decided to go!

They really did this place justice with a very very nice outdoor patio space, and a gorgeously decorated inside space.  The woody colors and booths really make the place feel comfortable but at the same time can be on the cover of a magazine.  A great space overall with tables and a large bar area in the back.  There's not a really well defined hostess station, but all the servers and staff are super friendly and really make up for the lack of a stand to greet you when you come in.  

Our server Matt was super nice and calm.  With the rush of the football crowd and a Panthers away game, the place got packed shortly after we arrived.  Luckily we got a good \"godfather booth\" where you can pretty much see everyone in the restaurant and our backs to the corner.  

I tried the chicken and waffles.  Their Leroy Fox signature chicken atop a waffle with peach compote and maple syrup.  Perfectly poached egg on top.  It was amazing.  After food was done, we just sat in our booth and got nice a ready to watch a somewhat mediocre Panthers game.  Ugly win, but a W is a W.

Overall a great experience.  It does tend to be a little on the loud side (could just be me getting old) but I saw some early brunches with little ones.  The restaurant does have high chairs so it can be kid friendly... maybe just not on Sundays during football season."}
{"text":"Visited here yesterday with a friend not realizing it was St. Patrick's day. With that being said  the outside patio here was live or like the young folks like to say lit !!! Perfect location in south end of Charlotte. I ordered a blueberry smash for my drink ,which was rather tasty,and the pimento cheese fried chicken sandwich. The fried zucchini fries we ordered was perfect for stimulating our appetites leading up to our actual meal. No complaints here just wish the zucchini fries were more seasoned.My friend found herself adding salt to them. Other than that i highly recommend this place."}
