{"text":"Holy eclair! No seriously the eclairs here are of divine inspiration. 

We were very excited to hear that a local alternative to Starbucks was opening up in our neighborhood, and we were certainly not disappointed! 

Walking in, we were welcomed with bright, authentic salutations from the barista. While there was no artwork or decor on the white washed walls, he was so nice that it was like stepping into a Dr. Seuss book, colorful, charming, and makes you forget that bad things can ever happen. He chatted with us for a few minutes about their shop, the coffee, the pastries, and, most importantly, the eclairs. We ordered a cappuccino, a vanilla latte, a berry waffle, and of course, an eclair. 

After ordering, we sat down at the monstrosity of a bench that runs along the restaurant. Seriously, this thing is huge. If you pushed the tables together it would basically be The Last Supper: Coffee Shop Edition. They let us know that they didn't have waffles yet (eyes watered, but no tears were shed) but that they would be happy to get us anything else on the menu (see above comments about how ridiculously nice the staff is). We ordered a Florentine breakfast sandwich. 

Our coffee and food all arrived at the same time. They serve Piexoto coffee from Chandler. The barista let us know that he was still working on getting it dialed in, but he did an excellent job. The vanilla latte was a big hit for my wife, and the cappuccino was leaps and bounds better than the Starbucks around the corner. 

The breakfast sandwich was also great. For $7.50 we had high expectations, and Love of Chocolate delivered. The sandwich was large and in charge. Perfectly cooked eggs, melted cheese, good turkey, ripe tomatoes, spinach, all served upon an everything bagel. Bam! Mouth explosion of flavor! 

But then... the eclair. My goodness! The eclair! I wanna shout it from the rooftops! I wanna stand in front of that eclair's house with a boom box and tell it that I love it! I want to hold it on the stern of a giant boat and shout, \"I'm the king of the world!\" Seriously stop reading this and go buy this eclair. Go now. You are wasting your time reading this. 

All in all, I think this place is a great addition to the neighborhood. As they decorate the walls, fill the cases, and dial in the coffee, this will be a great Saturday morning spot. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely worth checking out Love of Chocolate. It's WAYYYY better than Caribou or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Awesome place to just sit and enjoy coffee and dessert. I also guy a flatbread that I liked a lot and actually ate that after my mocha cake."}
{"text":"I live right near the bakery and have been anxiously awaiting their opening. At the 19North event back in November-ish Love of Chocolate was there before their official opening and selling desserts and coffee. I got a slice of their pumpkin pie and it was so amazing. I was sad to see they aren't selling it now. I have since tried their other baked goods especially the eclairs and there hasn't been anything I wasn't blown away by. I am not a coffee drinker but I love their tropical tea. They're also super friendly in there and remember you when you come back."}
{"text":"What's going on??? I called to check the business hours & no answer! I checked Google & Yelp & they both say PERMANENTLY CLOSED!! I am a very picky coffee drinker. . . I love your iced coffee!!! WHAT IN THE COFFEE BEANS IS GOING ON?!?!? You have this girl Scervous!
Would have been 5 Stars but"}
{"text":"What a lovely new place serving delicious craft breakfast, lunch and coffee in an area which was underserved for a while! The space is clean and modern with beautiful mission-style architectural details and a gorgeous patio for these cool and crisp AZ winter days. I tried their prosciutto and fig flatbread, the dough was flavorful and baked to perfection and what a nice twist to have figs on top rather than fig jam. Greens were fresh and crisp with a tangy balsamic glaze. Now on to what really knocked my socks off, their eclair! Perfectly light and airy dough with a not so sweet creme inside, covered with dark chocolate. So delicious I would drive there for just that! Everything is made in house and you can tell from the way the food tastes. North Phoenix this is your neighborhood coffee and breakfast/lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is new, but super cute. I love that it's family owned. The inside looks very clean and modern. They had all sorts of chocolate and cakes on display. I asked the man who must own it all about his cakes. He explained each one. I couldn't decide and asked what he would recommend. He told me to try the Tres Leche cake and proceeded to tell me how they make it. Look at my photo--how could I pass the beautiful cake up. It's a generous piece so I brought it home for my boyfriend to try too and he loved it and wants to come back with me. The coffee was excellent as well. I had a mocha with a shot of Carmel. Before leaving the owner asked me about the cake and I said it was excellent and you could tell he was so proud. I will be back, the lighting was well chosen and I love the variety of seating-- outdoor with umbrellas, tables with chairs or even a sofa. Very chill atmosphere. I wouldn't doubt this place gets popular very soon."}
{"text":"Such a cute place serving traditional and none traditional coffees. I got a cortado, my favorite, it was delicious! The pastries are divine looking. I didn't try one today but definitely will in the future."}
{"text":"Cute place with good atmosphere and they serve peixoto coffee beans which is amazing, you always get a perfectly pulled shot every time ! They also have a delicious menu for quick eats, I had the flatbread and it was divine with balsamic glaze, fig and prosciutto."}
{"text":"Nice little cozy place to hang out early or late. I had the Nova Lox and all the ingredients were fresh and taste great! Great place, will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This lovely coffee shop and bakery is newish and in a simply gorgeous mission-style building. Their bakery is delicious and decorated well enough to display their fine goods at any special home party. There is outdoor seating under beautiful arches where for a few minutes you can dream that you're on vacation somewhere pretty in Mexico or Spain."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I love supporting local businesses, specially competing against Starbucks.
I came with one mission:try their base drip coffee.

Its a coffee shop right coffee should be good. I was rather disappointed. It was horrible. Maybe it was a one off and i came at that time but my review is based on that impression. 

Coffee was luke warm, maybe not close to warm. Maybe i should of said something but I didn't want to wait for a new pot to be made, warm coffee is sometimes still good. Not this one. Add cream to it and its almost room temperature. I like my coffee with splenda but they only had raw sugar or stivia. Stevia is horrible for coffee! At least in my opinion. Coffee was already too bitter no matter how much cream i added and stevia makes it worst.

You will expect a coffee shop to supply customers with an endless array of sweetening options, not this place sadly.

To sum up i was rather disappointed. I will try it maybe one day again. For now im not looking forward to it anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice. I went once by myself for lunch and had a Turkey panini that was excellent. Lots of fresh ingredients. I went back with my family and we enjoyed many desserts. We ordered a bunch and shared them all. They have chocolate cakes, red velvet cakes, tres leches, and fabulous eclairs. They also had a cheesecake that we did not try. I would highly recommend this as a place to have a sweet treat and just relax with friends or family."}
{"text":"Good service but cakes dry and hot chocolate tastes weak and packaged. Was expecting a lot more of this place. Have had better slices of cake from the grocery store bakery."}
{"text":"Delicious flatbreads and salads.  Excellent chai latte.  The name is a little confusing as the menu goes far beyond chocolate.  Very attentive service.  Nice addition to a pretty \"foodless\" area......."}
{"text":"I really like it here! It's a small, quite cafe type of place. The drinks looked so good from the tea to the coffee but I sadly didn't get any. My friend and I bought one of the cakes for sale and it was amazing! I can't remember the name of it but it was truly good! I will definitely be coming back for a drink or even more cake!"}
{"text":"Very hip and friendly place. Glad to see a family owned coffee shop in Phoenix. Great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a haircut at the Great Clips next door. The inside seemed very austere and, though it was still morning, they didn't have a lot of selection in the case. I was expecting to come in to a case full of different kinds of chocolate and treats but was a bit disappointed.
Got a small blackberry ice tea and two eclairs to go. The tea was good though they skimped a bit on the ice. The eclairs sat for a bit, rolling around in their box in the car before I got to taste them, but they weren't quite as good as they looked. The cream inside wasn't as rich as I usually prefer, though everything was of great quality. I would come back if visiting the shopping center but not sure I'd go out of my way."}
{"text":"Excellent chocolate strawberry cake and a cup of coffee for a mid-afternoon pick me up. Such a big serving of cake, I took half of it home to snack on the next day."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this coffee shop. I would consider going back in a few months since it is newer, but I think in the meantime I will stick to Starbucks. The staff was friendly but it was obvious that they weren't super sure what they were doing. Forgot to add caramel to my cold-brew, and when they did, they added a thick syrup when I was expecting liquid. That's partially my fault for not clarifying, but most places will automatically put in liquid pumps."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the employees were warm and friendly. Both times I got a latte and they were wonderful. Second time my 7 year old got the churro waffles and he loved them. Would recommend to others. I hope they succeed. The area could use some more local eateries and coffee shops."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Amazing espresso with the perfect flavoring and adorable pastries. I always love supporting local coffee shops."}
{"text":"Dirty, no one wears gloves. Items are expensive, they are always out of baked 
goods, coffee is too strong & expensive.They do not care.  Waste of time here.  My Reviews are true,  DO NOT REMOVE"}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:01AM a minute after their posted opening.   After milling around out front for a few minutes a worker poked her head out and said she worked in the kitchen and they couldn't open until another employee arrived.   We gave up at 7:10 and went to Lux (which I recommend)."}
{"text":"The only reason it gets a star at all is because it's required. The desserts were awful. The decor is simple and uninviting. I am curious where the money in this business went as it didn't go into the food."}
{"text":"We came for the first time and loved it. The owner took our order and offered us drinks when we sat down and forgot to order drinks. One of the best eclairs I've ever had and I consider myself a connoisseur. Nice environment and clean, too!"}
{"text":"Super cute local coffee shop. Coffee taste great, clean and spacious. Fast WiFi. Ordered lox and bagel - it was delicious. Definitely check it out."}
