{"text":"Had a friend in town staying at the Embassy Suites this week. Since there was a Garcia's in the hotel, we just decided to go there for lunch and catch up.  I hadn't dined at a Garcia's in years and I am always skeptical of hotel restaurant prices.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices for such large portions. And the food was delicious!!!  And our server Carla was just the sour cream on top of the enchilada!  Her service was outstanding!  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Just ate a very tasty dinner here. Service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I had eaten at a Garcia's and I was kind of looking forward to it.  Last one I actually ate at is now a Popo's.  I think I'll go to Popo's.  If the rudest hostess in all of Phoenix doesn't put you off the lack of air conditioning certainly will.  I'll be happy to see all the Garcia's close again.  And to the rude hostess, I hope you lose your job."}
{"text":"I'll start with saying the chicken fajitas were REALLY good. And our food came extremely quick.  However, the service was bad, and my $7 \"peach margarita\" tasted nothing like peach and EXACTLY like the mix you buy at the local grocery. Also, my friend ordered a virgin strawberry daiquiri and instead she got some weird smoothie with whip cream on top.  Also, while the waitress was fairly nice to us, we waited 10 minutes just for her to bring water and ended up having to ask another server. They seemed really busy, but why someone couldn't even bring water, I don't know. Also, she was horrible to a girl that was at the table next to us. The girl was gluten intolerant and stated this and asked instead for corn tortillas, and the waitress said \"WELL THEN, you'll just have to wait.\" So rude.   Anyway, I will NOT be going here again. If I want chain-restaurant mexican food I will stick with Chili's fajitas."}
{"text":"We had a Living Social deal for this restaurant. Edward was a great server. Very professional and attentive. Best server we've had in a long time, well groomed and really nice.  The food was good and we had more than we could eat, so leftovers.... Great value for what we paid."}
{"text":"I remember growing up going to Garcia's, so I don't know if it's all nostalgia or not but the chips and salsa here are the best! If you feel like you need to actually order something but don't know what I suggest Olivia's Sampler for a  few different options.  It's a little strange going to an Embassy Suites to eat while not staying at the hotel, but not strange enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Not very personable but ok. Love the chips, salsa and bean dip. Very prompt  service but I gotta say, the fish tacos are horrible. Everything else was delicious. Server didn't even notice I ate one bite and left the entire entree on the plate."}
{"text":"My friend thinks Garcia's the best so we've met her there on several occasions. The last time we went we ordered the green chili chimichanga and the chile relleno it was very good except for the canned refried beans. That said the cocktail server man in the bar is a jackass. On several occasions he's overcharged us and he's just downright rude. We decided to give it another try because my friend said he is no longer there. Mr. Jackass is still there we're done being treated poorly and won't be returning. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Used a coupon from living social went to Garcias first the margarita was horrible then came the appetizer fried mini chimis they were ok at best finally here comes dinner the plate was so hot couldn't touch it food was cold inside and out and tasted horrible last dessert looked ok ice cream was froze solid had to wait 20min to eat it. All and all i will never return to this restaurant will be surprised if its still open in 6 months ."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Tortilla Soup is amazing!! I'm only in town for work and I know I'll crave it when I'm gone. I actually had it twice during my week here because it was so good! I recommend the espinaca con queso dip too. I was happy with the service both times and I like that it's part of the mall."}
{"text":"I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed."}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix, Garcia's was a favorite dining destination for my family.  Fast forward 20 years later and I am living in Tempe with my partner and it is still a favorite.  This location is actually inside an Embassy Suites Hotel.  Even when its busy there is not much of a wait time. Yes it is a chain restaurant but the food is muy bueno.    The chips come with a spicy bean dip, yum!  There is a good selection of food, my favorites are seafood fundido, shrimp tacos, pork tacos and most of all their fajitas are probably the best I've had!  I'm not much of a drinker but they have lots of tequilas and margarita specials.  We are regulars there so we get treated very well."}
{"text":"Great food try the food hands down the best Mexican food I've had since I've been in Arizona other than the giant Cock roach crawling up the wall . So I whispered quietly to the host because I didn't want to make a scene or interfere with the other guests. When i mention it to the hostess he actually got an attitude with me. He didn't comp us at all with free drink or anything I would never go there again !"}
{"text":"The waiter I had couldn't even crack smile or even come by my table. If he did come by it was once every 15 minutes. Food is always good here service sucks all the time. Also u may want to dust your big picture in your dinning area dust bunnies all over it."}
{"text":"If there were a no star options I would've chosen it. The food tasted like canned food. And even then, I HAVE tried better canned food than what Garcias serves. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Food was very good and there prices are very fare. The only thing there service is poor not very friendly to everyone they choose who to be friendly too."}
{"text":"Haven't been to the restaurant in years...last night re-visited.   Taco salads were good.  Could definately have been much better with a bit more ground beef and charro beans, but the flavors were very good.  Next time, we will request more meat and beans be added...we will see if they charge extra for that. Service people, although prompt and attentive, were not warm at all. we will try this again in future. The lobby IS outdated as is the whole place.  However,we love Friday night \"Happy Hour.\"  There is occasionally a great band with a man who looks like Carlos Santana and plays even better!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend for vegetarians. I ordered lunch to go. On the grill section of the menu \"vegetable fajitas\" is listed. I thought that sounded good and from the description was expecting grilled and seasoned peppers and onions. What I got was not grilled or fajitas. It was literally just steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. They were completely unseasoned and legitimately looked like they were from a bag of frozen vegetables. My boyfriends non-vegetarian food was fine. I get that you can't expect a Mexican place to cater to vegetarians but selling frozen steamed veggies as \"fajitas\" is not acceptable."}
{"text":"They never answer their phone and my boyfriend woke up with really bad food poisoning . I wouldnt even give this a star . When we were on a date there they were super slow at coming to our table , taking our orders , and then after they served us we never saw our waitor again . Horrible.   Nunca contestan el teléfono y mi novio se despertaron con una intoxicación alimentaria muy mal . Yo no le daría incluso una estrella . Cuando estábamos en una fecha no eran super lenta en llegar a nuestra mesa , llevar a nuestros pedidos , y luego, después nos sirvieron nunca vimos a nuestro camarero nuevo. Horrible."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all.   Came on a Tuesday night to have dinner with some friends.  The inside of the restaurant smelled musty and slightly of urine.  The floor was dirty with food under the tables etc.  the waitress was less than enthused to be serving us and as we had additional members presenting at our party she continually was irritated that she has to take additional drink orders from us bc more people showed up.  She would disappear for long periods of time and then when we stayed later to talk it was another irritation. The food was not that appealing and the side of black beans tasted bad and bitter.  The food was hot but felt like it was microwaved before coming out. For the money and the cost of the meal I would of rather gone to a fast food place like chipotle and had cleaner service better ingredients etc.  I will not be coming back. I'm not sure why phoenix has all these Mexican restaurants which are long term establishments that go bad.  Like at one time I'm sure it was a family run great place where people would go to enjoy a nice family restaurant meal. But over time they have fallen into disrepair/mis management/ bad staff and poor food quality.  I really will have to say that I don't think I will continue to go to these phoenix based restaurant Mexican chain family dining.  I've tried many as an experiment and have been disappointed over and over."}
{"text":"We are huge Garcias fans (East Valley). This one should be ashamed of itself.  We visited with a friend in Friday night at about 8:30pm.  We all had the fajitas. Look ... if you run out of beef or chicken, then tell your customers that you ran out and ask them to order something else.  The fajitas had a fifth of the meat that Garcias usually serves to us.    Still a big Garcias fan but not this one in Peoria."}
{"text":"Good food and great service at very reasonable prices  The bean dip is unique to other mexican restaurants. Standard fare, and wish they served carnitas, but what they serve is excellent.  Highly recommend the carne asada tacos.  Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this Garcia's and I had no idea it was hidden inside an Embassy Suites. I've been to Garcia's before but this place was designed differently. It looked more on the fancy side, than the chill enviornment Garcia's usually is. We noticed right away that our waiter had trouble speaking in English, so he did have a difficult time understanding us. Even the tables close to us had to repeat things to him a couple times. He was the only waiter in this small resturant, which I didn't understand. I know it was a Thursday night, but even in a small place there should always be more than one waiter! When I dine at a Mexican restuarant, I expect our chip bowl to always be refilled without having to ask anyone. Not this place. Even when we he set our dinner down, he didn't even bother to refill our chips. The food itself wasn't even that spectacular. It was bland. When we asked for our check, our waiter took forever! We practically fell asleep waiting for our check.   I don't know if it's this Garcia's or what, but I really don't think I'll ever be heading back to Garcia's again. Why put up with bland food and crappy service? It just wasn't what I remembered."}
{"text":"Garcia's has typical Mexican food, perhaps a bit better than Macayo's. Not authentic Mexican food, but adapted to what the typical American might like. At this location of Garcia's, the food was OK, but the service was not good at all.   The waitress couldn't give us guidance on drinks because she doesn't drink alcohol. The drink menu doesn't have any prices on it, so I asked her how much some of the drinks were, and she didn't know that either. She just gave me a price range of $5.95 \"on up\". I'm not interested in ordering a drink with no price, only to find out later that it cost more than my meal itself. I didn't take any chances that night.   She couldn't guide us on what to order on most of the dishes because she doesn't eat meat. With all the people looking for work, I'm surprised they couldn't find someone appropriate to wait tables here. Anyway, some of the drinks got there quickly, but the manager ran drinks over to the table about 5 minutes afterwards (perhaps she forgot about us).   Later on at 845pm, they were running a noisy vacuum cleaner in the dining room on the other side of the room divider. This went on for several minutes, and I thought perhaps they had closed down that dining room for the night. But no! There was a still a table of people eating there. If it was annoying for us, imagine how they felt!   Just overall a disappointing experience and I won't go back to this particular Garcia's again. There were plenty of empty tables on a Saturday night at 730pm, so perhaps others have decided the same?"}
{"text":"Took my staff here for lunch today. Very disappointed on the customer service, cleanliness, and the food. This restaurant has gone down hill in the past few years. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decent place, good for a chain or mall restaurant but nothing amazing. Poor service but the Americanized Mexican food is pretty solid. My wife likes some of their fruity Margarita offerings but past that the place is a resounding \"meh.\""}
{"text":"What a pity that the service does not accompany the high quality of the cooking. You can hardly get a smile out of the waitresses. Thankfully the hostess, is always around willing to exchange some kind words with all her clients. Despite the high price of the food and the not so attentive waiters´ service, I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. For this reason I highly recommend going to a Different Garcias"}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT I'VE TRULY EVER BEEN TO!!! Waited over 45 minutes to be sat in a virtually empty restaurant. Food orders took forever, half were wrong & the other half were forgotten!! Food ranged between just not tasty at all to mediocre. I was truly shocked to have such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"It is the girl that works at the front door, she is terrific.  Oh and the food is always delicious and on point too.    I asked her for her name a few nights ago and she wrote it down for me.  Aileen Llamas; everytime I come in for take out she is full of happy, friendly, welcoming smiles.  Aileen helps me with my ordering and never says I don't know.  She is very helpful every time and very nice.  If I had a business I would want her working for me.   I asked her for her name because I told her that I wanted to say something good about her and she thanked me with her happy & friendly, sincere smiles.  I dearly hope that she is rewarded for her genuine service with Garcia's Restaurant.  She always lifts my spirits no matter what kind of day that I've had & I leave a much happier person looking forward to coming back again.  I sincerely thank you and I especially sincerely thank Aileen."}
{"text":"Had a great meal last night. My bf's steak burrito was dry, but it's got a good flavor. Mine was delicious. We're definitely coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"all was good but cannot find where to check my gift card balance. its a joke."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. One of our favorites! We love the bean dip, salsa and chips served before the meal. I usually get the fajitas, and my husband usually gets a burrito. We have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a dump! So you walk in and it smells like an assisted living facility. Staff were really nice, food was fine; nothing special, but the clientele are GHETTO! Obese black people and white trash, then it's music night so of course the POLICE have to be there to make sure nobody gets out of hand! Stay away from this place unless you are one of the aforementioned. Also, this isn't Mexican food, it's Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Phoenix this will be our go to Mexican Restaurant!  We came here once before and it was really good so tried it again and it did not disappoint. Definitely in my top 3 for Mexican Food anywhere!!  Love the bean dip they serve with the chips and salsa.  Chips are great, thin and warm.  I had a combination plate with the sour cream chicken enchilada, tostada and chili relleno. Best chili relleno I've ever had. My son ordered Carnitas tacos and didn't like them.  They had a lot of cooked purple cabbage and flour tortillas, the meat was delicious so next time he will read the menu better.  Everyone else loved what they ordered!! Can't wait to visit again and come back fro a great Mexican food meal!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't even worth one star, horrible service  atmosphere and food will never go back!"}
{"text":"Mmmm shredded beef tacos! The cheese crisp is good (or as you non-native Phoenicians call it \"quesa dilla.\" Always good food. Usually good service. Not cheap, but one of the better mexican restaurants out there."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst mexican food chain ever!!! The quality has declined the meat is fatty and the beans have no flavor"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for a reasonable price.  Yummy chips and salsa that I can eat all day. Would recommend for anyone to try."}
{"text":"I have been coming in here for awhile now and we have always had a great time. Are usual server is mica and she always makes our experience that much better. Mica is extremely tentative and you can always tell by her service that she really does care and wants you to have a positive  experience. We are always excited to see her greet us at our table."}
{"text":"I am always interested to see if I like the Mexican food in the region I am visiting.  Being semi-close to Mexico I would imagine the food would be authentic... this place did not have the homemade taste.  Don't get me wrong, the beans were perfect and so was rice.  It just misses that one little taste I am always searching for.  I have to admit, the waitress messed up on one of the orders and to compensate she gave us some fried ice-cream.  That in itself propels this to a 4."}
{"text":"So I went out to dinner with my neighbor and our kids. I was iffy about this place all together because I usually go to the original Garcia's on 35th ave in Encanto. Well, when we first got there, they sat us close to a whole bunch of people.. I'm sure that restaurant is bigger and they can spread us out a bit.. We gave him our order and what not and they brought the food back pretty fast. When I received my chimichanga enchilada style, they gave me like a teaspoon of sour cream and very little rice (which is my favorite :( ..) I'm used to restaurants giving a good heaping serving. Well not even halfway through my meal, I asked the man if he could give me a little more because they didn't give me much the first time. When I received my bill, he ended up charging me for more sour cream. I tried explaining to him that he gave me a tiny bit in the first place. He told me he needed to speak to his manager about it.. I'm like really dude, for some sour cream? Well he ended up taking 50 cents off the bill.. Seriously........50 cents? Would it really hurt the restaurant to give me more sour cream? This isn't a big issue because the food was okay.. The customer service just sucked and I won't be going back.."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST mexican food place in the USA you will Love it I promise you. Let's start with the chips and salsa always fresh and they also have beans that are stirred to perfection. The best drinks you have to try the margaritas they are mouth watering. The best array of dishes you will enjoy. I recommend the tamales they are so good."}
{"text":"This place was awful the service was just simply lacking are waitress had to be over worked or they were short staff I don't know but it started off bad first when we were seated I told them I need a high chair didn't get that had to go get it myself then I spilt salsa cause I was trying do there job when I told the server I spilt the salsa she brought me napkins I was like I need a towel dont u see the mess like really. Then she kinda an attitude I guess because she was the only working that section I don't know but still she could done better and not show it. We did not get any refill or even asked at all. I fill like this place is lacking the right kind of management I mean if you are under staff or your waitress or waiter is overwhelmed or got double seated whatever they case may had been the manager should had help out or something and it showed threw out the hole place there need to be some serious new training going on for the hole crew I will not be going back at all and that why I gave it one star and that because the food was some what okay that need some work on to but they service is horrible and it my experience bad and just so you know I am a manager to and I know that what I saw today was a manager that don't watch his staff"}
{"text":"Oh I've missed this Mexican restaurant so much!  I was in town and had to make this our first stop.    Garcias has a few locations around Arizona.  I used to frequent the Chandler location, which I loved!  Since we were driving right past this location off of Peoria we were definitely going to show them some love.  We were seated immediately with our waiter getting our drink order quickly.  Another lady brought our salsa, chips and bean dip while we were waiting for the meal.  Their bean dip is still my favorite.  It has a bit of a kick to it which i love.  Since they keep bringing more for the table, I just can't resist.  I ordered my favorite dish - Seafood Fundido.  I can find this anywhere else.  A tortilla filled with shrimp and crab, then fried, then topped with jalapeño cream cheese with melted monterey cheese on top.  Some other places have a similar dish but it doesn't come close to this.  My husband always orders the Pollo Fundido which is as equally amazing.    Service was great and the food was just as fantastic as I remembered.  Thanks Garcias!"}
{"text":"Wow! Garcia's saved the day for us tonight.  We started out at Top Shelf on Greenway, but no one would wait on us.  After 15 minutes of waiting to order anything, a waitress seated a table of three at a table next to ours and immediately took their drink order.  So we left and went to Garcia's.  Immediately, a waitress took our drink order.  She returned with the drinks, chips, salsa and bean dip.  She took our order right away.  She was very attentive.  The food arrived quickly.  It was hot and delicious and way more than we could eat.  We both have sufficient left-overs for another meal.  Way to salvage the evening!"}
{"text":"Not outstanding Mexican food, yet popular mainstream food.  There was nothing spectacular with the food, yet I was content with the burrito, rice, beans.  Chips are tasteless.  It is what I would expect from this type of restaurant. Unfortunately they don't seem to make things spicy, and this is a terrible disappointment.  If you want something better, 1/2 block north of Peoria on 35th Ave is La Parilla Suiza; the food is outstanding.  Would I go back?  Yes, yet only because it is simple comfort food, but because of the outstanding recipes that they follow."}
{"text":"I'm not rating the food , as my wife and I didn't stick around long enough to try it.  Now, where to begin... We entered the establishment only to find the lobby deserted.  We stood there for a couple of minutes, then I started down the hallway to where the hostess was having what must have been a very important conversation with another employee.  Body language says a lot and it was clear that I was interrupting her.  She told us it would be 10 minutes, at 3:30, on a Sunday.   After a few minutes they led us to a half-table / half-booth.  I took the booth side.  While I was sitting, I noticed all of the crumbs, crayons, and crap along the edge of the cushion.  Once seated, my rear-end noticed how worn out the booth truly was.  I commented to my wife, who told me that her chair felt like it was going to fall apart.   Then we both noticed the sticky table, and the fact that it wobbled with little provocation.   I understand that things wear out.  I also understand that, when your business is in the restaurant industry, you must deal with that wear and tear, not just ignore it.   Since it was impossible not to wonder about the condition of the kitchen, given the condition of what we could see (and feel), we were out the door before they could serve us chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Garcia's in some time so wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.  This Garcia's is a fairly large place and the interior is very nice.  We were seated immediately and the waiter and salsa and chips were there quickly and our drink order taken.  The chips were very large and warm.  The salsa was mild but the bean dip that they also brought was much spicier (good first impression with large warm chips and bean dip along with salsa!).      I ordered a two item lunch with a sour cream chicken enchilada and a red chili colorado burrito.  I thought both were very good.  They were large and the plate had lots of refried beans and a scoop of rice (I am not much into rice so glad it didn't overwhelm the plate like in some places).  My wife had the cheese enchillada and tostado which she liked quite a bit as well.  The waiter was attentive with the drinks and extra salsa (and I did like the way they gave us both a serving of salsa rather than having to dip from one dish).        The only reason for not giving the place a 5 star is just the lack of alternative meats as in prevalent here in Phoenix such as adobada, machaca, barbacoa, carnitas, etc.  I know they have stores in California as well and that is all most restaurants there serve is the chicken, ground beef, and shredded beef.  Other than that though, we enjoyed it and will return."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile so wife and I came in for dinner. First there was 15-20 minute wait not to bad. Got seated and they brought chips and salsa along with bean dip. Wife tried to ask for hot salsa and before she could get a word out the girl who brought the chips left. Then our waitress came by really friendly asked what we would like to drink. After giving drink order my wife asked if she could get hot salsa.  Waitress said sure and asked if she would like to try the green also my wife said sure. 10 minutes later waitress came back asked if we knew what we wanted so we order appetizer and our meals. 10-15 minutes later we received our appetizer. Still no hot salsa or green salsa. We eat the appetizer and my soda was gone. Good comes and before I could ask for refill which you should never have to ask at a restaurant I was going to she was gone. Wife and I ate then we saw the waitress helping some one close by we flagged her down before she could get away to ask for Togo boxes and our check. She said sure and then asked if I would like a refill by this point I was just ready to leave and didn't want to wait for another drink. Now with all that said I gave 2 stars for the food it was really good. Service was really bad. I don't know if it was the waitress or she was over worked with to many stations but in all its up to the restaurant to compensate so the servers can do their jobs. Like I said she was really nice and friendly if she could have delivered on the service side this would have been 5 star.  *****6/3/16 came back in to try out the service again. 25 minute wait at door not bad waits happen. Got seated a little sooner. Ernesto was our server and he did a great job. I watched Ernesto with his other customers and he was very attentive with everyone. Didn't mention last time I went the music from the cantina was really loud in the dining room and could hardly talk to my wife, however this visit was much better I noticed they made some changes and it was much better. After today's experience I would continue to go there and done again. I hope they keep up what they are doing."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it was Excellent!  Myself, Wife and kids all went here for the first time. We all were very impressed with all our meals. I went off the reviews off my phone, and tried it for myself. The great reviews are true, this place is really that good. Everything was top notch. I had the enchilada combo, the sour cream blend chicken was superb, as well as the others. Everything you can tell was made with care. We all were very impressed with the food and the quality and taste. This will be my favorite Mexican food restaurant.   It's just too bad it's soo far away from us..."}
{"text":"The staff here is so strange. The hosts walked away a few times before acknowledging us, then walked us to a booth while stopping to joke around with the staff along the way. The waiter(s) ignored us, we're rude, and strange. He handed everything to the person who sat on the end to distribute the food, did not really listen to us and walked away. It was an odd experience. The food isn't anything to brag about not worth coming back or recommending."}
{"text":"Bleh. First, any \"Mexican\" restaurant with ground beef on the menu is not authentic. Second, this stuff is not fresh. I asked whether they could cook my steak for the steak burrito medium, and the waiter said the steak was \"precooked.\"  So, I asked for steak and shrimp fajitas. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium, and it was harder than an old sponge (nasty). I ate here last night and asked for medium rare steak fajitas, and they came out very rare (still mooing). Rule of thumb: do not order steak from here.  Also, buyer beware!  My coworker literally could not put her fork through the tamale she ordered ... Someone overheated a frozen tamale!"}
{"text":"Garcia's was recommended by someone at our hotel so didn't read any reviews. Sometimes they give you preconceptions. The chips were thin and crispy (good) and the salsa was ok but the bean dip was delicious. Husband had the shredded beef burrito and I had shredded beef flautas because I wanted something with crunchy shell and included guacamole. We each enjoyed what we ordered very much. Husband liked the rice better than I did. Black beans and refried beans were good, too. Then...got dessert. Oh my. The chocolate mini chimis are what dessert should be. Cream cheese filled fried chocolate mini chimis with big scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by whipped cream and topped with chocolate and caramel sauces. Done."}
{"text":"Good happy hour! $2.00 cover get's you a buffet and like music that is actually good. for some reason though the sound system kept cutting out. I guess the forgot to pay the electric bill."}
{"text":"I just love this place. Chips and salsa and more recently the bean dip are amazing. They are always playing some salsa in the background. It's always clean, I've been coming here more than 20 years with my family. Service is always prompt, rarely have to wait. Pretty much everything on the menu is great. I always get the pollo fundido. On the weekends the bar side has live music. Usually Mexican music. I will always come here. I love everything about it. Childhood restaurant."}
{"text":"A year or more ago before Embassy Suites took over this restaurant, I would have given it five stars. Past few times I have been here, the wait svc and the kitchen have been extremely slow. Soup came out lukewarm but I did not send it back because I had waited about 30 mins for.it. Bean dip is not as delicious as it used to be, salsa is good but not consistent, fries were cooked in grease that tasted like it needs to be changed. It has changed to a place that's in a hotel, run by a hotel that expects a captive audience. It's a shame... As this place used to be the best kept secret in Tempe."}
{"text":"It's interesting that Garcia's is tucked away in the Embassy Suites.  I think it probably works out for both parties since there are barely any restaurants in the area and hotel guests are forced to come and order here......damn them.  And as a hotel guest I did just that, but I ordered it to go.  I don't know what the standard for mexican cuisine is here, but Garcias is just shy of a typical Chevy's, maybe not even as good.  I was starving, so I went on a binge and went with the 3 item meal, but then who knew I ended up going on a diet:  -Enchilada - this was ok, and mostly because of the sauce and how they drenched everything in melted cheese.  -Chile Releno - melted cheese is good....but TOO much melted cheese is just death  -Tamale - one bite.....and that's all I had and nothing more because it sucked.  And the guacamole and other sauces were mediocre.  I guess when you're part of a hotel and have a steady flow of guests come in, you can slack on the quality of the dishes.  sad.....truly sad."}
{"text":"Came in here during my lunch break. Yelp has pretty average reviews and it was close to work. I got greeted very fast and sat decided to sit at the bar. Right away I noticed it was very dark and 70s music playing not quit what I was expecting from a Mexican restaurant.   Got the rolled tacos and within minutes got my food. Pretty fast which makes me think the food was sitting there, but i could be wrong. Overall was descent: tacos were good, beans ok, and rice was very dry.   My waitress kept sitting down by the bar and had to ask another waitress for extra food."}
{"text":"The service was great here, but unfortunately the food was not. The enchiladas were served with minimum sauce. The taco did not have any flavor. I really want to support businesses close to home, but I can't this one. It was my second time back and will be my last. you know if you are going to pay $13-16 dollars for a two item plate you want it to have some flavor. I will have to drive out to La Pinata's or el comedor on I-17 and central. Such nice staff. I hope that business can survive."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about this location.   The food is always good.  The service can be so so.  It really depends on your server.  There is an older gentleman, whose name I do not recall, that we had the other day.  Yes he was pretty slow.  Another person coming through actually brought our food and refilled our drinks for us.  The food however is always very good.  The bean dip is fabulous. I like the decor of the restaurant also.  If you want good food Garcia's is a good place.  At times the service can be slow but it is always courteous."}
{"text":"My birthday dinner was at this Garcia's with my mom. It was a great meal and I would definitely come back at some point.   Upon entry, we realized that we were going to have to wait for the line of people before us to get seated. They told us it would be about 30 minutes. That turned out to be about right. So we hung out in the front lobby, waiting for a seat to open up.   When it finally did, we were taken to a nice booth near the back. Our server, a young hispanic guy, was very friendly and quick to take our orders. Because it was pretty busy, he wasn't the greatest about getting back to us for refills though.   The food was excellent overall. I had enchiladas and a cheese crisp, my mom had the tacos. The chips and salsa were also great. In the end, we enjoyed a great dinner at this Garcia's. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is very good and the menu is pretty extensive. The complimentary chips and bean dip are awesome. The only negative is the atmosphere. The restaurant is pretty run down and not the cleanest. Not a bad place to eat but definitely not for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  The bartender was grouchy and overcharged us. We will not be back even though we enjoyed the karoake."}
{"text":"I'm easy to please when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I will usually order the same items if my faves are on the menu. So I was happy to order the Espinaca Con Queso: Spinach and Queso with Jalapenos, Onions and Peppers. Love love love their dip here. I always add a bowl of Tortilla Soup. I have to be careful because the Chips and Salsa are always on the table before the dip arrives and I can go through all the chips if I allow myself. Maybe one day I'll try a few other items on their menu. Service is always amazing and courteous. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Great authentic bean dip, the entrees are high on carbs and short on protein."}
{"text":"I don't like going to chain \"Mexican\" restaurants like this.  I don't think they are all that good and all serve the same crap.  The only reason I was here was because I was going bowling across the street.  It was about 9pm on a Saturday night and the place was pretty dead.  I enjoyed the chips and the spicy bean dip stuff they give you to munch on.  The fajita platter I split with my wife was also pretty good.  The steak was excellent and the chicken and shrimp were good as well.  You can't really screw up fajitas (I hope), but it was all a pretty standard meal for this type of place (Garcia's, Macyo's, etc.).  The service was also very good.  Our waiter was fast and friendly and my diet coke was never empty."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Old building. Uncomfortable seats. Average wait staff. Then Tuesday, May 24th happened. Brought my family there for my son's 8th grade promotion. Not overly busy but obviously not staffed well. Was told 30 minute wait for my party of 9. 50 minutes later we were still patiently waiting when a party of 20 came in and asked to be seated. They were given an hour wait time, but was seated before us. We walked out. The hostess was immature and not one soul came to us to say how much longer we would wait. It was a slap in the face to be such gracious and patient guests, waiting to be treated to an average meal and then be passed for a larger party. Poor quality service. The only reason we would come back would be convenience, but even so, this was such a terrible time that if we do go back, it will be a long while. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Newly opened at Thomas and 46th Street.  Great staff, great food.  A little on the slow side, but I think with time that will work itself out.  It is a new location after all."}
{"text":"Delicious food for really great prices! Meals are all around $10, but you will definitely have some to take home! The chips and salsa that they give you before the meal are also really good. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Come here often and every time I wish I hadn't. The best time to go is right at opening 11 am. For some reason everytime we go we get the same RUDE waiter \"Jesse\" who is ALWAYS in some kind of rush and spills when he is refilling drinks and never let's us finish a sentence before rushing off. The salsa is always great and consistent but the food is mediocre. I need to keep that in mind before we go back."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month. I love that when we get our chips they serve it with salsa AND beans. I will usually get the Pollo Fundido or the Avocado Chicken Salad. Both are delicious. The restaurant itself is kind of out dated but it it's your standard Mexican restaurant décor."}
{"text":"The first time i went there my experience  was not very good second time i met melissa she is a awsome waitress i highly recommend her she pays attention to customers needs  and very attentive thank you ."}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona as long as Garcia's has been a household name for Mexican food.  Let me begin this review with the positives that earned this place 3 stars...  They serve free bean dip with their chips and salsa.  Many other places charge $5-8 for this, but Garcia's brings it for free in an unlimited supply.  Their salsa is fresh and on point.    The food, for the most part, is decent; even good.  But here is where they seriously disappoint.  This place is lit like a bat cave, and if you look around you can see why.  It's dated.  Like old, grandma dated.  It's filthy in spots, and the upholstery is completely disintegrated.  If you are sat in a booth, you will notice the springs are completely gone.  It's like being a tiny toddler at an adult's table.  They serve the same dishes they did 40 years ago.  There hasn't been a new or exciting dish on that menu in decades.  I'm not sure why this place looks like they have given up.  Where has the passion gone?  The decor is such a vast, ghastly affair, that if one didn't know they actually had decent food, they would run for the hills.  The cantina area looks like someone hacked it to death with a hatchet.  It's awful.  The karaoke night is the worst I've ever experienced... the locals who can barely talk, let alone sing, frequent here.  Terrible.    I suggest the Garcia's family put some money into fixing this place up before the business completely dries up.  This is the time to do it.  The area has been labeled \"blighted\" by the city of Phoenix and many strip malls are remodeling and renovating.  Don't get lost in the mix.  Bring this restaurant back to it's former glory and make it exciting again."}
{"text":"best garcia's in town the place is always empty, the tortilla soup is better here than the other locations ive been too. the interior is more upscale than the other locations. even the plates are nicer and food looks like a gourmet chef makes it. The other garcias it comes out looking like it was fast food out of a wrapper or something. i drive out of my way to eat at this location. same friendly waitress every time i go."}
{"text":"Every since our favorite Mexican Restaurant ( La Rosa's ) closed many years ago we have been patronizing Garcia's ( 35th Ave & Peoria ) whenever we are in the mood for decent mexican food at a reasonable place, price and at a sit down restaurant.  The prices are very affordable.  You can literally buy the three item combo with rice and beans for $11.99 and feed two people and with the unlimited chips, bean dip and salsa your stomach will be begging you to stop eating.  Well since I am fat I like to buy the two item combo ( $10.99 ) with rice and beans.  The soda's are always fresh.  The margaritas look very delicious but I am not sure of taste or quality or even the price because I usually just pop in for lunch but one of these days I will give it a try.  I was at Garcia's last Saturday and they had a special of two cheese enchilada's with rice and beans for $6.99.  Are you kidding me ?  That's an amazing price.  Service is always prompt.  They are happy to see you and serve you.  In closing, I am not saying its the best mexican food in Phoenix but Garcia's offers the best service and price in town at least at this location."}
{"text":"Today our dinner was not very good nor was the service. Waitress was not frindly at all more or seemed very put out when she was asked for anything. We got 2 cheese crisps well they were crisp alright burnt, the red chile burrito the meat was tough and 3rd the fish tacos also were very well done. They were not very busy not the best night to take my daughter out for her High School graduation dinner. I think we all would of enjoyed taco bell more. The last time we went 2 weeks ago it was only okay I did not update my rev8then as I don't like righting negative things and was hoping it was just a off night. Guess not seems like it's going down hill. To bad guess we will be going to Popoo's on Indian School for now on. Even if the parking sucks."}
{"text":"For \"Girls Night Out\" I chose Garcia's.  I called a week in advance to set up reservations for 10.  When the night came, there was no reserved table for us.  The food tasted OK but nothing to write home to mom about.  Service was mediocre and our waiter didn't understand a word we said.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Recently redone bar adds a lot to the place! They give free chips, salsa and awesome bean dip with every purchase. I'm a sucker for the pollo fundido- won't be disappointed. Being attached to the hotel is nice with all the travelers willing to chat it up around happy hour!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain mexican restaurant & having so many choices in the Valley, I should be ashamed to go here, but I've been eating here for YEARS.  The service is generally very good, servers are friendly and quick, and the food is consistently good.  I love their salsa and bean dip they bring out with chips.  A little bit of bean dip + a lot of salsa = a happy mouth."}
{"text":"Okay, so hard to believe I am the FTR of this Garcia's location since it has been here for eon's (and looks like it) and is still one of the staple restaurants around the Metro Center area that hasn't closed down or changed.   The food is the same as it has been for the last 15+ years. Decent, not great and sadly, the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning.   For those of you reading this review who have never been to Phoenix (Arizona at all in fact) you may not be aware of the greasy deliciousness called a cheese crisp. This is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the Valley. Garcia's does make a fine cheese crisp and for that, I am still grateful and willing to go.   The one good thing I can say is the restaurant still seems to have a hopping bar area with live music a few nights a week. Good for the happy hour crowd, but since I was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch, it didn't do anything for me knowing this.   Word of warning to ladies who need to potty while in the restaurant area...The bathroom is as old as the rest of the place. One toilet so if you drink a lot, be prepared to wait your turn."}
{"text":"We keep coming back this location instead of ever trying anything new because honestly this place is great.The only complaint is that the girl who sat us last time was rude we asked her if we could sit at a booth and she said no that she had to sit us at the table because it was the next section to be seated then she came and sat the next family in the booth we wanted what the???? Anyway you should be able to sit where you want it was lunch and there were like 20 booths open hmmmmm. I love the carnitas fajitas omg and kids eat for 99cent with an adult meal on Sunday and probably other days but I'm not sure. I love the salsa and bean dip I always eat so much of it."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and never had any issues. We only come here when we are in the area. Not to confuse this place with the Original Garcia's further south on 35th ave. This location is very good, I have been to others that have not been as good.  I have had there nachos, tacos, grilled chicken. Everything has always been good, kids loved it last time, and wife has no problem coming here. The service has always been great, never have to ask for anything. Seems like every time we come here they have their nite club going on. So it can get loud up front. My two favorite mexican restaurants are Rio Mirage in Surprise, and The Original Garcia's in Phoenix. However, this location is right up their with them."}
{"text":"The staff here are super welcoming and friendly but food was mediocre. I like the generous portions of the bean and salsa appetizers, but the flavor is a little generic to me. The seafood enchiladas were loaded more with imitation crab rather than REAL crab OR more shrimp. I give Garcias three stars because of superb customer service and large servings for the price."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place over our usual Valle Luna, regrettably. All of their meats are pre-cooked in onions and tomatoes, which HELLO not everyone is a fan of. Unfortunatley, we had purchased a living social offer and had already paid prior to coming. The margaritas were extremely weak and the food was just bland. I would not reccomend this to anyone or ever come here again. Also the staff was not very helpful or friendly and the place BADLY needs a makeover those dim lights are not kidding anyone. HUGE THUMBS DOWN."}
{"text":"A lunch companion and I visited Garcias this afternoon for a quick lunch.  As we entered the restaurant  we were greeted and seated immediately. The decor in Garcias is warm and inviting with its Spanish architecture, paint, tiles and Mexican music in the background.   As we were seated our chips, salsa,  and drinks arrived almost immediately.  The chips are served hot with chunky red salsa and a refried bean dip. The chips are hot, very thin, crispy and salted perfectly and the bean dip is delicious.  The menu at Garcias has a good variety of entrees, all reasonably priced for a full service establishment. The staff at Garcias are friendly without being intrusive.  The food is delivered quickly, hot, and plated attractively with generous servings.   My lunch companion and I both had the burrito fundido which was probably one of the best I've had. Each entrée  comes with typical rice and refried beans with a little lettuce and tomato.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream which is quite good. One large scoop of vanilla ice cream that has been fried on top of a cinnamon honey crunchy tortilla with whip cream.  We enjoyed a delicious lunch at a very reasonable price.  If you're ever in the neighborhood give Garcias a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy Mexican food, but the atmosphere feels like a chain. Still worth it for the chips and salsa. This one is really close to Scottsdale Fashion Square mall."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited an hour for our food. Garcia's is known for good food but that wasn't the case. The food was bad. I do not recommend this restraunant. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a one star because the server John was awesome, super friendly and attentive. Other then that awful experience. First of all when we were sat down they sat us in a small area of table where they sat a huge party and a couple other people at in tables when the rest of the restaurant was empty. And one couple sat across the restaurant on there own. so i couldn't even hear my husband talking to me where we were seated. The floors were super dirty and gross. The salsa tasted like it came out of a can and so did the beans. When the food came out it was not good at all my meat was dry and my tortillas came out soggy. We definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Coco Motion Margarita is Sooooo GOOOOD!:D"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for bean dip (and we wanted to use our coupon for a free cheese crisp from Yelp so of course Garcia's was our only option :)   The cheese crisp was super cheesy (definitely a plus) and made even better with the variety of salsas to top it with. The chips were warm and crunchy and the bean dip was on point as always.   We ordered an el magnifico and Olivia's platters for dinner. The food is really tasty and piping hot when it comes (read: when they say it's hot so don't touch the plate, BELIEVE them!).   The service was quick - we were told it would be a 20 minute wait when we got here but they seated us in 5! Our drinks were always attended to as were refills of chips and dips. Also, you'll get a lot of food for reasonable prices.   There is a DJ on the weekends and a full bar. The atmosphere is great for families or date night."}
{"text":"I love this chain of Mexican food and was in the area so I figured I would try a new location. WHY DID I DO THAT?!?!?   This location needs to be closed and remodeled.  There are dusty dirty box fans on the ledges all over the restaurant. Server uniform looked like he had been wearing it every day all week. He was accommodating, but too busy to visit my table or stay long enough for me to finish a sentence. The two things that really told me NEVER again was: 1. I chewed on a piece of plastic that was in my chimichanga. I brought it to my servers attention. He had it taken off the bill BUT the manager on duty \"Angela\"  didn't even bother to come to my table until I specifically asked for management TWICE!  Then all she had to say was excuses \"that she didn't come over because the restaurant had too many booths for her to visit\" and she asked what was the problem, that she took the item off my bill. I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR MY BILL.  Not everyone wants a free meal, perhaps I just wanted an attentive management, an apology from management AND perhaps offered an item that did not have plastic in it. 2. I saw a huge roach in the bathroom. I will not be visiting this location again! And I hope this isn't the beginning of bad experiences for me at Garcia's because it truly is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim ordering via Delicious Deliveries, the restaurant delivery service. Now, I kept my expectations low considering we were having it delivered instead of dining in the restaurant. (No, we're not lazy, I swear. It was midterm season.) Even with that in mind, we're concluding if we were some strange alien species visiting the planet for the first time and ate what we ate here, we would turn around and never come back.  I had chicken and beef flautas and a beef tamale with green chili a la carte while my friend ordered a chimichanga. My friend went to town on his chimichanga, actually lifting his head before the meal was finished, which is always a bad sign. Apparently, it was bland and dry - now with sauce gushing out of its every orifice, that's a pretty \"amazing\" achievement.   The beef tamale was \"eh\" - slightly higher than \"urgh\" but lower than \"meh\" on the yummy scale. The flautas were cooked to a crisp. So crispy, in fact, I could almost hear my father screaming in slow-mo about carcinogens while staring at the blackened ends. So I turned to the sopapillas, certain that at least they couldn't mess up dessert. (They could.) The sopapillas were hard and overcooked - how in the world do you mess up sopapillas?! C'mon! They were also so saturated with cinnamon sugar that I took a knife, scraped the excess away, and had enough to top an additional fifteen sopapillas. Pretty much the only thing that was somewhat tasty was the cream cheese concoction that came with the sopapillas.  And to think we suffered the after-effects of Mexican food without ever really enjoying the benefits... laaaame."}
{"text":"Garcias is so good I can never decide what to order because it all looks so good! Great place for happy hour! Love the character of the place!"}
{"text":"Went as a relatively large group. Unfortunately, I remember this place when it was packed and thriving - in its heyday! But, it's still very good. Very friendly service from Micaela. She really took good care of us. The food was absolutely delicious. I got a taco salad and a quesadilla. Very good!"}
{"text":"I ordered food on the Yelp app and it claimed to only take 10-20 min to make. I gave a good 30 min before I called the restaurant and nobody answered. When I showed up to the restaurant I wasn't greeted or helped for 15 min and when I was they claimed to not have my order. I re-ordered and waited another 30 min for my food. Honestly I don't know why I come back the food is never hot when I get it, terrible service, rude waitresses and hostesses were not attentive of their customers."}
{"text":"Meet up with some friends Sat night to have some dinner before I painted the town red, we all had decided on going to Garcia's, meet up time was 7pm, and were a group of 10 or more, and we didn't have wait long to be seated, which was nice.  I wanted to try something different this time, I normally do burritos or beef tacos, but I am trying to eat just a little bit healthier and lose some weight, so I decided to try the Grilled Fish Tacos  I told our waiter what I wanted, and on the menu it says your choice of beans, refried, churro, or black, our waiter didn't even ask, and to be honest I am ok with whatever showed up on my plate. Now the menu description was Two corn tortillas with grilled tilapia, tomatillo mayonnaise, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro. Served with a side of salsa de piña,  that right their got me craving the salsa of pina, which in my white girl head flipped it to pineapple salsa, man doesn't that sound delish and I was so sure that it would go so well with grilled tilapia, like how mango salsa is grilled chickens best friend. But guess what, I couldn't tell you, it never showed up, the one thing I was looking for and it didn't show up, was super bummed. The type beans I wound up were charro, like I said I was easy going on that part. The grilled talapia lacked flavor too, it was sort of bland.  I understand that it was a Sat night and we were a big group and the place was busy, but I had to flag out waiter down to even ask for our checks, he just kept disappearing, and wasn't very attentive, never once asked any of us if our meals were ok, just sort of gave us our plates and left and just ignored our table, so I never even got the chance to ask for the salsa de pina. Saw his tip was already included on the bill since we were a big party, which I expected, but I just don't like when the tip is already added and the server didn't really do anything to earn it, but its part of the going out and eating beast, sometimes service is spot on or better and sometimes we get treated like the red headed step child.  One of my friends even had food fall of the plate down her back when he was picking up our plates and never once did he say sorry.   Wouldn't blame her if she didn't want to go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite family owned Mexican food spots in town. My momma used to bring me here when I was a kid. Now I know she brought me here because you can almost surely plump yourselves up on their amazing chips/salsa/bean dip!   Try the pollo fundido or chicken wrap...heck try it all!! I've never had a bad dish no matter what I picked."}
{"text":"An average Mexican restaurant all things considered. Food quality was not that great, service was pleasant, order takes too long too come even if its not a busy time. Valle Luna up the street on Bell seems like a better alternative and is in the same price range."}
{"text":"So I have to start by saying that I come here for the food and margaritas but definitely not the service. It seems that no matter when we go, the service is always lacking in some way. But frankly this is one instance that I will put up with that to get me some delicious food. They start out by bringing chips and salsa as well as a bean dip which is good. The salsa is mild. Then take your pick. I have had many things but their El Pollo Fundido is the BEST! Add a margarita or two and top it off with some sopapillas with sweet cream cheese for dessert and I am in heaven!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Garcia's in at least 5 years.  I have nothing good to say about  the experience last night, except that the chips and salsas were good.  First, it was too hot inside.  I am not one of those ladies that gets too hot or too cold and complains all the time; it was ridiculously hot at our booth.  Second, the waiter told me that he didn't know why they listed some of the wines on the wine list because they don't have them.  There were 6 chardonnays to choose from and then he said they had none.  The beer I settled for arrived in a glass that was not chilled and it was not cold enough to enjoy so I left half of it.  The chicken on the plate was tough and dry but smothered in cream cheese sauce.  My date ordered a side salad which arrived with no dressing.  He wanted a salad instead of rice and beans, but the waiter didn't quite understand and brought out one dry salad before his meal- he had to ask for dressing.  Finally, the prices are just too high!  Each of our meals was $11.99 and each beer was $4.25 on a Friday night at 5:30 pm-- come on!  How about a happy hour special for the regular diners who don't want to be in the loud cantina crowd?  I felt that the meals were worth about $6.99 and maybe $2.50 for beers.  I will not go back :("}
{"text":"This Garcia's is located in the Phoenix area.   Back in the 90's I remembered Garcia's being a pretty decent Mexican restaurant. I don't know what happened, but this is Calimex, not Mexican. First we ordered enchiladas. We asked if they had red chile. The waitress said, \"What?\" I was like,.. nevermind, you don't. She then said, \"You mean like a jalapeno?\" - \"No, red chile sauce, like you pour on enchiladas\". She then said something like, \"No, we have a tomato like sauce, but not jalapeno sauce\". It was clear she had NO idea what chile was. So we get our plate, it had some sort of brown sauce, and the meat was tasteless. Really gross. They brought \"salsa\" and chips (kinda late, after we started our meal), and the salsa tasted like marinara sauce. Again, gross. Overall, the food was disgusting. We won't be going back.  Do not confuse this Garcia's in Arizona with the Garcia's in New Mexico. Two totally different franchises."}
{"text":"I have not been to Garcias in a few years and I must say I will not be back.  The bar was so loud I could hardly hear my wife.  The waiter was the most bland person ever.  He never smiled, asked us what we wanted and at the end pretty much threw the bill on the table and said you pay me.  Also my wife made a mistake and ordered something with meat, she is a vegitarian.  I realize it was her fault but when I mentioned it to the waiter it would have been nice if he offered her something else instead of saying oh.  At least the food was good"}
{"text":"Despite other reviews, I liked this place. It's close by and relatively cheap Mexican that serves huge portions. It's like comfort Mexican food and they usually have a deal on Margaritas. I thought the food was good especially their salsa, fresh tortillas, and bean dip. Also they have something I forget what its called but its marinated pinto beans that's really good. They could use more than one bathroom in the girls room just saying."}
{"text":"Lived near this place for seven years and was looking to locate a nearer Mexican restaurant to my house than taking  a drive to Manuels.    Saying Mexican food in the UK means pretty much one kind of cuisine and a fixed range of flavors, here we at least have attempts at many variations and regions ( though mostly from the USA it seems) and this is what I would consider to be the default  for  the type.    Nothing too spicy,sadly, and not much more than choosing your arrangement of beans, flour ,meat and cheese in slightly differing patterns. I rather like the red chili they have and wouldn't mind it isolated from it's floury strait-jacket the next time I go here. All fresh, all hot, all tasty  if you are in the mode for Mexican a la USA without needing to shoot yourself for going into \"On the Border\"   Service really good on the Sunday AM  (kids eat free)  food is generic to a fault and if they were to the cheaper side of the street it would be 3.5 and pushing it close to 4  but  this may as well be  Macao's or a Manuel's for all the difference it makes."}
{"text":"Good food, crap service. We were ignored and treated like our money didn't matter!   Once they saw a credit card they decided to smile. Haha, no thanks. I've been coming to this place for years and it's just been slowly going downhill."}
{"text":"I don't know what some of the other people are saying, but I personally enjoy coming to this particular Garcia's. I really enjoy their salsa and bean dip (free). Their bean dip is sort of spicy, so it sometimes has a nice little kick. Mixing the salsa and bean dip is a winner for me. I also enjoy their food and the service has always been average or above average, but not terrible.  I always order the same thing from mexican food restaurants: 2 enchiladas rice and beans or 1 enchilada 1 chicken taco rice and beans and Garcia's was just as good as the rest.  I am usually so full from chips and salsa that I only eat half and the left overs are muy bueno. :-)"}
{"text":"I must say I was not completely satisfied with my visit.  Restaurant's ambiance was like many typical Mexican Food restaurants where there were many seating areas/sections and rooms.   We were seated at a booth where I completely sunk into the cushion. The seat and foam endured so much wear and tare that it was not firm and I felt like I needed a booster seat. We asked to be moved and the waitress sat us in a booth that she said was remodeled/upholstered. It was much better!  The salsa and bean dip was good. I have definitely had better at other places. But nothing to complain about.  I has the pork chili verde with rice and beans. The taste and seasoning was decent however it lacked the meat. Not sure if I got the bottom of the pot, but definitely barely any meat.  We also had the beef enchiladas and I believe that was good since the plate completely polished.   I wouldn't say the menu is simple, there are definitely choices - primarily the more popular common dishes.  If you're looking for more authentic dishes, this is NOT the place. They didn't even have shrimp ceviche!  The one good thing was the frozen coconut margarita which was surprisingly very good! I have never had this flavor of margarita and was glad they had it! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went to eat New Year's Day the service was mediocre and the combination plate looked sloppy with cheese and sauce all over the plate. The tacos hardly had any meat in it and when I asked about it a female manager couldn't explain if it was normal for them to put so little meat in the taco then she offered to bring me more meat instead of making me a fresh taco and when the meat came out in a bowl it was warm not hot and the shredded beef was flavorless and so was the chicken in the taco but I ate that anyway but  not flavorful at all it was like Denny's but Mexican style. Then my son orders Mac and she and a cup of fruit the fruit isn't fresh it's a pre packaged fruit cup you buy at the store with pears and peaches in it it reminded me of a packaged fruit cup they give kids at school not happy about that at all! So I told my waiter I didn't like my food and he offered me something else to eat and as he is picking up my plate he says \" I guess you weren't hungry \"I thought that was rude. Just because someone isn't happy with the food doesn't mean they weren't hungry it means they didn't like the food period. On the bright side the chips were good and the tortilla soup was good but sad to say we won't be back. The female manager on this New Year's Day at 11 didn't do much to make us feel welcomed or accommodated and  was far from apologetic she isn't as knowledgable about her kitchen as she should she did a terrible job at damage control. We won't be returning guest I suppose the neighborhood is right Don Rubens and Parilla Suiza are the best Mexican restaurants as far as flavor presentation and quality of service"}
{"text":"While the food was fine, the service was, um, interesting...  The poor host looked like he was shuffling three jobs all at once, and it took a while to get seated.  Once we were seated chips and salsa hit our table almost immediately and our waitress Miriam took our drink orders from behind a pole.   She did bring out the hot salsa when I asked for it, and took our order.   After our food hit the table, the next time we saw her was to drop off the check.  At this point, I guess that she didn't want any more of our money for desert.   So, we're going to go somewhere else for sopapillas...  We're going to give the place another try, but during a different shift."}
{"text":"If possible, ask to sit in Jenn's section. She is basically awesome. Courteous, patient, prompt, and personable. We've sat in her section before, and she never disappoints.  As for the food... SO good. I honestly would go just to eat chips, vats full of salsa, and cheese crisps. But the fajitas are good, and so are the burritos."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, it took too long to get seated (empty lobby), took too long to order food @930 at night..., and get out tasteless food. Our waitress disappeared several times. The tilapia was blan, served without lemon.  it took so long I was full from eating the darn chips and salsa... This is not the gracias I remembered from 25 years ago."}
{"text":"Great food, usually good service always ask for the green salsa, pollo fundito is always a safe bet for ordering, wait times are very short even on busy weekends"}
{"text":"Today my brother and sister in law were in town from California and so my family, my sister and dad decided to taken them to Garcia's. When we walked in there was no hostess. We waited for a good five minutes with a few other people ahead of us before one appeared. Once we told the woman there were seven of us she picked up the menus and started walking so we followed her. She then turned around when we got near the table and told us she was o my setting up and would come back to get us. Once we were seated our waitress quickly took our drink orders and a few minutes after she also was able to get our lunch orders . She was really great with my son and even stopped and asked me if it was ok to refill his soda which I really appreciated. I'd give five stars for the waitress. I ordered the street tacos and a bowl of tortilla soup. The soup was phenomenal, but the steak was over cooked and bland. The presentation was good as well as the black beans. Nothing really stood out to me about this place."}
{"text":"Went looking for Mexican cuisine that was within walking distance of my hotel, happened upon Garcia's. Dropped in with a group of seven and it took nearly 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take drink orders. The drinks were then brought out in shifts with the final drink appearing 5 minutes after the first one arrived. Salsa and chips were decent. I choose the shrimp tacos, which came in flour tortillas with a side of rice and beans. Tacos lacked flavor and were overwhelmed by a runny sour cream sauce. I ended up picking out the shrimp and shredding the drier areas of the tortilla to salvage my meal. The rice and beans were the highlight. Additionally, due to inattentive service, we twice had to request that our server come to our table. The restaurant itself seems a bit old and groups of people get easily held up in the skinny hallways. Overall, I'm not a fan of Garcia's."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday and this was about my third time going there. I was hoping the other two times were flukes but I'm starting to think that's just their food. The steak was just.. crappy. It was a little burnt and tasted like char on some of the pieces. Honestly, I'm giving it three stars because of their name. It should be two.   If you're not afraid to travel a little south to a slightly rougher area (really not that bad in my opinion) the original is down there. Huge, tremendous difference, worth the drive especially if you have been here and we're wholly disappointed by this place. The wait staff, hostess we're all friendly, nothing wrong with the way we were treated. It's sadly, the food itself."}
{"text":"Of the five local area Mexian resturants I frequent, Garcia's would be my favorite.  I usually have the MAGNIFICO SAMPLER, and always enjoy it.  The beans always taste fresh.  In some other plpaces, they often taste canned, but not here.  The food was just spicy enough.  I admit it, I am a whimp whenit comes to spicy food.  I do not like HOT stuff.  I prefer just a little tang with my meal.  And Garcia's always gets it right."}
{"text":"Ok... My last review really sucked, no real information - shocked it wasn't filtered.  Time for a legit review.  Partook in Garcia's this evening.  The bar is full of \"Jones\" folk.  These are Edward Jones Investment newbies. Apparently every week they fly a new crew (of about 100) in, the failure rate is 96%, but keep the contacts given during the pre-hire process. Granted, there are a few senior Financial Advisers here... They are not who I am referring to in my post.    So I walk in and I am surrounded by suits (literally... wall to wall) staring me down. For those of you who don't know me - you have to pay me to get me out of shorts and a t-shirt.  If you pay me or you are a 4-star, I will do Italian threads, but only then! Thankfully, they are all busy doing the Captain pose at the tables so there are a few seats open at the actual bar.  After no less than 6 inquiries of \"are you a Jones man?\" and 3 job offers (they claim to all make over $200k/yr, according to Glassdoor.com the average salary is $43, 257) I am finally left alone to enjoy my Grey Goose and a la carte taco.   The Goose... stellar... 9 bucks.  Average for Tempe.  Bartender (Bryan) is a real cool dude.  I felt his pain, he felt mine.  The taco is decent.  If I would have been a grease fan I would have liked it a lot more, possibly 5-stars.  I had pork (known at every other Mexican restaurant I have been to as Carnitas) and it had some flavor.  Positive points there.  The atmosphere was decent, TV's with the MNF game highlights on... I think 3 stars is both fair and generous (I am aware of the contradiction).  If you are sequestered to the hotel without a car, great option.    The service from Bryan made the experience decent.  I, however, will not be investing with Edward Jones."}
{"text":"My rating is zero stars but they force you on this app to give it stars B's in my opinion  My family and I visited this location today . It was Awful and that's putting it nicely. I walked in and waited and waited for someone to greet me and finally when they did they sat my son and I in a dirty smelly corner of the place. I have been to other locations and not had this kind of experience. Will never visit again! :(   Food was terrible!  I've never been to Mexican restaurant that serves you guacamole in ice cream scoop form and does not offer refills on chips or ice tea.   They were NOT busy  No excuse and I can't believe the health department hasn't been out to visit  I don't know how they stay open"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE your restaurant. It use to be a tradition to go to your Peoria location every Sunday night after dinner with my family and friends. We started noticing a pattern of rude service. We usually arrive around 9pm and the restaurant doesn't close til 10. It's like the waiters were annoyed that we were coming in. It has seriously been the last 5 or 6 times we visitied. We got the same 2 people a waiter and waitress and they were consistently rude. So over a period of time we've gone less. We usually decide to give it another chance and we're always disappointed. Tonight was so bad that we walked out before we were even seated. We arrived at 9 the restaurant was practically empty and we stood in the waiting area for 20 minutes waiting. A male waiter(one of the 2 rude ones) walked by where we were standing and looked at us. He walked back by us and said very loudly, \"I don't want any more people, I'm tired.\" At that point we decided that's enough. Never have we felt like our business was unwanted. It was completely rude and uncalled for."}
{"text":"Bring a thermometer when ordering to go just picked up a To Go order 2 Cheese Enchiladas dinner 11.29, I live on 43rd and Peoria get home and food is cold O.o literally like it was taken out the fridge and put in the container Ugh if I wanted cold food I would've went to Fry's and purchased out of frozen food section. At least use Styrofoam containers easier to pop in microwave smh next time I'll go to Rolando's right up the street Great food and they just scored an A rating in last inspection. I wonder what Garcia's scored?"}
{"text":"The waitress couldn't even do her job. of food was horrible.. lets say we wont be back."}
{"text":"Shoot me now.  The Winger curse strikes again.  Jen and I had a great experience at the Garcia's in the AZ Mills mall so after a long day of running around and checking out the home show at the stadium in Glendale, Jen, my brother Bill, and I, decided to eat at the Garcia's in Glendale.  I told Jen earlier in the day that some of the littler \"dive\" or \"mom and pop\" places have some of the best food.  First impression aside (mostly empty parking lot that needs an extreme makeover), we entered the lobby already occupied by a family of 7 seated and waiting. No hostess. Bartender in the other room looked at us then turned around and walked away.  We sat for about 2 minutes 2nd guessing ourselves wondering what time they opened. After another 2 minutes I walked into the bar area which had 4 people. 2 customers at the bar, the bartender, and another employee eating.  I stood there being ignored by the bartender and made eye contact with the hungry employee. I asked what time they opened they answered 11 am which spawned the question what we had to do to get seated. The bartender came out to the lobby and with a bewildered look counted out 2 menues.  We pointed at the family of 7 stating they were here first.  The bartender commented that he wasn't sure where to sit us.  I worked in restaurants for just over 21 years and if the bartender doesn't know how to seat a table then they are either a poor employee or the manager is poor employeeand didn't train them well enough. Most 14 or 15 year olds can handle that job we decided to just leave at that point.  I was pretty pissed off. 5 minutes may not seem like long time.  Well  it is.  And we won't be back to this location or any other for some time.   Bill said I've now experienced his experience at this location every time he has been there."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout nachos from here and let's just say SOGGY. Disgusting. I will never order from here again. Better off eating filibertos."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices"}
{"text":"Really good food, service, and location, prices per plate is around 9-15. Lobby and restaurant is older and a little run down, but the food makes up for that. Service was good, he wasn't a chatty super nice guy, he brought us what we needed and phoned the rest in.  Salsa could use a little less cilantro, beans were really good.  Parking was good, however at night they could use more lighting for safety"}
{"text":"My 300th review on Yelp was a Taco Bell on Ocean Ave. in San Francisco.  For my 400th, I'm moving a few notches up:  Garcia's Mexican Restaurant in Tempe, AZ.  My wife and I were exhausted and hungry after an evening meeting with our realtor.  After some deliberation, my wife suggested Garcia's  This is not the Garcia's with which she was familiar, but we know the area (near a Denny's that we frequent), and I have seen the place before, so it was easy to find.  According to my guide to Mexican restaurants (see my review of Valle Luna), Garcia's classifies as a type D, or chain-type sit-down restaurant.  I had a cheese enchilada plate and she had her usual chile relleno combo.  My meal was quite tasty.  The chips were thin--not as thin as those at Chevy's--but easily crunchable and dippable, with a good salsa and bean dip.  The enchiladas were delicious, and the rice was unusually spiced with something resembling a curry/cumin mix--very good though.  The black beans were fair.  My wife liked her relleno combo, but was surprised by the amount of breading.  She enjoyed her meal on the whole as well.  Service was friendly and we both left satisfied.  We also got a meal to go for our daughter at home, and were happy to see the large amount of chips and salsa that they packed into our to go bag.  Thank you Garcia's for a good type D Mexican meal.  Here's another place my wife and I need to frequent here in Tempe.  Next time we're tempted to go to the Denny's nearby, I'll suggest going here instead."}
{"text":"We were invited to meet for a friends birthday and have drinks.  I'll be honesty and say that I have never paid a cover charge to go in for happy hour, but it was a birthday party so we paid.  It was not crowded but it seemed noticeable that the one male server in the bar and the one bartender were overwhelmed.  In a short time it just got worse.  Understaffed on a Friday, and a holiday weekend not a great evening.  In a short time there were up to four people in the bar and still one male server on the floor.  One little girl was washing glasses, and two managers were trying to help and it look like even a chef came to help.  The fans were dirty and then they turned them on.  Not only was I worried that dust would get in our food and drinks but it became to cold to drink!!!  I am eager to try this place again sometime in the future but I hope operations get evaluated before I go back."}
{"text":"We went there after wedding rehearsal.  Great for a big family. The menu is simple. Great Mexican food. We were here for lunch. Great lunch special. No complains because we were here for vacation from Hawaii. Please check photos."}
{"text":"Garcia's always reminds me of my high school teacher, Mr. Garcia.  We all used to taunt him by saying \"hey Mr. Garcia- nah nah nah nah nah nah nah.\"   It was hilarious at the time.  I think Garcia's is pretty good for a chain Mexican food restaurant. You get salsa and a bean dip with your chips and the margaritas are huuuuuge. They have a good happy hour with a little buffet (I used to go here when I had a fake i.d. shameful, I know). All in all, I'd say it's a good alternative to the other chains...Carlos O'Brien's and Macayo's."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chips melt in your mouth as you eat them. This particular location is amazing, becuase they often are very slow and I guess this makes the service so wonderful. Half of the stars are from the outstanding service I receive EVERY time. Sodas are ALWAYS bubbly, and cheese crisp tastes like eating candy. The other food is all 'good' but nothing to shout over. I am addicted to the cheese crisp, though, if ever you go here, TRY IT. Their cheese is amazing, usually always perfectly crisped tortilla. I have also tried taquitos, which were ok, fajitas which were pretty good, etc. Most is all \"Ok\" or \"Good\" but the cheese crisp is \"Phenomenal\". Cant wait to go back! Wonderful servers. Always get treated like a VIP."}
{"text":"Well, the service was poor & the food was mediocre, at best. Even the chips & salsa were blah, once I finally got them (after the entree arrived & I asked for them).    Garcia's might be worthy of 3-4 stars in the Midwest, but this is Arizona.  You can do soooo much better!"}
{"text":"oh my gosh, do not go here!  So gross! I remember this restaurant when I was younger when we would shop at Metro Center (which used to be special too :/) My family decided to all meet here before an event downtown because it was a more central location for everyone.  Upon arrival, it was apparent they hadn't changed a thing since I was there years ago...including the paint, bathroom fixtures, tables, booths...and later I questioned if they had cleaned anything since I had been there last!  Because the food took an extraordinary amount of time to order and prepare, I went to the restroom. Mistake! when I got back I just ordered a  cheese crisp...thinking I would play it safe. I don't know how to explain it, but it smelled and looked like the bathroom and couldn't bring myself to eat it!  My family as a whole regretted our pre-event dinner choice."}
{"text":"Decided to try Garcia's restaurant based upon other reviews.  Upon entering I decided to sit at the bar which was quite large however I was the only person sitting there which seemed a bit odd. The bartender was friendly enough however there seemed to be a lot of staff just milling around doing nothing.  After ordering a Sol I placed my order to have the Carnitas tacos served without onions. Chips, salsa and a bean dip were served prior to the meal coming out. The  salsa was amazing and some of the freshest I've had but the bean dip just basically tasted like refried beans.  The Carnitas tacos came out and looked nice on the plate however the plate felt like it was about 150° which likely means it was flash heated to melt cheese. The result was the rice was dried out and the tacos were lacking any real flavor."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Chocolate chimi for dessert...need I say more?  Try anything, everything is awesome...  EAT. HERE. NOW."}
{"text":"Valle Luna's is better in every way. Flavor, venue, and serving staff. We had to call down the waitress for refills twice and she seemed upset the whole evening with all the tables she waited on.  Charged us for chicken in our burrito but didn't tell us the charge beforehand. In reality, on food alone I would have given this place the same poor rating"}
{"text":"Food was pretty dang good and service was great. It was really nice not to have to track down your server to get a refill on your drink or beer. Our server, Marcus, was very friendly, attentive and quick. Prices were good too! Kids loved it. Go for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Usually the service here is average but tonight the service was absolutely horrible. The server was rude and disrespectful. He tossed plates on the table, never brought refills and when the food was prepared wrong he made it seem like an inconvenience we asked for it to be fixed. The food tonight was good once we received what was ordered. After tonight's experience I don't believe we will be dinning back at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Details..   .. Week long corporate training (all expenses paid).   .. Party of ~15 on a Monday night.  Advice..   .. Go somewhere else to eat. I'm sure even the Denny's across the street is better than this place.  NO prOs.. =\  cOns..   .. It took 15+ minutes for the server to take our drink order - meaning we didn't order our food until almost 30 minutes after we were seated.   .. The food took almost an hour to come out.   .. The food was cold when it finally did reach us.  mOre..   .. While I understand that large parties are harder to accommodate, the service we received was laughable. It's not to say the servers were rude, but it is NOT suppose to take almost 2 hours after being seated to receive cold food. The servers tried (continually bringing chip & salsa refills), but whatever the kitchen staff was doing (or not doing) was unacceptable. It would've been slightly justifiable if the food was good.. but it was barely edible."}
{"text":"This visit would have been a 5 stars Issue 1. Order was not put in on time  Created  Issue 2 . Waiting 30 minutes before the food finally came out.  As she was putting plates down i decided to asked  \"what happened \"...... to my complete Surprise Lucy owned it and said it was overlooked and she said it was her fault.  We were no worse for the wear   All and all mor a bad diner  Carne Asada Street Tacos were MONSTER."}
{"text":"Pollo Fundido. Pollo Fundido. Pollo Fundido. Pollo Fundido.  Whether you haven't been at all or you haven't partaken in this dish, you must visit as soon as possible and order this right away. The chips and salsa are fantastic but don't overdo them, you'll need to ensure you have room for the main course.  Go there. Try it. Nothing more need be said, you will completely understand."}
{"text":"Had the build your own combo, with the shredded beef enchilada, the chile relleno, and a shredded beef taco.  It came with spanish rice and refied beans.    The food was good, taste was spot on for tex-mex which reminded me of Texas, and the service was quick, friendly and attentive.  Not the most exciting Mexican food I've had for sure, but for today, it was a good meal."}
{"text":"I rarely come to this one as I go to the one on 35th ave and McDowell and as of today that will change . Today I experienced the best customer service  over the phone . I spoke with Ryan who took my order and made a stressful order a very convenient one ( for me ). My order was placed around noon and I can only imagine that is one of the busier hours as it is lunch time. Ryan had a very up beat attitude and I am appreciative that he spent more time telling me what he could do for me rather than what he could not do for me. Ryan needs to be a trainer to show in detail how customer service should really be done ."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever gotten!! For a chained restaurant I would be embarrassed if I owned Gracias!! I walked in the hostess was very rude so I walked into the bar and sat in the bar for 15 minutes before  anyone came to greet me! The manager walked past me twice and didn't say a word plus other employees the poor old bartender you just feel bad for! There was only three other tables in the \"cantina\" area but he had no help just employees walking around talking to each other and the manager! It was very obvious I was a new customer in the big empty bar area! Never been so disappointed in a place haven't been to Gracias in forever and won't be back two tables sat dirty with dishes for over 30 minutes before someone came to clean them!!! Would not recommend this place to someone I hated! And I would fire the manager or whatever her position is walking around with keys bossing people around but can't make time to greet a customer seating for 15 minutes with no menu, drink, or a decent be with you in a few! never again and if I didn't feel bad for the bartender that is older then my parents I wouldn't have tipped:-( don't come her for the food or service!!!"}
{"text":"When I was a child, dad took me to this little hole in the wall place off 35th and Thomas -with dark red carpet, felt paintings of bullfighters, and checkered table cloths with the signature candle at each table.  That was 40yrs ago.   Tonight, we waited almost 10 minutes to even see a hostess at the front door.  15 minutes to get a table, and a waiter who walked off while l was talking at least twice.   The cheese enchiladas (my childhood favorite) taste the same.  The food has always been good.  I've watched this tiny family business grow across the valley into these big fancy places. I have always been a fan.  Tonight...I was severely disappointed in the extremely poor service.  The margarita was weak, and far inferior to other Mexican restaurants.  Hope they get their act together...because I would like to be a fan again...someday"}
{"text":"Not horrible not good ... Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but 0 for 5 on attempts."}
{"text":"A,\"new\" find for us!!  Food is abundantly served and the beverages are a wonderful treat. Fun layed back atmosphere with great service and upbeat environment. Go for it!!"}
{"text":"We visit this place 3-4 times a month. Mostly on Sundays because kids eat free. This location has a great outdoor patio - perfect for this time of year. I am a huge fan of the sour cream enchiladas!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time! Love this place!! The food and service is always amazing. Been going here since I was a little girl. They have the BEST pollo fundido I've EVER had! Their fajitas are to die for. I love their chips, salsa and bean dip, too! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"When clients came to town wanting a Mexican flavor - but something really casual - we took them here. This happened more often that you might think really.  And while it worked great for the really casual folks, the building itself is nice enough that for folks who are normally anything but casual, they feel comfortable too.    In this location service has always been wonderful, but the star is really the decor.  While the food is clearly \"chain\" food, the location is built in a \"we take pride in this location\" kind of way.  Good lighting through the place.  Pretty cozy bar area - though there are enough tables to support a larger group.    Everything in here just feels so cozy and comfortable - including the really nice wait area, that you almost forget you are in a big chain. Much \"nicer\" experience overall than most of their other locations."}
{"text":"I don't know why I thought my next visit here would be any different than the last. This time I ordered my food, which when I went to pick it up the hostess informed me that she had no ticket for my order.. weird, I had a confirmation email for it. Not even 5 minutes later she comes back with my receipt, I give her the payment, she never gives me back my change. It took over an hour for my food to be ready, when originally it was only going to take 10-30 minutes. So annoying. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"this place is hit or miss for me. i really wanted to give it a 4 star review but there's just some inconsistencies whenever i dine here. the customer service is good as the servers were always nice. they provide unlimited chips and salsa. we liked their grilled fish tacos but their seafood fundido is a miss."}
