{"text":"Went here on a date during the summer on a patio. Kind of like a crappy version of Bier Markt. Beer was really expensive like $15 a bottle.   Crowd is older like 35 - 45 type deal, all in suits. Mind you we went on a Wednesday night so that's to be expected.  Patio is like a corridor, almost in an alleyway but definitely not the main attraction. The action is inside usually during the winter, but not a great patio place. This is more of the place you'd go to for a business lunch if your office is close."}
{"text":"An upscale yet casual and chill bar with a fun, retro atmosphere on King St.  Overall great food and huge selection of beers! Their beers, mussels, and Belgian frites are really popular. We loved the Spicy Beef Tacos and Belgian White Mussels. The Bistro Salad was good, nothing special. The Lamb Shortloin tasted okay and is overpriced, as there was much more of the chickpea salad than lamb pieces.  Our server was fantastic- unfortunately I didn't catch her name :/ She was super attentive and helpful taking our orders, recommending and offering us tasters of different draft beers."}
{"text":"Damn good beer and the food is top notch as well.  Our bartender, I think his name was David, was phenomenal.  Next time I'm in Tdot I'm there."}
{"text":"I've been to Beer Bistro more times than I can count on my hands and toes and to be frank their beer selection never fails to impress me.  The wait-staff is always delivering impeccable customer service, with the only problem being that the place is sometimes too small to accommodate a large walk-in group that on occasion I have brought to the place.  As much as their beer menu is diverse and amazing, and their dessert menu (beer screams and the dessert trio are all I've tried) is to die for; their food menu is a bit on the shy side: It hasn't changed in quite a while and can not satisfy the health-conscious trends that have been sweeping Toronto.  Their food is typically neither gluten-free (although a few of their beers are), nor vegan or organic.  Granted the food that they do have is often amazing; if you're on a diet note that you will be forced to sacrifice some of your principles to eat here."}
{"text":"Amazing beer list. Maudite short rib pizza was really nice."}
{"text":"The Beer Bistro is by far the friendliest place to go for a couple of pints if you work in the Yonge and King area. The first time I set foot into the place was over 4 years back. I ordered a bottle of Liberty Ale, and was instantly hooked. I have tried numerous other beers over the years, but I am a true believer in love at first sight, so I always go back to my favorite. Great mix of beer nuts available, and the best time to go is before the evening rush."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some drinks and food before we left. Not disappointed! I know practically nothing about beer, so I had to make my selection based on where it was from and the name. The beertender brought it over to our table and poured it for me and talked me through what it was and the tasting notes. I had the mussels, Belgian White style. They were tender and incredibly flavorful. The portion size of the mussels blew me away! There were so many, I couldn't finish! Which was a shame, I know. Mussels were served with a delicious loaf of a mild sourdough. The sourdough was perfectly balanced as to not over power the broth. Also had the truffled potato perogies. Don't pass these up!!! They were served with a topping of caramelized onions. Unreal!!! Service was great and food was amazing! Try the Pinot blanc wine."}
{"text":"A company that is truly invested in opening guests eyes to the craft of beer. Fans of beer and committed beer non-drinkers will discover a new love of what beer really is along with some great food and attentive service."}
{"text":"Excellent new years eve lunch. Great beer selection and attentive service. Highly recommend their mussels in white wine. Burger was cooked to perfection. Short rib pizza is a+. Frites were more soggy than I would have liked. Did I mention they have an amazing selection of beer!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Beer Bistro.   #1, great beer menu with information about their beers, and recommended pairings both on the beer menu and the food menu, AND knowledgeable servers and bartenders who can help you find a beer you'll like.   #2, The Best Fries in Toronto bar none (Belgian Frites). Blanched in duck fat, they are crispy, salty, and delicious, served in a cone with mayonnaise, and their special smokey ketchup.   #3, Very good mussels. Served with crusty bread, with something like 10 options for broth and a special bowl that makes dipping easy. The broths have big chunks of the ingredients in them too, really halfway to a stew.   #4, Great menu. Not long, and changes frequently, but they do unique things, and they do them very well. The gourmet dog is a great idea. Last weekend it was a venison dog. i didn't have it, but heard great things.  This is my favourite place for a beer, or for dinner in the financial district in Toronto. The only challenge, you have to make a reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, service as well, chef is hilarious, best table in the restaurant is at the open kitchen...highly recommend if you visit downtown toronto!"}
{"text":"Solid place for a casual lunch or late night snacking and boozing in the financial district.   Food - Never had a bad meal here. Everything is either slightly above average or super tasty. Duck fat fries and mussel bowls are hearty, filling and flavorful  Drinks - well-constructed and diversified beer menu, you can tell that it was thoughtfully composed and not an overwhelming volume like the telephone book you get at bier market   Service - bar staff is very good, attentive and knowledgeable on beers and eager to make recommendations to suit your palate. They also do quirky little tricks like balancing bottles on their head while wildly gesticulating to an audience of no one in particular when they think no one is looking. Simply charming. The lunch staff is slightly obnoxious at peak hours but I can forgive this, every table is full and these guys are jammed  Ambiance - more upscale than your average gastropub while still maintaining a casual and laid-back aura. Very good ambient lighting scheme, you are instantly put at ease. Big comfy booths to lounge around in at night for several hours on end and put away a few drinks. Patio doesn't have a nice view or anything but seating is a single column of tables so you have a degree of privacy from other patrons"}
{"text":"One star for poor service from our server (Jamie). There is nothing I can't stand more than poor customer service. As a former waitress myself I know what it is like to have to wait on tables however it is still no excuse to give attitude and be so slow especially when the restaurant is DEAD and we are one of 3 other tables. I Don't understand what could have possibly taken an hour for 2 small appetizer orders which were in the end, cold tasteless and overpriced for such a small portion of fish tacos. Not only that but when I followed up on our order it felt like she was annoyed that I had even asked. To put the cherry on top, when I had asked for her name after we paid the bill she snapped at me and asked (why do you want my name) at which point I told her I'd be writing a review. I will never go back here again! So disappointed especially after I had heard some good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite spots in the city. I might be a bit biased since they have St.Ambroise Oatmeal Stout on tap as it happens to be my favorite beer. That aside. Everything from appetizers to mains,sauces and desserts are made with beer. The menu offers beer pairings for everything. The staff knows and understands the world of beer as few places do. Whatever beer you order you can be sure it will be served in the right glass and poured properly. Great night out with a good atmosphere. Call for reservations."}
{"text":"Awesome Beer selection  Great menu. Had the Rabbit before, but due to seasonal menu I never seen it agian :(  Love the Fries so damn GOOD"}
{"text":"Good beers. Good for after work. Frites are good. Someone in the group decided to order the Pulled pork pizza. It was the most greasy yucky thing I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"When we lived in NY, the wifey and I made a couple of trips to Toronto. We stumbled on Beer Bistro about two years ago while wandering the city and decided to stop in for a beer and a snack. We went back two days later and stayed for hours. About six months ago we went back to Toronto and it was on the top of our list of places to eat. It is still fantastic, and some of the same bartenders and waitstaff still work there, which is a good sign in the service industry. I have lots of recommendations for you:   FOOD  -Duck Confit \"corn dogs\"  -Kobe beef tacos  -Pulled pork sandwich  -Bar fries   I was really afraid of Canadian beer until my server urged me to try these. It ain't all Labatt's and Molson up there.   Canadian BEER (i prefer on tap to bottles)  -Blanche de Chambly  -Denison's Weissbier   We have only ever eaten on the bar side, which seems a lot more casual than the sit-down-dinner side (it looks very serious over there.) Lots of business types and locals just getting off of work sitting at the bar. Great for people watching if you perch along the window. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the beer, and friendly. We left them stupid-big tips."}
{"text":"My family and I took a trip to Toronto for the first time this Summer. We were hungry, so I pulled out my phone and quickly found Beerbistro through Yelp and let me be the first to say that I am so glad!   The Belgian Frites are absolutely to die for. I could have eaten three orders of just the frites. (and I just about did as my younger sister left some on her plate!)  Get. The. Smoked. Trout. Salad. I don't care if you aren't a salad person, just push the leafy greens to the side and attack the Trout. It's literally heaven on a plate. I have yet to find any restaurant that has any fish that compares to this trout. I'm telling you! The trout is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say the price range is $$$. The prices are pretty reasonable I would say. Cheaper than a lot of other similar bars for the same beer. Service is good too."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in the city, if you love beer and good food definitely check it out. Each menu item has a recommended beer pairing that will compliment the food. Good menu selections but I always end up with the cheese fondue and mussels, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I flew 4,000kms for their pulled pork sandwich and fries. Sure I had some business to do but let's be honest: it was really a cover to eat at Beer Bistro."}
{"text":"Great bar servers and one of the best beer lists in the city. Great for a relaxing pint after work or a full on meal (fully beer inspired menu)."}
{"text":"Fun place, good food and vibe. The place was crowded at 6 pm. We sat on the chef's bar, which is more quiet than the main space. Service was good."}
{"text":"With limited seating and small menu, I still love this place. Why? Because the service is always awesome, food is even more awesome, especially their cheese fondue... and Belgian White Mussels and Duck Confit Pizza and...AND AND Pulled Pork Primanti... mmmm..."}
{"text":"Very good beer menu but the food is extremely average. I've been here on multiple occasions and I've experienced bland options with small portions. The seafood wasn't anything special and the burger was disgusting. The burger patties remind me of something I would prepare by myself with expired hamburger back in my college days.   It's a good spot for drinks after work but I'd skip dinner."}
{"text":"The Beer Bistro had an impressive beer list and food that speaks for itself. Definitely the best mussels I've ever had, complemented by belgian style frites, and a taco appetizer. Topped it off with some INCREDIBLE caramel sea salt ice cream and the food was perfection. Unlike other chef's tables or counters I've sat at before, the head chef here was AWESOME. He was constantly interacting with us, talking to us about the food, the kitchen, and the city. He gave us lots of recommendations as far as where to go and what to do. He personally made us feel so welcome and we truly felt at home. We came away full of great food and loving the good company. Both my boyfriend and I agree that this was a great restaurant experience. Go to Beer Bistro !!"}
{"text":"Beer seems to be well adored in the city of toronto. It is so versitile, and at Beer Bistro, it has taken a classier face similar to the reputation of wine. I was overwhelmed by the restaurant's beer list which was an entire booklet with hundreds of beer choices --it was definitely hard to choose just one!   Luckily, their food menu had suggested pairings. The menu was quite limited, but for each dish there is a suggested taste category of beer that you should order with it. I found the categories pretty helpful because that way I can try a new beer but still ensure that it will have characteristics that I like. I actually wanted to try the fruity beer that they had on tap, but it was out of stock that night! I guess on the bright side it means there are no worries of low turnover and getting the bottom of an old keg!  One thing I do want to point out is that this place is really loud. First sitting down, I couldn't come to terms with the sounds of utensils coming from the wide open kitchen at the back. Its so open that you can actually see it and the chefs cooking! Couple that with the amplifying effect of conversation from all different tables, and it got pretty busy! I got used to it after a while and proceeded with my meal.  Beer Sampler ($6.00) -- The sampler gives you an option of 3 beers. A good option if you don't have a go-to favourite brew!  \"Belgian Frites\" ($6.00) -Fries blanched in beef and duck fat, house-made mayonnaise; smoked tomato ketchup. Yes people, these fries actually taste as good as they sound in the description. They went great with the homemade smokey (almost barbeque tasting) ketchup and even better with the beers that we ordered. A must try!  \"Lobster Quesadilla\" ($18.50) - was not a huge fan of this. Too little lobster, half the time I felt like I was eating a veggie quesadilla!  Belgian White Mussels ($16.95) -- These mussels are to die for! The sauce was a white wine base with the addition of garlic, cream and lemon. Simple, but it was the perfect amount of richness and acidity to bring out the natural freshness of the clams. Don't forget to use the table bread to soak up all that white wine sauce!   \"Rocky Road Ice Cream Sandwiches\" ($8.50) - If there is one thing that you have to order from Beer Bistro (aside from beer of course), its the ice cream. These ice cream sandwiches are served with beer flavoured ice cream and fresh baked cookies. The ice cream was so good! It has a distinctive beer flavour to it, but not too much that it would be revolting. Definitely would consider ordering the ice cream on its own next time."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, drinks were good, food was good not stellar but good."}
{"text":"Extensive beer collection, although I had a great cab Sauvignon with a bistro burger. Great duck fat fries that can be shared by your group."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Food good but not special, we had 2 kinds of mussels (Provençal, which was too salty, and Belgium) and fries."}
{"text":"The place to go for upscale food and beer. Menu wasn't quite as adventurous as in previous visits but it is consistently excellent. The beer selection is unmatched.  The place to go for upscale food and beer. Menu wasn't quite as adventurous as in previous visits but it is consistently excellent. The beer selection is unmatched."}
{"text":"Great place. Huge selection of beers and pairings with the menu. Food came quickly and in good portions."}
{"text":"My friends night out restaurant!    Great atmosphere and service.  Nice selection of beer with amazing good.  Highly recommended: Muscle bowl!! My \"must have\" from this place.  Call in a head to reserve a table because it does get very busy during night time.   Tips: Mother eats for free on Mothers day!"}
{"text":"Red curry Thai mussels were amazing!  The waiter offers great beer selections to accompany the food choices. Our bartender Greg was outstanding! Definitely recommend and will come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a huge selection of beer.  So much so that it takes a while to find what you want to try.  Reasonably priced, it's more of a place for beer lovers that enjoy a good beer.  Not a place to get trashed.  This place is classy, and the ambience was great.  I only went in to try a few beers that caught my eye as this was my first time.  The next time, I'll definitely get the sampler.  One thing I noted was that on the way to the bathroom, there was a small high stool area overlooking the kitchen, and I THINK they must have something special goin' on there.  Maybe food + beer pairings?"}
{"text":"Beer selection is outstanding and the food is great.  The hostess was really rude and the server looked uninterested and like she really didn't want to be there.  It started to rain and all the customers on the patio tried to open the umbrellas (which was unusually difficult).  Not a single staff member made any attempt to help.  Did I mention that the staff don't look happy being there?"}
{"text":"Just got home from this place a few hours ago, and cannot say enough. It was busy, so my friend and I were offered seats at the Chef's Table (which means we looked in to the kitchen and had side-by-side seating). Turns out to have been the best decision we made! It was very quiet, and our server was fantastic. She was very helpful with my friend's dietary restrictions, and after a bit of a back and forth over a few ingredients, the head chef very kindly gave us an order of fries on the house.  I had the burger - it was excellent. Cooked just right - juicy, full of flavour. My friend had a salad that came with delicious grilled apricot (among other things), and the beer selection is fantastic!  If you're looking for somewhere that has food for everyone, tons of beer, great atmosphere and amazing service, this is your place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"With a decent menu and late hours, this restaurant makes the regular rotation list. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.  Favourites are the tartare, fries, and the pizzas. There are times when these are only okay, and times, more often than not, when these are really, really, good. I've never had a truly bad meal.  This place tends to be busy at all hours - especially with the after-work crowd. There are regular tables, higher tables along a couch, and the couches in the bar. I prefer the couches in the bar for a relaxed late-night meal."}
{"text":"Great service, beer selection, and food! The patio was a beautiful to sit out on. Definitely recommend for lunch or drinks."}
{"text":"I have been walking past this restaurant for two years always staring into the windows telling myself I have to try this place one day.   I'm glad it was open NYE 2014 when we we're looking for a place to go to for drinks.  It is a warm friendly atmosphere with a wide variety of beers & knowledgable staff.  I will definitely be back to try their menu."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with my husband and made a 9:30pm reservation. We were taken to our seats on time, but the service stopped there. Besides taking our order and the abrupt check-ins without waiting for an answer the service was un-attentive. The Beer is divided into reccommendations & different categories, I think to expedite the service, but left us feeling cold. The food was alright, nothing amazing just your average fare. The one down point was how noisy it was. I expect some noise on a friday night, but to not hear the person sitting right in front of you is a little much. A headache inducing level of noise."}
{"text":"Beer bistro was AMAZING!! We had Emily as our server and she was SO knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. They have a massive and great beer variety and an unbelievable food menu!!  And don't forget to ask for Emily as your server."}
{"text":"Simply divine!  Came here for lunch.   We ordered:  1)BLANCHE DE CHAMBLY CURED SMOKED SALMON  |  $15, they smoke their own salmon. 2)BISTRO SALAD  |  $7  |  $12 House mixed greens, green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, beets, lemon & witbier truffle vinaigrette 3) BELGIAN FRITES  |  $6 Blanched in beef & duck fat, house made mayonnaise & smoked tomato ketchup  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Nice place good food especially the mussels and good beers. Hip atmosphere"}
{"text":"Eat the Thai Muscles. Imagine a silky coconut broth with spicy thai chilis and muscles. There is something magical about fishy food and Thai flavors. It was awesome.  I also had the Salmon Tartare and it was decent. It tasted like your standard mixture of raw salmon and capers. You can find better places to eat but the combination of beer and food is excellent."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening to find that they had a live jazz band, which was a nice surprise.  They have a good variety of menu items, serving up mussels, pizza, steak frites, etc. What I like about their menu is that they suggest beer pairings for each of their dishes, which really helps to narrow down what beer to order (since they have such an enormous variety!).  Whenever I come to Beer bistro I ALWAYS get the belgian frites ($6). They serve up some of my favourite fries in the city. They're blanched in beef and duck fat and are served with house made mayo and smoked ketchup. Crispy and delicious!  Since I was starving, I also started with the roasted red pepper and tomato soup served with white cheddar beer bread croutons ($6). I enjoyed the croutons... the soup was just okay. Wouldn't order this again. I saw many servers walking by with kobe beef tacos.. probably should've ordered that instead!  For my main, I ordered the Hog Wild Beer Bread Pizza - Berkshire pulled pork, smoked sausage, beer-cured bacon, oregano, mozzarella, garlic confit ($15.75). Loved it. C'mon, with the combination of those ingredients, how could you go wrong?  My boyfriend went with the veal cheek pasta - slow-braised with maudite, hand-cut fettuccine, wilted baby spinach, zucchini ($23). Wouldn't recommend this. It didn't really have much flavour to it at all. Just bland. He normally eats everything he orders (and half of my meal...) but in this case, he didn't even finish it!  My friend ordered the Coq Au Biere - nut brown ale-braised chicken, woodland mushrooms , tarragon, crème fraiche dumpling ($18). The serving was enormous! I had a bite of this and enjoyed it. My friend said he's always a little cautious about ordering chicken at restaurants since they can turn out dry, but this was really moist and had a lot of flavour.  Overall, love the atmosphere and beer selection. The food, for the most part, was a hit. But given the few misses, I'd have to give my experience 3 stars."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro is so consistent that it's a regular spot when I'm eating in the downtown core. I'm a die hard fan of the pulled pork and I rarely deviate.   Go and enjoy the beer infused menu."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant for beer lovers.  We tried the mussels with belgian beer. PERFECT"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times the service and food have been exceptional. The mussels are some of the best in the city, maybe even the country. We've also tried some of the other items on the menu like the steak and they've also been spot on.   As a bonus their kitchen is open late!  A reliable choice that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Sometimes you feel like your review is just affirming those who came before you, but this spot deserves another 4* rating.  In my opinion, you come here for the beer selection, hoping the great ones haven't run out that night. There are great craft beers to choose from, which is rare in the city, and you can use that tasty foaming top to wash down their well cut fries.  I didn't try their food, so can't comment there, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just got back from Friday lunch here.  Participated in their Winterlicious menu for $15 (apps, main, dessert).  Be careful though, they ding you an extra 6 bucks for sides under this menu so make sure you really need those fries.  I would have to say the food has gone downhill here lately.  The burger is still sitting with me like a lead weight.  The fries (yes, I really needed them) tasted like they were whipped up in the early morning and reheated for lunch.  Bottom line, not impressive.  If you do decide to try this place for lunch - reserve; otherwise you'll likely be stuck at the bar or those mini stool that break your back.  +ives: beer variety (just go to drink) -ives: food, it's gone downhill"}
{"text":"Great place to have mussels and beer. The frites, I must say, we're disappointing. Especially when they claim it's Belgium style and what they're known for. Other than the fancy way of preparing it in beef and duck fat, and serving it Belgium style (cone shape paper), there's nothing good about those soggy fries.   The beer selection is excellent. Most of the popular Belgian ones will be found there. I had the Triple Karmeliet, which is a bit spicy and creamier. Good with mussels.   Overall, great atmosphere and a place to have dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome spot in the heart of the Financial District!   My wife and I came into town for a day as part of our mini one week getaway. We went down to the Toronto Islands at around 7PM for the night scene and came back through the ferry at around 9:30PM. We parked next to the ACC on Bay Street and walked ~15 minutes to this corner Bistro/Bar area for a late dinner.   We were seated promptly- keep in mind, this is also late April. The server greeted us and gave us a quick run down of the menu including their seasonal special of the day. While the special- I believe it was a red snapper, sounded delicious, we opted to go for the regular menu items after seeing all the reviews. I'll get to the food later, but something that had impressed me quite a bit was the service. When the server realized that there was no one to our left- he had combined the empty table with ours to give us more space! Since we had ordered quite a bit of food- this extra space was definitely needed. The extra table wasn't necessity but was a HUGE bonus for us.   Belgian Frites- OOH~ Talk about portions! The fries were served in a cone shaped container with two sauces. One tastes like a mix of BBQ sauce and ketchup and the other one was a form of a sour cream I think? (I'm not a foodie, so I tried- HA). But the fries were good. They were fried in duck and beef fat- which you can definitely taste in the fries. Although the duck flavors were not overwhelming, the slight taste was actually quite addicting.   Tomato and Crouton Soup-  The soup was good. The tomato flavor was full and robust- and the crispy croutons were excellent to cut through the tanginess of the tomato. Good for two people to share because the tomato flavor may get a little too much if one were to have this on your own.   Beer Bistro Burger-  The burger was succulent and good! The patty was thick and juicy and cooked just right. The server had automatically offered to cut the burger in half for us to share- so that was perfect. It was served with the ketchup mixture, the white sauce that came with the fries, and then a nice mustard to go along. Included on the burger was a cole slaw that was refreshing and crisp that helped to reset your palate after a bite of the burger.   Belgian White Mussels-  The mussels were served quite generously in a clay pot. They were fresh and tasty with the garlic cutting through to keep the \"fishy\" flavor to a minimum. This is a definite highlight of the restaurant. We weren't able to try all the different flavors or sauces that they use to cook the mussels- but the Belgian White, first on the list, is a deserving first on the list.   Overall- GREAT experience. We came in on a not so freezing but still cold night and had a warm and cozy experience. I would definitely recommend this place for a spot at night! We didn't have any beer- as that seems to be one of their selling point as well- but still had a great night! The atmosphere is great for friends for just drinks or a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago and was excited for the duck fat fries -- Hot Doug's was local place that had duck fat fries every Saturday.  Beer Bistro had less than mediocre duck fat fries. The fries were soggy, flavorless, and overall disappointing.    My Burger came out charred.  Our server did not even ask how I wanted it cooked.  It tasted quite leathery.  The grilled onions on top made it taste similar to that of a White Castle Burger -- of less quality -- which is quite difficult to muster.   On the bright side, we were able to refill our own water glasses -- our server was not present.  My girlfriend's salad was good... Which is sole reason for the full star   Overall, large beer selection with food of a sub-par rookie chef.  Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro has the best imported beer selection in the city in my opinion. The bartenders really know beer and can describe all the tones of each brew. The menu changes all the time so you always have something new to try. I like light and fruity beers but my boyfriend likes dark stouts, both of us are always satisfied. They don't have a lot of seating and the bar area gets very crowded on the weekends. I've had food there too and it's delicious."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good, but the food and service is mediocre. I ordered the duck fat fries and a burger, and was pretty underwhelmed. The fries were soggy after 2 minutes, and the burger was dry. Avoid the smoked catchup, it tastes nothing like catchup and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. The service was slow, and hard to get a hold of."}
{"text":"I had the pork chop and duck fries. The pork chop was ok. It was tender and juicy. It was a cut with some bone, but that just adds to flavor. It was sitting on a pile of greens, not sure who would want to eat that. The duck fries did not seem that special to me. They were a little extra crunchy, but nothing great. The arrogant bastard beer is a very strong flavored beer, be prepared if you order it, lots of HOPS."}
{"text":"The fries! Must get the fries here. The mussels were also super amazing. The portion size is huuuge. Was upset that our waitress would not let me pack the mussels to go. That was very upsetting to me since it is technically the food that I paid for."}
{"text":"I go here fairly regularly (mostly because I have friends who love it) and I'm a bit reluctant to give it a lower rating.  The things to love about it are obvious:  it's a beer-lover's paradise, when they are served the Applewood smoked ribs are amazing, they have a live jazz band!  However, I have to say that, for the price, I find the menu to be wanting.  I can think of a dozen places that have comparable or better food for a better price.  Portions of some dishes can be a bit small (again, considering the price -- I'm not asking to be super-sized).   I had the Grilled Chicken Breast last week, and while it tasted great, it was a rather modest portion.   And I confess I don't get the deal with the Corn Dog -- it's like some kind of bourgeois pogo stick.  I also find some of the seating to be uncomfortable.  Having said that, the service is always great, they have all kinds of Belgian and other beers that you would never find anywhere else, and if you happen to like the type of food they serve there you won't be disappointed with the quality."}
{"text":"Frites are delicious.  Beer selection great. Mains were decent.  A tad pricey but a great place to meet friends and eat. Lively atmosphere on the weekend.  Not disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer selection. Service was a little slow because the server was chatting with her friend that came in for a couple of drinks. No worries we weren't in a rush as we had a late flight back to the states.  Pirogies are a must have here."}
{"text":"Great selection of bottled beers at this location. Classy atmosphere and attentive staff. Great for any kind of outing, be it a lunch date with co-workers or a night out with friends. Recommend the St.Bernardus Abt 12 if you want to blow your mind."}
{"text":"As a downtown dweller, I visit this bistro often. Never disappoints. Beer and food - amazing. Large variety. Good service and vibe. Great crowd.  I recommend Beerbistro for sure. Go! Check it out. You will enjoy beerbistro.  Wife loves it too. Fun date place ;)"}
{"text":"The perfect afterwork drink spot. The decor needs some refreshing and the menu wasn't particularly exciting, but that's not their area of expertise. The beer. I'm not even a beer drinker and I got excited by all the selection. The fries are a must. When in beerbistro...  The service was really friendly and the atmosphere is casual. It's a departure from the standard Toronto financial district afterwork bar. And thank God for that."}
{"text":"Love it!! Must try their fries and you won't be disappointed. Tons of different types of beer. This is a must try place for beer lovers!"}
{"text":"Our favourite place in Toronto! Beers are exceptional, the time is on hold (nobody is stressing you to have another beer or to finish your meal), service is great and food is like at home... In better!"}
{"text":"Came here for the amazing selection of beer. Didn't know about their famous fries but now I understand why there is so much hype.  It turns out the rest of their food is amazing too. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic. I would definitely go here again. The service was also amazing! Little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Saturday night. Lesson learned, though: do not expect to find tables downtown on a Saturday without having made reservations (at least in the good places!)   But luckily, a tiny table in the bar area was available without any wait.   Well, the first thing I noticed was the ginormous menu of beers. Woah, serious.   Both my companions ordered a 1/2 pint with their meals (don't remember their exact kinds) but they both thoroughly enjoyed them!   We ended up ordering:  1) Salmon BLT mussel bowl   2) Belgian mussel bowl   3) Steak tartare.  Both mussel bowls came with a side sourdough loaf for sopping up mussel juices, which was quite nice compared to the usual slice of bread or mini bun! The mussel bowls were also really huge and cool-looking (heavy, too, damn. Props to the servers!)   But the flavours weren't all that exciting. The salmon BLT one had all the salmon pieces tucked at the bottom, and not too sure where the \"BLT\" comes in. The Belgian mussels had more complex flavours, but overall nothing that was really different from regular home-made mussels.   My dish was the steak tartare: it was a good portion, the horseradish mayo was tasty (but there was too little of it!), but the steak was pretty substandard. It was very stringy and tough, and I spent majority of my time trying to cut it up into manageable bites. I enjoyed the flavours, but the difficulty I had chewing it kind of ruined it.   Service was in general, good, and the atmosphere was nice. Only reason to return would be for the huge selection of beers to try, but don't expect too much from the food."}
{"text":"This place was phen-nom-nom-nom-nominal! Went with my fiance and his parents for brunch and was very pleased with the experience. Service was prompt and friendly without being overbearing. I got the smoked salmon benedict and it was so delicious! My mother-in-law had it too and had the same reaction. My fiance got the breakfast burrito and said it was great - he ate all of it before I could get a bite. The interior was comfortable and interesting to look at and we were treated great by all the staff. Overall we had a great experience and will go back next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love their menu - fries are exactly the way they're served in Belgium!  Their beer menu is to die for.  I was there during summer this year, and a waiter accidentally had spill ed on my boyfriend's jacket.  Without anything, we were given the card of the manager in the event we wanted to expense dry-cleaning and a fresh beer was served to him within minutes to apologize.    Always a great atmosphere, always busy and buzzing!"}
{"text":"Nice place in the downtown! I had a great beer with a pork chop was really juicy.Both bartender asked me about and they were really friendly!Enviroment is calm with soft lights!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night, it was packed with the after work all-suited-up crowd. Very impressed with the beer selection. The descriptions and categories (sweet, dry, fruity, etc.) really helped. Also there are pairings on the food menu to help you find the right beer, which is a nice touch.   I think they were understaffed that night, because we were not seated right away even though there were empty tables. When the waitress finally walked us to our table, we wanted to switch to the booth seat and was denied due to reasons I could not comprehend. So we had to sit next to a huge group of girls that talked like characters on The Hills. MAJOR TURN OFF.   The cheese fondue was amazing, but it was huge! Kobe beef taco was too salty for my taste (side note, Kobe-beef snacks are one of my biggest pet-peeves). Mussel bowl was good. Overall the meal was OKAY, nothing special. Unless I work in the area and am paying with my corporate card, I will not go back."}
{"text":"One star for service, and another for the extensive beer list. Everything else is less than decent.  Atmosphere: this place is LOUD. It also has a weird juxtaposed deco happening between bar and dining room. Furnishing is less than classy or upscale considering the area, but it matches the price range of the menu. Mix of tourists, older crowd, and professionals.  Service: incredible. The hostesses have been extremely friendly and welcoming every time I've visited. They take a long time to explain to you what the situation of the hall is like at the moment, including which tables are expected to leave within a reasonably short period of time. They have a coat check in the winter, which is great if you wear massive down filled trekker coats. Wait staff are all knowledgeable about the food and beers, and very timely with service.  Food: everything I've had here, in the numerous times I have visited, the food has disappointed. I know, I know; many yelpers have touted this place as the best place for moules frites in Toronto. I beg to differ. Tiny, usually undercooked mussels. Thankfully, the sourdough bread is delicious, especially if you dip pieces into the broth.  Frites are not surprising in any way; basic double fried frites you might get at any decent downtown pub like Town Crier.  Pizzas are very, very small and are moist to the point of making the crust mushy/soggy. Flavors have no impact on the two meat pizzas I've tried.  The burger was plain, the patty dry and crumbly. It could not have been worse cooked.   The saving grace at this joint is the beer list. it's one of the few places in the city that carries rodenbach on tap. They have an extensive craft, imported beer on tap list plus an even longer and variety-packed beer in bottles list. Can't go wrong with a good pint, and most of the offerings are definitely on-point. Choose the flight of beers if you want some variety or just can't seem to choose one.  Can't sing praises about this place for the food, but I'll keep returning for the beer."}
{"text":"One of the people in our party has a severe peanut allergy and notified the server at the start of the meal. He ordered wiener schnitzel and fries. AFTER we finished eating, the server came up sheepishly and told him that the schnitzel had been cooked in peanut oil, but \"the chef said it would be okay because the oil is highly refined.\" While it is often true that peanut oil won't cause a reaction, it's not always true -- and obviously, the choice of whether to take that risk should have been left up to the customer.   There was a clear failure of communication in the kitchen, but apart from the server herself, no one apologized (she took the offending meal off the bill). I would have expected the Beerbistro chef or manager to come out and speak to the allergic patron, explain what had happened and assure us they'd take steps to make sure it wouldn't happen again in the future. Nothing.   Thankfully, the allergic diner did not experience a reaction but you can probably guess how stressful the experience was as we waited to see if we'd be spending the afternoon at the hospital. Beerbistro was just unprofessional all around and left us really unhappy."}
{"text":"First off, the service at this place was spectacular.  Our host, Sean, went above and beyond our expectations.  When he found out it was our first night in Toronto, he went into the back and printed us out directions to some other places he thought we might enjoy.  He gave us some helpful tips for using public transportation and answered all of our questions about Toronto.  This guy deserves a raise!  Our waitress had high expectations to live up to after this, and she managed to exceed them.  She was prompt in taking our order, and knew the moment we asked for her to come back that we wanted to add an order of their belgian frites.  We both had ciders, though they have a very extensive beer selection, and thoroughly enjoyed them.  The belgian frites appetizer was so amazing we may find an excuse to get them again before the end of our stay.  The bison burger I had was very good but undercooked for my taste, be sure to ask if you want it cooked a certain way - they didn't ask how I wanted it cooked like they do in American restaurants.  My boyfriend got the hog heaven pizza and raved about it.  All in all, a great experience and we would definitely recommend this as a don't-miss place to eat and drink in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. Food is quite tasty. However, menu is on the expensive side of things (Given that it is at King and Yonge this is not a surprise. I just went for the chips and 3 types of dip appetizer this time around which was good. I sat on the big patio on the side of the restaurant. Only problem is that there is no sun and the patio is quite dark. Good times though"}
{"text":"Love the late night menu here and great selection of fruity beers. Duck fries are a must."}
{"text":"Who would have thought this place would be packed on a Wednesday night .. at 6pm? I walked in and was told the wait time would be 2 hours. Or I could go to the bar.  I went to the bar.  My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken Cobb Salad and LOVED it. I sampled her dish and was very impressed. The chicken was spicy enough and blended quite well with the salad dressing.  I ordered the mussels and I was astonished at its size! Hell of a lot more than the Bier Market ... at least double-triple the portion. And it was soooo delicious. If I could, I would have asked for more bread to soak up the gravy.   I did not have beer (WTF?) but the selection was impressive.  The service was good but not overly great - no one came to check up on us. Perhaps cuz we were at the bar. I had to walk up to the hostess to ask for the bill."}
{"text":"A fantastic experience! Our waitress was friendly, and the food was fabulous. I had the perogies with truffle paste, which were outstanding, as well as the mashed potatoes on the side."}
{"text":"Great place, ambience, food & staff! Greg is worth coming to BB. He's personable, friendly & very knowledgable about everything on the menu. I've been going here for years! One of my fave places in the city!"}
{"text":"Ordered the New England muscles and frites. Muscles were delicious and frites were abundant, but just okay. Had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and it was not sticky in the least. It was dry and I didn't eat most of it.   Then our bill came and the manager thought it was completely acceptable to rudely ask us to pay up and get out. There was a table of 8 glaring at him. Not sure how managing upset customers fall on us. He did not nicely ask us nor did he offer to move us the one of the few empty tables for 4 around us.   Our waitress was great so we didn't give her a lacklustre tip.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Starting going back to Beerbistro since I work in the neighbourhood. I love the fact that they stay true to their concept. Place could use a bit of a facelift but the food is good, the beer lineup to die for, and the service utterly amazing. Such a relaxed place. Good to see them doing such a good job after all these years"}
{"text":"I love this place. Though I under dress compared with all the business locales that frequent this place. I really like their mussels and their fries. Their mains are good too. Always come here when I feel like spending a bit on food."}
{"text":"My wife and I just sat on the Bar of the Beer Bistro. It was our first time at the place and we didnt make reservations in advance (our bad... if you want to dine there, especially during Friday or Saturday night.. you better make reservations). Anyway, we found some free space on the Bar. the 2 barmen were nice (male and female), they could recommend  beers from the menu and were pretty knowledgeable. It is one of the only places in Toronto which as the X.O beer (Volo used to have them.. but no longer for some reason and the Bier Market have this brand as well). the food was reasonable, nothing fancy, a Maki roll, stuffed chicken and some lobster pita in Spanish Style. The atmosphere was cool, nice people overall. I do like this place.   other stuff. the coat check is free. they have a nice outdoor seating. the washrooms were clean. the music was good."}
{"text":"Came to this place base on Yelp reviewers.  This is wow place for us during our visit to down town Toronto. Food - 5 starts Service - 4 starts Decor - 5 starts  May be because we came in odd hours, only one or two people working.  Food and other service came by slow.  But it's okay for us because we are on vacation.   Love their duck meat pizza.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"If you like beer and good food, this is the place for you.   The beer menu is second to none, with labels that do each beer justice in description. A great combination of European beers and those from around Canada.   I have the Diabolo mussels which were spiced well with a delicious broth. The chorizo was lacking for someone from the southwest, but may be fine for Canada. The accompanying Sourdough bread was good, but not excellent. Maybe an import from San Francisco is in order.   The Belgium fries were very good, cooked to perfection. The homemade mayonnaise was adequate, but no better than Best Foods. However, the homemade ketchup was phenomenal. This was the first homemade ketchup that I would recommend as fantastic.   I had a variety of beers, each of which was appropriately described and hit the mark.   The atmosphere was a perfect match for the food and drinks served.   A great place to go in the downtown, financial district."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to grab a pint or three in the city. Beer Bistro is a great place to check out all the latest craft beer taps whether you're with friends or on your own before an event. The staff make everyone feel right at home. My recommendation is to sit at the bar, as it's directly in the middle of the restaurant and you can see everything, from the sports on TV to the legendary beers behind the bar. Food wise, I've always stuck to the duck fat frites as they pair amazing with all the beers."}
{"text":"Terrible. Good demonstration of how Yelp App can create a reputation. On a cold day we looked forward to sitting down to a nice meal. Our Fondue tasted great but was served at a tepid temperature. Our bacon wrapped Shrimp tasted good. Nothing special about the sauce served with them though. Had to send \"Steak Frites\" back, Too salty. This was taken off the bill. The Saturday night special (Pork) dish was anything but.  Service was great. The waitress was very apologetic and accommodating. Offered to re do the steak for us but we had a show to go to and couldn't wait. They removed the charge for the steak from our bill.  Strong list of beers but beer menu very cumbersome to comb through.  I would spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great beer selection as the name infers.  But I really enjoy the food here too Moderate to high pricing in my opinion Always enjoy going back when I can"}
{"text":"I just don't understand the appeal of this place. The place is a lot bigger inside than I expected but the food choices are really limiting for anyone concerned about their health or with food restrictions or sensitivities. Practically everything is cooked in duck fat or lard, hopefully this is something they change in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing places! awesome selection of beers and the food is quite good. Had the duck confit pizza and loved it! nice thin crust and tasted quite well. great patio as well. Perfect place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Pulled pork benny on a potato latke?  Don't mind if I do!  And a mountain of fries that took 3 of us to finish....   Incredible beer selection here.  There must be at least 200 on the menu.  It was funny to see a couple selections that are regarded as pretty cheap beer in BC show up on their menu though.  But there were some on here that cost $50 for a glass if you wanted them.  Let's just say I didn't try them.  Only complaint is that there was nobody on the patio when we arrived (on a sunny day?  yet the inside was packed?  Do Torontoians not like sun?) and yet we ended up with a faulty umbrella that kept hitting everybody, yet we weren't moved to a different table or the umbrella fixed.  Once we got used to it though it was a minor inconvenience and became a bit of a running joke."}
{"text":"I stop by here after work for a few drinks with friends often and have never had a negative experience. The selection of beers is extensive, and you will undoubtedly be able to find a beer you will enjoy. As a beer lover, I especially enjoy 'daynas beer of the moment'  which is a their featured beer (much like a 'soup of the day'). It is usually fairly good and I have never disliked it.  Their appetizers are also great. I usually sit in the bar area and the fries are fantastic and a great value. Their pizza is also very tasty and I would recommend it (especially the applewood chicken) if you are looking for something to split between two people.  I have only had dinner here once and it was ok. I ordered the steak tartare as an appetizer, which was ok (but I found it a little bland) and the salmon salad as a main which was great. Everyone I was sitting with enjoyed their food. I had a taste of the (duck confit) corn dogs and they were really interesting - I'll probably get them next time!  I really like beer bistro. The servers are friendly and it's a very nice place to enjoy a beer after work!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Friday night without a reservation, so we ended up sitting on the bar side, sitting side by side, looking out onto King St. Good for people watching! The waitress was not attentive or friendly, but I wouldn't say that is out of the ordinary in Toronto if you are paying under $50 a person.   The beer selection is great. I tried a flight so I could sample a few different kinds, including a nice cider. The flight is a good option if you are not sure what to order, so you do not get stuck with a pint you are not crazy about.   We had the Belgian frites, hog wild pizza, and pulled pork primanti sandwich. We loved all of our food! The fries are amazing, but we could have used more dipping sauce.   I think this place would be good for a laid back date night (recommend making a reservation) or after work with friends."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Beer Bistro for years and try and go whenever I return to Canada(Canadian living in USA).  Went this past weekend and had the WORST service I've ever had, ever! Waiter was rude, arrogant, and sorry if you work for tips try to be nice and check on your tables. He acted like we were inconveniencing him if we needed more beer or food. The food was delicious as always and always fantastic selection of beer."}
{"text":"Great service, unbeatable value, make sure your server pairs beers with your meal. Great experience"}
{"text":"Sadly, three stars because our server was good and staff seemed friendly.  But on food alone, 2 stars.  Really wanted to like this place more.  Mussels were disappointing.  Decent portion, but the preparation wasn't quite there.  Not terrible, but just OK.  Tried the New England Style and the Diablo Style.  Also, the Belgian fries were soggy.  Beer selection great, but serving a good Tripel in a glass doesn't require a lot of finesse. Sour dough bread is good."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection and great atmosphere! This place is showing 3 $$$ for a reason. It ain't cheap, but it's worth it. Steamed Mussel bowls were awesome, the fries kicked ass and the again... the Beer. Then for deserts, some beer flavored ice cream with other rarely found flavors, were all very good. On top of all that, some very friendly service, very handly with the beer recommendations. Will deffinitly be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Family Day. One of the first tables there but definitely filling up by the time we left.   Kobe beef tacos - yummy but actually too much beef and not enough fixings. Beef was the centre of attention but more lettuce etc would have been nice to offset the richness.  Awesome pulled pork sandwhich for lunch. Barbeque sauce wasn't too sweet -my husband's usual complaint and the coleslaw provided a nice snap to the sandwhich.  Add an impressive beer list (ask what's not available though my first two choices weren't) and friendly staff and we'll definitely be back.   Note also we brought out infant son in his stroller. Got a nice table with room to tuck the stroller out of the way. And they offered to take my lunch back to keep warm when he needed to feed at the same time as lunch came."}
{"text":"Great beer, huge Sortiment, very friendly and quick staff, great atmosphere, Belgian fries are 10/10, Especiall the smoked tomato Ketchup is soo good, and it's enough for three people, for $6. Located next to the subway station or the streetcars, Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!   Just oozes cool.  Like the restaurant design and detailing.   There was a Jazz trio playing at the bar; setting the mood of this well dressed happening spot on King St. Sat night.   We ordered a bunch of things this evening and I felt stuffed like a Panda by the end of it all. One notch of the belt loosened. Check!     We started off with a warm fresh loaf of sourdough bread.   then   Baked Garlic Mussels $13.25 sautéed arugula, spinach, witbier, shallots, garlic butter, chèvre & mozzarella  then   Potato Skins $11.95 white beer smoked salmon, housemade goat cream cheese, red onions & fried capers  then   Belgian Frites $on the house Thanks! :D blanched in beef and duck fat, housemade mayonnaise & smoked tomato ketchup     then  Steak Frites $23.95 grilled flat iron steak, tarragon butter, caramelized shallots & ale-braised mushrooms   Very tasty. No room for any dessert.   My favorite would have to be the Potato Skins, such common name eliciting thoughts of carnival food but it's very far from that. Give it a try. It surprised me how good it was!  I'd say the only criticism is, they need to reduce the salt on the dishes. Wayy wayy to liberal on the frites especially.  Other than that we really enjoyed our time here. Loved the atmosphere and the beer infused food.   Recommend!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food.  All the meals ordered by our group of 6 were bland and not very hot.  Not returning"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times when I've visited Toronto.  The first time was awesome. This last time the food was just OK and the staff seemed bored and not really interested in giving good service.  It seems like this place is starting to go downhill or I went on a bad day."}
{"text":"I am in Toronto for a visit and looking for a place near my hotel. What hooks me about the beerbistro are several reviews raving about the Belgian frites. Very disappointing! The fries are mushy, not well seasoned and the ketchup and mayonnaise they come with are mediocre. McDonald's fries are better than they are. We also ordered mussels, pizza and the Bacon wrapped shrimp. All are ok but nothing to be excited about. My advice is to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"HIPSTER FREE. which equals JOY. Beer is what is on the menu and food is the treat and the bartendar is the bonus. I went on a sunday night and my bartendar knew everything there was to know about beer and the toronto beer scene. His objective was not to get me drunk , it was to educate me. I love the atmosphere and the menu. I loved that i did not run into one douche in the whole place.  I loved that i could buy local without seeing Moose head on the menu. I love this place. I love the food. Go to here."}
{"text":"I went to Beerbistro with a few friends a week or two ago. The food was fantastic! I think everyone was very pleased with their meals. I had the Jamaican goat curry, which I was a little nervous about because I'm a little picky with meats, but I was absolutely delighted. We all shared cheese fondue to start and it was great! The beer selection is extensive, of course! We all had dessert as well. The flourless chocolate cake was amazing, and I sampled everyone else's desserts as well and they were all good, especially the sticky toffee pudding. Great atmosphere, great service, even better food!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great food and great service! Our party of 3 each tried a different pizza. I opted for the curry roasted cauliflower pizza with eggplant and raita - awesome flavour. The dough was among the tastiest I've ever had :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places in all of Toronto, Beerbistro has great food, great drinks, and a great staff! The atmosphere is fun while still relaxed and Greg pushes this place above and beyond."}
{"text":"During a business trip to Toronto from the states, I was Yelping for a good place to bring 2 clients for lunch. I was attracted to the Beerbistro menu choices and the beer selection. I have found it hard to find much dark beer in Toronto besides Guinness (even though it's sooo easy to find in Vancouver).  The beer selection was terrific with browns, porters, stouts in addition to the good European lighter beers - the food was good, but not great. The duck fat fries were tasty although bit as flavorful as duck fat fries I have has elsewhere. The buffalo burger was OK but I had a better burger at the hotel. The salmon salad someone ordered was good, but very ordinary. Again, the beer was great.  So...if you need a solid place with great beer and food  that won't blow your mind, Beerbistro is it..."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review. Our experience was so bad that I was motivated to sign up and write this review. We went to BB recently and they had run out of many of their beer selections - including the most benign crowd pleasing ones. Prior to my arrival the people I was meeting were seated. The waitress spilled water all over my menu and wiped it up with her hand - it still had water all over it so when I arrived I asked for a new one. Despite having a reservation for 3:30pm we were told in a very rude fashion at 5:30 that we had to be gone from our table at 6pm. I approached the lady who was kicking us out of our table - she identified herself as the mananger and 'independent owner'. Had she done her homework she would have known that our bill was paid and we were about to leave to go somewhere with better food and service. We learned later that evening that BB has been sold to Cara foods. The first thing Cara can do is fire this rude woman, respect that a 2 hour turnover policy should be mentioned to customers when they make a reservation, and switch up the disgusting velvetta cheese fondue. Not to mention, when you are called Beer Bistro, you shouldn't be out of several selections so early on a Saturday."}
{"text":"This is a regular watering hole of mine. They do a fantastic job of recommending beers from their extensive list and service is always quick and friendly. Gotta go early if you want a good seat because the place fills up fast. Plenty of room at the bar if you don't mind sitting there. A few different TVs offer plenty to watch if your conversation hits a lull.   The food here is exceptional. I highly recommend the quinoa salad with chicken and goat cheese. The duck fat fries used to be free if you tweet about your experience. Not sure if that is still the case.   Bathrooms are clean and on the same level. Great patio with shade in the summer."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with a few friends from work.  Ordered the brisket sandwich.  It was pretty disappointing.  It was skimpy on the amount of brisket.  The brisket was bland.  The sandwich must have been sitting around for a while, before the server finally brought it over, because the bottom bun was so soggy.  It was so soggy that it was falling apart and I had to eat the sandwich upside down.    My co workers ordered a brisket sandwich, burger and quinoa salad with chicken.  the two who had buns in their order, experienced the same soggyness.  The quinoa salad apparently not too bad.  The fries were really good though."}
{"text":"My go-to place near the financial district. Had the duck-fat fries, the burger, and the lamb dishes before. All with a generous portion size but equally great quality. The beer selection is fantastic but overall a great balance of fine ambiance and properly priced food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars..loved the ambiance of this spot..the place was quite busy on a Thursday evening..we ordered a bunch of beers and the wood smoked chicken wings, Kobe beef tacos and Belgian frites. The tacos were just ok (don't order) and the frites were ok as well. The wings had a nice smoked taste but were tiny.   On the main course, we got the pot of mussels (devil's puttanesca) And the hog wild pizza. Loved the flavor on the puttanesca. The pizza was ok.   Would I return? Yes, but only to have more of their beers, wings and the mussels. Everything else was just ok!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and have been impressed both times! The latest time we went the atmosphere was great! The place is set up so that there's a dining area and a bar area although both areas are great. The bar area is more for socializing/watching a game/ catching up with friends after work. The dining area is great for a date or a family dinner (if you're ok with talking loudly so you can hear each other).   I also really like the renovations/upgrades they've made since I last came. Their new tables are  really elegant and the seating/furniture is also really nice. They brightened the place up since last time and it really made a difference.  Food wise: excellent! Beer selection was fantastic and our server even brought a sample for us to try before ordering. I ordered the burger and they had a beer suggestion but I decided to go with a cider which was great! The fries/frites are fantastic as well and great for sharing. The house-made ketchup is also amazing!!   Only docking a star because we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated despite our reservation, however I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pierogis, fries, and New England mussels. All were delicious and highly recommended! The atmosphere was relaxing. Vast beer selection."}
{"text":"We went here with friends a couple of weeks back for dinner.   Mussels are great here.  We ordered a couple of plates, and everyone loved them.  Everyone had main courses as well.     As others have mentioned, the beer list is extensive. However, they have only a few beers on tap, and when we were there, a large number of them were Ontario Craft beers.  The international selection was mostly bottled, but the prices were equal to other places that had them on tap.  I compare this place to Bier Markt (where I go frequently) and BM has far more beers on tap, and at the same prices as Beer Bistro charges for their bottles.  The ambiance was nice, and the wait staff were friendly.    I would recommend this as a nice bar to eat, with a good selection of bottled beers.  However, for anyone interested in beer, I would recommend the Bier Markt any day."}
{"text":"What I love about the beer selection is that they feature great Canadian brews, but don't exclude good beer from anywhere. I ordered food for the first time last night - the Thai red curry mussels were outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is an overpriced pub.  Admittedly, the pub grub was better-than-average, but I still can't justify the prices of this place with what it is - a pub.  If you are a beer connoisseur maybe you could find more to like about this place than I can, but if not, you may want to find somewhere else to enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"I'm afraid of the revolving doors that take you in to Beer Bistro. Are they some sort of test? Are they designed to embarrass you as you leave?  Aside from my irrational fear of glass doors, Beer Bistro is a fun spot with a great selection of beers (of course) and an enticing menu.  Even though the eating and bar areas seem of average size, the place feels huge due to the enormous ceilings. It feels as though you're in a theatre for a performance, and this is a feeling that the bar maintains throughout your visit.   The staff are well-versed on each menu item, including the monumental beer list. Suggestions and alternatives are made without hesitation. They all give a winning performance. With moody lighting that isn't dark, everything feels as though it's a spectacle, and a constantly enjoyable one at that.  We made a meal of appetizers with some of the best mussels I've had in awhile. The fondue wasn't served piping hot, so for once I had a fondue meal without burning my mouth, a plus for sure. The prices were certainly acceptable considering this is a prime bankers-with-bucks location. The fries were, well, fries, can't go wrong there and the little pizza was full of flavour.  Since half of our party met us there, I'm unsure of wait times, the place was busy, but the rotation of tables seemed to go at a good pace, with no one really rushing out. Out-of-towners will certainly enjoy the people watching and the space will make them feel like little fish in a big pond, something us city folk love to show off."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Drink menu had a good selection and variety. The restaurant was busy but the service was still excellent. And the prices were reasonable.   No complaints, no regrets. It was all around a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Great fries. Wide selection of beers. Reasonable prices. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"extensive beer selection, but the food and service is veryyyy blah. the frites were dry and tasteless, although the presentation of them were good (served in a tall cone with two dipping sauces, but which were also tasteless). we also went with the rabbit ravioli, which was also in desperate need of salt."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice selection of local craft beer and international favorite's must stop for beer enthusiast's. Great freindly staff"}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant for the cheese fondue.  Was a very big portion, there were 3 of us sharing and couldn't finish all the cheese.  There was one type of cheese in it that was very strong that not everyone liked and the bread was on the stale side but very good consistency. Also got the Belgium fries which were delicious especially dipped in the fondue.  I got the duck confit pizza which was very good but the sliced potatoes on it felt out of place and not needed.  Caesar salad was awesome. Salmon was good but found it to be very oily.  Others at table got the meat pizza and loved it.  Staff was very nice, loved the atmosphere and liked that they had free coat check.  Would return."}
{"text":"Decent food with good portions. I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Belgian Frites. The sandwich was mediocre but the frites were a great complement to the selection of beer they carried. However, the staff weren't too friendly and the hostess that greeted us was quite rude."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good brunch and short to no lineups, but only between 11am and 3pm. I love getting the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. There's an awesome selection of beers too, especially if you're a fan of Belgian and sour ales. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the bartenders that does some acrobatics with your drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool! They have over 22 beers on tap, 100 different bottles of beer, and lots to beer infused food. If you food and beer this is the place to be! The servers and chefs are so also very knowledgeable about the menu they have whether it's food or beer or pairings. They also have a patio on the side of the building. It does get much sun because it's between the two big buildings, but it's still nice. We order a Belgium beer with white sauce mussels and also a pulled pork burger. It was so delicious !"}
{"text":"So many visits so few complaints. Sometimes table service but more often bar-side.  This place overestimates itself a bit with all the huffing and puffing in the beer menu descriptions (even for non-fancy stuff) but then BB markets to a pretentious Bay-street wine set who like the puffery. The suit set does not make this place less accessible to all, and it's still a mixed crowd. In fact I like the lively cavernous atmosphere very much, relaxed but elegant. I've brought family and visitors here.  The food is pretty good at least 80% of the time for me - did not like a pizza, though sandwiches generally off the charts amazing. Had some mussels that were muddy. Had some plates that, mm, really depend, those go about 50/50 in the ones that really delivered VS wishing I'd gone for something reliable. And your favorite go-to dishes may be discontinued every so often.  Beer is a little behind the current cutting edge of 'great' craft beer bars, but BB offers well-selected imports and crafts with lots of moderate choices for the non-hardcore friends you may have in tow. Bottles they bring in are often surprising with some reasonably-priced ones.  Just a nice place to while away a lunch hour with a Primanti pulled pork sandwich and a select USA craft beer. And might as well get a side of frites with that to go with the Belgian Ale I'm having next..."}
{"text":"This place has really improved in terms of food quality.  The beer list is fantastic as always, but the food is a lot better than it used to be."}
{"text":"Questionable, possibly nationalistic waitstaff.  Waitress was amazingly friendly to my Canadian friends/colleagues (granted, they go there all the time).  I asked for a napkin and she seemed entirely displeased that I had requested one.  It was like she smelled the American on me.    Perhaps post-election, we'll start getting a friendlier reception when traveling abroad?  One can only hope.  Seriously tho - really good food, good environment, mostly friendly waitstaff and huge beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Beerbistro and a regular patron. The beer selection is great and the food is really good too! The food is really what brings me back as there are a lot of bars in Toronto which offer a wide variety of beer.  The mussels at beerbistro are delicious! I've tried all of them and highly recommend the Spicy Thai, Devil's Puttanesca and New England Mussels (in that order)."}
{"text":"Very nice spot for dinner or a few drinks just off of Yonge street. They have a nice little patio which is surprisingly quiet considering how close the restaurant is to King Street. The beer list is extensive and categorized into themes (Spicy, robust, bold, etc.) and the dinner menu chimes with suggested pairings. The cheese and lager fondue and mussels are excellent share dishes. For mains I really liked the lamb shortloin or the burger if you're looking for something a little less fancy.   Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand what is all the hype around this place.  Went there last night at around 9:00pm with a bunch of people.  Pros:  HUGE selection of beers. Clean, nice decor, dimly lit (which i like)  Cons:  Food was mediocre at best.  We ordered different things from the menu to share:  Belgian White Mussels  Brussels Mussels  Spicy Red Thai Mussels  Flatbread and Dips Duck confit pizza Belgian Frites  All the mussels were way OVER COOKED and about the size of a penny.  VERY disappointed.  The sauce were 'oooh kay', nothing to really brag about.  would've been nice if they gave us some bread to dip the sauce in it!!!  Flatbread and dips, well....flat bread and dips.  Duck confit pizza, was alright, but the supposedly duck confit just tastes like duck with heavy oregano/Italian seasonings.  I think the duck have been sitting out for too long and kindda dried out.  Duck confit melts in your mouth, this one didn't.  NOW THE FRIES!!! I've heard so much about the fries, but BELIEVE ME...I think it is VERY comparable to New York Fries.  I mean, it's not bad, but I really didn't tastes anything different.  The ketchup and horseradish Mayo was nice, but the fries itself....TRUST ME, it tastes like New York fries.  It's great that they have a huge selection of beer, then again, even though I am a beer drinker, I know what i want and don't need 10 pages to choose from.  SERVICE:  The service was ok, nothing really special.  Our server had a really serious look on his face and was to the point.  I guess that's a good thing...    They are really good at clearing plates as soon as you finish and get things out of the way.    Total bill with tips $230"}
{"text":"Ah Beer Bistro, so reliable.  I had a cousin visiting from LA and I wanted to take him to Duggan's for a mid-afternoon pint. Duggan's was closed (It was Sunday, that may have had something do with it).  I headed to the nearest place that I know had beer in the financial district.  Beer bistro is fantastic. Not only because of the super-extensive selection of beers... The quality of food is consistent and the bar staff is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.  We sat at the bar, watching the Olympics and asked questions about the beer. Our server was able to describe in great detail all the beers, made excellent recommendations, and gave us samples to taste.  Everything a great bartender should do. We learned about hoppy beers and the origin of IPAs. It was awesome!  After a discussion about poutine, we ended up ordering a  Beer Bistro version of poutine, which isn't really on the menu, but they can serve it up.  * Crisp golden fries, fried in duck fat (Mmmm duck fat) * Dark smokey gravy (This is one heavy gravy, it's serious business) * Aged cheddar infused with Guinness (Talk about bold flavored cheese OMG)  Probably the one of the heaviest versions of poutine I've ever had. But very enjoyable.  Beer Bistro remains to be one of my favorite places to go. It's great for after work and just to hang out. Yay. :)"}
{"text":"Must Try: BEER Flights (ask the server for recommendations!)  ||  Rating: (9/10) Drinks, (9/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Does not disappoint in bringing the beer! An enormous selection of beer, so there's something right for everyone. I had a few menu items which are pretty decent, but really, drinks are the name of the game here!  Ask the server for suggestions, but the flights are a great deal here and lets you really try your drinks out. I've taken out of town visitors here all the time, and an amazing spot to go out with groups. Although a bit outside the core, a short walk will bring you to this great place!"}
{"text":"Among other bars, I like going to beer bistro to catch a game after work before heading home. It is conveniently located near King subway station; so even in a deadly winter, you can rush a few meters to catch your subway without bearing the risk of freezing-to-dead.   Beer wise, lots of selection, obviously ! If you are not a beer drinker like me, you can easily find substitutes like ciders or wines.  Food wise, I like to order fries and mussels, great finger food to leave the hanger out of way so you can enjoy the game.  Btw, the place has a private room available for approximately 10 people for dinning. Went there a couple of times for work events, quite good and definitely ensure your privacy (especially useful for bankers, consultants and lawyers to discuss secret business in a group)."}
{"text":"Lovely food, great ambiance, wonderful beer selection. Love how many of the dishes are prepared using beer, along with beer pairing suggestions. The desserts were amazing! Had a good tap selection -  wish there were more, but the bottle list was great!"}
{"text":"Trying to say something new about Beerbistro is a fool's errand. Everyone worth their salt in the lower downtown core has probably been there at least once.  I was torn between a three- and four-star rating for this place. While there's plenty to drink and eat, there are some rookie mistakes that should (and probably could) have been avoided.  Chief among them is their list of drinks. I have no problem with a restaurant that switches its beer menu around - I rarely drink beer anyway. None of my concern. What I am concerned by is the fact that no one on the staff last night knew how to make a mojito. You know how to make a complex drink with maple syrup, Maker's Mark, cinnamon and a half-dozen other ingredients, but you don't know how to muddle mint and mix rum in it? Considering the number of other mixed drinks this place offers, I don't buy for a second the line from the waitress about keeping their menu small.  I was on one of those \"brooding, Sonny Crockett-esque\" moods, and not having a mojito disappointed me. I went for the concoction mentioned above, called a Cinnamon Maple Bourbon Sour. A good drink, but it was overtaken by the cinnamon. Were it not for what followed next, I likely would have rated Beerbistro a 2 on this drink alone.  Those fries.  Those damned duck fat fries.  HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. The taste is out of this world. The aioli is so good that my friends and I ended up ordering additional bowls of it. It seems like the container holding them is bottomless. It doesn't even matter that it's $7. It justifies the trip on its own. A couple bites of those fries and I instantly understood why this place is so popular. It may not be the cheapest beer joint around, but it more than makes up for it in the quality of its dishes. My friend had a salmon dish and reported that it was very good as well.  The other reason you would come here is for a date. My friends and I were hanging on the patio after a Jays game, and watched multiple couples weaving in and out of the place. One woman was fawning over her date, while another looked like she was about to strangle the man she was with. The scenery at Beerbistro alone is worth the price of admission. I would contend that at this price point, there are few better spots to go with a loved one. The atmosphere is incredible.  I haven't even had a chance to check out the inside (which looked nice from what I saw), but I plan on going back very soon.  In the end, I rated Beerbistro a 4. Although it has a few small issues, this is a fantastic spot to hang with friends and enjoy the night.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection with tons I hadn't seen before. The samplers are great as you get to choose any 3 draft beers to taste. The food was good, not great but definitely tasty. I had the steak frites. The fries were excellent and the mushrooms and crispy onions were delicious, but I ordered a medium rare but was server a medium well steak. The prices were reasonable for the quality and atmosphere. Overall would recommend, especially for the beer lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Was taken here on a lovely date one time. The atmosphere is very fun - the staff know what they're talking about and our drink was never empty - water or beer!   The Good:  1. Staff. I must say they are some of the best in the city. Very attentive, knowledgeable, and most of all fun. They even do tricks with the beer bottles! 2. Beer. Selection is superb and lives up to its Beerbistro name.  3. Atmosphere. Causal relaxed feeling with a touch of upscale.   The Bad:  1. Food. It's not totally bad, but it's not the best to be honest. It was a bit bland and the bread for the fondue was stale.  2. Price. For what you get it's really not worth the price (unless you count the funny bartender who can do tricks).   I would definitely recommend giving this place a try for a date. Theres all kinds of different seating for you to choose from and you will be entertained.   Recommendation: actually try gluten free beer. It's better than you think!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We had a reservation at 7pm and arrived a little early and they sat us so that was nice. I'll start with the good. The beer I ordered was great and all the food was pretty good too.  Perogies: Really delicious. Cooked very well and I loved the onions and other toppings. Belgian Frites: the portion size was really generous and of course the fries were awesome. Belgian White Mussels: again the portion was huge--came in a large pot with a side of bread. The mussels were great and the broth was even better. Very flavorful.  The bad: Service was really slow. I was halfway through my dinner by the time I finally got my beer. It's also really noisy, which is typical for many restaurants, but I felt it was hard to have a conversation.  Overall it was good and I'll go back, but probably more of a place to gather with friends."}
{"text":"Very good. Love the beer selections. Large amount of great craft beers. Tons on tap as well as bottles. My friends had the fries cooked in duck fat which were really good. I had the heirloom tomato and beet salad. Hardly any goat cheese and it wss a very small portion. For the price point it wasn't worth it. Beer based ice cream was fantastic. The dragon stout with skore pieces in particular. All in all id go again, mainly for the beers. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good spot to spent time with your friends. I had a blonde beer and it was tasty and nice. My friend had the lime beer which was very good.   I place is nice and the environment is good.   Service is fast and the guy who took care of us was very helpful by recommending different options.   I think you should try it out."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro is a brew-pub with 100+ beers available for the beer connoisseur.  Frequented by the 9-5 suit crowd it offers a pleasant environment and a ton of beer to satisfy even the most picky brew fanatic.  The beer inspired menu is above-average in both price and quality and service is very social and friendly.  It is not a place I would eat at frequently, but for a frequent beer meet with some friends or business colleagues Beer Bistro is a great place."}
{"text":"I've been here before but it's been years, even though this is around the corner from my office.  As the name suggests, they are an exceptional spot to go to for Beer.  An incredible selection gives you variety away from the common kegs at most bars, and knowledgeable staff to help you choose something for you.  I went with Le fin du monde or The end of the world, from Quebec.   Loved it!!! They call it a spicy beer but I just thought it was delish :)  Tried the vegetable tagliatelle. .. and it was ok.  The meal could have been Spicer but it was definately not bad.  They have a really nice, long patio to enjoy the summer warmth (too cold inside with AC for me!).  Service was pretty good too.  One last thing, the Fries are fantastic so be sure to try them out!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent however service was a little slow. Also, if you're hoping for the crème brûlée as seen on yelp, be prepared for disappointment as they've recently changed the menu!"}
{"text":"I only came here for a beer, so take my review with a grain of salt. Beerbistro is located just east of the King Street Financial District. Fittingly, Beerbistro is a bank-turned-bistro. The restaurant is an aesthetically pleasing space with high ceilings, modern lighting  and white tablecloth. Sophisticated would be a good one word description. Tables are closely spaced next to each other and the interior is intimate without being overly cramped. With that said, the noise level is high even at off-peak hours. The service was attentive and our waitress was pleasant.   My buddies had dinner at Beerbistro before I joined and they enjoyed their meals. Judging from the empty dishes and plates at neighboring tables, the food must be decent. I would describe the menu as upscale pub food. You have staples like pizzas, burgers, buffalo wings and pulled pork sandwiches. At the same time, they have \"fancier\" items such as Belgian Frites, Duck Confit Spring Rolls, Grilled Salmon, Mussels and Lobster Quesadilla (really!). A good variety of items, each with a suggested beer pairing. I regret not being able to make it for dinner.   Beerbistro has a robust selection of draught beer. I count 20 on their menu, representing Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Ontario and Quebec. Unfortunatley, but not surprisngly, they don't offer too many American craft beers on draught. They do have a dedicated Rogue Tap which is a plus. They also have an extensive selection of bottled beers (50+). Since I hardly drink any Canadian craft beer and I'm a huge IPA fan, I opted for the Publican House Square Nail Pale Ale. It was a solid choice.  Overall, Beerbistro is a nice classy place for dinner and drinks. As other reviewers have mentioned, it may not be great place for a romantic dinner due to the noise level. However it's an awesome venue to meet up with friends for good food and beer. They also have a nice little patio area for those warm nights. I'll be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city.   We eat at beer bistro every few months. While not the cheapest restaurant, it is totally worth it. The atmosphere is easy going and the servers are very good and attentive without being pretentious. They are also very knowledgeable and can recommend things based on what you already like.   The fries are the best in the city and I love the mussels as well. They have a wonderful selection of beers and even if you aren't a beer lover they have the beer to convert you. Many times I've had the chance to try rare or unique beers that are not available in stores that are no longer even available there.   The one time I was disappointed was when we came after 11 and had the poutine. The poutine was not good, so don't have it. Go while the kitchen is still open and have anything else."}
{"text":"I was craving mussels and this place popped up in recommendations.   I tried the Spicy Red Thai Mussels and it was good, not the best I've had but good enough. Mr. H had the burger and thought it was decent. He did however really enjoy the beer. I had a few cocktails and they were fine, this is not the place for cocktails. We also tried the belgian fries which was good but a very large quantity, we never even got through half of it. Also, even though I mentioned to the waiter that we would like to fries to begin with, it only came along with our food and I would really have preferred to have it with our drinks. The service was not the best, the server seemed to be in a hurry and was asking us for our orders 2 minutes after handing us the menus.   Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants to come in for a beer and snack post work.   PS: I agree with another reviewer when I say that the fries were too salty."}
{"text":"Great patio, great beer selection, great service.  Any place that carries my favourite beer (Fruili) wins a place in my heart.  I studied the menu and also found a couple of similar beers - it's always good to have a back-up plan.  They were all out of the beer my date selected, but the knowledgeable waiter was very helpful in helping him select a similar beer and explained all the similarities and differences.  We were seated at a nice table on the patio and found the noise level perfect for conversation.  (I hate noisy bars where you have to scream at each other from just across the table, and too quiet can be awkward.)  I didn't have a chance to get to the food as this was strictly an after-dinner drinks-only rendez-vous.  Menu looked interesting and the food traveling to other tables looked appetizing."}
{"text":"We had excellent service.  The main dishes were delicious, yet not that large, but the superb desserts made up for that!   Their bread and pizza dough with beer in it are to die for."}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks on a hot day. Service was excellent, atmosphere was great. We sat outside where there was a much needed cool breeze. Didn't eat but food at surrounding tables smelled amazing."}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown Toronto, Beerbistro is a chic little spot with decent beer, and average food.  Your best bet is to stick to the bites and small plates, as their entrees aren't worth the price tag. So pull up to the bar, grab a flight or two and some fries, fondue, or tacos, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good food.    Kobe beef tacos $15 - they were good in flavour but a little dry  Perogies - amazing! So much depth of flavour... If you love mushrooms and onion this is the dish for you! Pricey for $18  Duck fat fries - probably our favourite dish! Huge portion for $6 served in their signature cone napkin... Really flavourful, perfectly salted and crisp (I'm sure they're at least double fried).   It's not a raving review but it's certainly worth a visit. Best part is their beer selection... Organized in a way that's easy to read and navigate through the types of beer you like."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because the beer selection and the company were great.     ---   ---   ---  This wasn't one of those places with a wall of 50+ taps, but they had a solid selection of some great Belgian offerings, which really hit the spot. The service was incredibly friendly, as were the surrounding patrons at the bar. I visited during the World Cup - sorry for the delayed posting, this draft was written but never submitted!   But it was neat to talk soccer with some Canadians and a couple of other visitors from other countries. It was at Beerbistro that I learned about Canada's lack of interest in America during the Olympics/World Cup. I always assumed Canadians probably rooted for the U.S. in such things.... nope! They root for Canada, then England, then who cares. The border sharing does not influence them whatsoever.  Now... that has nothing to do with Beerbistro, but I'll never forget the time that I learned that the rest of the world doesn't care about us lol. Even despite that, the company was very enjoyable :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Beer Bistro a few times. The beer selection is pretty good, but the wait staff does not \"know\" it. The beer is just another menu item. The food is good, whether it be appys or a meal. The duck fries (fries cooked in duck fat) are always worth getting. The steak is above average. The oysters were ok, but not great. The wings are tasty and good for a change, but they only do them the one way. I like Beer Bistro as a place for a drink after work. The atmosphere in the bar, and on the patio (seasonally dependent) is good for chatting with a beverage in hand."}
{"text":"Awesome place with excelent beer from all over the world. Great food and incredible attention. We will obviously return to try the others 100 beers we didn't try!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was nearly empty, so naturally we were a bit spectacle if this was the right choice for lunch...boy are we glad we stayed!  The mussels were great, but the puled pork sandwich was the real highlight.  Seriously, this sandwich changed my life.  The smokey BBQ sauce is homemade and the fries on the sandwich make it INCREDIBLE.  I'm already craving another one!!  YOU MUST TRY THIS SANDWICH - yum!!!!  The beers are the perfect icing on the cake, with something for every pallet.  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner  Ambience: 3/5 (Looks a bit tired, went here mid-early 2014) Food: 3.5/5  Service: 3/5 (Nothing to complain)  Repeat: Not really.  But in all fairness not being a beer drinker, not sure how well I'd assess this establishment."}
{"text":"I really wish they would open up a place in San Francisco or New York. We had Cider, Spicy Crab Benedict over potato pancakes, Salmon Benedict and flourless chocolate cake. The breakfast was amazing.  I rarely see everyone at a table finish ever bite of a meal, but we managed.  It's well worth a trip and I look forward to coming back here when I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place needing to escape the cold and was more than pleasantly surprised. They have a fantastic beer menu with both local/imported/bottled/tap beers. I had a 'Smoky' something, it was delicious. Not much of a meat eater, I ordered the The pear, blue cheese pizza which was EXCELLENT. The place was a little noisy as it was so busy but besides that Its certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"Uncomfortable corporate lunch look and feel. It was close to my hotel so I stopped in soon after arrival. Got a seat at the crowded bar right away and took the place in. The first feeling you get is that some power lunch spot vacated last week and they moved a whole lot of beer in and kept going. The room makes one think of martinis not beer. The financial news channel on the giant TV at the bar was a bad sign too.  So, yeah they have a lot of beer, but how much of a choice is too much? I ordered what looked appealing on tap and a burger. Beer an ok choice. Burger was not too good at all. Run of the mill at best.   Then after paying and walking out, the bartender chased me down on the sidewalk because he forgot I paid him just five minutes previous. Funny. Overall I was sorry I stopped in, and wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is the mecca of beer and food pairing in Toronto. A busy and classy, yet unpretentious, downtown gem where both connoisseurs and newbies won't get disappointed. As a cheese fondue addict, I can assure you that you won't find any better in the Alps than the one coming out of this kitchen. The mussels, though rather tiny, are served generously in a variety of broths and come with a delicious loaf of freshly baked Cantillon sourdough.   I wouldn't mind finding a horse steak, served only blue (I will choose for you North-Americans and screw you vegans, vegetarians and horse riders) or a Belgian carbonnade (beef and beer stew) to complement the wonderful and liberally served beef and duck fat (nice twist) fried fries, just to list a few suggestions to add to the already delicious menu.   The friendly servers, who seemed to be trained professionally, belong to the best in the city and surprised me, a beer connoisseur from birth, multiple times with astonishing choices (try the Dogfish Head World Wide Stout as a dessert).   Five well-deserved stars. I guess you know where you will find me on my birthday."}
{"text":"I only go to Beer Bistro for one reason only, the Fries. The food is good but not amazing (nothing noteworthy, the burger wasn't that good when I had it) but the fries are frickin awesome."}
{"text":"Where to begin... Beerbistro deserves its high rating - food, service and beer selection are all excellent. My night tho, did not end so well, mostly because of this and add in good company.  First, the food and drinks: - belgian frites Top choice, great flavour and texture - new england style mussels Small mussels but good - wagyu tacos Loaded with meat, but it's ground - pulled pork pizza My friend's fave, tasty bbq sauce - steak frites Excellently cooked and seasoned medium - 3 Lindeman Apple - 3 different stouts  I made reservations for a Tuesday night which I highly recommend. Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. The bar and dining area are separated, but still open and you can see into the kitchen. The space is stylish and comfortable at the same time. We could've stayed there a lot longer since we were never rushed with our seating or food. It's a bit pricey so -0.5 star for me.  So how did my night not end so well you say? It was just my friend visiting from NY and myself dining, so we ordered wa-haaay too much food. I am also a beginner beer drinker,  a fruity Lindeman Apple was the obvious choice (and it was very good). But I guess 3 beers and stuffing our face with all this food pretty much had me rushing to the women's washroom for a \"Technicolour Yawn\" (I had to google a nice way to say 'puke' - sorry, TMI).  In the end, my friend and I had a great time! I'm glad to lose my beer-ginity at Beerbistro. The very first (2-day) hangover wasn't so much fun... Amateur - I know!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, doesn't even fit on 1 page. The food is great, the desert is great and the service is great. No complains."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of microbrews plus some interesting selections from Europe. It is a great place just for drinking.  But the food is also very good.  The mussels are outstanding.  We had the Brussels-style mussels - a large pot of mussels flavored with spicy sausage and herbs.  There are also good flatbreads, and a range of other beer-influenced foods.  The food is pairs with the brews, the service is helpful and the atmosphere is very pleasant.."}
{"text":"Heading to Beer Bistro on a Friday night to catch up and meet a friend's new love interest, was the perfect choice. Good ambience, comfortable bench seating, good drinks and a surprisingly diverse late night bar menu.   Our table 'sampled' (more like devoured), a chicken w/ bacon burger, cheese fondue and the legendary frits fried in duck fat. All delicious, rich in flavour, wonderfully presented.  This was a great spot to drink beer (and caesars) with friends and chat, definitely not a wild and bumpin' spot. I would recommend Beer Bistro for dins with friends or family, and a relaxed but intimate drink later on.  The staff was really great, and the beer selection of course, amazing. It's hard to find my favourite, Fruli beer (strawberry!!!)"}
{"text":"Good spot for beer, knowledgable bartenders. Can get crowded, especially after work hours. Try to grab a seat at the bar and enjoy. The food isn't bad but skip the 'kobe' beef tacos - if it was real quality kobe beef it would never have been served that way (stuffed with beans and everything else)."}
{"text":"First restaurant in our Canada trip. I was looking for a guys friendly place (business travel with a couple of guys) and this place seemed to fit the bill.   Walking in, the Beer Bistro appeared to be a high end restaurant.  The beer list is amazing, with a large list of beers, from common brews to rare finds. I had the cider myself, which I enjoyed while my friends tried a variety of         IPAs.  The food was good, I had the goat curry, which had a good kick to it. The steak frites my friend had was apparently really good and so were the lobster quesadillas. One must try is the Belgian frites! Don't shy away because of the description, it's worth it! Prices were reasonable, though trending high,, running $20 CAD per entree, while the drinks are about $8 or so.   I didn't have room for dessert but they did look good.  At the tables they had realistic flameless candles, which my friends insist deserve a half a star unto itself.  The slight negative was the server never refilled our waters. I suppose they wanted to encourage the beer consumption! Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Visited for a quick meet with a friend on Monday lunch hours. Was quite excited to walk in and try this place out after seeing good reviews, don't let them get you that soon like it did for me.  The interior design is quite eye-catching, modern and clean. It boasts great atmosphere and my friend and I sat near the door. The staff are friendly and nice but also very professional. There was minimal wait on sitting down, getting the menu and getting to order. It's a solid 5/5 up to now.  The menu is well organized, not much to munch-on for a lunch menu but we decided to get the burgers made of Canadian Chuck. I also ordered the suggestive pairing for the burger which was the Shillow Sass. It was definitely a good tasting beer and tasted just like how it was described on the menu, but I'm not a beer expert so I'll leave it there.  The burger came with cole slaw and pickles on the side, with the burger itself having just lettuce and tomato. The burger itself wasnt bad, the patty was cooked to perfection, it was very moist and tasty. However the bun really threw me off, its taste didn't blend in well with the rest of the burger and it left a strong weird taste after. The texture of the bun also was pretty weird compared to what traditional burger buns are like: soft yet mildly crisp white buns. I guess the focus really is on the fact that it's probably healthy and trying to be experimental. I'll give the burger itself a 3.5/5 since there wasn't much in the burger itself and tasted alright as a whole, pickles won't change the score sadly but their in-house made ketchup (i believe) may kick it up to a 4, definitely try it out with their ketchup.  The cole slaw, however was the calamity of this dish. It tasted blend, it honestly looks like how most Mondays look like; like a lazy slob of slaw was lazily thrown onto the dish. It didn't compliment the burger nor the beer, the slaw could have been left out for a better experience. I know i walked into a beer restaurant but any part of a dish that's served in any restaurant/pub/bar should never be this bad. Solid 0/5.  Overall the experience wasn't bad, i just really hate that slaw. I'll definitely come back to try other menus and other beers they got, but based on what I got I'll only be able to give a 3/5. Two burgers and a pint costed ~$55 after tax and tips.  Tl;dr: meh foor for too much $$"}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give 2 stars but I didn't..  I'm feeling generous today.  While the beer, the service, and the location are great...the food fell short.  I had my eye on the mussels which we found out that they were out of...so I opted for the corn dogs...which again we found out that they were out of....I settled for the sticky lamb ribs on the recommendation of the server and my wife had the kobe beef tacos and the baked onion and ale soup.  I can't complain about the portion of the lamb ribs...there was more meat on the plate then I could finish...unfortunately the lamb was over smoked and tasted dried out..  While my wife enjoyed her tacos...I thought the meat was so tender that you really couldn't tell what the texture was...it also suffered from a heavy hand in the spice department.  We both agreed that the onion and ale soup was pretty damn good...  Cool place, great beer, decent bar food..."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Beer selection curated with and expert eye . Great food, great service.  You should go here."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  As a beer-lover, I appreciate that they match the differently-shaped glasses with the respective beers.  I didn't eat there, but the food looked decent.  It's nothing spectacular, but if you are in the neighborhood, it's a good place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"Great service & greater food.   I had one of the best burgers in recent memory here. Dripping with fat oils, and each bite perfectly accompanied with veggies and tangy sauce.   The patty itself was beautiful. I can't describe the happiness I had on those beautiful couple bites."}
{"text":"Not sure about the food, since all I tried were the Belgian frites blanched in beef and duck fat, and they turned out to be nothing special. But the beer selection is pretty good. Especially the cellar menu (five kinds of Cantillon!). Many beers are exclusive to the place only and some of them they have in different years, so you can do vertical tastings.  On the downside the service was a bit slow and the patio is just a fenced off patch of concrete jammed in between two huge office buildings, so there's not much to look at.  But I will definitely recommend the place to any beer aficionados, and be coming back myself."}
{"text":"While the food at Beer Bistro is good, particularly the fries and mussels, the attitude is the worst. The bar has 2 areas, a large diner's section and à over crowded drinks only Section and mary the two shall meet. Despite working locally and visiting  numerous times, the staff never acknowledged our frequent attendance and wouldn't allow our group to sit in Diner's section even at 4:30 pm when the area was dead empty.  A place that does not make customer service a priority does not deserve customers. Go if you like attitude as a side with your overpriced craft beer."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium-rare steak, it was well-done. The Belgium frites is not even close to the real one. Adding ketchup and mayo doesn't mean your frites are Belgium, cause they must must be, at least, crunchy!"}
{"text":"I went to Beer Bistro a few times, because its always been a fun experience. Great selection of beer, amazing steamed mussels, and friendly staff :)   Atmosphere could use a bit of a face lift, and the hostess was vaccuming one time which was weird, but I'd still go back!"}
{"text":"Ehhh, wasn't too impressed by this place. Prices were high, and descriptions of food were misleading.  Fries tasted like any home cooked fries, and there wasn't any taste of beer batter in them.  I ordered the kobe beef tacos and the pulled pork sandwich.  The tacos tasted ok, but the sauce overwhelmed the slaw which had no taste whatsoever, and the pulled pork was drenched in a overtly sweet sauce.  Beer selection wasn't good, and the \"flight of beers sampler\" showed a picture of them coming in a paddle and sampler sized beer glasses, but we all received our samples in small wine glasses..  Service was polite and friendly which gave them another star lol."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome food and generous portions. You have to try the Belgian frites. Service was fantastic, and the selection of beer goes without saying. Even a good selection of non beer bevies if you so desire.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I dropped in for a catch-up with girlfriends after reading about the great reviews. The place has a high ceiling and is a great spot right near King Station, so it's great for beers after work or anything of the sort. Go figure, since it's called beer bistro. Unfortunately the bistro part fell far from expectation and left the place with a \"not much to write\" conclusion.  We dropped in around Oktoberfest time, but the special menu wasn't much. I got the schnitzel since it's on the regular menu as well, thinking yes that's a regular item, should be safe, but really it was bland and boring. Perhaps if I was two pints in I wouldn't taste the difference? It was nonetheless not a bad place to sit and catch up, we saw many tables doing just that, but food fare is subpar and the price is more than I want to pay for what I got.  Probably will not be returning unless I'm in the area and looking to grab beers in a place with a cool ceiling. That's about it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I return to this place regularly and recommend it to all our friends and family. The food is great and so is the beer selection. Service is excellent, knowledgeable and friendly.  The super high ceilings create a nice atmosphere but if the place fills up, and that seems to happen every time we're there, it can be very loud."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro is easily one of the best destinations for beer lovers in Toronto. They do things up classy - owing to their location right near the business district downtown, it seems. The interior space looks really good, and there's a separate bar area with TVs as well as an airy patio.  The beer menu is absolutely gigantic. In addition to offerings from a seasonally rotating tap list, Beer Bistro easily has the largest bottled beer selection in Toronto, drawing its contents largely from European and American brewing heavyweights. I'm more partial to beer on draught, and so I prefer the nightly updated taps at Volo for extra variety and freshness (as well as a more local craft/microbrewery-focused selection,) but the bottle list at Beer Bistro could make even the most seasoned of beer geeks start to tremble with anticipation. They employ the great idea of dividing their beers into well-defined categories that even the novice drinker can understand - Spicy, Fruity, Sociable, and so on.  The food menu is more focused and not as large as the beer selection, but the kitchen does an excellent and creative job. It is mostly built around the familiar \"upscale pub cuisine\" standard -  flatbread pizzas, steak frites (the frites are really awesome and come with mayo as well as the standard ketchup - hooray!), pastas, ribs, grilled fish and a goat curry dish, etc... The menu is rounded out with the Bistro specialty - mussel bowls in a variety of styles, all incorporating beer into their broth for extra flavour. I'd suggest trying the Brussels style with smoked sausage, fennel, Belgian blonde ale and hot peppers. There's even a dessert menu with such selections as beer-infused ice cream!  Service can be a bit slow at times, but the quality of the food will hopefully make up for the extra time it could take. A stupidly minor, but annoying quibble, if I'm allowed one - don't bring bread out before mussels so it sits and turns hard and cold! The servers are well-acquainted with the menu and all the ins-and-outs of the many beers available, as well as how to pair them.   A quick story: I was eating here most recently with a friend who works at Starbucks. It turns out that the owner of the Bistro is a regular patron of that very Starbucks! He recognized her by chance, came over, introduced himself and much to our surprise brought a bottle of awesome Italian sour beer by our table on the house! Now, that's service!  If your idea of a great beer place has as much to do with more refined surroundings and delicious food as it does with beer that tends to be on the exotic side (rather than the fresh and local,) Beer Bistro is your place. It may be a bit expensive but, it's a knockout."}
{"text":"My friend and I we're looking for a nice place to eat and drink and we came across this place which had great review on Yelp. We trusted them and we went for it. I weren't disappointed!  First of all, the service was impeccable. They we're friendly, gave great advice on beer selection and menu also. The cheese fondue was to die for, you could almost just drink it. Be ready, it's good for two, but you better be starving, it's a big portion. We took the fries with the mussel. The beacon and potatoes we're delicious with the mussels. We ended with the chocolate cake who simply melts in your mouth. Can't wait to be back in town to try some more.   Amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Lots and lots of beer,  check. Lots of tantalizing entree options...not so much.  After  deliberating what actually sounded good to eat I settled for the salmon and my husband the lamb ribs.   My salmon was slimy and the \"salad\" with asparagus that my meal came with was a huge tomato cut up into 4's (note out of season tomatoes are just mealy and gross) with 2 cold chopped asparagus coated in a creamy feta like creme.....not tasty,  filling or satisfying. Husband's meal was much better , his potatoes were good and the ribs tasty but awfully fatty. Probably won't return but server was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 but Yelp won't let me.  I like the food here, moderately noisy and ok-amb."}
{"text":"They have a decent beer selection here. However, the food was alright. I would say this place is more business-y. Many people who work in downtown core come here for drinks after work."}
{"text":"Beerbistro was conveniently located to our hotel in Toronto and made a nice impression on us when we stepped in for dinner on a Saturday night. The dining room area felt really open despite the amount of tables in a relatively small foot print and the decor was very comfortable, darkly lit and modern. Very much my taste. Upscale Belgian beer themed bistro is what I would call it (shocking based on the name right?) and the food and drink definitely reflected that. The two ladies got samplers of 3 different draft beers that had plenty of quantity and at a very fair price. I was a bit disappointed they didn't carry any craft sodas since I don't drink at all and I find it a nice feature in a lot of high quality restaurants/beer joints.   We went with the special of the night which was roasted suckling pig accompanied with mushrooms and house made chips and we grabbed a side of their fries as well. The pork was amazingly tender which we expected and offered a pleasant sweetness that paired well the salty mushrooms and chips. It didn't have the punch I've grown accustomed to with the roasted pork I get from Dominican and Puerto Rican establishments but nice in it's own right. Chips were top notch crispy and seasoned well with rosemary and the right amount. The definitive highlight of the meal was the fries cooked in beef and duck fat. We loved the fresh cut, skin on fries that were crispy and darkly flavoured in the best possible way with creamy interiors that showed off their skill at frying. Both the house made mayo and ketchup were tasty and that is coming from someone that hates mayo in general. Truthfully, I stayed toward the ketchup and the drippings from our main course but the mayo was significantly better than the jarred stuff.  I sampled our dining companions mussel dishes and both were very solid. The Thai broth was spicy and well seasoned with cocount and lemongrass and the New England style was decent if not quite up to the level of the Thai version. Mussels in both cases were cooked well with no signs of grit. A little bit pricey but plenty in each serving to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food and beer! Fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Laid back yet polished atmosphere in the heart of downtown with great beer, food and service!"}
{"text":"A great place of food and excellent beer selection. Having been here on multiple occasions, it has lost some of it's luster over the years. The food is still very tasty but has become less spectacular with the recent changes. My Belgian frites became french fries so better to make them at home. The draft menu, bottles and cellar still are worth seeking out. Together good food and great beers still make it a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Came here after a conference and had some drinks and food with friends.   The beer list here is extensive but the staff are very nice and will help you in making a selection.  I had the mussels which were very nicely done. The broth was delicious and mussels were cooked to perfection. I didn't get any unopened mussels which is rare when you order mussels. I think the litmus test for a good pot of mussels is always whether you want to drink the broth. In this case, I asked for their entire stock of bread and then proceeded to sop up the entire pot.   The decor is nice and modern. Quiet enough that you can talk. Good place for a date. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Boy the food quality has gone down here. This is the 3rd visit where the food was of poor quality so I feel an update is warranted. The beer selection is still great though they have competition now so sitting on their laurels won't do them any good as the food quality has to be brought up.  Things started a bit shaky as somehow we ended up ordering the the Syrah and it was off (teaches us to order wine for place synonymous with beer) On to the food we ordered the following Beer Burger: Devoid of seasoning and the necessary fat IMO. The bun didn't do it any good either as it had an odd finish to it. The salmon which came with couscous was so oily that plate looked it was ladled with oil.  The chicken curry was strange attempt at regional cuisine as the meat still had skin on it. Needless to say we won't be back here for food for sure. 2.5 stars mainly due to the beer selection."}
{"text":"HUGE beer selection.  Everything cooked with beer.  Nice variety of high end bar food.  Infusion of ethnic flavors- Caribbean and Indian especially.  Laid back, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"casual atmosphere, not too fancy, not too casual. I would say, this is just a place to get good beer and maybe some decent food.  the menu was ok- 3 out of 5 stars service was attentive 4 out of 5 stars  overall execution on the food, nothing to write home about. Noone hated their food but noone talked about it like I have to come back. So not totally a bad place, it was satisfying and served its purpose.   was the dining experience of a lifetime? No, and its really a better pub than place to eat. Just know that going in."}
{"text":"Prior to a concert at the ACC, my group and I were looking for a simple menu with good drinks.  After googling, some nearby places, we settled on The Beer Bistro, which offers a casual outdoor patio. For a Tuesday evening, it was quite busy. Probably wouldn't be bad idea to make a dinner reservation; however, we were early enough  We each ordered a 3 draught sample ($6). I was very excited to see BitBurger on the menu, as that was token draught we were used to drinking in Germany - quite refreshing!  Quite impressive were the Mussel Bowls ($16.95) - Belgian White were preferred over the Summer Saison. Our group also shared the Spicy Kobe Beef Tacos (which were small in portion size and not quite flavourful enough) and a Hog Wild Pizza ($15.75).   Service started to slow down towards the end of our meal (7:30pm), as more hungry patrons entered.  If you're a group looking to share and have a taste of many items, order a few extra things for the table. I found portion sizes to be smaller than normal. Overall, I enjoyed the outside seating, standard service, and selection of draught beers."}
{"text":"Love the vibe in this place: beery and classy. Love their beer selection. Server had to come back 3 times because we hadn't picked. Once we chose, he brought it right over. There were 2 servers in the bar area and they took care of us very well.  Ordered a flatbread and that arrived pretty quickly. Lots of toppings and the crust was crisp and tasty. I'd get it again!   Nice high ceilings and all seats looked pretty comfy. I sat in the lounge area.   I'd love to come back to try some other brews and food!"}
{"text":"As the name suggests, this is a \"beer\"bistro. So prepared to be entertained if you are here for the beer, or be prepared to be slightly disappointed if you are here for the food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  In the restaurant wasteland that is the financial district (or so it seemed), beerbistro stands out as a decent option. With dozens and dozens of beer options, including some really nice Belgian beers for reasonable prices.  The mussels and frites here were solid, though they need to be a little better about bringing you a bowl for your empty mussels shells. The lunch crowd here is mostly business folks and it gets really crowded really fast.   Overall the food is solid and the beer list is worth checking out."}
{"text":"The waiter was very knowledgeable about beer and hand picked 6 beers for us to try (with the beer tasting option on the menu)  The pulled pork pizza we ordered was a bit of a disappointment as you taste pretty much only the BBQ sauce. It's ok for me but it's just not amazing as we expected.  I like the Belgium fries, which I think is fried in duck fat. I think it's pretty good, but bf says he has tasted better ones. We both like the beef taco though! It's really flavorful! The beer that the waiter recommended to go with the taco made the taco tastes even better, we really appreciated that :)   Overall the tasting menu is actually quite generous, you get to try (I think) 4oz of each beer of your choice. We might not come back for meals but it would be a good place for happy hour or a weekend hang out with some beer and taco :)"}
{"text":"Service was good. The server was friendly and took time with the table; however it took at least 35 minutes for the mains to come out after the appetizers, and he only apologized for the wait once he was bringing the mains - during the wait time we were ignored.  I liked the atmosphere, but the room was freezing cold. I hate over air-conditioning.  I had the soup to start.  It was incredibly salty, and I am not usually sensitive to salt.  This is a tactic used to get you to order more alcohol, and I don't like it.  (Speaking of which, I hate beer, but I ordered one beer that was supposed to taste like sour cherries and it was amazing - like a mix of red wine and beer).  For my main, I had the maki appetizer.  It was so spicy I had to get my water refilled 5 times during the consumption of it.  Again -- a tactic used to get you to order more alcohol.  I'd rather have had good food and drank more alcohol because it paired well.  We finished paying our bills around 11 pm; after a bit of time (the room was still full so they must switch shifts at this point), our server hinted we were his last table and he wanted to go home.  A big hospitality no-no, especially when we all tipped over 20%.  I'd go back, but I ain't rushing."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant has a great beer selection. One of the best for sure. Very accessible location by ttc 504 king streetcar. Very friendly service. It's definitely one of the kings of it's trade. Pricing is a little steep but fair for the  products and good service."}
{"text":"Solid beer and drink menu and delicious food! We came in at a random pre-dinner time on a Sunday and sat in the bar area enjoying the tomato/red pepper soup, mushroom pierogies and potato latkes with salmon. All were delicious and good portions (perhaps latkes were small-ish). Definite thumbs up."}
{"text":"By far the best meal we had while visiting Toronto! If you love good food and great craft beer then Beerbistro is the place to be.  The food: Hog wild pizza- bacon, sausage and pulled pork sauce. Need I say more?  Truffle potato perogies- crispy and delicious without being too greasy.  Smoked salmon- rolled and served on top of a potato pancake.   Steak tartare- my go to dish pretty much everywhere. Made perfect with a cracked egg on top.  As for the beer we had way too much to mention and left more than a bit tipsy. But for the full run down go to their website to down load the full list and beerbible. During the summer months outdoor seating is available  and service is on point. I'll for sure be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"i should really give 5 stars. great great staff. amazing berrs . huge selection. very very good food. love this place. coming back!"}
{"text":"I was in the Royal Bank Plaza waiting for a friend, I found Beer Bistro using Yelp as one of the top bars in the area. I really enjoyed the decor of this venue- soft lights, high seats and lounge chairs - the crowd definitely seemed like a bunch out of the show Suits- a well dressed group. The hostess said it was first come first serve basis for seats during happy hour and the place was packed. I weaseled my way through to the end of the bar near the window. I didn't order food - but the menu had some solid choices like the mussels. The dishes price around 15$ price range. I asked the bartender to recommend a stout - I couldn't really hear him. He gave me a pint of St Ambroise oatmeal stout (I paid 8$ for homeland beer lol le QC) but the service was decent so I didn't mind even though it was on the pricier end for a pint. There is an Oktoberfest special going on this month. Cool spot - minus the crowded venue. 3 stars for this place during happy hour."}
{"text":"I went here on a date and it was very busy. I'm glad my date made reservations before hand as some people had to wait. This place is small and lively. Seems like there were many business suits having beer/wine after work. They had a great beer selection and tried some belgium beers that had a kick. I ordered, bacon covered steak peices, chicken quesadilla and it wasn't too good. I will recommend to have dinner somewhere else because the food sucked. One good thing was the service was fast and friendly. For future, I will go for drinks but not for food."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro is a few steps away from my office, and has become a regular spot for business lunches.  The beer selection is great and the food is good.  They even have dogfish head on the menu!  You can just about find any obscure brew here, and I'd say the overall selection is on par with Bier Markt, although some of the offerings are from the bottle.  Food wise, be sure to get an order of the belgian frites that are deep fried in duck fat - delicious.  I typically order mussels here and they have a long list of different flavours.  You'll get sourdough bread on the side.  A note that any of them that include bacon I found to be quite salty (it'll just make you drink more!).  The sandwiches are also very good, but they only come with a small portion of coleslaw, which makes the belgian frites that much more necessary!  It's a small restaurant with a decent sized patio and a bar in the back that allows you to sit in front of the kitchen, which is neat.  They also play classic beer commercials in the washroom.  The only thing I found is that the decor could use a bit of updating (for some reason I remember the pattern on the chairs).  Anyone looking for a more intimate restaurant that has a great beer selection - this would be it!"}
{"text":"Fun energetic atmosphere.  Great beer selection and of course i had the cider.  I had the hog pizza and yes they use just about every part of the pig.  The server was nice but they almost seem short staffed.  Maybe it is a Canadian thing but i like to have my water filled once in awhile.  I would try it again."}
{"text":"With a good supply of beers both in bottles and on tap and some interesting food (we got tacos, cod fritters, truffled pierogies and duck fat fries) this place is a winner, plus it's open pretty late which is handy when you arrive on a night flight."}
{"text":"I went last night with a large group. Food was great, lots of interesting beer choices. We really enjoyed ourselves. Not too noisy.   We were among the last tables to leave that night. After paying our bill. The waitress asked us if everything was OK and if we enjoyed ourselves. We replied yes, everything went well, why do you ask. And she said because you didn't leave me a tip. Our bills were charged for service, I'm assuming because we are a large group. It was embarrassing for her to ask us this in front of our friends. We were in disbelief. We told her that service was already charged to our bills. Which is why we didn't tip.  It was very upsetting that she asked. I don't know if her goal was to embarrass us into giving her more money or simply to make us feel bad. What's worse her role that evening was partially a manager and to close up the restaurant. It was an extremely unclassy move and it will deter us from returning.  I enjoyed the restaurant but was extremely disappointed with the service after that incident."}
{"text":"Great brunch! I loved the salmon benedicts. Desserts were really good too. I don't like beer myself, so I didn't try it, but they have a huge choice of beers. My girlfriend had the spirit tree cider, which she really liked."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar in front of three TV screens and a wide array of beer. Tried the mussels with Belgian white and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is my go-to restaurant for unpretentious, QUALITY food in a great relaxed atmosphere.  I've been here twice so far and my favourite item on the menu is their steak, grilled to perfection.    Staff is extremely knowledgeable about their extensive beer selection (understatement of the year) and can help you select the best beer for your meal.  Also had the trio of beer-related ice cream for dessert, which was a really fun dish and great for sharing.  The first time I came here I just stumbled upon it and it was PACKED.  Fortunately another party didn't make their reservation so my friend and I got a table quickly.  The second time I went, it was pretty much empty even though I had made a reservation.  I would recommend booking in advance, just in case."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here.  Food is definitely for the acquired artesian taste.  It's really delicious though.  I've had the frites- amazing, pork pizza- surprisingly yummy, and the Cesar salad with salmon- also delicious.  Our bill was about $76 for two people plus two beers.  Atmosphere was great.  Everyone was super friendly.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Douchey inattentive self-absorbed bartender but decent beers on my visit.  Another couple complained to Zoe about the bartender as well while I had my one beer and then quickly left to go somewhere with better service.  Wanted to like this place but oh well..."}
{"text":"The service here was very good, and the staff were fairly knowledgeable about the extensive selection of beers (including a number of local and local-ish beers I'd never heard of or tried).   The ambience is nice, though we were there after work (around 6pm) and the place was very loud -- not due to music, but rather due to other patrons' conversations, which are amplified by the high ceilings.  The food we had was quite good, a little bit on the expensive side, but not too bad (around $15-$25 for an entree). The mussels were very good."}
{"text":"Overall, a pretty good experience.   Mussels were delicious but the bread that they came with was a bit stale, not warm and not exactly 'sourdough-esque'.   The steak frites (only steak on the menu) was a veiny. Everytime I'd look over at my boyfriend's dish, he was sawing away at a stubborn vein.   The lobster quesadilla was very good, their house-made sour cream was delicious. I paired the quesadilla with a bowl of roasted red pepper and tomato soup and that was pretty good too.   Obviously they have a wide selection of beers to fit anyone's needs. The servers are there to narrow down your choice.   Pricing: overall with apps & dinner, 2 drinks and 2 deserts - $130. Worth it? Mehh...might come in and try something different next time!   Tip: Always always always make a reservation! This place is small and gets packed quickly!"}
{"text":"The pork pizza is quite good! Whole carmalized ears of garlic with smokie sauce and pork! Yum!  Buddy's Bison burger was a 4.5 out of 5 as well..  Rich flavor!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big beer drinker but I still miss the cheese fondue from Beer Bistro.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"If you like over paying for a  330L Trappistes Rochefort 10 ($16.39) while surrounded by douchey bankers (redundant) than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer.  Knowledgeable staff.  Great environment.  Enjoyed the Saturday special of raosted suckling."}
{"text":"This is a beer lover's dream come true.  Their draught selection is top notch and each beer gets poured in a glass it was intended to be served in which really highlights the beer's distinct qualities.  I was really surprised at the good prices here as well considering where it is located.  I've paid much more at jack Astors for shittier beer. The bartender was great and really knew his stuff.  Will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Good beers, reasonable prices (esp for Downtown Toronto), really friendly service."}
{"text":"It hurts me to take away a star from my original review, because I really like Beer Bistro. This review is based more on my most recent visit.  I was excited to bring two colleagues and I here after my first, great experience several months ago. We ordered a few appetizers -- the crab quesadilla, the flatbreads, and the Buffalo wings -- because we had a large lunch that day. The Buffalo wings were small, but good, the crab quesadilla was decent, and the flatbreads were lacking the adequate amount of dip. We went on to order soup afterwards. Unfortunately, the tomato and red pepper soups came out lukewarm and my chicken hot and sour soup had a little too much kick to really enjoy it.  I do suggest, though, that you finish with the chef's dessert sampler -- each of the five desserts served were awesome.  My other stops in Toronto were at Earl's and Jump, and I have to say that, this time, I enjoyed the food there much more. I still love the Hog Wild Pizza here and obviously they have a great beer selection. I'll still come back again, and I hope they will win me over me again."}
{"text":"Love Beerbistro!  The taps are great and the prices are really reasonable by Toronto standards.  The food is really good; however, what makes the place is the friendly, entertaining staff.  I love the fact that it's a nice pub - without the attitude that can sometimes be associated with a gastropub.  One of my favorite places to go each time I'm visiting."}
{"text":"I don't think I could say enough good things about my experience at Beerbistro.   The food was delicious, and better than I expected based on some of the other reviews. Started with the duck fat fries per the recommendations on yelp and they did not disappoint. Even the ketchup for dipping was extra tasty. Also had the Bavarian pretzel special for another appetizer. You could smell the butter on the pretzel, which if you're a lover of soft pretzels, you know is key. For dinner, I had the Brussels Mussels which I thought were far better than average and plenty to fill myself up for a meal. Loved the gate at the end of the pot so I could easily dip my bread into the broth. Sadly they were out of the rockfish that my dining partner ordered initially, so he settled for the chicken which was fine but not satisfying when he had initially wanted something a little more exciting. For dessert we had the peanut butter ice cream sandwich. It was a little tough to dig into since it was so frozen, but was totally yummy.   My dining partner is an avid fan of beer. We had fun trying several of the different brews and didn't find one that disappointed. And to add to the experience, our server REALLY knew what she was talking about when it came to the beers. In fact, I really wish I could remember our server's name, because she definitely helped make our night. She was the perfect mix of attentive without rushing us or being on top of us. She had all the right recommendations and told us some great stories about the beers we were having.  The atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for as well. It's a nice place without feeling too nice to show up in jeans and be relaxed. We were in Toronto for only 2 nights from Washington, DC. We felt like we found the perfect place to get a feel for the local scene. We almost went back our second  night it was so good."}
{"text":"Came here upon a friends recommendation as he lived close by this place. Was expecting a pub-like atmosphere from the name of the restaurant but was impressed by the classiness, decor, service and food here. Would definitely come back here again.   Atmosphere: excellent. Love the bar area and the separate dining area set-up.   Price: Mediocre. $15 for muscles and $25 for steak which is about average pricing for this ambiance.   Presentation: Excellent. Loved how the food was presented and served. Especially liked the sour cream in the muscles.   Taste: Amazing!!! The sauce from the muscles were really really scrumptious. I'm salivating thinking about it and couldn't get enough of it. Steak was also excellent and the duck pizza was also good. All items were great!   Portion: excellent sized portions.   Service: above average service starting from entry into the restaurant. Staff are very customer service oriented, friendly, knowledgable and food also was service especially fast! Very impressed with service here."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Belgian bistro.  A wonderful selection of beer and utterly amazing mussels."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro offers a place with great food and beer in an atmosphere that's comfortable but upscale enough to for entertaining your less uptight clients. I know it's not too far from Bier Market and those other places, but this place is in a whole different league.  They make their fries in duck and beef fat which makes them awesome.  They also make their own ketchup with a nice smokey flavour.  Burgers and pulled pork sandwiches are great.  Soups - the real test of a chef, imho - are excellent.  Basically, there is someone in this kitchen who really knows about and cares about great food.  Love it."}
{"text":"Pretty great for beer and food pairings I haven't tried there cellar aged beers as of yet.. Can be 30$ and up a glass I will one day though,  I'd recommend the flight 3 beers of any draught,  and the duck fat fries."}
{"text":"Little known fact- Beer Bistro's brunch many years ago was not stellar.   BUT NOW IT IS! So good- had the benny- I usually am not a fan of benny's but it seemed to dominate the menu.  So I ordered the mushroom benny. Comes on a potato hash brown- so SO good, with a pile of delicious sauteed mushrooms, goat cheese and perfectly done eggs. With a generous side of yummy greens this is like- my PERFECT breakfast.  Some here on the weekends for brunch! It's amazing. (PS: It's also REALLY competitively priced.... I've spend much  more for much less in DT toronto for brunch.)"}
{"text":"I don't like beer. So, you can imagine how ironic it must have been to find myself eating here. To add to the irony, I liked it so much that we came back for drinks and dinner the very next night.   Beer Bistro has a very impressive (I assume) beer list. Their one cider, a Canadian offering, was lighter than the average cider I am used to. It was very pleasant. I can't come up with beerish adjectives, so sorry.   Over the course of two dinners we tried as much as we could.   Appetizers: Belgian Frites, which are sinfully delicious thanks to the duck fat. Mussels Al Diavolo with a nice but not overwhelming sauce. Arctic char sliders - not really burgery sliders but, light and tasty none the less. Tandoori Ribs - wow, do they cook ribs well - so meaty and just fatty enough to be indulgent yet not sickening.   Entrees: Pork (we got in on the Saturday Special, which was really good. And the pork ribs, which I regrettably could not finish that came with a wonderful cheddar and bread dressing. A dinner salad with chicken and thank goodness they made an effort with this salad (Most just slap lettuce and tomatoes on a plate). The pulled pork pizza - which really plays nicely between the salty in the mozzarella and the sweet of the barbecued pork. Finally, the chicken was just succulent and juicy wrapped around an oatmeal with polenta and grilled vegetables - that was some damn fine polenta.   The staff was very pleasant. The drinks were nice and strong. The service was very satisfactory.   If I had any complaints, I would say that while I like the jazz combo on Saturday nights, the drummer could really put a damper or cover on his snare. I like to talk with the people I eat with. I also complained about the fact that we didn't get dessert either night. But, not to you."}
{"text":"Food is decent, casual chill place. Mostly came for the beer and the selection did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped by for beer and a appetizer.  The beer was great.  Certainly not cheap but many choices and the bartender knew his beer.  We wolfed down the duck fat fries.  Nothing more to say.  Great place for a Friday night beer.  We will be back on our Toronto holiday."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, very helpful and very knowledgeable. Excellent selection of beers. Food was excellent and reasonably priced! Muscle bowls are the specialty."}
{"text":"I usually find a new patio to try out for drinks and food on sundays for my friend and I ..  Found beerbistro on yelp and thought we'd give it a try.   The drinks were good , there was a very limited cocktail choice.   Enjoyed the patio, very chill and relaxing , not too busy or loud. There were many little fruit flies everywhere around our drinks but what can you do i guess. Nature.   We ordered hog wild pizza ,perogies and the belgian frites. Fries were lovely. Pizza was delicious and perogies were pretty good.  I cant say the portioning is excellent for the price, but definitely tasty.   Server had a bit of attitude, thats the one part that annoyed me. I never like to put down people serving us, so im always repeatedly saying thank you when they bring stuff out, and take empty plates away, and im always saying sorry if im asking for something .. This server wasnt being Rude but he was definitely making us feel as if we were a waste of his time.  Only time he actually smiled and said thank you  was when we paid and tipped."}
{"text":"I am giving it one star for their horrible service, but 4 for their food. I think Yelp should develop a rating system separating food & service. Beerbistro, among other places, is an example of a place that needs such a separation.   The food's good, the beer's good, but the staff are not. The hostess looked very annoyed when we got there, although there were only 2 people waiting after us. Even though we went 10 minutes ahead of our reservation, we were sat down 15 minutes into our reservation. What is up with that? I saw the manager kept walking around and to the hostess counter, and he saw us waiting, and said nothing. Being the hostess of this birthday party, I felt embarrassed about how they are treating my guests at my party.  Having a group of 8, I requested for us to be sat together and they failed to do so for us because they didn't have a big enough table (which they never told me on the phone). Fine, we sat separately. 6 on one, and 2 on another.   The food came out on time and so did the drinks. The mussels, beer, and pasta were fantastic! Everything was almost forgiven with their great food & drinks. At the very end, I requested our waiter to please take a picture for us and he DENIED me, quote \"Sorry, I have alot to do, and do not have the time to do it.\" Excuse me? It takes literally ONE MINUTE when everything set up already by my friend who is camera savvy and had it set up. No tripod, just a regular camera. I was so angry at this fact, but I decided to keep calm and not say anything to the manager.   I want to return for its food, but their service really is making me think twice."}
{"text":"Wide beer selection. We got 3 samples for $6. Blanche was light but tasted watered down. Also the duchess tasted a bit like sour wine.  damn the belgian fries were good. Too bad the fries were short and small which made it harder to eat. It comes with a sweet ketchup and a garlic aioli dip yummmm  I had the pulled pork pizza. The crust was similar to flatbread. It was good - thin but thick enough to hold up the toppings. The toppings were decent.   Service was great. Our waitress cleared our plates promptly, refilled our waters frequently, and super friendly.   Lovely atmosphere and great date place."}
{"text":"This is the first time I visited Beer Bistro and I will definitely be coming back!  They have  an option where you can pay $6 and sample 3 different specialty beers.  It's a great opportunity to try it before you commit to a full pint.  There is a great variety of beers and the prices aren't too bad for downtown Toronto.  We had a great, entertaining waiter who was very knowledgeable about the types of beers on offer.  We didn't order any food but I will next time I'm there as I've heard it's tasty."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing staff. There is a tremendous choice of beer. Fries and pizza are the specialty. Had a burger which was good enough. The place looks old and could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Great beer selection with helpful descriptions.  More geared to adults, but very accommodating to our family with older teens.  Fondue was excellent, great creaminess with adequate sharp cheddar bite.  Mussels were also fantastic with julienned thick bacon slices and potato in an addictive buttery broth.  Mussels were preceded by two fresh, yeasty round loves of house baked bread, which we greedily dunked into the rich broth. Daughter loved her Caesar salad. Hog wild pizza was fresh and delicious as well, though very small for the price.  Not a great value for the money, but attentive service, great beer, knowledgeable bar staff and delicious food.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection. Beer infused cuisine. A classy joint but not pretentious.  Knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here on a weekend for lunch. The restaurant serves their brunch menu until 3pm, so we took advantage and ordered $3 beer mimosas. You can't go wrong with mimosas.   The staff are well educated on their beer offerings and the food. We had great service from the beginning of our meal to the moment we left.  We ordered a large bistro salad, the fries, and the spicy red Thai muscles. The salad was perfect to share, it had a good dressing and variety of veggies. With no protein, I probably wouldn't order this as a main. The Belgian frites were phenomenal. Blanched in beef tallow and duck fat, and served with house made mayo, they were probably some of the best fries I've ever had. Perfectly crunchy, salty and very flavourful on their own. The muscles were cooked in a flavourful broth with peppers and onions. They were tender and a little spicy and came with sourdough for dipping.   If I dined here again, I would have a very difficult time ordering something else off the menu. I loved each dish we tried and would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Slow service and it took over an hour after we ordered, for waitress and manager to inform us that some items on menu are not available. When the main course finally arrived an hour and half after we ordered, the mussels in Belgian White was delicious. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"This is our second time here so obviously we are pleased.  The fries are out of this world.  Service is speedy and professional."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, beer is not the best thing on the menu at the Beer Bistro.  Although it cannot be questioned that this urban oasis of specially crafted beers is best known for its fine selection of suds, Their Belgian Frites are second to none and a clear standout.  For the reasonable price of $6.00 one can feast on crispy Frites blanched in duck fat and served with sides of house-made mayonnaise and smoked tomato ketchup.  The frites come stacked in a pseudo cone of paper which needs to be unravelled as one works their way through the order.  Great atmosphere, great beer selection and Belgian frites that can't be beat."}
{"text":"One of my top 5 favorite restaurants.  Never had a bad or even mediocre meal there.  Pulled pork primanti and frites is my usual order.  Pulled pork has a lovely smoky flavor that doesn't overwhelm and pairs well with Quebecor cider.  Frites are fries, duck fat fried and decadent.  Staff are always attentive and very helpful with pairings."}
{"text":"OK, so I don't like French fries.  I know, I have issues.  But, if you ask me to choose, I'll choose onion rings every single time.  Now, remember that for later in the review.  So, hubby and I are visiting Toronto for my birthday festivious.  We are staying at the Omni St Edward across the street. (Highly recommend see the review there).  Despite the concierge recommendation to make a reservations for Saturday night, we thought we'd wing it.  (Not recommended, despite the Easter holiday it's quite busy).  So, hubby suggested this place, Yelp reviews were favorable, and it's soooo close.  After walking about 4-5 miles today, my dogs are barking.  So, we go around 7, and it's packed.  No room at the bar.  45 minute wait, per the hostess.  But wait, she says!  There is room for 2 at the chef table, which is down a hall!  What?  Cool!   Looking at the menu, and Yelp reviews, duck fat fries get great reviews.  Yeah, but I'm not crazy about fries.... We'll pass on that.  I order  the bourbon cocktail, yummmmm.  Oh, guess what, at the chef table, they give you fries on the house.  OK I'll try them.  What??? omgosh, AMAZING!!!!!!!  I guess I don't like fries because I've never had duck fat fries!  Holy moly, amazing!  Entree....oh just the Saturday special which is a suckling pig over polenta.  Again,  amazing.  And we got to watch the kitchen staff work their magic the whole time.  Dessert was a house made stout beer cookie and cream ice cream.  Wow, out of this world.  Did I mention I don't care for beer, either..... Who would have thunk it!  Go.... now.... eat their food!"}
{"text":"Beerbistro was fine in every way, but I can't really justify more than 3 stars.  We had the duck-fat fries, which I read many glowing reviews of.  I found them under-seasoned, just a bit soggy (not much), and not really tasting of much duck fat.  And I normally like duck-fat fries a lot.  They weren't bad, just not particularly good.  Our other dishes were the pulled pork and the chicken curry.  Again, both were good, but that's about it.  I had much, much better pulled pork the next day around the corner at one of the Front Street Foods stalls (at Union Station).  And the chicken curry was well-cooked (moist, tender chicken) with decent sauce and rice.    Again, it was a perfectly fine lunch.  Service was very good, and it had nice outdoor seating.  Food was just good enough, though."}
{"text":"Stopped in one evening after a long day in the office. Broad selection of beers. Enjoyed the brussels mussels and fries. Left full and a bit buzzed. Will happily return."}
{"text":"I had the mussels with chorizo to start and the steak frites. The mussels were good to go. No beards or grit. The chorizo sauce was chunky with a lot of flavor (not spicy at all). The steak was cooked medium rare and was decent enough. The frites were crispy with good flavor from the fat that was probably poured over it. Overall nice vibe on a Friday night. I'd come here to meet with friends or date night."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here this past Friday and were disappointed. I got the pulled pork and it was barely warm and the fries that were on it tasted like they were randomly picked off a plate that the busboy was dumping. The Thai curry mussels were fantastic, cooked perfectly and the broth was excellent so my date and I mostly ate those. I would have been able to live with mediocre pork but the service was terrible. The waitress never came back after someone brought our food so we didn't get any more drinks and we just sat there with our empty glasses and plates in front of us. The place wasn't even that busy and it looked like other tables had to call her over because she was just standing there watching the game. We ended up leaving and going down the street for additional drinks since she didn't seem interested in doing her job."}
{"text":"I've been to BeerBistro a few times, before and after their renovations. My overall impression: beer list is great, the food is hit or miss.   Before the renovations, the restaurant was a little dated, but I recall the food to be good. I was there a couple of time recently, and I had the flatbread/pizza, and it was a little bland. But the wings were fantastic! Absolutely perfect on the patio with a cold pint, and a side of Belgian fries."}
{"text":"Apart from the attitude by the two hostesses at the front when they learned my friend and I didn't have a reservation y time at beerbistro was good times! It is a shame that our experience started off a bit on the sour note when we were judged for not having made reservations and then asked if we wanted to dine or just do drinks and snack on apps. Since we were looking for the latter we were pointed towards the crowded bar area saying it was a first come first serve basis and that people kept leaving so we should be able to find a place.   I was feeling a little ticked off by this as while the bar area is a good size, it's not large enough to really have a lot of standing room to enjoy beers, but lucklily for us two seats at the bar opened up in a few minutes and we took full advantage.  Since then my experience was off the hook as the bartender was excellent at his job being friendly, efficient and such a pleasent guy to have around. He was very helpful when it came to discussing the various beers on tap and recommending ones.  The beer selection here is without surprise what really puts beerbistro in my list of great beer places here in Toronto and not another overpriced restaurant catering to the Bay street types (although plenty of those were around too). The area we were seated had a good mix of all kinds of people, even a guy or two by himself looking for some beer. So totally a fun place to be at.  Their beer selection is not the biggest out there, but they are well covered that you will definitely find the right kind of beer for you. They even have a sort of \"beer of the day\" which when I asked my bartender about, he did not hesitate to provide us a sample (in a cute little glass).   We only ordered their flatbread, which was delicious, well presented and over too soon since the quantity was a little on the smaller size, and the overall impression I got from just their appetizer menu was \"sounds great but look at that price\". But our food was delicious enough for me to want to try out more items in future visits namely the variety of mussel bowls they have available.   Overall, beerbistro is a great spot for beer discovery at a great location and while reservations are highly recommended for a meal, it's not the end of the world if you do decide to spend your evening at the bar area."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is located in Old Town and has been a place that I've heard great things about (granted, mostly from beer enthusiasts).  It helps that they use everyday adjectives to classify their beers which help newbies like me navigate through their extensive beer list book which boasts some 100+ beers.  With the disclaimer at the beginning, I naturally opt for a fruity beer - Lindeman's Pêcheresse, a Lambic beer, mostly made from peach juice and ringing in at a low hang-over rate of 2.5% alcohol.  I had previously been to Beerbistro in 2012, but word on the street is that the owner has changed and I would assume the chef has too because the experience was different from my first.   We start with their halibut fish tacos which are piled high with diced tomatoes, red onions + avocado purée.  The fish is lightly battered and the filling was quite delicious.  I wasn`t a huge fan of the taco shell though - too starchy. The first time I ate here I had the lobster tacos, which were also a disappointment.  Lesson of the day - stay away from the tacos?  We then turn to the drunken mushroom pizza; the dough is made with St. Ambroise`s Oatmeal Stout.  It is topped with goat's cheese, stout-braised mushrooms, mozzarella + tomato sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  But then again I always have a soft spot for mushroom pizzas.  The showstopper was definitely these New England-style mussles, braised in beer, with diced potatoes, bacon, shallots, smoked cheddar, leeks and parsley.  The sour dough bread was delicious in its own right with a nice crust on the outside and soft, spongey centre which was perfect for sopping up the braising liquid.  We shamelessly devoured both the mussels, sopped up the juices + ate the entire bread basket.  And while I almost never opt for butter chicken (which is ever-so-popular on pub menus), Beerbistro nails it with their brown ale butter chicken topped with eggplant, tomato, cream, on a bed of brown basmati rice, crispy papadum & coriander.  This was delicious. Not your usually mess of overly-sauced plate of brown, unrecognizable slop that makes you wonder if it really is chicken under there.  No doubts here.  The chicken was perfectly tender and the crispy papadum is one of the freshest I`ve had.  And beer does have the ability to reduce spiciness the way a slice of bread can save you from the burning flames of a habanero pepper.  While I am still not going to reach for an ice cold can of beer as opposed to a cold glass of wine, I will definitely not hesitate to make my chicken beer-can style at the next barbecue because if I've learned anything from my dining experience at Beerbistro, it's that everything tastes better with a little beer ;)  *Meal was complimentary.  Opinons as always, are my own"}
{"text":"I come here often enough that I'm not sure how this missed my yelping radar at any rate it's high time I sung Beer Bistro's praises!  It has probably the most astounding beer selection in the city. You have a beer for all tastes as listed on the menu and a good number are always on rotation for draft. My good friend and I like to hold what we deem to be our 'beer summits' here where we catch up on the going ons of our lives all the while debating which beer(s) we will imbibe along the way. Dayna's beer of the moment is often a good bet and if Dayna is in, she's an excellent resource to mine for information about brewski's.   Food is pretty good here, though some of the offerings on the menu are pricey, stuff from fancy schmancy-bistro entrees to prettied up bar appetizers. I love the belgian fries they are hand cut and come with mayo so I'm not obliged to ask as I do at other places. And if you're a mussel lover they have a diverse selection of mussel dishes available -some spicy, some cheese or some classic.  So if you're in the mood for casual drinks with friends or a classy hot date, Beer Bistro is an excellent choice to consider when downtown."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and the second time I came especially for their mussels...    I LOVE MUSSELS! The simple fact that they have so many varieties of mussels on their menu is enough to make me exicited. I've tried 3 flavors of them: Spicy Red Thai, New England Style and Brussels Mussels. I'd say the Spicy Red Thai is my favorite! Their mussels are very fresh. Totally enjoyed it.   Besides the mussels, I also had the cheese fondue, Belgian Frites and the Rainbow trout salad. The fondue is ok - like Melting Pot better. Frites - I can never tell the differences of fries...they are taste the same to me..I did love the trout salad though; it was a big portion with decent amount of trout. Pretty nice.   I don't really drink so I can't comment on the beer part, though i guess that's the reason why most people are here. But I know I will def come back soon, when I crave for mussels next time!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place more stars because their food and beer selection is one of the best in the city. We usually have a few drinks here before the game but the head bartender is a complete doosh. My friend wanted to pay with a $100 Bill which was not from the recent edition and he refused it right out and told us to take it to the bank and have it changed, not only is that bill easy to check and see if it could be fake, but it has brail and a hologram on it. Most bars in the city which see a lot of cash should also keep a green money pen to check and verify bills. But what really pissed me off about this arrogant Toronto bartender was when I asked him if he accepts U.S bills and if he would take dirty ones from Zimbabwe, he replied yes dollar for dollar, so a old $100US would make no difference to this guy and his own legal tender would. What a joke! Clean up your policies on taking cash, we do not live in the dark ages especially when the new bill was only issued about 2 years ago."}
{"text":"Top notch beer selection well over a hundred. Bar tenders are knowledgable an friendly. Many different food menus depending on time of day. I had the smoked wings which were some of the most unique wings I've ever had. Fall off the bone good spice. Overall just a great experience."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Ordered the \"to-die-for\" pierogies - wasn't wowed. Bistro salad was \"meh.\"    I really was looking forward to this place based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the only thing cool about this place is the decor.    Showed up around 9 in a Friday and there was no wait.  Probably indicative of the joint, right?  Ordered the bistro salad and added grilled chicken.  Greens were overdressed and wilted.  Chicken was dry. So dry that I felt like I was eating cardboard.  Pierogies looked great...but flavor was lacking.  Unfortunately, the one thing that I was looking forward to was not worth getting again. Cousin said his beef tacos were just okay.   Maybe it was an off night. MAYBE. But, not so sure I'm willing to drop $100 on the chance it may be another\"meh\" meal."}
{"text":"beerbistro is a very frequent haunt of mine in Toronto, almost exclusively for a draught and an order of the well-regarded frites.  The cone of fries sided with smoked ketchup and house-made mayo is so good you'll run over your own mother to finish them.  I've sampled the pizzas, sandwiches, and a few other items and all have been very good.  Of course, the beer is what brings people in, and they don't disappoint.  My friends are always attracted to the samplers and an opportunity to try a few of the great craft beer offerings, and as of late, the chance to drink a Dogfish Head without dealing with customs is an attraction to me.  Finally, the staff are excellent - I've never had bad service here, and more than once have found them to be very personable and helpful in your decision-making process.  Negatives?  The prices are fairly high for everything but the frites, and as noted by some others, things can get extremely loud at times."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday. I had never ventured in but by the happy hour Bay street crowd plus the Yelp views, I was intrigued. Maybe with their extensive beer menu, I could find a beer I truly like.  I made a reservation through Yelp and Open Table. The restaurant called me the day of to confirm and even handled my time change and various requests with ease. I wish I could remember the hostess's name but she was great. Plus her tattoos were awesome!  My friend was literally in awe that I thought I might see a tear trickle from his eye. The beer list amazed him. He even found a beer he didn't think he would consume outside of the Netherlands and got that far away look like he may have died and gone to heaven.  We started our meal with the Kobe beef tacos and they came out quickly--literally so quick, our waitress hadn't even come back with our drinks order yet. Very impressed by the speed.  I ordered the Steak Frites and it was delicious. My friend kept thinking there was something wrong when I was eating slowly but it was so good, I didn't want it to end. The fries were good but nothing special compared to other places I've been.  I really liked their house-made mayo and stopped short of licking the metal container in came in. My friend ordered a side of mashed potatoes that I wasn't too fond of. It may have been too much sour cream but I wasn't a fan.  I was also impressed by our waitress's knowledge. She suggested an ale that perfectly complimented my main dish. My friend suggested cider for me and I enjoyed it a lot.  Appetizer, 2 ales, 2 ciders, meals and dessert = about $120. A bit pricey but around the same level as most high-end restaurants. I may not have found the beer to convert me on this trip but the food was delicious enough, that don't mind giving beerbistro another attempt to convert me to a beer drinker."}
{"text":"3 - 3.5 stars.  This place was recommended by my cousin's manager and we decided to stop by today. We came around 4ish for a very early dinner. I didn't like the hostess, she seemed very pretentious. Based on my friend Lana. D's review, I ordered the hog wild pizza - $18 and the Belgian frites - $6 to share and my cousin ordered the burger. We also decided on the beer flight - 3 samples for $6.   Our server was great and gave his recommendations for the beer flight and I enjoyed 2/3 beers. I don't remember what the names of the beers were called lol but they were nice.    The Belgian frites came first and holy crap it came in a very generous portion! I couldn't stop eating them. However, I found the hog wild pizza to be just okay..the edges were a bit dry and burnt.   I don't think I'll return anytime soon, the only thing I truly enjoyed were the Belgian frites. And if you're a beer lover, they have an extensive selection to choose from! Other wise I'd pass."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner with colleagues tonight. Nice spot, very cozy with great food.   While I'm not a beer drinker, their beer menu was impressive and one of my colleague quite enjoyed the varied selection.   I had the chicken curry for dinner and the food was full of flavour, good portion size.   The fries are something to have as well.   Would go back there again."}
{"text":"In my short time in Toronto, it seems every place I visit revolves around beer. This place is, obviously, no different.  Beer selection is amazing. And the food is just as good. It's the first place I've ever had mussels and there were surprisingly delicious. The fact that they are all cooked with a type of beer must be the secret to their flavor.   I absolutely love their fries.   Ugh, all my reviews are starting to run together. \"Beer good. Food good.\" Good good.\" But seriously, I don't know what else to say about this place, other than you won't be disappointed. The food and beer are top notch."}
{"text":"Went up to Toronto for a short vacation and stayed right across the street at the Omni. In four days we went to the Beer Bistro three times!   This place has an outstanding beer list (both bottles and draft) , great food, friendly locals and great service.  I highly recommend it, especially for fans of Belgian ales!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, great tasting food and really nice environment. The portion sizes for the mains were a little small however the frites were plentiful!"}
{"text":"A Banh Mi should have a light airy French baguette that is really just a wrapper to the contents.  This was a very dense bread, had to be cut with fork and knife.  But biggest problem is it was filled with lemon or orange  rind, which was all I could taste.  Chef should taste the food coming out.  I give it three only for the great draft beer selection and the knowledge of the staff on the beer menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an early dinner here yesterday after hearing a lot about this place. They feature over 100 beers in bottles and tap along with a well crafted menu. The place was busy for a Tuesday night but no waiting for a table for two.  I ordered a well priced German lager and my friend ordered a Quebec ale. Both were winners. For food I opted for the veal chop which came a little undercooked but the side of polenta was simply amazing-great choice! My friend ordered the generous portion of curry chicken which was rather authentic in style and taste.  While the meals are a little on the pricey side for a pub, the quality and quantity won't disappoint. Next time I will order the frites which are cooked in a beef/duck fat!!  Final verdict--Bay street means you pay a bit more but good value for your money! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm generous with stars, but I believe in giving credit where credit is due. I've been here a handful of times, and consistently the staff have been fantastically helpful, the beer selection has been awesome, and the food has been delicious! It's not a gigantic establishment, which keeps it personalized and contributes to the overall experience - which I really enjoy. It can still be personal and intimate enough for a date, or lively enough for a group of friends/coworkers.  Like many other people have mentioned, you have to try the Belgian Frites! I'm a huge mussel fan, and their mussels have always been delicious! Their flatbreads are also great options - and perfect for sharing! Definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on New Years Eve and had such a great time! The servers are very friendly and the food is absolutely fantastic. They offer a huge variety of drinks (mostly beer) and recommend beer pairings for each entree. I got a beer flight for only $6, which is a great option for a place that is known for its beers. We ordered the Cheese & Lager Fondue and the Belgian Frites to start. The fondue was so good that I almost  asked our server for a straw to finish it off. However I didn't need to because the Belgian Frites were perfect for wiping up the fondue when we ran out of bread. As a main, my boyfriend and I shared the Duck Confit pizza and the Pulled Pork Primanti. The Duck Confit pizza was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The flavour combination was spot on, and they didn't skimp out on any of the ingredients; it was absolutely overflowing with goat cheese and duck! The Pulled Pork Primanti was also delicious and packed with a ton of pulled pork. The portions were all very generous, so I was feeling pretty massive by the end of the meal. Unfortuantely I  didn't have room for dessert, but I would love to go back next time I'm in Toronto to take a stab at that particular menu."}
{"text":"Went back in May with BF, who works in the area.  On a Thursday night, this place is filled to the rafters with guys in suits, and women who prowl the aforementioned. It seemed to be a lot of groups of \"you bring a few single friends, I'll do the same\". I felt out of place in my causal jeans, tee, and blazer.    We got wings with blue cheese dip (completely unmemorable, but not bad either). I let the barman pick a flight of three samplers for me. My partner got a St.Ambroise.  The flight was interesting, with a lot of variety, but with no theme, nor vertical or lateral movement (meaning there was no logical/ palate transition between beers). Chocolate stout, a Vienna lager, and a spicy blonde- none were memorable enough to make note of. But that doesn't change my rating of Beerbistro, as when letting other people pick with no criteria, you can't really fault the result.   Just under $30 for a couple drinks and a snack (before tax and tip)... pretty average for the area.  Noise: deafening over the flirting of groups of singles.  Service: Just average.  For a rocking total of: Just a-ok.  Not a bad choice if you're really into beer, wanting to get into beer, post work drinks, or having a small get together.  Definitely not a good choice for romantic dates, memorable food, or a casual evening."}
{"text":"I work downtown, hence spend a lot of time here. I prefer to leave it behind me and make my way to my own neighbourhood, or, dare I say...kitchen....for dinner, but when I can't, I unfortunately have to visit places like this.   I'm sorry, downtowners, but there's nothing awesome about fries in a paper cone, unless you're in England, wearing a newsboy cap and calling people \"guvna\". Otherwise, I'd expect not to be charged like $11 for food wrapped in NOW Magazine. Seriously.   Before I say more, yes, I have a hate-on for the downtown core and it's restaurants. Why? Because they charge a premium (because their overheads are likely sky-high) and then don't really deliver on great food or great service and they never deliver on atmosphere, because all of the stripey-shirt IB guys who don't remember what their kids look like are there having mussels for dinner. Ew.   I've heard they have a fantastic if not overwhelming selection of brews, including from craft and microbreweries. So I guess that's good. But the prices and the 'tudes have to go."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and very decent menu options.  I wouldn't say this is a foodie-paradise, but the food is good here.  We ordered the mushroom flatbread and the New England style mussels - definitely satisfies for two.   Mussels were the highlight here.   The real draw here however is the beer selection.   Awesome!  They have their own little booklet for just the beer selection, explaining the tastes and smells of each.     Tons to choose from, both draft and bottle, so every picky beer-brah will be satisfied.   It also looks as though there are things that rotate on tap too.       I'm only here visiting for a weekend, and this was the first place we popped into on a Friday lunch and so far so good Toronto!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is great (as expected by the name.) Particularly good at mixing local and international beers - some of the best Toronto places lean heavily toward local, so it's nice to have an international draft selection that goes beyond Guiness and Hoegarten.   Ambiance is slick. The clientele descends from the nearby towers and nurses wounds sustained in the collapse of the derivatives market over a pint or six of Affligem.  That said, I've also shown up here  in jeans and the staff at coat check have put away my down parka without so much as a raised eyebrow.  The food is ok. The appetizers are better than the mains, and some are really, really good  (baked mussels with goat cheese...mmm.) The soups are fantastic. I haven't been overwhelmed by the mains and usually end up ordering an appetizer or two instead. Some of these are too clever by half - duck confit corn dogs?  It does get really busy and loud here, and I like it much better at off-hours. Reservations help, especially on Thursday/Friday evening."}
{"text":"- Great atmosphere, awesome drink selection - Not pleased with the cost of pop and charging for refills - I was VERY disappointed with the food: my bison burger was delicious, but it was 14$ and TINY! And it came with no sides, when I ordered a side salad, it was 8$ for about 5 bites.  - Would not return except to have drinks"}
{"text":"DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!  This is one of the best bistros ever.  My husband found it (again, thanks, fellow Yelpers!).  I was suffering from hypothermia and hunger when we entered the establishment, so they could have served me a bologna sandwich and a PBR and I wouldn't have complained (that's a lie, I totally would have, but I am prone to hyperbole).    To begin, the beer selection is worldly and totally fits every single taste.  Our bartender was super knowledgeable, we loved spending the afternoon with him.  Yes, afternoon, stop judging, it was effing cold, there was basketball on TV, we made our imprints on the bar stools and stimulated the local economy.  I had the Mort Subite cherry lambic, divinely sour-sweet brew, as well as a few others, some Belgium, some Canada beers.    And I've saved the best for last - the food.  We both had the hog-wild pizza.  I've eaten my fair share of pizza, even considering I hate cheese and have to look like a weird-o each time I order with no cheese, but this one, hands-down was the best pizza I've ever had, and my cheese-loving, pizza connoisseur life partner wholeheartedly agreed.  The crust was cooked perfectly, great flavor, crisp outer texture, chewy inside.  And the toppings - WOW, perfect ratio, three different types of pig, all distinctly different but harmonious, filled up every square inch, and the BBQ sauce was the right portion, and the right balance of sweet-salty-acidic.  I was so sad when my food was over.  I will dream about that pizza for years to come.  I also decided to have a mid-afternoon snack of the Belgian Frites - cooked in beef and duck fat - oooh yes, real fries, cooked in animal fat, the way nature intended, and homemade mayo and ketchup."}
{"text":"In the U.S. craft beers have taken off in a major way within the last 10 years. What was once a poor showing in terms of the beer now leads the world in terms of innovation. Canada unfortunately fallen behind, blinded by the fact that Alexander Keith is better than Miller, Canadians beers for years stagnated due to the unwillingness to see reality.  However, as times have past American craft beers have trickled across the border. Innovators within Canada have also sprouted up and bright minds such as Mike Duggan have sprouted up. Ontario brews are now within a Canadian Renaissance, and along with this fact more people have been attracted to establishments which serve a more eclectic selection of beer.  This is one such establishment. The bottled beer list here is excellent. The selection can be pricey, however, it is nonetheless impressive for a Canadian establishment.  The staff is decently knowledgeable about beer and willing to help out. The food is good, and has decent options. I would definitely go back to this place if I was in the area and wanted a drink."}
{"text":"One of the best beer selections in Toronto!!!   When I am in the mood for some high quality craft beer this place is at or near the top of my list. Their beer selection is truly tough to beat. They have quite of few beers on tap, the sheer number of taps isn't all that impressive but the quality of the beers sure is. If nothing on tap tickles your fancy, you are bound to find something in their selection of bottled beers that will. Their selection of bottled beers reads like a book.   If you are not a beer nerd/snob like me, fear not! Their staff is extremely knowledgeable and will be more than happy to make a recommendation based on your beer preference. If you have a hard time deciding you can opt to have 3 small samples of any of their taps for only $6! Their beer prices are not outrageous, a pint can be had for around $6 rather easily, however be careful if you venture into the bottles as those can get quite pricey depending on the beer.   The beer isn't the only star of the show, their food is quite good also. This place has THE BEST fries in the city. Their fries are cooked in duck fat and beef tallow which makes them very crunchy and quite decadent, they are served with a house made mayonnaise which is also irresistible. Other house specialties include streamed muscle bowls (very good), and flat bread pizza made with oatmeal stout dough. The great thing about a lot of their food is that they also find ways to incorporate beer into a lot of their menu items. Overall good food at a reasonable price.  If you are interested in a beer recommendation they usually have La Maudite and St. Ambrois oatmeal stout on tap, you can't go wrong with either of those. Be careful to pay attention to the alcohol percentage on your beers, many of their beers are pretty high in alcohol and I am usually stumbling after 3-4 pints (Belgian beers are the best but they are usually at least 8%), who cares though, it's right beside king station so it can be gotten to easily via TTC."}
{"text":"I was lured into Beer Bistro by the promise of great fries.  My partner is a Fry Monster (think a cuter, less blue, more-human-y Cookie Monster).  It did not disappoint.  Seriously, I'm sure the rest of the food we had there was great, but all I can remember are the fries.  The first time we went, there was a miscommunication between the waitstaff and the kitchen and our fry order got missed, but they handled it beautifully, getting the giant cone out to us in record time and then comping them for the inconvenience.  They are sooooo good.  The fries (technically Belgian Frites on the menu) by themselves are incredible, but with the homemade mayo and ketchup are to-die-for.  I think a lot of people attribute the incredible flavour to the duck fat, but it's not the whole story (other places with \"duck fat fries\" come close but don't match the unctiousness of these beauties), it's that they blanch them using BOTH duck fat AND beef fat - a double punch of savoury richness.  This is now what I do at home with our potatoes, and it really is an unbeatable flavour profile.  Come here, order whatever you like (there's big emphasis on beer selection and proper pairing).  Just don't let anything get in the way of your Fry Experience."}
{"text":"\"Once inside, we were faced with a big open space with a bar overloaded by three large TVs. The hostess politely took our coats adding to the overall posh atmosphere we already started to experience.\" \"We had their duck confit pizza with the recommended robust Maudite beer.\" \"Beer Bistro is meant to be enjoyed with a larger crowd, in our opinion, not too much of a tête-a-tête spot. It is also a definite must for beer enthusiasts in search of a new beer to taste.\" Just a few bites from our full review.."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great. Steak was very tough. Their burger is also mediocre. How can you mess up a burger? The patty was tasteless and tough, the bread was stale. Belgian frites was the only thing I enjoyed.   Also, we waited a while for the food. This would've been fine if we got our appetizer. Instead, they delivered it all at the same time. If I'd known I would've skipped the app."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic. The wait staff is top-notch and hands down the best service I've experienced at a restaurant recently. I had the New England styles muscles paired with the Delirium Tremens which was fantastic.   If you come here experience the beer flights and order from the extensive beer list for your main dish.   The Belgians frites are unbeatable with they are fried in duck fat and served with a wonderful homemade ketchup and mayonnaise.   If you can get to Toronto experience this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner (9:30 on a Monday evening). The place was busy, a good atmosphere. The beer selection is great and I enjoyed the Diablo Mussels with some hearty, fall beers. Very nice.   While the atmosphere is good, backed up with some great beers, the decor has run some miles and needs a little attention to keep this place among the top spots."}
{"text":"Best mussels in town? I think not. Perhaps it was an off day, but the mussels I ordered were the size of my fingernails. My boyfriend looked up the restaurant online before he took me there, building up the hype that blogTO had rated this place 2nd for best mussels in Toronto. Oh, was I disappointed. I asked the server if the Brussels Mussels bowl would be the spiciest out of the selection. With her confirmation I ordered it only to be disappointed at the size of the mussels and lack of spiciness to the broth. The salmon tare tare was delicious, expensive and tiny. The Kobe beef tacos were essentially fajita beef chili with beans in taco shells and tasted like something you'd get off the back of a lunch truck. I don't drink beer so I can't say much about that, although the list looks impressive. I tried the cider they have on tap and thought it was strange, had a musky tinny twang to it, and unlike any cider I've ever had, may have been just the way it is and  probably conflicted with my own preference anyhow. The patio was nice enough I suppose, the metal chairs were slightly uncomfortable. The atmosphere inside seemed a lot better. I hope it was just an off day for Beerbistro. Sorry, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good service, great suited up lunch crowd. The fries are amazing as well as the bistro salad with truffle vinaigrette. My only complaint was my steak was medium rare but too chewy, sadly."}
{"text":"I came to Beer Bistro with some high hopes after reading their beer list online and seeing their menu. Tons of bottles and drafts to choose from. Hey, they even have Brooklyn! Can't find that at Esplanade Bier Markt. And I went during mussels month with all types of moules frites specials. Well, nothing wrong with the beer. In fact, they even offer samplers so you can try more and more types and varieties. But the food was the problem. The frites were decent but the moules were super-chewy with not much taste. I sent them back and to their credit, the head chef came out to apologize. However, he tried to defend his dish saying noone else had sent it back. Well, I'm a Yelper so I'm not everyone else, am I? Had a dinner salad instead which was only fair. I think if I come back here again, I'll just come for the beers but food? I'll stick to Esplanade."}
{"text":"I LOVE the French fries, the great beer selection and in the warmer months the little patio. Always enjoy this place."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! These guys REALLY know their beers, and they have an incredibly eclectic collection that will satisfy any beer fan's tastes. The food, especially the ribs, is excellent (I've had ribs in the deep south of the U.S., and these are just as good, if not a bit better because of the unique sauce! They even make ice cream with beer (using a powerful stout with chocolate and caramel crunch to make a to-die-for dessert!). And friendly?! These folks make you feel right at home. Highly recommend it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I dined alone at beerbistro and the host/manager made me feel welcome immediately. I sat at the chef's table and was able to watch the chefs prepare dishes for the other diners. They were conscientious and everything was plated to perfection.   I ordered the Flight of Beer, Steak Tartare, and the Belgian White Mussels. Everything was delicious!   The hand chopped, Steak Tartare was set with a raw egg yolk in the center, fresh horseradish, greens, crostini, giant capers, and a few cornichons.   The generous portion of Belgian White Mussels came with a side of sourdough bread to soak up the well-balanced, lightly garlic, and sweet flavor of the broth the perfectly cooked, mussels sat in. I paired that with one of the beer samples in my beer flight.   The waitress was very attentive, and the head chef, down-to-earth and friendly.   The service, food, and ambiance were amazing and I would happily dine here again!"}
{"text":"If Beer Bistro was in my city, I'd be there once a week. Alas, it is not so I'll just be happy I got the chance to eat there while visiting Toronto.  Excellent service.  Our waiter was patient, meticulous in his descriptions of both beer and food and happy to accomodate our weird ordering style.  We tried a huge amount of the apps and then split mussels and a pizza.  Everything was awesome.  Well prepared and delicious.  Only complaint? It's crazy dark inside."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite gastropubs in North America. Duck Fat fries are gluten free and they guarantee no fryer cross contamination. Gluten free buns (can't eat them anyway as they have egg) Paleo friendly  The burger is bad ass! Meat quality fantastic  They make their own condiments. Mustard.. ketchup and hot sauce. No high fructose corn syrup Service is fantastic!' Great wifi! Big TVs at the bar to watch footy! Chef's table in the kitchen if you want to watch your meal  This place is awesome for people with food allergies!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place! We sat outside on the patio area and enjoyed some beers and dinner before the Beyoncé concert. Prices were reasonable and the pizza we had was pretty good. It's a flatbread pizza that is perfect for sharing between two people. Overall the total for drinks and dinner for four was about $120. The inside atmosphere is a bit stuffy. I noticed that they have seating at a bar that looks in to the kitchen which I thought was cool. The location is great, it's easily walkable from many hotels in the area."}
{"text":"8 types of Eggs Benedict? Yes please! They make each fresh and apparently make the hollandaise to order as well. I actually believe them. Hand down the best Bennies I've had in recent memory.  They make their own celery salt and the caesar had fresh horseradish grated in. Well done!  Service in lounge is great, not so great in dining room.  Really enjoyed the Devil's Puttanesca Mussels! Not sure about the Kobe beef tacos. Could have been fresher/had more than meat on them.  The beer list is overwhelming. Its very hard to navigate if you don't often stray from the usual beer you know but I'm sure there are some gems in there if you are lucky enough to get a server with the patience to help you choose."}
{"text":"when in town, this has become one of our \" go to's\".. the staff are always very friendly ,no matter how crazy busy the place is at the time.  the selection is outstanding... for any not sure what to try.. they offer a 3 beer flight to taste.  the food is outstanding... in everyway.. from the apps,  which are large enough to share.. to the desserts  which leave you talking about them for days. the location is central to many hotels  and is also great for people watching.  we have yet to not leave there impressed."}
{"text":"Great mussels, pulled pork a bit too sweet and the BBQ sauce is no surprise, truffled ravioli is decent, Caesar salad is average.  Service team is good.  3.5 stars. Prices reasonable for Toronto."}
{"text":"Spacious place and a decent selection of beers. Friendly service. Went here on a Friday night and was not too busy. Laid-back and the music is low enough to have a conversation with someone else. Would return"}
{"text":"My friend Brett and were visiting Toronto and looking for a place to have a beer or two! We found Beer Bistro and Yelp and headed in for a beer. The beer selection was fantastic and the bar tender was very knowledgable. The othe patrons were extremly friendly and we had a great time. Next time I will be sure to head back for some Belgian food."}
{"text":"What a great find.  I love places like this,  casual and very chill.  The decor was neat,  the tables weren't all packed together,  nice bar and very friendly service.  We came late on a Saturday night and decided to split a pizza and salad.  We got the large sized salad and it was a good amount for 2 people.  The Hog Wild pizza was delish as well.  Very pleasant experience and will be one of my go to places next time I visit the wonderful city of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Belgian triple threat: Belgian white mussels, Belgian fries and Belgian Trappists' trippel beer: so good!!! I couldn't stop sopping up that garlicky broth with the not overly sour sourdough bread! Delicious and decadent."}
{"text":"Love bringing friends and family here.  It can get quite loud, so if you're looking for a quiet place- this isn't it. The menu is not bad. There are quite a few dishes here that you can't get anywhere else.  If you're going to come here though, just get the mussels. The mussels are full of flavor, and the beer blends in nicely when finally prepared.   I would recommend this place for a small group of 4 or 5, as they are already limited on space."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The $6 beer flight is a great deal and the bar manager (and everyone else we've encountered) really know their beer. If you want to try a bunch of different beers or have options, this place is for you. Don't fret, because they have yummy cocktails too and their food is delicious. We sat at the bar and encountered a bunch of regulars... Which says a lot about the atmosphere of a place. We popped here for my husband's birthday and they really made his day. Raymond is amazing and we loved talking about beer with him. I'm not a beer fan, but he poured one for me that was delicious."}
{"text":"Solid place for beers and some higher-end food.  Definitely a step-up from a regular bar.   They have an extensive beer list with tons of fabulous and interesting choices.  The menu has lots of interesting sounding dishes, but they didn't live up to our expectation.  We had the Fries, Hog Town Pizza and Smoked Trout Salad.  Fries were pretty standard, not quite crispy enough for my liking.  The Hog Town Pizza, we ordered the gluten-free version, had lots of toppings, but weren't super flavourful.  Given that it's all pork and BBQ sauce, we were hoping for a flavour party in our mouth, but ended-up with a fairly bland pizza.  The Smoked Trout Salad was good, but the dressing could have had more flavour as could the fish.    I'd be game to come back to try other dishes.  One of our fellow dinners seemed to love the rabbit pasta.  I just hope the food is more flavourful the second time around!"}
{"text":"Good Beer selection, limited food options, good frites.  The restaurant has high ceilings, a bar area in the front with general seating further in, and also kitchen side kitchen seating even further in.  Outdoor seating is on the side.  The beer menu is extensive, and varies in prices.  I stuck with the beer flight for 6 dollars, all were decent.  The food however didnt stack up with the beer.  We both had the mussels.  I had the spicy red thai mussels which was pretty good, we shared the beef and duck fat fries which was a good idea because the fries are pretty massive.  Skipped dessert, too much frites.  Even though the average review, I would say a good place to just grab a pint.  They also serve smaller sizes of all their draft beers (tasting sizes as well as 300mL size) and of course full pints."}
{"text":"Beer Bistro has one of the best beer lists in the city.  It and Volo are neck and neck.  The chef at Beer Bistro cooks with their beer and the staff are trained to pair beer with your meal.  The menu also suggests pairings and types of beer.  It's really a great place for food and drink.   If you like ribs, the Applewood smoked back ribs are really good when they are on the menu.  The one problem is that the dining area can get loud.  On special occasions when there is band playing it can be very difficult to talk other than to those sitting next to you."}
{"text":"Great Food, great atmosphere, great beers. A place to spend a lovely evening with people who love good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan! The atmosphere here is great and the food is delicious and presented beautifully!   I am not the biggest beer fan, so I can't comment on that.... but really great place (especially on the weekend)"}
{"text":"TLDR; Mediocre meal, strange ambience, great service.   I don't get the appeal with BeerBistro at all. I've been a few times now thinking I'm missing something and it must be good. After several mediocre meals I've realize -- it's not me, it's you BeerBistro.  I might have ordered wrong, but I had high hopes for the Niçoise salad. When it arrived, it was a massive piece of inedible smoked fish, some unseasoned vegetables, lettuce and a mediocre dressing. I don't often return a dish, but the waitress noticed my dislike. She was very gracious and offered me a different salad as an alternative and removed it from my bill.   The group I was with enjoyed their meals more than mine. But no dish stood out.   This place is acceptable, but I most likely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"A great bar/restaurant specializing in all types of imported beer. Their draught and bottle list is quite extensive with lots of hard to find beer. If you can't decide on a specific beer or feel like being experimental, they also have sample sizes ($6 for 3 samples).  As a group we tasted 7 different beers...everything ranging from a super smoky German beer (with a campfire like aroma!), wheat beers, various ales and everything was super tasty. Sadly we didn't try any of the food, though it looks wonderful and everything comes with a beer suggestion.  We came here around 9pm and it was very clear this is definitely an after work style hangout. Most people here are dressed in suits and trying to relax...no dress code is enforced, but you'll look out of place going completely casual.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Out the door at at $101 for the two of us, with only one drink each, it wasn't exactly a bargain.  But, we really enjoyed our casual dinner on the patio here:     My wife started with a salad, while I started with the cauliflower soup.   Wow, the soup was just bursting with flavor:  don't hesitate, just order it; you'll be glad you did.  My main was the whitefish, which was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.   My wife had the mussels which she really enjoyed; we liked the \"gate\" that they put in the mussel dish so that one could soak up the broth into the bread quite easily.  Nice atmosphere out on the patio and good servers."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this out for a while.   Loved the decor, would want to visit in the summer time for the patio too. Huge menu of beer, love it.   Order the fries and share it. They really give a lot. We also got brussels mussels and some meat pizza.  Yum, will come back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, awesome beer selection and beautiful decor. Beerbistro is one of those places hidden just off of Yonge that makes you happy to be alive. Carefully selected New Canadian food, fabulous french fries - fried in duck fat of course with the consummate mayo/aoili dipping sauce - and yummy mains including an outstanding burger (add the Berkshire beer bacon!). We went here for a Christmas Eve lunch a couple years ago and found it to be the ultimate beautiful escape before we dived into an intense few days of family togetherness. Since then, we've been back for appetizers and drinks. The mussel bowls are tasty; we've tried the Blue Blonde and Spicy Red Thai. Slurp slurp. A winner!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The food was very good, the beer selection is great, the setting is comfortable.   The staff seems Canadian friendly.  The bar tenders were a bit slow, but they were busy, so..you know.  I had the potato and truffle perogis, the cheese fondue, and the tacos.  All were ample in portion and the flavors were great.  I strongly recommend BeerBistro if you make it to Toronto.  Ask questions about the food and the beer. The staff will happily answer."}
{"text":"Hopped in here as the first stop of some delicious beer spots in Toronto over the weekend.   Took awhile for anyone to greet us, eventually the bartender came over and offered us a seat.  Opted for the patio but then realizing how muggy and cloudy it was we changed back to inside without much issue.  Beer menu was extensive with a great $6 for a flight of 3. I tried the Rodenbach, Hacker and a sour. All 3 were pretty good, especially liked the sour.   Ordered a beer off their rarities section but unfortunately that one was sold out... bummer but went with a second choice and as he was pouring it he says this one is available at LCBO you know... then why did I just pay $17 for a bottle???  All in all the beer was still pleasantly good. The burger my partner ordered was more disappointing... sloppy and not great at all. It was falling apart from all the liquid and by the end of his lunch his plate had a small lake on it...   Will come back for their beer options but wonder how many are available at LCBO lol    Staff was friendly, restaurant was nice and comfy."}
{"text":"Nestled in the heart of the financial district this place may look ostentatious from the outside but it is anything but once you pass through the revolving door.  The bartenders were by far the best ones that I've ever had. They were friendly and talkative and knew what the best things on the menu were to recommend. Great beer choices from all around the world and the bartender may even surprise you with a great cocktail concoction that's not on the menu.  The location is primo for hopping to after work, a little inconvenient to drive and park to but well worth it. There is one TV and that's good enough. You don't go to watch the game, it's just something that's on in the background. Good seating and an overall great ambiance. Great place for a first date.  You may run into a financial try-hard but it's almost worth it to see them try to cross over into the non-friend zone with the date he's with.  The clientele may all be from Bay Street but showing up in jeans, t-shirt and some runners is not frowned upon which is top notch in my books. Looking forward to the next time I go back."}
{"text":"Really good mussels and tasty beers. Their cakes are so delicious and very chocolate-y."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Open view of the kitchen in the back. Belgian fries and brussel mussels were excellent!! Great selection of brews as well!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was interesting; I had a Quebec Maudite.  Of course Bier Market is nearby but I was looking for a better bite to go along with and house made gourmet dog was exactly what I was dreaming about.  Coming from someone who goes on \"hot dog crawls\" frequently in Chicago (where there is also a Beer Bistro-- no relation) it was one of the best dogs I've ever consumed.  The flesh of the dog was smooth, like a more firm pate.  The casing could have used a touch more snap but I'm in no position to complain about this fantastic creature.  In typical fashion, I requested their wonderful bacon to wrap my dog in a blanket of redundantly wonderful pork product.  Good atmosphere, mix of upscale and laid back, a helpful and very friendly manager and server!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time tonight and the staff was wonderful, the food was delicious, there was a huge selection of great Abby beers, and the patio and main room are beautiful. The price was great too! Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"I have to say there are a few times in life I compare food to sex...but this would be it. Lord have mercy duck confit croquettes make me want to do bad bad things. Even the chili sauce was heavenly with a hint of orange mixed into its sweet spicy tang. The mussel diablo started off slow with what looked like very little broth, but oh mama that chorizo was amazing... little bites of flavor packed into unassuming red sauce... and then as u went down layers the creme fresh mixed with the tomato spicy broth to create a rich bread dipping oasis. The homemade sourdough was fabulous... though a little Spartan considering it left beautiful sauce in my bowl I had no way of eating. My husband got the onion and ale soup...aka french onion soup. Great soup not too salty as many of its cousins fall pray too. Let me take a brake pre main course to speak on their beer. Great selection. 20 beers on tap 100 million in bottle. I loved them. You could tell they kept there lines clean. On to the main course. Mine was good... I could have used a stronger citrus over tone to break up the heavy squash cream sage pasta situation...even a brown butter nuttyness would have added some depth but over all good. My husbands coq au biere was yummy...except the dumplings... they were a smidgen raw still. Truthfully though the fabulous beer and starters were so over the top fabulous you could have served me KFC and I would have left happy. ..... and then there was dessert. Love the ice creams ...the sticky pudding...the cheese cake ...roll me home"}
{"text":"I love the food and beer here. Last time I had a Hog Wild pizza and this time Steak Frites. This is my go to place when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"The beer selection is obviously very good. The food quality is nice, and really complements the beers, I guess everything really is centered around beers. Service is very friendly.   The draw back is that, it's not that big, and the bar area is usually packed. They do take reservation over Opentable though.    Oh, order the duck fat fries, you are welcome."}
{"text":"Thanks to beerbistro, where I learned to drink and love beer, I've spent hundreds(maybe thousands) of dollars on fancy beers in the past couple of years.  I was here a while ago, when there was a nice pappardelle dish with rabbit and mushroom on the menu. Since I wanted to try a couple of beers, the waiter suggested a nice trio to go with my meal, my favorite being the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout.  Their homemade beer scream is fantastic - nothing like the ridiculous \"homemade\" ice creams we used to make in middle/high school. Here, the consistency is smooth, it's flavorful without being too bitter.  Food - delish with generous portions! Beers - wonderful selection. This will definitely be one of the stops the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Been coming here every so often with coworkers over the last 15 years.  Always enjoy the food...the Belgian frites are amazingly good as is the Belgian mussel bowl.  Why post a review now?   I was there June 13th for lunch and we seemed to have been forgotten by the wait staff.  We were seated at the lounge area by the bar.   The bartender noticed and right away jumped in. He checked on us a couple times, topped off our water and for the first time, we were asked if we'd like some extra bread to sop up the mussel broth.   Didn't get your name, but whoever you are, bartender guy, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here this evening for his birthday - it was awesome!  When we first arrived, we were treated to a complimentary frites (well played Beer Bistro) which were AMAZING! Fried in duck fat and served with house made mayo and ketchup, how could you go wrong? They tasted awesome!!  Skip the spicy kobe beef tacos (only let down of the evening, just was like something I could have made at home). Not bad but not cray amazing!  The house salad with goat cheese was delish, super flavourful and tasty! My BF had the burger (which I tasted) - YUM!   Throughout the evening we sampled many awesome beers, all with the suggestions of our super knowledgeable server, Andrea.   Our dessert was the flourless chocolate cake a la mode, with dragon stout skor ice cream - this was TO DIE FOR. I also tried the Black Forest beer cocktail which was a mocha stout topped with a shot of Chambord - OMG, best drink ever!  All in all, this was a memorable evening and I would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Yay...my first Canadian review...and it is one of my favorite spots to hit, when in Toronto!  Beer Bistro has one of the greatest menus of beer on the planet! From hundreds of countries...beer beer and more beer!  The decor is elegant, yet not stuffy, and the bartender was so cool. My wife and I sat at the bar, he was well schooled on all the different drinks. My wife mentions to him that she was born in Poland, and his next sentence is in Polish. We were cracking up. The guy studied it in school, and was pretty damn good. Although my wife and him said a few words in Polish, while I sat there confused and intoxicated.  Note: Next time I go, leave the wife at home.  But definitely go...its located right in the center of the city and close by the King Edward Hotel."}
{"text":"If you love beer, this place is solid with a sampler for you to try several and knowledgeable wait staff. Food is okay. The beer fries were adequate and the beer-inspired food is worth a taste. The atmosphere is nice, mostly groups hanging out having fun."}
{"text":"Beerbistro has a great selection of beers (both on tap and bottled) which is what makes it stand out from the crowd. It's not just a pub or a bar because the waiters are very knowledgeable about beer, its different flavors, aromas, characteristics, etc. They can also pair your food with a beer or vice versa. I was here in early September and took a patio table which was extremely nice. The patio is not facing King Street but instead located in between two buildings in something sort of like a small square. So you don't get any street noise when you are on the patio. The food was pretty good but not extremely amazing. We had 2 of their pizzas which were delicious even if a bit small for the price. The lamb stuffed jalapeño peppers were awful, I would recommend to saty away from them."}
{"text":"Through the first couple of days in my Toronto trip, the movie Strange Brew was beginning to look a little too much like a documentary. Every brewer in Canada seemed akin to Max von Sydow, tainting his beer in an attempt to rule mankind while turning out an inferior product. Turns out, I'd just been going to the wrong places. Beerbistro has what every self proclaimed beer snob wants. Lots of good beers on tap. I started with a Muskoka Mad Tom IPA, which single-handedly made up for every bad beer I'd sipped the first couple of days in the country. From there, I asked the bartender for his advice on the second between the La Maudite and the Junction Conductor's Ale. He made a clear argument in describing both of them, so I ordered both of them. We could have played this game all night, as there were several beers I didn't get around to trying.  Beerbistro is the kind of place Bob and Doug McKenzie would be proud to call Canadian. Well, Bob and Doug MacKenzie post capitalizing on the back bacon and toque bubble and making millions. It isn't cheap and the food is a little bit of an afterthought. But the people here know their beer. And you've got to respect people who know good beer."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my office today and was pretty unimpressed. I had the Bistro Beer Burger. For the price, it was quite underwhelming. The bun was quite delicious, but the burger itself was rather boring.  I might be willing to give it another shot, but my colleagues meals looked rather underwhelming as well. Probably wouldn't bother unless dragged along."}
{"text":"Top notch!!  Extensive and impressive beer list. Felt like I was back on Belgium or Germany!    Food was yummy too. I had the BBQ sandwich and Belgian frites.  The sauce on the BBQ sandwich was great, and the sandwich had fries in it.  At first I thought it was just one and a mistake or my doing, but found several more and loved it!  Boyfriend had one of the flat bread pizzas and said it was good.  Very friendly service.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"On the first night of our 2 year wedding anniversary get away, my wife and I strolled around Toronto looking for a late night dinner when we stumbled upon the BeerBistro. We ordered a plain cheese pizza to split. It was delicious and perfect portions for two people. The sauce and the crust were amazing.   For dessert we got the flourless chocolate stout cake and cookies n' cream ice cream. The cake was off the charts good and so was the ice cream. They went together so beautifully.   Our waitress was very kind and put up with all my weird questions about the nightlife and Toronto as well as answering my questions about the beers and ciders.   We would definitely return to BeerBistro!"}
{"text":"Went there with my daughter before the Jann Arden concert.  Our apps were great - the frites and baked mussels - as were the mains...I had the duck breast and my daughter had the rabbit pasta, both were fantastic.  The service was also really good, the only disappointment was the dessert.  We ordered the \"sticky toffee\" donuts but it was really more like timbits with butterscotch sauce.  Still overall, the experience was great and we would definitely go back!  (and the concert was great too!)"}
{"text":"I hate it when I go to a place because of great reviews and come out disappointed. It makes me wonder how they get such good reviews! For one, It wasn't worth the wait. We went for lunch at around 1:30pm. It took the waiter 15 minutes to get service. Food is okay, but really nothing to rave about. I cook better at home. Waitress never came back and we had to get up to ask for the bill and still waited another 5 minutes for it. This place sucks."}
{"text":"David was a very friendly and intelligent bartender. Beer is great here! Food prices are a bit higher so expect that. Free Wi-Fi. You won't hear the TV and music might be a little loud if you are on a date. Overall great atmosphere for travelers and loners :)"}
{"text":"Chose this place for lunch a week ago. iIt was about 1:30 and the place was almost empty but we waited st least 10 minutes before anyone noticed us  I ordered a Cobb Salad. what arrived was wilted lettuce drowned in vinaigrette with 3 grape tomatoes cut in half, some kernels of canned corn?? and a few chunks of a supermarket excuse for blue cheese. When I said to the server \"doesn't a Cobb Salad usually have avocado,  bacon, eggs\" she went to the kitchen and a young woman came out and actually told me that avocados were out of season. Then she said this was their \"take on Cobb salad\"  when I said it was just a green salad she started to talk about the history of Cobb salad-in a condescending way like I needed to be enlightened. the place is a joke -- bad service worse food and appalling  \"management\" if thats what she was  Never again  1 star is too many!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with 7 other people.  Everyone was taken care of in a timely and orderly fashion, our waiter was very nice, the beer selection is phenomenal, and the food is incredibly good.  Had an amazing Caesar salad and a burger with all the fixings on it.  I would highly suggest the duck fat fries and the burger if you're coming here."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  Since I don't drink, I was initially worried this place might go over my head, but wow the food was delicious.  The grilled stuffed chicken breast with polenta was heavenly, and creme brulee was the perfect finish.  Even if you're not going for the beer, go here."}
{"text":"For some reason I always passed by this place but never ventured in until recently. Decided to give it a try before heading to a media event on a Friday night and luckily called ahead to make a reservation. It was a same day booking so I think I lucked out getting a table during peak time. Online it said fully booked for the time I wanted but I called and they had a open table. I would definitely recommend you make a reservation or else you might get stuck waiting around as some people had to. I saw big crowds near the door.   I went in and was promptly seated with a coat check (no fee). Dining with a friend and we shared the steak frites (a bit pricey but a filling portion). It was good, tendor, cooked exactly as requested, and uncut. We found the knives a bit dull though.   For drinks, I was a bit indecisive on what I should get so just told our server I wanted something light and sweet. They recommended the À Tout le Monde beer from Quebec under their Spicy section. Quite happy with their recommendation, it was refreshing, light, sweet, and reasonably priced. Great pick! I would definitely recommend this beer.   Overall good place, interior was nice and felt geared to the after work crowd. Lively at night. Good for coworkers, friends and dates. I would come back."}
{"text":"There were four of us. We had two very good salads, and two seafood dishes that were also very good. The beer selection is terrific."}
{"text":"Heck yes!  So many great beers on tap!  My hubby and I each got a sampler to start and tried 6 different Belgian style beers.  They were all incredible!  Blanche De Chamble on tap= yes please!  So good! We got a little out of control with ordering food.....opps!  I just love melted cheese!  We tried the fondue, which was meant for 5 or more people.  We may have eaten most of it....with the fries!  It was really good as were the fries!   We didn't stop there!  My husband got the mussels.  (With bacon and leeks). He said they were excellent!  I got the white fish which was good too!  We rolled home after we finished our beers!"}
{"text":"Steak frites, fondue, and calamari on point. The beer selection is wonderful and the servers were helpful in finding pairings between food and bev. Great atmosphere!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for beer in the city.  Great selection on tap, with 100-200 bottles in the fridge.  In addition, the staff are super-friendly and knowledgeable about beer.  Food is quite good as well - I almost always go for the Bistro Salad and the Steak Frites, but I hear the mussels are fantastic as well.  Space is very slick, double-high ceilings gives the place a bit more air, and finally, the ambiance music is often very good as well.  Great spot."}
{"text":"The Beerbistro is a staple of my time in Toronto. It is mine and my wife's favorite place, and hasn't let us down after visiting multiple times.  They have a vast beer collection. My wife, who doesn't really like beer, wes able to get recommended a few beers she really liked. Mostly lambics and fruit beers, but stiil!   Additionally, they keep rotating what's on tap. For those who love beer, this is a great place to go.  Now the food. The food, every time we've had it, has been exceptional.  The duck fat fries are a must. Be sure to order them, they're worth it.  We've tried the muscles (they make great muscles), the bison burger, pork ribs, steak tar tar, strawberry salads, alcoholic teas (which were awesome may I add), homemade ice cream desserts, etc etc etc. We've done this in multiple sittings of course, but it was so worth it.  All the food comes in nice portions in my opinion. It isn't the cheapest place in the world, so don't go there if you only want to spend 15$, but if you're willing to spend over 30$, you can get a very satisfying meal.   The service has also been great every time we've been there, A+."}
{"text":"3 words: duck fat fries.  A few more words: the mussels were pretty good, great beer selection (obviously), the price was great for the area, but man, read those first three words and then try to resist going here."}
{"text":"Fantastic time!  Yelped a Gastropub walking distance from my hotel and this did not disappoint. Yummy beer list, try one of the six different mussels and you will not be disappointed!   Love it and will return."}
{"text":"In the financial district besides the good old Bier Markt in St Lawrence Market another great place for a selection of domestic and international beers is the Beer Bistro.  Just east of Yonge street on King, it can be easily missed however nonetheless the place is very spacious, high ceilings and an open concept.  This was our past stop downtown before hitting Johnnys hamburgers in Scarborough.  Our server was very pleasant, and quick in taking our orders. Though my buddy and I kept it light by not ordering beers we ended up ordering Vodka tonic with a dash of lime........kudos to the bartender who mixed it perfectly.....not because our drink was strong ;) .... lol it was mixed perfectly. The prices are quite reasonable for the area, and for those avid beer drinkers you've got a lot of choices :) :)  Unfortunately by the time we came here, the kitchen was closed which means I'll have to make a second trip."}
{"text":"Really love the concept of the establishment! We started with the country pate and smoked salmon with homemade Boursin,--both were a hit!! Next we shared the lamb ribs and heirloom tomato salad. The salad was divine,--every bite was heaven. Really loved the potato salad and asparagus that came with the ribs,--maybe I'm turning into a veggie. Ribs were good, not amazing. Loved the beer accompaniment suggestions that came with each selection. We finished with chocolate stout cake and it was a home run!! Love this place and it's open on Sunday!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had tickets to a concert in Toronto and were looking for a restaurant that was close to the hotel/theater that also had some gluten free options. We reviewed the menu and everything looked great. Reservations were openly available in the time slot I was looking for. We were right on time for our reservation and were immediately seated. The restaurant is pretty small and is mostly a bar area. The wine selection was ok and they had an incredible selection of beer. We had the Belgian Frite to start and they were incredible. My wife had the Bistro Burger and I had the Chicken Curry and they were both pretty tasty dishes.   The restaurant was MUCH louder than I expected it to be so if you are looking for a place to have a nice dinner conversation, this is not it. Even after dinner, we went to another bar for drinks as we couldn't hear each other very well."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend since we were in the mood for a trendy place to have a drink. I must say that my first impression was okay. I liked that they hang up your jacket and are prompt to greet you at the front. However, I wasn't as impressed by the ambiance, service or food. As a beer bistro,  I thought it would have more booths and be a bit nicer. The service at the table was slow, flustered,  and rushed. The lady serving us forgot our beer menu and had to be asked and she also took a very long time to bring me my second drink. The food was good but had a bit too much dressing for the quinoa salad and steak tartar. However, it has a wonderful selection of beer! I'd come here again only if I wanted to try a new beer I've never tried but not really to hang out. It's close to the subway too."}
{"text":"Had a Friday night meet up here and had a great overall experience.  Just east of Yonge on King, Beer Bistro is just a short walk for those living in the St. Lawrence Market or Queen's Quay neighborhoods.  The four of us had a 7:00 pm reservation on Friday and were seated right away.  We had attentive, friendly service.  I had a Mill St. Organic beer, which is pretty much the only kind of beer that I can stomach, and Abby had an apricot beer, which wasn't bad either.  We shared an order of the thai spiced mussels, which were delicious -- my favourite part was dipping the bread in the sauce and savoring the soaked bread as it dissolved in my mouth.  For my main, I happened to order my server's favorite dish, the Jamaican goat curry, which wasn't quite as spicy as I like (but let's be real, what is these days) but nonetheless hit the spot.  It did come with a generous helping of hot sauce that I was only too keen to spread all over the meal.  Abby couldn't finish her meal so I ended up eating half her rib-eye and then gorging on the peanut butter ice cream bar and the skor like ice cream dessert (dragon's something or other).  Everything was extremely enjoyable."}
{"text":"Even though I don't like beer, I usually go to pubs and gastro pubs because of the food (chips, stews, meat pies and the like), so when a friend invited me to go there I thought it would be nice to see how it's like. But I got disappointed.  I ordered a beef stew, which lacked seasoning (a little bit more of salt would just do, but it didn't seem to be seasoned at all) and the portion was quite small for the price they ask (something in the range of $23-25).  Belgium-style fries were nicely done in duck fat, but some of them were somewhat mushy (you wouldn't get mushy fries in Belgium for sure!).  I can't say about the beers because I don't drink but they seem to have a nice selection.  Service is good, the place is accessible by public transportation and the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because the creme brulee I had was actually quite good.  I don't know if I would return there, unless I'm again with some friends who enjoy nice beer."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner last night with great waitress service. There were some mishaps but all were taken care of except for the fries.They encourage you to post a pic  on instagram if you order the duck fries and they will be free. Unfortunately, We did that and showed the waitress but it was not taken off bill. We ended up paying for fries.  Drinks were great. Dessert was delicious. We are From NY and were visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Holy service! No sooner were we sat before we received our food and drinks. Unbelievably fresh beers and food... What can I say. This place doesn't pretend to be fine dining it is quality pub food, great downtown pricing and classy atmosphere that suits before, during, or after the game appetites."}
{"text":"Another dependable Toronto restaurant that you can trust if you just can't seem to figure out what to eat for dinner. Quality food and acceptable prices make this place one that I return to consistently. With quite a few beers on tap and even more in bottle form, what more could you ask for?  If you're not interested in eating here, bb is also a great place to just sit and enjoy a few drinks. Although it can get a bit loud close to the weekends, who wants to hang out and have drinks at the library?"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  After a night out for dinner my friends and I wanted a place where we could just chill with some drinks.  We were walking around and came across this place and since it wasn't busy on a Wednesday evening we decided to check it out.  It has that sports bar..but we aren't trying to be a sports bar kinda feel and it does pull it off.  Some tables and some booths lend to that feel along with the dark lighting and dark furniture.  Trying to be sexy but not really there yet.   We seated ourselves and a server came over right away with their drinks menu which is extensive.  They have a 12 days of Christmas beer special that they do annually so you can order from there or the regular menu.  The table next to us insisted we try one of the 12 beers of Christmas and were kind enough to buy us a bottle (can't remember the name but it was the red bottle).  It had a nice deep flavour -not my cup of tea but not bad either.    I ordered the strawberry beer (yes I like them fruity and I wanted something to drink that would match my kickass catsuit and sparkly boots).  The server said this was the fruitiest of them all and he was right!  It's a lovely pink (!!) colour and really did taste like strawberries.  Lovely.  At the end of the night we ordered the duck frites which were a great snack!  Crisp and rich in flavour they were a great end to a fun evening.   Service was always pleasant and made great suggestions along the way - definitely utilize their knowledge and try something new.   We were here on a Wednesday really late in the evening and it was still fairly busy so I can only imagine on a weekend.  Try on an off day if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"This place is what all pubs should be like. Friendly and attentive staff. Great finger food and entrées. Extensive beer selection.  Slightly expensive prices, however once in a while I don't mind paying a lextra for excellent quality   However, you are paying for the quality. The bill was very expensive, but I didn't care since it was comp'd by a client.  Definately a place to bring someone if you want to woo/impress/treat."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat in the heart of Toronto's Financial District.  Great beer selection and really delicious food.  We had appetizers for our main meal.  Perfectly prepared and the service was great.  We sat outside on the patio which was peaceful and a little less noisy than inside. We didn't have a reservation but were able to get a table during a busy lunch hour. Finally, the very best thing on the menu is the beer/stout ice cream.  Just incredible.   The Beerbistro is a little pricey, so it got four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks with the girls - or even for a date (there seemed to lots of dates happening).  The food was yummy - we tried the ribs, pizza, flatbread, and mussels (which apparently are the crowd favourite).  All were delish.  Served with a side of fruili!  We also tried other fruit beers (but we agree that the fruili was the best).  The desserts were also great - peanut butter cup and banana was yum - and the chocolate cake was good (must try with the recommended beer pairing to get the black forest cake flavour - the beer was heavy on its own).  Still a must visit - the patio was also quite nice!"}
{"text":"We easily made dinner reservations here through Open Table, surprisingly for a Friday night but for a much later time. It seemed to be very busy at the bar when we walked in but there were a few tables open for diners.   The beer menu is broken down into categories and each dish on the menu includes a suggested beer for pairing.   I ordered the Coq Au Biere which is described as \"maredsous braised chicken, woodland mushrooms, tarragon, crème fraîche dumpling.\" It was a hearty dish and the braised chicken was so tender. The dumplings and mushrooms paired well with the chicken, and the sauce was delicious. The menu suggested that I pair this dish with a \"sociable\" beer so I ordered the Saint Andre Vienna Lager. It was my kind of beer - easy to drink, and it didn't overpower my chicken dish.  I only wish I had room for dessert as I really wanted to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding.   The host was very friendly, and service was courteous, although a bit slow. It's pretty dim in the restaurant but I do recall seeing vines covering the walls."}
{"text":"It's true what they say about the Belgian frites, they are ah-mazing! I've had them a few times and each time I eat them I am reminder why I should go back for the frites. The best part of my visit this time was getting the frites for free. If you tweet #tweet4frites in the month of February they are free! Aside from the frites I got the mussels in the Belgian white sauce and that was very tasty. I am not a big beer drinker funny enough but the wide variety of beers will allow anyone to find something to drink. Overall a great place to have a few pints and good food with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly on a Thursday night. Wasn't terribly busy at all. Sat down and a nice beer. The bar tender was nice, but the environment was a little too slow for my brother and myself that evening, so we headed out. All and all it seemed decent."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is my go-to place for beers and fries ! I love ordering fries whenever I'm here to grab a drink, the portion is great to share!   They have so many beers to choose from so I'm never bored of visiting.   Dinner menu items are decent. I usually get the New England mussels to share.   The atmosphere is dark and cozy. Many seating are available. The back also has a view of the kitchen, which takes away from the cozy setting. But it's an interesting concept."}
{"text":"pretty good spot.  plus the location was ideal - right across the street from my hotel.  it gets 4 stars because of the wide selection of canadian micro-brews.  it also has an extensive mussel selection.  i ventured a bit out of my comfort zone with the bacon and brune.  it was ok, but everybody else around me with the more traditional mussels seemed to be enjoying themselves.  i would come again just for the beer selection."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer. My friend got the stuffed French toast (it was the first day on the menu), & it was delicious though super decadent. The white beer mimosa is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Spent some quality time at the bar with Greg the awesome bartender recommending several great Canadian craft beer choices. Also had a Bistro Salad which was very nice and light. Finished off with their homemade vanilla bourbon ice cream topped with a caramel sauce, by far the best ice cream I've ever had."}
{"text":"Really interesting menu and great service, plus all the beer (and beer back story) that anyone could EVER want. Excellent Kobe beef tacos, great mussels, duck fat fries...don't come here on a diet. Loved our waiter, who was both funny and cognizant of the fact that he was there to provide great service vs being the show part of a dinner-and-a-show. Lov-ed him. Better than cromulent (look for that secret word on the beer menu)."}
{"text":"Our party of seven decided to have brunch at BeerBistro, a Belgian restaurant with upbeat music. It reminds me of my favorite restaurant in the Washington DC area called Mussel Bar.  For brunch, they serve brunch cocktails, eggs benedicts, burgers, and mussels. The staff were friendly.  Our party ordered Brussel Mussels, Spicy Red Thai Mussels, Avocado Toast, Bistro Salad, Belgian White Mussels, and Blanche de Chambly and Beet Cured Smoked Salmon Benedict.   The Belgian White Mussels consisted of well shucked mussels steamed in a flavorful beer broth made of Blanche De Chambly, lemon, garlic, and heavy cream. The Mussels were a shareable portion. It was served with a loaf of freshly baked sourdough.   Blanche de Chambly and Beet Cured Smoked Salmon Benedict consisted of crispy potato croquettes topped with Blanche de Chambly and beet cured salmon, red onion, housemade boursin, poached eggs, smoked tomato hollandaise, and capers. It was served with a side salad consisting of heritage blend mixed greens lightly tossed in lemon vinaigrette. It was hands down the best smoked salmon benedict I've ever had."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night with a team of 13 at 7pm. I had two appetizers(escargot and octopus salad) right after oyster platters with beers. Everyone enjoyed their food and I enjoyed mine too.  Even though we didn't have a private room, the waiters allowed us to stay there for a quiet big and it was very fun and relaxing. Thanks for your service."}
{"text":"I'm looking forward to returning and trying the chorizo mussels.  The short rib pizza and wings were delicious. The service was very friendly and the decor set a nice evening-out mood. Wish I would have tried this place sooner... :) Already planning our corporate Christmas lunch/dinner here... :)  Oh... almost forgot to mention... the duck fat fries were so good i didn't want to spoil them with ketchup... :)"}
{"text":"So I was a bit skeptical about this place right up until our server came to take our order. But all of my negative expectations were quickly assuaged and I now have nothing but high praises for this hidden and understated gem. They have an incredible selection of beers (which is what brought me there in the first place) with staff that are very knowledgable and can point you in the right direction even with the vaguest description of \"what you're looking for tonight.\"  The food was also a pleasant surprise, my friend and I both had the pork pizza which was different in the best way possible and we opted for the duck fat fries which it seemed everyone gets. For good reason, they're delicious.  We opted for dessert after a second round of beers and I was, again, pleasantly surprised by both the house made \"stout\" ice cream and the cinnamon mini donuts. The waitress seemed to be unmoved by our surprise at the quality of the food as if she hears it on the regular and credited the in-house made everything.  Whatever the reason, both my friend and I left very full, not so sober, and very happy for under 50 bucks each. Not bad for the financial district at all."}
{"text":"Selection of beer is good. My friend found a hard to find beer here. Food is presented well and tastes good. The three of us shared mussels, beef tartar, and duck fat fries. It's tapas style and has an upscale vibe to it with matching prices. It's nice. I'd come back. :)"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrendous. Everyone who works here thinks they own the place and have some pompous attitude. It's kinda entertaining. Beer selection isn't the best either, and they have dozens."}
{"text":"Good: The frites are free in Feb if you tweet about them. Remember not to fill up on them! The quantities are huge.   Buffalo wings are very fresh, I like the smokey taste but a bit too much skin/fat than the usual wings you'd get. Still yummy though  Great selection of beer as the name suggests. Try something new!  Pizzas are really unique, as well as the Farro salad  Good for families and groups. Also if you like sports there's a bar and tvs here.  Bad: The famous frites are still good but I think the quality has gone down over the years. Some are overcooked and burnt so not really edible  Veal and steak were mediocre, kind of bland"}
{"text":"Great place to have an awesome selection of beer and some snacks while drinking.   To start my Hubbie had the BrewDog Elvis Juice and he thought this beer had too much is a grapefruit taste for his liking. It was overpowering but he doesn't like fruity beers.   For food of course we had the Belgium Frites and they didn't disappoint! Tip: the size of the order is huge! It was a bit much for two to share with out entries as well. My Hubbie had the mussels New England style and he really liked them. I had the hog wild pizza and it was very good! Highly recommend. I love garlic and they must have had a whole head of roasted garlic!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Good place. Got a spot at front, nice service. Food is quite good. Not very loud, perfect for some reunion chatting(that's what I did)"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I go to beerbistro. It takes everything to not order mussels every time I go, cause they're so great. It's got a great, versatile vibe for a casual-to-nicer catch up night or lunch with friends, post-work beers/drinks, or a first date. When in doubt, I go to beerbistro. Love this place. Any place that stocks Dieu du Ciel stouts/porters is solid with me. ;)"}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch and sat outside in the patio area.  It was perfect for that sunny morning.    Food: They start you off with a bread basket full of baked goods that are freshly baked.  I tried the banana nut muffin and it was incredibly delicious.  For my entree, I had a russet potato scallion latkas topped with smoked salon, asparagus, and two poached eggs.  Once again, it was delicious. No complaints. Eggs were cooked just right, smoked salmon seemed fresh, and the latkas added the right amount of flavor to it.   Service: Waitress was friendly and attentive to our needs.   Ambiance:  It was a sunny morning with a slight breeze.  Perfect for sitting outside on a Sunday morning for brunch. Very clean and casual.   Unfortunately, I was not able to try any beer there.  Although, the list looked quite extensive.  I'm hoping to try it when I come back for another visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I've walked by this place a billion times. I don't much like the corner. There's a Tim Hortons and a travel agency. Not a hive of great dining. My GF decided to surprise me with a little dinner and took me here. It's not a big venue. Half is given to the bar, which gets filled up quick with an after work crowd. The attraction is the large numbers of beers they have on tap and in bottle. There's a nice 3 for 1 sampler deal for $6. We had that. My GF and I got hooked on proper US style IPA craft beers and Beerbistro has a few. Not much in the dark beer spectrum, disappointing.  I had the bison burger and onion rings. The burger was one of the tastiest I've ever had, along with the onion rings. The have to ding them a star because the price does not reflect the quantity. You only get 6 onion rings and the burger, despite being so damn tasty, isn't particularly large either.  If they gave a bigger portion size, this place would be my new go to place."}
{"text":"I've made two recent trips to Toronto and besides the hotel, this is the only place I visited both times. The location is really well placed just up the street from the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Sony Center. Going a little later in the evening we were able to get either seats at the bar or in the lounge area each time. The ambiance is upscale and modern, with a semi-divided bar and restaurant area. The lighting is dark and the decor a bit retro. They also have an open kitchen which I love. Not only is there nothing to hide, but it's like being invited in to their home. A small touch I always appreciate.   The food was absolutely amazing, having tried the Duck Confit Pizza with goat cheese (I'm a complete sucker for goat cheese) and Mushroom Pierogi. Both were excellent and had to be finished despite being completely full."}
{"text":"I really liked Beer Bistro.  I've only been here once (so far), but the food was good (I had the Wild Crab Tempura Maki and the Spicy Thai Mussels) and the staff was friendly.  The best part is they are open later than most restaurants in the area (limited food menu until midnight), and they offer free Wi-Fi!  It was a great place to come while staying at the Meridien across the street to relax to some food and beer.  They also have a nice outdoor patio with sun umbrellas (though I learned today that these are not waterproof umbrellas)."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is great for trying out beers that you've never had, and pairing it with the ultimate comfort foods.   Me and my partner both got the $6 flight of beers. Definitely would recommend this, as you have a chance to try 3 different beers from their extensive beer list. Only problem was that they were out of quite a few of the beers we wanted to try.  We ordered the Belgian Frites, which came in a giant cone, and they were some of the best fries that I've ever had. We also ordered the Belgian White and New England style mussels. Both styles of mussels were very different, but both quite good. They also came with a side of delicious sourdough bread to dip into the broth.   The only issue we ran into was the service, but that was quickly fixed. Our server basically ignored us for the entire meal. However, I was extremely impressed by how all the other servers and the manager made up for it. Whenever it seemed like we needed something, someone would come by. When our food was taking long, the manager came by and explained that there was a large party at the restaurant, and apologized for the delay. We were very well taken care of despite the fact that our server was missing for most of the meal. In the end, we found that they gave us our Belgian Frites on the house, despite the fact that we didn't complain about our server at all. I'm extremely impressed by the team at Beerbistro."}
{"text":"They serve the best Bison Burger I've ever eaten. Our friends enjoyed their meals as well. The staff was great, even though it was busy, they took time with us & the menu. Beer selection is a mile long; fantastic. A bit noisy, and the prices are ~ high, but recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to Beer Bistro several times now. It's probably my favourite place in the area. As the name implies, they have a great selection of beers. They also have a great selection of food. The mains on the menu change slightly each time i've been, and are usually quite good. I think the things to try here if you go are the fries -- definitely! -- and the mussels. During the summer the patio is open, and usually quite busy. It's also almost impossible finding a spot here to drink right after work. Damn those bankers."}
{"text":"Not usually an area I frequent but I was whisked here in a cab the night before my birthday by some bartender friends. I was impressed by how huge the place is vertically -- the ceilings must be 50 feet high.  We had some sort of hard-shell taco each and I have to admit they were damn tasty. It was in a purple corn shell and just the right amount of spice. It melted in my mouth, though I was pretty drunk at the time so I think almost anything would have tasted amazing at the point.  Speaking of amazing: my friend ordered some sort of chocolate and/or coffee stout in a bottle that cost 30 dollars! Was it worth the price? I don't think any beer should be 30 dollars, but this beer was pretty out-of-this-world. I guess if I was rich I would order a few, though it's so sweet you might not be able to handle it.  Would like to come back to this place and try more outrageously priced beers. Oh, and the staff were really nice to us. And there were no jackasses in sight -- though it was also a Wednesday."}
{"text":"If you love specialty beer and have a pocketbook that can afford them, you will want to visit Beer Bistro.  It has an amazing selection of difficult to find brews that you will not find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food was okay..  beer selection obviously above average, but prices were certainly reflect that.  Clean interior, service was fine   Expensive"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decor.  It was definitely a place for the working crowd.  A tab on the expensive side.  The food was tasty.  I ordered the lobster quesadilla which was delicious.  I'm not a big guac fan, but the quac they had on the side was great.  My friends got the pulled pork pizza and the stuffed chicken and they both really enjoyed their meals.  The menu was nice but I wish it was more extensive.  That goes for the wine selection as well.  I know it's the BEER bistro, but I feel there should have been more than 3 white wine selections for those who aren't a huge fan of beer.    All in all, I had a tasty time and would go back."}
{"text":"Beer, Beer and more Beer!! Lets start off with the service was GREAT! We started with the fondue, WOW...sooo good! My boyfriend was sad when there wasn't a spoon to finish the cheese when we ran out of bread...but our server promptly offered to bring more! It was enough for dinner, i was practically stuffed afterwards! For dinner I ordered the mussels (recommend by the server) and my boyfriend had the steak and fries. Mussels were outstanding, i loved the bread that came with it to soak up the beer broth...i wish i could picked up the bucket and drank the broth straight! My boyfriend loved his steak. Finished with the Stout and Skor bar ice cream... Mmmmm enough said! Great beer selection as well! Cant wait to go back to Toronto so we can eat here again!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine for myself and my client. My co-worker had a beer. We also ordered the fries. Everything was great. Had a really nice crowd right after work. Couldn't ask for more ..."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience when I come here. Great staff, wonderful food, and lovely ambiance. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Duck fries was good, the portion was big. I tried the duck pizza based on the past reviews and it didn't disappoint me. They have a huge selections of beers, also aged beers. Planning to go back to try out different beer every time."}
{"text":"I been here couple of times. It's a good bar they have great selection of beer. And they got my favorite beer which is kystele. This is one of the best bet I tried is Belgium and rare and they have it. Also they have many others and rare foods that you will crave. It's some how pricy as we ordered a pizza which was 18 buck and it was like half pizza so ya. The place is nice with multiple TV screens with clean washrooms. Over Alli like the place for the net other wise for food it is good but pricy."}
{"text":"Delicious mussels and sourdough bread... We also tried the fondue and the Belgian Frites which were also pretty good. Beer flights were awesome and cheap. Cool atmosphere and decent service on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Brilliant. A massive selection of beers, in a really beautiful setting, with incredible food and frites. Really, I can't see where you could go wrong here. Fitting for such an establishment, moules & frites are available, as are some awesome pizzas. Great spot for lunch, good food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"I would have thought that a place called \"Beer Bistro\" would be right up in my wheelhouse.  I enjoy varied types of beer and love eating bistro-style food.  What's not to love?  And truly enough, the place has grown from fairly humble beginnings.  Rot iron and contemporary stools and tables await.  The staff are friendly and attentive, wheeling around the space armed with an understanding of the newly created gastro-pub menu (Did we really let the word \"gastro-pub\" sneak into our vocabulary?  Seriously?  Huh.  I don't like it.).  They are well aware of the pairings of food and beer that will make a good meal, and will also allow you to get a sampler of beers without resorting heavily on one pint.  Good points all around.  That's the good stuff.  The sense though is that this is a place to boast about the girth of your expense account.  As varied and numerous as the beers are, they are not cheap.  Mostly this is due to them maintaining the ability to provide a range of offerings.  But you can also add on an extra 10-15% onto the bottle and tap price based on the number of credit cards with company names punched into them that come forth for payments.  The food is tasty but can sometimes come off a bit pretentious for a place that has something as fun as beer as one of the ingredients.  All in all it's a fine place to go, but make sure someone else is paying for it."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for one night for business and counted on my fellow Yelpers for a good place to dine.  They didn't let me down.    This place was packed on a Wednesday night so they put my party of one at the \"chef's table\", essentially a mini bar like area looking into the kitchen.  good thing i didn't sneeze.  ha.  the menu is very heavy on fru fru foods - lots of fancy seafood and lamb and stuff.  i just got the grilled chicken but it was over a great polenta with balsamic vinegar and was stuffed with a light goat cheese.  outstanding.  the dessert where some beer-brownie cookies sandwiched around some beer-coffee marshmallow ice cream - all outstanding.  they even had the one beer i really love - chimay blue.  the only thing that keeps this from five stars is that the menu is a bit pretentious with all the high falutin stuff - nonetheless the pricing was right and the food outstanding."}
{"text":"My dining mate and I went to Beer Bistro specifically for mussels and beer.   I had the Blue Blonde mussels (ermite blue cheese, affligem blonde, pear, spinach, leeks and a touch of cream). The flavour was really wonderful. It was surprising and pleasant to find chunks of blue cheese inside the mussel shells. The broth is excellent; I slurped it all up with a spoon. The downside to the mussels was that they were teeeeeny. There were a lot of mussels, but they were all quite tiny.   We shared frites and they were quite good. Crispy and hot! It was really nice, dipping the frites in my blue cheese mussels broth.  I found the description of the different beers really informative and helpful. I felt like I had adequate information to help me choose the perfect beer!  The service was all right. Mediocre. Nothing too special. It would have been nice if we had our waters re-filled more often.  All in all, a great place to get mussels."}
{"text":"I've been here to grab a drink a few times. They have a good selection of beer and the service is pretty decent. I ate the hog wild pizza.... It was delish!!!Pretty good patio and nice interior. They close off some of the interior at a certain hour and it becomes a pretty small place to hang out in, that's the only drawback in my opinion."}
{"text":"Fantastic French fries and dynamite cheese fondue!!!   I've eaten here a few times and been delighted every time. This time we stopped in for a few beers and a snack and were blown away with flavour and hospitality. The service was excellent, attentive while not being pushy, and a nice treat for a bar. But Beerbistro is much more than a bar, it's a relaxed high end restaurant with a focus on beer and food pairings."}
{"text":"Great spot for work lunch! I had the Steak Frites (flank) which was amazing beyond my expectations. The steak was cooked medium rare as requested, juicy and paired with herb butter. To my surprise, it was very thick for a flank.  It could use  more seasoning and the server forgot to bring black pepper but it was still good. The fries were addictive as well, with mayo and a very special ketchup. The server was very upbeat and was very knowledgeable about the beer menu.  This place has a completely different vibe during the day. I came for lunch and the décor was actually pretty nice (vs. the time I came at night and it was all dark)."}
{"text":"Bison burger was great and tasted extra-gamey on a fresh seemingly-cheesey bun and I really liked it.  Also, the coleslaw had more of a vinagrettey flavour and I liked it too.. Buddy had the pulled pork pizza and was also amazing with a smokey smell and flavour."}
{"text":"Chambly Mimosa for brunch. Need I say more?  Well, I will say 8 kinds of eggs benny is what brought me in. I had the spicy crab, which was delish. My bf had the bacon florentine variety, which I have to admit, was quite potent. I think it was the emmental cheese. Too much of a good thing.  The service could have been better. We were both seated with our arms crossed, our knives and forks in the \"I'm finished\" position for a good 20 minutes before our plated were cleared.   The bonus was while we were waiting for our food to arrive, we were served mini carrot cake donuts, and we were also given a sample of the brunch ceasar.   I have been here once before, and I had a pleasant experience, but this time, with few tables in the restaurant, I expected better service than we received."}
{"text":"The beer selection was phenomenal. I had Westmalle Trappist beer. That's right, it was made by monks in Germany!  The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were very good, but I was surprised there were no greens (even as a garnish!) with such a heavy meal.   The atmosphere and decor was very masculine. Service was excellent and attentive!"}
{"text":"This place charges $2.50 for glass of pop with 3/4 of it being ice. No refills. doesn't inform you either that there's a charge.  The steak I had was plain. Pedestrian.  Didn't come with any side as they expect you to order extra and pay more. For the price I paid I would have had a set dinner at the keg.   Holy rip off!!!  WILL NOT BE BACK"}
{"text":"I should probably preface this by saying I am related to the owner, but that only adds to the appeal!  So what if I get a free beer once in awhile? I come here anyways!  Having lived in Belgium, I come here to relive some of my favourite Belgian foods and beer (although, I am admittedly not much of a beer drinker). The cheese fondue and frites are authentic standouts, as well as the pulled pork sandwich even if it's not really Belgian. You have to ask for the pulled pork as it's not on the menu, but it should be since it's so popular. Maybe I should see to this since I have the connection and all!"}
{"text":"Can this be true? A place in the downtown core that is actually decent??  Yup. Won't go into the beer selections here because it is pretty damn good.  I did have the buffalo burger there and have to commend them for it - was very delicious and the patty wasn't dry. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Had dinner there once and tried the beef cheeks. Very well done, moist, melt in your mouth and the sides were amazing. Portion size could be a tad bit larger but honestly, no complaints.  Service is always great and the servers are consistently friendly. Would definitely take friends or even clients there for a meal."}
{"text":"Really impressive beer selection, and enjoyed their late night menu...poutine and cheese fondue. Our server was incredibly nice and also made some solid beer recommendations based on our preferences. Was pretty hopping even at the 1am mark!"}
{"text":"Been here many times for work meetings, lunches, dinners, hosting out-of-towners and it never disappoints.   This is a staple place in the financial district/shopping district to go right along King St for after work, meetings, or to celebrate. If you like beer, they have an expansive menu of different beers in a ton of different categories. They also do have a few options for wines and local ciders. First visited here 10 years ago, and while a few things have changed, the charm of joint and selection of beer really hasn't, and again, that's a good thing.  The menu changes seasonally and they have beer pairings for each item chosen by the chef and wait staff. Service is typically quick and effective and they have a patio on the side outside if the weather is nice enough.   Lots of tasty, delicious food items like Fresh Made Perogies, Fresh caught halibut, Lamb, Veal and Steak, as well as chicken curry, belgian beef tacos, etc.  Had a chance to try to the steak frites and couldn't be happier. Cooked medium-rare, and served in a great portion.   Parking is a problem as really it's downtown so that's to be expected. Also, even though they have a big dining room, if it's busy, you're not getting a table for a while.   4.0 out of 5.0. This probably is the default place for me in the area. b"}
{"text":"Beerbistro is the quintessential after work spot for the Bay Street Bankers who don't mind dropping a hunky chunk of change on beer.  I kind of imagine them walking like the Jets from West Side Story, snapping their fingers in their fancy suits.  OK, I won't hold it against the restaurant, but it is an over-dressed slightly douchey crowd.  This place is always busy...never think that you can just walk in and get a table.  The BEER: Once upon a time, I think this restaurant was near the forefront of the Toronto beer scene.  I have to say that their ranking is slipping, particularly with what they have on tap. I'm starting to find they have a lot of beer from the more macro breweries in Ontario and Quebec: Beau's, Mill Street, St. Ambroise, and Unibroue.  They often have a couple more interesting beers, but I find it's pretty hit and miss.  Occasionally they'll have something from Rogue on tap.  Their bottle list is a lot stronger, but the prices are often disproportionately high...much higher than say Sin & Redemption.  Now, don't get me wrong, sometimes their beer list is filled with gems, but 3 out of the last 4 times, I've had a hard time finding a beer I wanted, often because the good stuff was gone.  The SERVICE:  This is clearly the weak point for me.  First of all, the hostess station is always total chaos.  No one seems to be there to greet you, put your name on a list, or anything.  When they are there, they're generally not friendly and look put out to be helping you.  I've never sat in the proper restaurant portion, but for the bar area, they seem to only have one waitress for a lot of people.  You better decide quickly, because if you're not sure when she happens to get to you, you might be out of luck for the next 20 minutes as was my experience last time.  Getting the check is also a similar challenge.    OVERALL, This isn't a bad place to go if you're in the area.  The Yonge street corridor is pretty much a good beer dessert between Bar Volo and here on this side of downtown.  Their beer list can be decent, but I would rank this bar pretty firmly in the middle of the pack of bars I've visited in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my people had to sit in the back of anywhere. Simply walked in with my Mom, we were asked whether inside or out, we chose out, the hostess began walking us past the action and out of the way at the furthest end of the patio...No people in sight. We kindly stopped, shook our heads, and made a b-line for the door. When I say there's no people in sight, we were put in the back right corner. The closest occupied table was no less than 5 tables away. It felt really awkward as she walked us past the action and then proceeded to walk us past empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty tables. I'm not saying that she should bunch people in, and I really should have videotaped the whole situation and post it to show that I'm not overly sensitive and exaggerating.  Unfortunately I can't say anything about food or \"service\" other than what I opened with. It has been a few long years since my people were forced to sit in the back of anywhere...But it could have been worse, she could have said \"I'm sorry, we don't have any open tables for tonight\""}
{"text":"A great place for a night of drinks or extend it to dinner afterwards. There is an extensive beer menu with delightful witty blurbs for each beer, I appreciated the extra effort to make it interesting and you will be sure to find something that works from all the choices. The Belgian Frites are good and make the perfect nibbles as you work through your drinks. For dinner I had the mussels, and they were so fragrant that the table next to us leaned in to tell me that it smelled delicious (and this is after they had finished a full meal already). And they were delicious!   The space itself is one large room divided into a bar area clustered by the front door and a restaurant space further back. A large glass window in the restaurant area lets you watch the kitchen staff in action as they plate and execute orders. The crowd volume levels steadily increases as the night gets later, but you probably won't notice since you will be a couple drinks in already. Service was excellent, with our waitress checking periodically to swap out new drinks and make sure we didn't need anything. In all, a great experience for a night out."}
{"text":"Read about how good the duck fat fries are, so we ordered one for two to share for $7. They tasted just like any other fries unfortunately, nothing too special.   I ordered the pulled pork primanti sandwich, it was quite large (4 fists size). The pulled pork was average, the bread was dry and all other condiments' flavours were overpowered by the pork; they did not add much to the presentation either.  Environment: We chose the outdoor table at first but deeply regretted it soon after, because there were bees, flies and mosquitoes just swarming around you and your food. The waitress kindly relocated us indoors, but not before some fruit flies landed in our sandwiches...  Slightly overpriced for the food, but decent service and had a vibe of an upscale sports bar."}
{"text":"Always dependable for a great bowl of mussels and frites!!!!! And, an awesome beer selection, including (for the ladies)....Fruili!!! YUM, nothing better than strawberry beer!!!!!  This is a great spot for lunch in the downtown corporate district, to take clients to....or an after-work dinner with friends.  I highly recommend it!!!  We've never had a bad meal here -- it is always the high standard of meal you'd expect at a good restaurant!!! We love love love the selection of mussels -- from thai to mexican......fun fun fun!!!  YAY Beer Bistro!!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Beer Bistro rescuing my night and the aggravated first impression of Toronto that I was getting.  Not only were they serving food late and open until 2am, they had just the atmosphere that I wanted--moderately lively but not overbearingly bustling or loud, like most places were around that time.  Besides, the beer and food menus both enticed me.  (Chicagoans:  think of a roomier, hipper, less pretentious, and more menu-ambitious Hopleaf.)  I loved the space, especially the high ceilings.  It was modern but also comfortable.  All of the staff that I encountered were top-notch and very friendly.  The hostess was nothing but cheery both before and after I changed my mind about sitting outside and asked her to hop back inside.  She gave me the perfect little table in the corner.  My server Jeff G. was spot-on as well, with the small exception that my water glass was left unfilled for most of my meal.  Of course their specialty is beer (which technically would make them a brasserie), specifically the northern- and central-European and European-style varieties.  Of their 20 draughts and 110 bottles (yes, I counted), most are imports from Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, etc, and many others are local to Quebec and Ontario.  Most servings are in the $6-$7 range (for a half-litre or 300ml), and they also offer a sampling of three for $6--great for trying several kinds.  They group the beers on the menu by personality, such as sociable, bold, crisp, quenching, spicy, soothing, robust, contemplative, etc.    All the food came out with a classy presentation and tasted great to boot.  I started with the bistro salad, which included shredded beets and a white-beer/truffle vinaigrette; and the bacon-wrapped shrimp--five very large prawns wrapped in \"bacon\" (not the crispy American kind), with dollops of an interesting sweet/spicy sauce on the side of the dish.  Let's say B+ on both of those dishes.  The Berkshire pulled pork primanti was huge--just the sandwich fillings were the size of my fist.  There was a generous portion of pulled pork, a wonderful multi-vegetable slaw, a few frites, and a slice of smoked gouda.  As a straight-up pulled pork sandwich, I have had better; but as a \"fancy\" version it really worked, especially the slaw.  A- on the sandwich.  Overall, I loved the food.  I skipped dessert in favor of a Leffe Brune.  One last note:  in the dining room and bar they have framed old beer advertisements (vintage and classy, not like modern beer mirrors and whatnot).  However, the men's room takes the cake:  above the urinals are flat-screen monitors showing old 50's and 60's TV commercials for long-lost beers such as Schmidt's, Duke's Golden, and Hudepohl.  What a brilliant idea and delightful touch.  If I lived in Toronto, this would be a regular spot and would probably get the fifth star (rare for me) after the second or third trip.  Apparently they also offer weeknight tastings, and Beer School is in the works.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Toronto for our anniversary and wanted to find an upscale, trendy, and romantic restaurant without indulging the overly clichéd steakhouse or Italian place. Beerbistro was absolutely perfect.  The beer menu is massive, although unlike a lot of the specialty \"tap-overload\" restaurants, Beerbistro actually takes the time to carefully curate a large selection categorized by taste profile and parings with full descriptions. Great diversity with lots of European/Canadian/American beers available.  The food is pretty good. We started with the fondue (our one anniversary click´for the night) which was a great treat. The cheese was the perfect amount of sharpness without being too decadent. For dinner, we enjoyed a nice bucket of the mussels which, along with the appetizer, was more than enough to feed both of us.   The restaurant itself is very open with very few walls and large windows that open on to the street/plaza. The decor is all very modern with both clean exposed steel and some bohemian selections on the walls. The location was conveniently located mere feet from a subway stop, so it was very easy to get to.  Overall... highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really not sure where to start. This place could probably be rated four stars based upon its beer selection which is pretty good. I was able to sit down and consume one beer at the ice bar.  $8.25 for the full-size beer. I sat there for about an hour, was never offered another beer or food menu, so I never tried any of the food, although some of it looked pretty good as it was passing me by. Service was terrible and the Wi-Fi would not work the entire time I was there. Wish I had a different perspective, but I have to write this upon my experience. I basically felt invisible sitting at the bar. I will not return, because you get one chance to make a first impression."}
{"text":"Out of all of the places that I stopped in toronto, Beerbistro had to be one of my favorites. Numerous factors went into this:  1. The World cup was going on and Beerbistro is a fabulous place to watch this, there is a display large enough to satisfy a large group, yet at the same time it felt cozy enough to not notice the ruckus, if that isn't your thing (it was our thing though, and it was awesome!).  2. The service was the bomb. Our server was fast, friendly, attentive, and more than happy to give us suggestions (that turned out to be great ones) of things to do while we were in town. Also, the hostess seated us where we wanted less than 2 minutes of walking in 10/10 on the service end.  3. The beer was delish (I had the Rodenbach & the La Maudite). Both were new flavors for me and exactly what I was looking for, I would recommend them.  4. BELGIAN FRITES. Yes, the all caps was needed. MON DIEU! These frites were devine. They have such a taste. Do you think I could get them to mail some to me? I would go back here just for the frites. Order these. It's a must.   Go here, drink beer, eat frites. 10/10 Perfect experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend. Seriously --- was difficult to pick something from the menu -- soooo many great choices. Lots of great appetizers too if you prefer drinks and appetizers to a traditional meal.  My friend had the mussels (which come in 4 flavours - she went for the East Coast one).  Comes with a nice mini Sourdough roll.  I had the Schnitzel which was great.  It comes with potato salad and frites (which is a little too much potato for me -- so I switched up the frites for their house salad which was great).    Fantastic selection of beers, but also a decent and reasonable wine list. There was no sparkling wine by the glass (we were celebrating her engagement!) - but we just went for the bottle!  It has some lively vibe and obviously a popular spot (all tables were taken for the full 2-1/2 hours we were there). There is even a cool spot for singles to sit along an eating bar that faces into the kitchen.  Tres cool.  I am thinking next time I will have to try those mussels, although I saw lots of good offerings go by (nice looking burger and pulled pork sandwich as well as a Cheese Fondue - which is not something you typically see!).  Check it out -- and hope you enjoy! Service was great too -- helpful, not hovering, and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Went to Beerbistro for a nice dinner with the guys, and was not disappointed. Food was awesome, beer menu was nuts (though they could use some Beau's). After we ate, the host asked us to move to the lounge area so that they could sit more people at the table, and gave us a round of drinks as a thanks. Great spot."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Toronto, this place is a must. We had their Cheese Fondue and Belgian White Mussels. They were incredible. Their ciders are wonderful too."}
{"text":"Many would say this is an old-faithful favourite, particularly for business lunches or after-work drinks in Toronto's Financial District. Prices are reasonable, there's a looooot to choose from in terms of drinks (read: BEER bistro), there's variety to the menu (from salad, to fish, to those infamous duck fat fries), there's a good amount of seating (plus outdoor seating in the warmer months), atmosphere is classy (think white linen tablecloths) but still with a hint of casualness that doesn't make it stuffy. Atmosphere is within the range of casual to business casual.  My recent visit was on a Monday evening, and by 6:00 PM, it was pretty busy - the restaurant and bar areas were both almost full. I ordered the Steak Frites and a cider - the duck fat fries that came with my Steak Frites (you can also order it by itself) were delicious - nice strong smokiness and crispiness. Note: if you order the fries by itself, you may want to share - the portion is very generous. They're delicious to the point of addicting - while the steak was just okay, the fries are always the highlight for me.   A good choice overall, whether you're here for a work meal or not."}
{"text":"There are only 3 things to order here if you want delicious food for a fair price.  The fries.  They're fried in duck fat, full of flavor and highly addictive.  The fries at Beerbistro is worth a second visit.  When I'm in the city again, there's no question, you'll see me having the fries as an entree.  The mussels.  They're served with sour dough bread and come in a whole range of flavors.  The only 2 issues is that the mussels are a little on the small side and to not order is the 'Fancy Smancy', which has lobster and crab.  It's not worth it, the crab tasted canned and I barely saw any chunks lobster.  If you stick to any of the other flavors though, you're in for a good meal.    The 3 glass tasting flight (3 ounces each) for $6  I found the other entrees overpriced and mediocre at best.  The 4/5 stars Beerbistro received is due to the friendly and knowledgeable staff, the tasting flight, mussels and of course the melt in your mouth fries."}
{"text":"I had a good friend of mine reccommend Beerbistro to us, so as a surprise I took my boyfriend here.  The ambiance itself was nice.  We sat in the comfy couches in the lounge, and while it was enjoyable and a gret view, the tables are too high for the couches which meant a lot of spillage of food.  When I went to the washroom I passed the open kitchen which seemed like it would be an enjoyable place to sit if the chef's interacted with you.  Seeing as the menu has about a bajillion beers, I was disappointed at the lack of attention the servers paid us.  No instruction on the menu, or any kind of conversation about what we were there for.  Also, we would've loved to try the tasting beers that we saw served, but again, no one pointed out that that was an option.  As for the food, the menu was shockingly expensive for what is essentially fanci-fied pubfare.    After paying $16 for 2 tacos That would've been equally delicious at TacoBell for 99c, I felt kind of stupid.  I don't mind small portions at all, but the flat bread in my opionion was also not really a \"shareable\" portion, unless you're sharing two apps.  Disappointed, and certainly not in a rush to return."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 7 years. Great beer selection in both draught and bottles/cans. Good food, in particular the duck fat frites. Staff has always been knowledgeable and helpful on choosing beers to go with the food and making suggestions based on what you already had.  I recently booked out the private back room for an event, and couldn't have been happier. Price point was great compared to a lot of other similar sized options, and menu choices were well within budget. Worked with me to have a specific beer list for my event and catered to vegetarians in the crowd. Staff were super friendly night of, and very responsive via email leading up to the event.  Try to avoid the after work businessman rush if you go, it's frustrating trying to get a table at 5 p.m. on a work night."}
{"text":"Had an excellent time at BeerBistro.   I don't love beer, but loved Close By since it was below freezing and super windy.   Gave the place a whirl and loved it.    Sat at the bar, and it was lively, open airy, and fun.   If I were in a talking mood, I could have met new friends.   Greg behind the bar welcomed me with a hand shake and a smile, and asked me where I hailed from, how I was enjoying my visit, and gave me some great reco's.     Loved 2 Belgian beers that were unreal, both on tap.   The burger was just one of a ton of delicious options.   After starting with a cute beautiful house salad, which was awesome, the burger was a perfect finish. Bison on a great non-overbearing roll.    Excellent place.  Have already forwarded to my dad for him to visit on his next trip to TO."}
{"text":"Five stars! It was our first time in Toronto and for our trip we decided to have a nice dinner somewhere.   We made this reservation for 7pm. After trekking all over Toronto seeing Casa Loma, couple museums, CN tower we hurried and grabbed the sub to get there. It's only across the street at the King exit. Very Convenient for running late. We got there a lil late and the hostess said she was about to cancel us! But she didn't, extra kuddos! The place was awesome. Big fancy mirror at the back of the room. It's a big open room including the bar which does not distract or interfere with dining area.   HUGE beer selection, I mean DICTIONARY of a menu, is the best way i can describe this. You looking for a good time with beer Definitely make it a point to come here. Or Wine and dine yourself if that's what you prefer. They have a staggering load of options!!  Food was great had Wide noodles spinach with Black Truffle, yummy, with an Arugula salad nice n peppery. The noodles were cooked to perfection and truffle had a rich taste. They shredded the carrots and made a nice presentation.   Would go over and over again! Until Ive had every beer in their dictionary!"}
{"text":"Went here before a Toronto Raptors game. Great location, walking distance to the Air Canada Centre. Great selection of beers, including from local breweries. We tried the mussels, really fresh and lots of bread to soak up the yummy broth. Service in the bar section was great! Waiter/bartender was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to find a wonder and robust variety of national and imported draughts.  German draughts are always draw me in but I always find myself with a glass of La Fin du Monde.  It was quite appropriate in the winter when we were celebrating the last day of the year.  Four rounds.    But I am a real sucker for their varieties of mussels.  All I need is a bowl of moules served with a fresh crusty roll and several rounds of beer.    It is nice to sit down a enjoy a good brew without the damning loudness of other beer venues and pubs.  A good pub is always treasured but sometimes you cannot savor a good beer when you're constantly raising your voice margin by margin to hold a conversation.  Somehow, this seems like a more appropriate way to drink down centuries of brewing tradition, give or take a century or two.    And please get the fries.  And the brunch is excellent.    Oh, and if you happen to need to go to the Gent's room there is a surprising way to keep you focused on what you need to do.  I have never had the need to go to the Ladies's room so I don't know what awaits you ladies there.  Sorry.    Prost!"}
{"text":"Ok, so on a Tuesday afternoon I decide I really want moules frites and beer. I yelp. I find Beerbistro. We secure a reservation for that night without any headaches or disappointment. Success!  Lots of business-y looking folks on the patio drinking beer; a maybe more tourist-y, cinq-a-sept crowd on the inside. Not my usual choice for dinner, but I didn't care. If perhaps not the trendiest place, it was fairly busy with happy looking people,  the music, lighting, service, and decor were overall inoffensive, if a little staid, and the moules frites were, yeah, exactly what I wanted.   Yes, I love the purpose-built bowls that come with a little grate to make sourdough bread-soppage more convenient! Yes I love the belgian frites (even if I did have to pay an extra $8 for them)! Yes I loved the Collective Arts beer they suggested as a pairing for my mussels Provencal! The mussels themselves were tender and tasty, if on the smaller size (I've had bigger, meatier ones elsewhere), and I loved the broth! Salty/Spicy, layered, delicious. I ended up only a tiny bit disappointed not to find moules meuniere on the menu.   My craving was satisfied. I'm thrilled this place exists. I will never crave hopelessly for my favourite food again. My date had the Short Rib pizza and complained that it was too small for a main and said something about it being 'onion and arugula pizza with a short-rib tomato sauce'-- I wasn't phased! I thought that actually sounded pretty good for a cinq-a-sept snack and he should have ordered the mussels!"}
{"text":"Our attraction to Beerbistro was partly fueled by a want for poutine as late night snack and a need for an eatery that is not ear-splitting loud. As we walked down the street, we quickly realized that our options may be a lot more limited than we had previously realized, as the late hours meant that most of the places that were open in the vicinity would be pubs and bars or clubs, all of which equal very loud noise. Thankfully, just when we were ready to resign ourselves and enter a random pub, we found Beerbistro.  Beerbistro to me is a unique eatery with a casual \"lounge\" feel to it. From the moment we walked in and sat down around one of their tables, I could feel the tension on my shoulders and back start to melt away. Because it was late at night on a weekend (and because this is after all a beer bistro), people are drinking of course, and there are a few drunks around, but the noise level is very comfortable. My group could talk without having to raise our voices, and without feeling like we might have to whisper or risk disturbing other people. The place was quite packed for the night, but somehow the atmosphere of the place was still relaxing; it didn't at all feel packed.  I keep wanting to return to the word comfortable because that's what it felt like to me.  At the server's recommendation, we ordered some ephemere pomme ale - quite delicious! - along with the poutine that had sent us out on our quest in the first place. We had two of their poutine in fact, the supreme, and the pulled pork. Personally, I have to recommend the pulled pork poutine over the supreme; the pulled pork is simply one bowl of deliciousness. Savory pulled pork bbq and half melted cheese curds and thin ribbons of sriracha over fries, and when the pork and cheese are gone and you think you're left with boring fries, what awaits at the bottom of the bowl are fries soaked in well-made delicious chicken gravy. As far as a late night snack goes, this is an A+.   We walked away from Beerbistro very much satisfied and relaxed. I also walked away with another ale and another restaurant to add to my favorite list."}
{"text":"Great food, beer selection and you must savor the Belgian Frites!  So delicious !  Good for families , the flatbreads were tasty, beef curry entree was fantastic too.  Service was spot on, friendly and so helpful to the foreign traveler !  Went out of their way to help us find a great breakfast spot for kids!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"though expensive, this classy spot is one of my go-tos for craft beer when i'm downtown, especially because of its proximity to union station.  excellent bottle list, decent tap list, and a diverse food menu.  they constantly pump out their belgian frites from the kitchen, and rightly so - lightly-salted, dense, crispy, tasty fries with tons of potato skins, served with a smoked ketchup and a super rich housemade mayo.  a perfect match with any beer.  the space is divided into two sections: a lounge area for a more casual bar-type feel, and a dining section for those looking for more of a full meal experience.  their recent renovation renders the interior a bit dimmer, showcasing wood walls of various dark hues.  elegant and modern.  i've never had a problem with the service here.  the staff are sociable and knowledgeable, and are always making sure you're taken care of.  plus points for having TVs for sports AND good beer - a pairing that somehow almost never coexists"}
{"text":"Dined here for Valentines Day after enjoying Bier Markt I really wanted to try this place after reading the reviews and noticing the selection of beers available.   We ordered the following:  - Belgian Frites  - Drunken Mushroom Pizza  - Steak Frites   And also ordered some beers, I don't recall the names of them though. The food and drinks were amazing, we simply enjoyed everything including the service. Our server was very helpful in selection of beer and very attentive. The food was cooked perfectly and the steak was the highlight for me since some people can't seem to cook medium rare properly.   I'm impressed and I would love to come back to try out the other appetizers as well. It is a casual dining but the atmosphere is romantic and great for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple half liters of Ontario's Side Launch Wheat, along with a bowl of Brussels Mussels steamed in La Fin du Monde with smoked sausage, fennel, chili, parsley and garlic.  I was not disappointed in the slightest."}
{"text":"This is my husband's chosen place of worship, and with good reason.  The beer list is absolutely insane.  The waitstaff knows the beer list inside and out.  The food is pretty good.  The ambience is quite nice.  We came here after a lot of begging from my husband, and he absolutely loved it.  I, on the other hand, cringed somewhat at the price, but I suppose if you're going to drink Belgian beers handmade made by monks, where they only circulate a limited amount in the world and you literally have to go to the monastery daily..... well, it aint gunna come cheap.  Sorry people, no Coors light in this place.  The food was good, although they have limited vegetarian options.  The fries were great, mostly because they make their own ketchup there and it was quite tasty.  My husband also really enjoyed the chicken.  All in all, we'll be returning here every Sunday for drunken services.  Oh boy."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place... I really don't like to review a place based on the service, because people comes and goes, so does employees. But technically, a place where you have to spend around $70 for a beer and a plate of food, I will expect to be treated a little bit better than I was treated here. Leaving the service out of the equation, let me start with the beer selection. Yes, it is wide, but if you ever been in a place like the Flying Saucer in Dallas or the Bierehouse (I think is closed now) in New York, you'll see it is not that wide. The bartender asked me, what beer I like and she tried to pair. She got me a regular pielsner, well, an imported one. I can say it was good, not wow. After 15 minutes I was able to order my food (yes, 15 minutes to take my order), I decided for the pork shank. Overcooked and unseasoned, I think I don't need to say anything else about that. May be you want to stay away from this item on the menu. The only reason I gave  2 stars is because the manager was very attentive to my complain and he really want to fix the problem on my next visit. I will take his offer next time and see how it works."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while exploring downtown Toronto. WHAT A FIND! The mussels are to die for, however, I caught myself salivating at every plate that was walked past me. Beer lovers....this is the spot for you! A huge selection and the waiters are very knowledgeable! We were lucky enough to catch live music too!"}
{"text":"2.5 (but that felt too harsh)  Full disclaimer, the food lived up to the hype, the service is really where they took the hit (as well as the pricey-ness overall, but that is to be expected I guess).   I made a reservation on a Friday for 5pm, and they told me only upon arriving that we had a two hour seating limit (not usually an issue, except our waitress had a bad habit of disappearing for 20 minute intervals between delivering food and drinks, but I digress). The place has a warm and hoppin' atmosphere with the bar side seemingly like a financial district watering hole and the dining room at the back being more formal.   The \"featured beers\" prices vary A LOT (from $7.08 - $38.50 for single pours). The \"normal beers\" in the menu are much more reasonable and so tasty! The belgian fries are delicious and crispy, with homemade ketchup. The mussels are also great! We had the brussel mussels (spicy and a little sausage-smokey), and the english mussels (like a chowder, but less rich, and a nice bacon potato taste). They come with cold bread (that should definitely be warmed for such a nice place...the small things make a BIG difference!).  THIS IS ABOUT THE SAD SERVICE (so feel free to disregard): Our waitress was THE WORST! She disappeared for long stretches and failed to check in. I had to ask for ketchup 3 times before it arrived at the table. She kept bringing food to the wrong tables, seemed angry when we wanted to order more food, or drinks and was surly and rude. While everything about the restaurant seemed to scream financial district decadence, their service made them seem like your subpar suburb diner). For those who watch the mindy project, imagine Beverly the nurse as a waitress....yep, that bad..."}
{"text":"went to the beer bistro after work. The beer selection here is pretty good. I had 3 flights (samplers of 3 beers each) . So a total of 9 different kinds of draught beer. I left the selection up to the server who didnt dissapoint. For food the table ordered, jamaican goat curry, bbq pizza and kobe beef tacos.  The goat curry was an interesting dish that used quinoa instead of rice, but didnt taste very jamaican to me. It was a good dish nonetheless. The beef tacos were pretty good as well, simple and delicious.  The bbq chicken pizza was excellent and was finished quickly at the table.   The only let down was the so called house specialty \"Belgian fries\". I have had fries in 3 different cities in belgium including at chez antoine in brussels .  What they serve here is definitely NOT belgian fries. I wouldnt be as annoyed at this if they had just included this as an afterthought. All the fries I had in the belgian specialty fries stands had these things in common:  1) double fried 2) crispy as ever on the outside  (snaps in two when twisted) 3) fluffy on the inside  4) actually tastes like baked potatoes  i dont know about 1 , but this place was a fail on 2,3,4. They really shouldnt call this their specialty, then people that know what belgian fries actually taste like might not be annoyed at what in my opinion is a misrepresentation of belgian fries."}
{"text":"What a great meal.   When our waitress first approached us, I let her know it was our first time there, especially since we are not really beer drinkers.  She immediately said \"Well I can help guide you.\"  A good sign.  Our friendly server then chatted to us a bit about the draft selection, and offered a few suggestions, but in the end we ended up making our own choices.  I had a Weihenstephaner (\"light and fruity with notes of banana and clove\").  There is a huge assortment of beers available (both draft and bottled), plus a fascinating \"beer cellar\" selection.  You could spend an hour reading it but basically the beer cellar menu is a selection of higher end beers, some as expensive as $80 / bottle!    Our meals arrived quickly - the Hog Wild Pizza and the Lobster Quesadilla.  My pizza was fantastic. Hot and crispy, loaded with toppings, including full cloves of roasted garlic.   My friend's lobster quesadilla was filled with tasty lobster alongside a big scoop of guacamole and another of sour cream.  These meals are not served with sides, so at first it looked as though they might not be substantial, but I was wrong.   We split dessert - the Chocolate Peanut Butter and Banana Springroll, which is served with vanilla bourbon ice cream.  The dessert was ok but the ice cream was heavenly.  The bourbon adds a great flavour.  I asked our server more about the ice cream - they are actually called \"Beer Screams\" and all made on site with different beers, such as \"Rocky Road with Coffee Porter\".   500 ml take-out portions are available.   I can't think of a single bad thing to say.  Service was friendly and helpful, food was delicious, and our bill (a 500 ml draft each, an entree each, and a shared dessert) came to about $75 with tax and well deserved tip."}
{"text":"Came here for after dinner drinks on Saturday night at 10'ish.  Beerbistro is divided into two sections: dining area and bar. We sat in the latter. The bar has a lot to offer including beers (both domestic and intl), wines, and pub grub. By reading other reviews, it seems that there's brunch as well. The dining area was crowded so I think it's safe to assume that the food here is good.  Upon taking a seat, our drink orders were taken (awesome). Service was quite entertaining as well. There was a live jazz bland in the very well-lit bar area.  I'm giving this place a SOLID three stars for now, but this based solely on my experience of coming here for DRINKS (only) on a SATURDAY night. I just wasn't feeling the vibe. My sister tells me that it's different on weekday nights. And I would have no qualms coming here for a nice dinner.  A-ok for going out on a Saturday night ~"}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here a lot even though I love trying new restaurants. First, they have live jazz music. Second, the food and drinks are divine and the fries are soooo delicious. It is a trendy spot and a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Great modules & frites paired with excellent beer list. The house Shallow Beer Saas on the Side in house brew is a top notch brown ale!"}
{"text":"Everything I had here tonight was fantastic and flavorful...duck confit flatbread, Shillow Something Red, and St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout. Excellent beer list, and I'd be happy to come back here on my next trip. Oh Canada! You are delicious....and cheap. In NYC, your prices would be doubled."}
{"text":"I'm impressed by the beer selection at this place. They have a number of beers you cannot get anywhere else in the city. And the prices are very reasonable (for what you're getting). They have a great selection of Cantillon, including vintages (a beer I didn't know you could get outside of Belgium). But these lambics aren't for everyone. They can get quite sour. Even the blends. In any case, an experience for anyone interested in quality beer. Also some very interesting selections from Quebec and the southwestern united states, not to mention a good selection of other great beers from europe. If you want to try one of the Cantillon's, or any of the exclusives, be sure to ask for the \"cellar\" list. The regular beer list doesn't list them.  The belgian frites come with a nice smoked tomato ketchup. Although the idea of fries cooked in duck fat sounds great, the fries always seem to be soggy. soggy fries are no good no matter what fat they're cooked in. texture is everything. That's what you get with one fry stage I guess.  The patio is a little strange, as its sandwiched between a couple of office buildings, and the place is a little fancy on the inside, so it may not be your regular stop, but definitely nice once in a while."}
{"text":"Had a reservation here and was seated right away when we came. The host gave my boyfriend and I a table near the kitchen. It was away from the crowd, but it gave us some privacy. The atmosphere was nice, but the lights were a little bit too dimmed for my personal taste.  The waitress was great! She was pretty attentive to our needs. We ordered the Belgian White mussels, Belgian frites, and one of the Pork House specials they had that evening. The pork and mussels were good. Pork wasn't too dry, but I felt that it lacked flavor. Came with seasonal vegetables and potatoes. The mussels were also alright, nothing outstanding about it. I don't know what I was expecting from mussels though. It was very light, just what we wanted to start with.  Apparently, the restaurant was renown for their Belgian frites. Blanched in beef and duck fat. There was a good amount of it which was great. I saw a few table ordering it, so hey, I thought we'd try it out as well. When it arrived, I just thought that they were mediocre. Again, not sure what I was expecting from the fries. I mean, the fries we had from America was very similar to the ones we were eating, possibly even better. Maybe since they were 'renown' for them, I expected that there would be some distinction from the fries in Canada to America. But nope, just regular restaurant fries. I did taste the beef and duck fat though. :)  The beers and wine we had were pretty good. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the beer selections (he loves his IPAs and he was on a hunt for some good Canadian IPAs). The Spirit Pear Tree cider and wine I had was pretty good.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I got to dine and wine with my boyfriend in Toronto! Kinda wondered what the fondue tasted like..there were a few tables ordering that off the menu."}
{"text":"A brief survey of positive and negatives:  + Delicious food. Duck confit pizza and mussels were outstanding.  + Beautiful décor  + Thoughtful food-drink pairings on menu.   - Surly service by our main server. (Other staff was great.)  Overall, five stars for the food and three stars for the service resulting in four stars in total. Definitely recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Extremely close to st Lawrence market so it's definitely worth it the short walk over. We luck out when we got here over the Easter weekend - they were having a Belgium beer festival. 5 different beer paired with food that compliment its flavor. P.s they offer lambic"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, friendly staff.  Perfect for after work drinks or weekend supper with friends.  Any time I've been here it's been packed to the roof with people and never a lag in service.  Staff are really attentive and come around often enough you're taken care of  but not too often that it's annoying.   Cheese and Lager fondue - I dream about this.  Steak frites - duck fat frites are amazing, steak is mediocre   Pulled pork - fantastic  The kobe beef tacos are also amazing.    Unfortunately for me, the wine list could  have a few more options (3 red 3 white is not enough IMO).  Though, they have a few gluten free options as well.   Also I like that they sell it in carafes (1/3 of a bottle) - my kind of establishment.  I love the food so much here that I even bought the cookbook!"}
{"text":"For you beer geeks in Toronto, this is one of the places where you'll find a good selection of craft beer. I recommend asking your server for recommendations so they can help guide you to make the right choice.  I went with their beer flight and had our server choose some Canadian craft beers for me to sample.  If the weather is nice, they have an outdoor patio where you can enjoy your meal with your beverage."}
{"text":"Let's all agree that this place is expensive. Let's also agree that they do a few food dishes right, and the rest are just so-so (and not worth the $$). But I keep coming back here.  It's just a whole lot of fun. The high ceilings, the classic decor, the great location, the busy/noisy atmosphere, the beer selection... Even in the menu's copy there's a playfulness that shows they just want you to have a good time. Just a great place to hang out with friends/coworkers.  Tips: Belgian Frites (amazing and great value) + wings. I brought a date here once. I forgot her name. But I clearly remember the frites.   4 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because a friend was in town at the same time. Place had a fairly substantial crowd for a Monday night so that it wasn't dead when we got there.  Their beer list is pretty comprehensive with lots of foreign selection, but I didn't touch those because they were 30-40% more expensive and I'm a student. I ended up ordering a German wietbier following by a California pale ale. The wietbier was ~$7 for a 500mL pour which was pretty good, and the other was a normal bottle. I didn't get to try the beers that would have set this place apart, but I figured that based solely on my experience that this was a great place for evening drinks that won't break the wallet."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9ish on a Friday night and the place was quite busy.  Excellent wait staff.  Extremely knowledgeable about the products - both beer and food.  Had some different beers than usual.  The food was very yummy - especially the frites.  Nice to site cosy together in a banquette and enjoy the evening.  Love the interior - the light fixtures in the bar area especially."}
{"text":"Had a great time here on our last night in Toronto! We came late-ish on a Monday night and were happy to see they were still open AND they have a late night poutine menu!   We're not from Canada, so the beer selection seemed new and interesting (it was also funny that they were super excited about Stone IPA!) We both got a couple of flights and glasses and the bartenders had great suggestions. They were super nice and funny.   We got poutine that was mexican-y themed. Chicken, jalapenos, cheese curds, sour cream. SO good. I love most iterations of french fries covered in stuff, but even still these were super good. We also got the beer cheese fondue which was AMAZING. The cheese combo was perfect and I could have eaten two orders by myself.   I was skeptical because it looked like it might be an overpriced stuffy place at the bottom of an office building, but it was really a good time."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Very good selection of beers, good food. The hamburger is just great, small though. My wife like the mussels very much. Frittes are spectacular too."}
{"text":"Service was good and the food was good.  I ordered the Hog Pizza and Cheese Fondue.   Everything was really flavorful - especially the fondue (5-stars!).  Not a five star pizza-more like 3-1/2 stars, but the price was fair for the quality of food (and the cool atmosphere).  I gave it four stars overall."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at the Beer Bistro. They have a great selection of beers (of course) and their food is delicious. I've gone here for after work drinks, lunch and dinner. I like the vibe at the bar and in the dining area or patio in the summer. The staff are typically knowledgable. Haven't had a bad experience with a server yet. Always makes great recommendations. I usually order Buffalo Wings or Hog Town pizza to share, both are good and flavorful. If I'm feeling for a fuller meal, I always go with the mussels in white sauce. I don't remember what it's called but it has potato, leek and pancetta. So flavorful! Prefer it over the other ones. Also, their Belgian frites are delicious. Probably my favorite item on the menu!"}
{"text":"The Belgian frites are amazing, cheap and can fill you up!! They also go really well with them beers, but I am not a fan of their tasteless mayonnaise which comes on the side in a small cup so I order doubles of the smoked ketchup - awesome!! The pizzas are something I can get into but the sauce they use is too sweet - I definitely don't like my pizzas sweet. The burger is OK, kinda big n' sloppy. Salmon potato skins are perfect if you don't wanna eat too much, it is very small portion. Beer selection is solid, and generally they cross off the ones they sold out of on their menu so the bartender doesn't have to waste your time going back n' forth checking to see if they have it and telling you they don't like in other local beer speciality bars I've been to. The clientele is mostly suits, especially after 4 or 5 on a weekday (after work) when the place gets extremely busy. Hey, it IS located just a stone throw away from the financial district. The average Joe might not want to interrupt their million dollar conversations, they can get quite snobbish if you don't have a business card. The bartenders might as well be beer connoisseurs, so even if you don't know your beer they can help out greatly beyond what the brief menu description tells you. Just don't come rushing in asking for a Bud Light or Blue, that would make them cringe a bit, gut reaction. They are also ultra friendly even to people who I thought were total jerks. How do they do it?? Food n' drinks always came out in a timely fashion, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Had a great time here...twice!  Great selection on beer.  Loved how they organized it so that you can pick one that suits your flavour palate or the meal you are choosing.  Tried the mussels, which were great! Definitely filling on its own.  The appetizer portion of the duck fat fries was pretty huge.  Of course I finished it!  The pulled pork was just ok.    Loved the atmosphere and the staff were super friendly.  This is a great place to have a late meal on a weekend."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Beerbistro, and maybe those expectations were a little too high, because I was quite disappointed. The decor is nice, but a little dated for my tastes. Maybe it's time for an update?   Beerbistro does deliver on the beer. There were so many beers to choose from, it made my head spin. They have a great selection local brews and ones from around the world. I decided on a beautiful cider (yes, technically not a beer) and my friend had a nice hoppy IPA both brewed right here in Ontario.   For dinner, we had braised beef tacos, the Hogtown flatbread and Belgian fries. My tacos were a bit messy, messier than your usual taco. They were served in hard taco shells, making the saucy braise and refried beans even harder to manage. I thought all the toppings were a little heavy handed with no sort of crunchy or fresh veggies to cut the richness. The Hogtown flatbread was delicious, but delicious in the way that any cured, rich pork product and cheese could muster. Again, the dish was too heavy for my tastes. The Belgian fries were the highlight of the meal. They were fresh, hot and crisp. It came with mayonnaise (as all fries should) and smoked tomato ketchup. Of everything, the ketchup was the one thing that made the greatest impression on me. That says something about how great the ketchup was and how poor the rest of the meal was."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best service I had while visiting Toronto. After looking over the great beer list my finacé and I decided we were each going to get the three sampler beers. It was three samplers for $6. But what beers to get... we decided to leave it up to the excellent bartender/server. We told him what sorts of beers we enjoyed and he brought us back some great choices, most of them were ones we were leaning towards. To go with the the sampler beers we ordered two appetizers, Belgium Frites and some Maki rolls. Both of them were great!  This place was just all around solid, it has a great menu of beer and food and a top notch staff. If you are working downtown or just looking for a place to eat or drink, Beer Bistro is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"We had the suckling pig, frites, Belgian white mussels, schnitzel, and a pretzel. Everything was delicious and we'll certainly be back when in the area. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Oh Beer Bistro! Your duck fat fries and chicken wings are to die for and you have an impressive selection of beers. I'm sold. Wish you weren't located in a different city in a different country than the one I reside in....  They have a pretty cool bar area set up in the kitchen that I would love to eat at next time I visit. From what I could tell you get an amazing view of the chefs creating the magic. If only my date had known about it...If only I had known about it ...maybe next time."}
{"text":"On vacation with my mom and dad, this place is around the corner from our hotel so we thought we would try it ... loved it ! Our server Natalie was great. She made recommendations and even told us about events going on this weekend. Would definitely come back !!!"}
{"text":"Beer bistro has a great selection of Ontario craft brews on tap and you can get an expensive flight (3 small pours for tasting). We sat outside on a nice summer evening and had a waiter who was both very friendly and very knowledgeable about the selection. We very much enjoyed our beer and the ambiance of the patio on the side of the building, as opposed to in front where you only have street traffic to watch.  All of the menu items at Beer Bistro use beer as an ingredient and we felt compelled to try to dessert sampler. The Dragon Stout Skor ice cream was incredible and the chocolate cake was decadent. We choose wisely.  All around, we were highly satisfied with the Beer Bistro."}
{"text":"3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food."}
{"text":"We came in so I could try muscles for the first time and were met with a busy and packed dining room. The hostess kindly gave us the option of sitting at the bar or chefs table overlooking the kitchen. We chose the chefs table and I must say.... IT WAS THE BEST! The chef there answered all my questions and interacted with us the whole night. Their muscles were fantastic (and all the other food we saw going out looked declicious)! The dragon stout ice cream was to die for and the experience was rivaled by no other experience I've had in Toronto. Great job Beerbistro!"}
{"text":"Samuel Adams Utopia @ $20.00 for an ounce and a hall."}
{"text":"The resturant itself is nice and a good patio, the food was good but basic and very over priced for what you get. The service was very good. The beer selection was good and had some interesting varieties.   Location was hard to find when using a map on my phone."}
{"text":"This restaurant gave me food poisoning for two weeks. It was either from mussels or shrimp, which is a shame, since shrimp are my favourite meat. Now, the idea of eating shrimp makes my stomach turn. Service was unfriendly, verging on rude, and the fries, which everyone seemed to be having and which my friend and I ordered, too, weren't great. They just seemed unnecessarily fatty and not very crispy. Also, given the neighbourhood, the clientele is mostly downtown office types. You might like that. I don't. But the beer list is extensive. I'll give them that. It's too bad most of my tall can ended up in the restaurant toilet after the meal. Seriously. I couldn't keep anything down, not even liquid, for more than two days after I ate here - I had to check myself into the hospital - and I had terrible nausea for close to an additional two weeks."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection (obviously) and friendly staff.  The poutine was more on the upscale side and not what I expect from classic poutine, but it was decent.  It's kinda like how California pizza is prissy bs compared to east coast pizza, but you still want it because it's good."}
{"text":"Went here with another couple for an evening snack. Nice variety of beers and really enjoyed the trio on the sampler. The food was utterly disappointing. Do not order the chicken wings - they were dry and had a strong smoky flavor which I despise. The fish tacos had nothing special going on neither did the potato perogies. The belgian fries were probably the saving grace for us! If I go back again, I will most definitely stick to their beers and avoid the food completely."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what is essentially average pub food. I came here for lunch, had a beer and a good enough curry, it came up to about $35. The service was excellent however. Generally I'd prefer to go to a more specialized restaurant and get better food for cheaper. The beer selection was reasonably large, though there are other places with a similarly large beer selection and better food/cheaper prices.  TL;DR nothing bad, but the price isn't worth it"}
{"text":"I've made two recent trips to Toronto and besides the hotel, this is the only place I visited both times. The location is really well placed just up the street from the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Sony Center. Going a little later in the evening we were able to get either seats at the bar or in the lounge area each time. The ambiance is upscale and modern, with a semi-divided bar and restaurant area. The lighting is dark and the decor a bit retro. They also have an open kitchen which I love. Not only is there nothing to hide, but it's like being invited in to their home. A small touch I always appreciate.   The beer selection is interesting and eclectic. I got spoiled by the Rodenbach Grand Cru, as I love sour beers. My buddy tried quite a few including Collective Arts \"Ransack the Universe\" and the BraufractuM Roog, which has \"entirely appropriate notes of ham\". It was smokey, and unpleasant.   The food was absolutely amazing, having tried the Duck Confit Pizza with goat cheese (I'm a complete sucker for goat cheese) and Mushroom Pierogi. Both were excellent and had to be finished despite being completely full.  The bar tenders were also extremely friendly, checking often, joking with us and making reservations. Also, on the second visit, the bar was full but the hostess told us a party in the lounge area was paying and likely leaving. After they finished she put a reserved sign on the table until it was cleaned to reserve it for us. Class move and much appreciated. This was definitely my favorite spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is one of the few American restaurants in Toronto where I can keep going back again and again and never get tired of it. The atmosphere is quite unique too, not just your typical upscale restaurant - it has a hint of a laid back feeling, like you'd want to be in your sweats in front of a fire pit while enjoying the food and beer.   Their mussels are just amazing. Must try!   I've tried quite a bit of their dinner menu dishes, and my top picks are the bistro salad (if you're a beet lover), the hot wild flat bread, and the pork belly. Great portions and they don't cheap out on the amount of sauce/toppings/flavours they include in your food.   There's also beer recommendations beside each food so you know what drinks will compliment what you eat."}
{"text":"I had supper tonight with my pals Franca, Liz and Rona.  Since we met at the Beerbistro, which is one of Gord's favourite places to have a beer, he joined us.  Rona and Liz ordered mussels ... Liz got Belgian White and Rona got Provençal.  Franca ordered a Spinach & Quinoa Salad with shrimp.  Gord ordered a Hog Wild Pizza.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Primanti.  There were fries in  my sandwich.  My sandwich was soooo messy!  We all enjoyed our meals and would get them again.  Kirill, our server, was friendly and took good care of us!  It was a fun evening and it was fun to catch up!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a day and wanted to find a place downtown to eat. Looking through the reviews on Yelp - and the fact I could make an OpenTable reservation - we chose Beerbistro. The menu looked amazing online and there were outdoor seating options available. For a nice May evening, this sounded pretty good to me.  We had an underage person with us, so I had to call the restaurant first to make sure we could still come. We got a table outside and quickly realized the flowers that line the railing had a lot of bugs in them that were flying around. If I were to come again, I would probably think twice about sitting outside unless I was just having drinks. There were also pigeons flying around and a feather landed on one of the plates as we were eating - thankfully it wasn't on food.  The coaster the server put down was for Shillow Beer. The make a Saas on the Side - a brown ale that's advertised as being \"lightly roasty and modestly bitter.\" I ordered this thinking it must be good, but they were out of it. Instead, I went with a La Trappe Tripel from the Netherlands. The description sold me on it: \"Brewed by monks, who focus all of their pent-up energy on beer.\"  I'll be looking for this back home.  Dinner started with a side of Belgian Frites, which were drenched in beef and duck fat and served with a house-made mayo and smoked tomato ketchup. We got two of these for the table and I ate about 2/3 of one myself which was about 1/3 more than I should have eaten. I thought they were good, but the youngster at the table knew something was different with these frites and just couldn't get into them. I think if they had offered a regular ketchup instead of the smoked tomato version (as they did for his burger) and some salt, it would have helped. I personally thought they were pretty tasty, but I could have gone for some salt too - or a side of curry.  Continuing with dinner, I went with a small bistro salad, which was house mixed greens, fine beans, tomatoes, cucumber, and beets with a lemon white beer truffle vinaigrette. The small was plenty big and I didn't quite finish it all, but the flavors all went together very well and the different kinds of beets on the salad were amazing. I almost didn't want to eat it because it was put together and presented so well, but after snapping a few pictures I didn't waste much time getting into this.   Definitely a good choice for our evening meal, and a great way to remember my one night in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Mussels were amazing and the bison burger was decent, beer selection was great too, obviously."}
{"text":"Bar had a great upscale pub feel but is not pretentious. Staff is very friendly and the lamb shanks are amazing. I'll be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Arrived in Toronto late on a business trip and it was one of the few kitchen's still open. Had the poutine for the appetizer which was the highlight of the meal (it was the last one they had). The duck confit pizza was just ok. It was a bit dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. Might have been the late hour that caused the mediocre food.   Beer menu is extensive but nothing rare or special to call out. Restaurant itself was a cool place and I'd defiantly go back for beer and appetizers but would probably pass on a full dinner."}
{"text":"Went here on NYE because we didn't really make reservations elsewhere. It was warm and not overly crowded, we were treated to awesome service. The waiter asked each of us a few questions ad then brought out wha he thought would be the beer we wanted, all four of us were totally satisfied. They have tonnes of beer here and so the best thing to do is just try them out, if you like beer that is. I plan on going back soon with someone I know likes beer. :-)"}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic! I had salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of seasonal vegetables, and the beer menu was awesome.  We also had dessert - the creme brûlée and the ice cream was made from scratch and delectable! the I recommend trying this place if you like good food and great beer."}
{"text":"My MO for TO was to fly from LAX, stay at the King Eddy (Le Meridien), and welcome myself to town with a dinner at Beerbistro, which is right across the street from the hotel.  It's not exactly a healthy choice, but do you really want a kale salad after getting off of a cross-country flight?  Didn't think so.  This place, as expected, has an excellent beer list and has great upscale pub food.  The duck fat fries, also as expected, are legendary.  The service is friendly and there are TVs spattered around the joint, making it a more comfortable place to go solo if you're traveling for work.  Food: 4/5 Value: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for beer and food in downtown Toronto. There are many craft options along with some well known favorites. I had a Blanche de Chambly and a Cherry Berliner from Niagara Oast House Brewers.  In regards to food, we split the potato truffle perogies. These perogies were pan fried to a perfect crisp. They were topped were caramelized onions, fried onions, mushrooms, and scallions. They were delicious.  The service is knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. I would certainly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I like this place alot. More that volo or the biere market. And i like it more because of the food.  First off, they make beer selection a little easier with their categorizaion. And they have a huge huge beer list. But they take it one step further and pair if with your food - that also has beer in it including the icecream.  Everything on the dinner menu is good. Specifically the mussels and i also love their taco, but really everything i'\ve tried there hasn't disappointed - even the flatbreads.  The ambience isn't too bad, however, given the location, their is a high concentration of suits to regular people. The suits unfortunately take over the bar and areas to sit down at and it doesn't help that they've probably been snorting coke for 4 hours. There is a dining room area, but you may have to wait."}
{"text":"This is a lunch stop for me - the food is reliable and there's a reasonable number of selections.  I've never been disappointed by the pizza, the sandwiches, or the salads.  The mussels are also good.  The service is always good. The tables are close together for Toronto and it can be noisy.  The fries are great  to share."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday night. They have a nice outdoor patio space and an extensive beer selection. We found the food to be OK. For the prices, I would have expected more. The duck spring rolls were OK, expensive for what they were. I ordered the New England style mussels which were a bit disappointing. The bread they are served with is hard and cold, and the broth tasted more like a white wine cream. I think it was a beer based broth which was not mentioned on the menu. I have also been sick for 3 days now since. I can't be sure that it was the mussels, but it was the only meal I had on Saturday so....   My BF got the special suckling pig sandwich which was heavy but very good. For $20, it was pricey, but we appreciated the service and flexibility of the server allowing us to change the onion rings it came with to a mix of onion rings and fries that everyone had raved about on Yelp. That was a mistake, the fries are OK. The onion rings are amazing... actually the best we've ever had.   They had a caramel pecan ice cream which I wasn't a huge fan of but my BF liked. It also had a beer aftertaste to it. Overall the meal was OK, I would hope there is better food for the money in Toronto."}
{"text":"Quinoa salad with chicken, czechvar beer, seats on patio, good company... awesome way to spend a Friday."}
{"text":"I understand this restaurant is on king and expected to be pricey- but it is really overpriced for the amount and quality of food you get. Two of us got the brisket hash and not only was it room temperature but also there was barely any brisket. We also got mussels which was in a really good broth. The one star of the meal was definitely the belgian frites, but not good enough to bring us back for brunch."}
{"text":"All soooo good! I had the suckling pig, yummm! Frites, yes please! Awesome, but the two of us couldn't come close to finishing them. Service was great! Attentive, but not smothering us. He would just kind of swoop in at the right time. Would totally go back there as everthing on the menu looked so good. Great for couples and groups."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok.  Not the best...not the worse.  Just be aware if you order a sandwich like a Burger, Brisket, pull pork you will not get any sides.  Therefore, I feel their sandwiches are quite expensive.  A burger for $18 with no sides??  The Burger was just ok and I still think places like Burger Priest is just as good but for 1/2 the cost.  Their brunch is pretty good though."}
{"text":"This place was super busy, but highly overrated. We had a nice server , but food was just ok. The pizza had zero flavor and tasted like a cracker with melted cheese on top. The side options are slim to zero for the entrees. You have to take things exactly as they come. I won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"VIBE There is a rotating door and for good reason. The place is buzzy with a casual mix of the Bay street crowd, locals and I'm guessing tourists from the King Edward Hotel nearby.  Mainly a 28 plus crowd. It's sophisticated yet casual.   The front looks busy (and it is) but the back is a bit more subdued. I'm big fan of that comfy bench in the front. Service is friendly and swift.   WE ATE   Spicy Kobe Beef Tacos  vienna lager chili, aged gouda, grilled vidalia, onions, sour cream & lettuce --they're not super spicy but they have kick. That said, isn't kobe beef supposed to be \"special\" beef? and in other segues I learned in Grade 12 English: Nonetheless, it's tasty. I'm a fan of the soft shell as opposed to a hard shell. They were a tad awkward to eat.   Potato Skins  white beer smoked salmon, house made goat cream cheese, red onions & fried capers .  These were also tasty and a good appetizer to share. If you like salt, there's plenty of it on this dish!   What I do like about this place is that they give drink recommendations for the dishes on the menu. They also have a detailed guide explaining the beers and stamps saying which ones are sold out. It's very practical.   But I did feel a bit rushed to order my drink. I got the Waupoos. A good go-to but it would have been nice to linger over other options.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  It ain't no bistro but it's a great place for a central meet up downtown with decent bites and drinks.  Value for dollar though, two drinks and two appetizers with tax came out to $46. I'm not sure if it was worth that much.  But I do like the place and I'll come back again (as I have before). I think I may get a main next time and test out the \"worth it\" theory. It's not my regular but it's a good \"once in a while\" place."}
{"text":"This place has all the beers you can think of and the staff is very knowledgeable!  Save room for the beer ice cream!  The fondu was creamy and perfect side for the beers.  This place has a great comfortable car area that makes it easy to relax with a group of people."}
{"text":"Went here with a family member and was treated like royalty. Server was extra friendly and answered every question we had about the food/beer/wine menu. Had duck confit pizza and red thai mussels which were absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here for a late post-happy hour snack and had a great time. They have a rather extensive list of beers on tap and in the bottle. This proved to be great because they had two dark beers (a porter and a stout) on Tap and then a Mill St Porter in the bottle.  I had a tasting of three of their tap beers and the Mill St. I really enjoyed the experience.  We then shared a thing of fries. They were really delicious. Not the best I've had, but definitely noteworthy.  We finished it off with their home-made ice cream sammiches. They were pretty good. I will say this though...the best thing about the ice cream guys was the Skor ice cream thingy...if i were to go back again soon, that's all I would order.  Last thing of note is their mussels. It seems to be their forte...we didn't try them, but most tables had them. Give them a try...Yum Yum"}
{"text":"The beer was great, but the food was okay. I came here on a weeknight after work at 5:30 for two with a reservation. Glad i had a reservation because it got super packed shortly after.   DRINKS: I ordered a beer flight for $6. You get to choose three of their huge selection of beers on tap. My favourite was the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, which was very light and creamy and almost coffee-like for a dark beer.   FOOD: We sampled the Belgian Frites and the Hog Wild Flatbread. The frites were great as a shareable item to munch on with your drinks; we also took part in a promotion where sharing a photo of the frites on social media would let you receive them for free! On the otherhand, there was nothing special about the flatbread. It didn't seem worth paying $18 for a regular flatbread, especially when the slices weren't cut in equal parts.   Overall, I would come back here for the oatmeal stout during happy hour, but not for a full out meal."}
{"text":"Beer battered mussels - SO GOOD! I would highly recommend the New England.  Paired with some Chambly (probably not recommended) - but delicious. I was not disappointed in the least, but wished there were more white belgium draught choices.  Love that they have outdoor seating and had free oysters and cocktails when I arrived. Apparently it is a part of some Toronto beer festival going on, lucky me :)"}
{"text":"Cooking with beer; food pairing with beer; and food that is friendly with beer - that is what beerbistro is all about!  Revisited after not having been there in ages and was very please that it is as solid as I remembered. An oldie but goodie, this beer-centric bistro serves up delicious beer-infused dishes that goes great with beer. Even their ice cream has beer in it! The Dragon Stout & Skor bar ice cream is so smooth and rich, you will not see other ice creams the same again   Their beer selection is constantly updated to reflect current beer trends while still maintaining crowd favourites. I got a pint of the Azzaca IPA and a pint of Brooklyn Sorachi ace and they were both excellent. They really do know their beers here.  Overall I think the food and drinks here are quite decent and the pricing is right for a restaurant located at Yonge/King.  Definitely a fan. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I got fries and three beers. All were delicious. I went with three of my friends as well and all of their food and beer was also good. Our server was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful with helping us choose a beer that suited each of our tastes. It was a great place to chill with my friends after a long ride to Toronto from Cleveland. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is by far the best restaurant with a name that references 'beer'.  And is in the worst neighborhood for restaurants in Toronto.  But it is packed on most weekday nights and once you experience Beerbistro, it is not hard to realize why.  The quinoa salad is probably the best I have had anywhere--with green beans, dried fruit and feta mixed in.  Their bruschetta pizza is comfort food with an edge.  The soups are excellent and, to boot, the service at Beerbistro is quietly efficient and friendly.  Beerbistro is probably my first choice in downtown Toronto for dining after work,  and it helps that I can choose to eat healthy or not, with a range that spans french fries and salads, all deliciously made in small batches.  I just made up the 'small batches' part for effect, but does that matter?"}
{"text":"Delicious food paired with delicious beer. The atmosphere was very cool and it was packed at midnight when we went. We're from NY and came here based on reviews and weren't disappointed. I had mahi mahi and it was so delicious. We took the waitresses recommendations for beers and actually enjoyed every single one she brought us. We had great service and an even greater time."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and had a nice time. The service was friendly and prompt, the beer selection extensive and the food hit the spot. I started with a beer flight to find my way, followed by a pint of one of the three tasters. I ordered a steak frittes off the dinner menu, and the kitchen did a great job. If I could only have done away with the annoying dude sitting next to me at the bar who wouldn't shut up about his football team, it would have been a great evening. That's not their fault, so I don't blame them.  Good for beer, food, and casual fun."}
{"text":"Awesome beer, decent steak.  I can't understand why Canadian places can't seem to get \"medium rare\" correct.  Still, a flavorful steak frites, good beer, and fun bartenders.  I'd say 4.5, with a slight deduction for the doneness on my steak."}
{"text":"The area within the establishment is split up into two parts: On one half, a bar area which you walk into when entering and on the other half, a sizeable dining area. It is very open concept. The ceilings are very high and it does look more upscale.   I visited on a Friday night, hoping to try a few excellent beers. By the way, the only reason I came was because this place is called \"Beerbistro\" and I love beer!! Anyways, I had decided on a flight of beers because there were simply too many to choose from. My idea was that of the 3-6 that I try, I will purchase a pint of the one I like to most.   Well...none of them really tasted any good to me. Now, I am not bad at picking out flavours. so it really was unfortunate that all I could taste was either dirt, sand or metal.   If you are going to go here for beer, I suggest you do the same before purchasing a pint of anything new on tap. You may be lucky enough to find something you love but for me, I just didn't have that experience."}
{"text":"This review is my 500th! My rating is 4.5 stars.   A former student of mine, who has become my friend, is doing an eight-month work term downtown. I went on a team event at work and sailed for a couple of hours on Lake Ontario. I ended up being a tourist for most of the day before meeting up with her for an early dinner at 17:00 at Beerbistro.   I went on this restaurant's Web site and decided to book a reservation for us. It was easy and seamless.   It was a muggy, humid day. I went in and was happy to see a bowl of LifeSavers mints. They are my favourite ones. I knew that I would love being here.   My reservation was acknowledged. I got a table in a quaint corner of the restaurant.   I texted my friend to indicate where I was. She was happy that I chose being indoors. The patio looked great, but not when you are sweating buckets!  She came. We hugged. The problem is that I was at a table where it is elevated by a step. I am about half a foot taller than she is, so I joked that it was a tall hug!  We are both foodies. So, we were down trying multiple items on the menu.  Here's our order:  - Beef tallow and duck fat fries - Truffle potato perogies - Beef tacos - Creamsicle cheesecake - Flourless chocolate stout cake - LifeSavers mints - Diet Pepsi   This place is known for its beer and fries. The fries were so flavourful and delicious! I often avoid getting fries when I can, but you do not here!  The truffle perogies were amazing. They were pan-fried crispy, but not to the point where your jaw is tired.  We both agreed that the beef tacos were incredible. It even has fries in them! The fried onions also made them particularly yummy.   I loved both desserts. They were creamy and full of flavour. My friend doesn't like beer, so she wasn't to crazy about the flourless chocolate stout cake. She ended up eating more of the creamsicle cheesecake (it's excellent) and I had most of the chocolate cake. It does have a stout aftertaste. It didn't bother me. I'd order it again! However, if you aren't big on beer in your desserts, skip this one.   We spent three hours catching up with each other. Lots of business folks come by here after work for a drink, so expect folks in suits and business attire. I just wore a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers.   I highly recommend coming here for dinner and drinks. It gets busy, but you can still hear what your friend is saying across the table. The food is worth the visit.   (181)"}
{"text":"A variety of beer selections which was great. I was visiting from NYC and found this place on yelp to grab a quick drink with friends for the night.   Service was a bit slow and the waitress didn't come after she have us our drinks to see how we were doing or of we needed anything else. We had to flag her down a few times which was annoying. We sat by the bar area next to the window."}
{"text":"Great place to chill and have a beer. We saw this place while walking about in Toronto, saw that it had a great beer selection and stopped in. We kept seeing the yummy food being brought out so we ended up ordering food as well. We got the, Belgian Fries, Garlic Butter Mussels and Cheese Fondue. A lot of food for 2 people who weren't even hungry but our eyes were bigger than our stomach. The fondue was a little too much, it was really good, but it was only served with bread, wish they threw in some veggies or something but the cheese was fantastic. You get sick of it fast because you are just eating cheese and bread. Muscles were delicious, very satisfying and went great with IPA beer. The Belgian Fries was also great! A wonderful place to hang and great friendly service!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this restaurant as I pass by it almost everyday.  Surprisingly, a bunch of us wanted to go out for lunch so we decided to sit on the patio.    The patio was nice but there were too many spider webs, which grossed me out for the entire lunch.  I ordered the Bistro salad ($12) with chicken breast (+ $7) but it was so overpriced for the portion and taste.  They gave a 1/4 of the chicken breast and it was overly cooked.  The salad itself was good especially with lots of beets.  We ordered the fries for $6 and they were quite good.  Service was below average -- they were giving attitude and gave us the bill right after we sat down for an hour. They also took the plates without asking if we were done.  The patio was actually pretty empty at that time.  I don't believe I'll go back and even if I do, I'll be sitting inside."}
{"text":"Cool stuff.  I came here based on reviews while wandering downtown after getting out of business trip obligations early, and it was a perfect place for a solo dinner with a couple beers.  The interior is cool, a modern take on a classic bistro look with the same posters and warm ambiance but high ceilings, couch seating at some tables, and cool lighting. Of note: a sweet chef's counter you can sit at in the back that overlooks the kitchen.  Great selection of local brews and cool upscale food, all with suggested beer pairings, or beer in the food! I had a \"devil's puttanesca\" mussel bowl - think mussels made with pasta puttanesca ingredients with a pale ale instead of a white wine. Seriously good mussels, and seriously great broth with extra bread to soak it up delivered upon request. Sweet.  So definitely good for solo dining, and I could certainly see myself here with a smallish group also. Solid work, Beer Bistro."}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite place to grab pints and pints of, the gift the gods have given us, beer.  I came here yesterday with 3 people to grab a pint and maybe catch the Jays game. I didn't realize that this place had an after work crowd and felt slightly under dressed but the bar staff never made us feel like we were. They were the most knowledgeable, charming, and friendly bartenders I've ever encountered. in our fine city. Not only were they able to chat up a storm about beers but they also know how to make killer cocktails.   The decor is very nice inside and feels a little classy with lounge sofas in the bar, dark wood, high vaulted ceilings, candle lit tables, a chef observers bar, large glass windows looking onto King St., endless beers on tap, and a gigantic plasma television at the bar.   The service is exceptional and you are treated like a valued customer and friend not just a number. Jokes and suggestions are often heard from the bartenders and servers alike and this results in a memorable and comfortable experience.   The food is flavorful and the beer pairing suggestions are a nice added touch to the not so typical menu. The typical bar food is found on the menu but with a gourmet twist. Duck confit pizza with stout crust, pilsner burgers, and more. Everything was delicious! I didn't get to try the fries everyone raves about but there's no doubt I'll be back to give them a go.  Overall this is a great place for a date or for a pint as the service and ambiance allows this venue to be so versatile. The prices for pints are respectable as you can get beers that you can't get anywhere else. Prices for food seem a little high but the quality of food and beverage justify it completely. My favorite bar hands down. May be expensive but definitely worth it,"}
{"text":"Beer Bistro was hubby's first choice for his birthday dinner, and not surprisingly so being the beer connoiseur that he is.  Conveniently located near the intersection of King & Yonge, It's a beautful high ceilinged interior with Art deco-ish flourishes. The Hostess was also super friendly and was very accomodating as I specifically booked a small booth/corner and also pushed back our reservation much later than anticipated, but my reservation remained well intact even when we waltzed in 5 minutes late.  The beer menu here is expansive and with choices as exotic as Avery Brewery's Mephistopheles Stout ( at 15.92% alc./vol !!) and Nickel Brook Gluten Free Specialty Grain Beer.  It's evident that they'll be no no Pabst Blue Ribbon to be found here.  I love that the Beer Bistro's menu also suggests a suitable beer for every app or entree and even categorizes it's beer menu by choices like \"Quenching\" , \"Sociable\" and \"Robust\"  To start we order the deliciously crisp Wild Crab Maki Roll  that's battered with pilsner tempura, and hubby orders the Wood Smoked Buffalo Wings that is fruit beer-marinated, with chipotle hot sauce celery sticks, québec blue cheese & leek dip. Hubby compliments his wings with Neustadt Springs Big Dog Porter, which he claims is pleasantly bitter with a hoppy flavour.  For our mains I order the Grilled Atlantic Salmon with wok steamed vegetables & white beer beurre blanc which was mouth wateringly delectable as the buttery veggies with the beer infused Salmon was the perfect balance of light yet decadent. Hubby entree is the Jamacian Goat Curry which is marinated in caribbean stout, tropical fruit salsa & coriander yogurt quinoa served with a bollock kicking scotch bonnet hot sauce which the server assures us is incendiary, but well worth the burn.  Hubby's secondary beer is again from another Toronto brewery Junction Conductor's Craft Ale, which hubby deems as having a lovely, nutty aroma.   The clientele was mainly caucasian which stunned me given that it was downtown, but hubby (who is caucasian) asserts that it shouldn't be surprising as it is a beer-centric eatery. Heck there was even a snappy jazz band by the name of \"The Gene Pool Boys\" playing some hep tunes while we ate.  I realized also that the dress code is certainly relaxed, even for a Saturday night as my Rihanna-esque outfit of a fedora, pleather pants metal spiked stilettoes and silver nails raised many a conservative eyebrow, I just can't help being a clotheshorse yo!   If you want a terrific meal accompanied by an excellent beer selection with an air of sophistication and minus the hoity-toity attitude, the Beer Bistro is definite must."}
{"text":"Beerbistro is definitely a place to check out! I find that a lot of young professionals go here.  1) It's very convenient because it's right beside King subway station.  2) Fancy food - Duck confit pizza anyone?     PRO TIP: They have a Feb frities promotion right now - tweet about the fries and they'll give them to you for free! 3) Lots of drink options 4) Service has always been really quick and polite 5) The space is beautiful! (high ceilings, the walls sparkle)"}
{"text":"From mild to wild. HUGE selection of beer that will appear to different beer lover (or trying to love beer).   I went to check this place with a friend who could dry a bar. I am not a drinker and I am cheap date. But the server was able to find me a beer (sorry I forgot the name) that made me keep my clothes on for the entire night. Me getting drunk is an ugly sight because it rarely happens.   Beer Bistro has a decent menu that will not bore you and your date. I have tried their mushroom pizza and their pasta. It was a pleasant experience.   The ambience was also great. It's a yuppie environment away from college crowd on Bloor. Downside is parking because it's difficult to find parking in the area. But, you're coming here to drink right? Don't drink and drive. Cops are waiting.   Peace."}
{"text":"Cold and fancy atmosphere, the beer list is better than most places in Toronto. Not very expensive prices on beer. They have WiFi on place which sometimes work, sometimes no service. The service seemed ok, we didn't wait to be seated on a Monday evening. However the open space was full already."}
{"text":"If Bay Street finance types don't make you feel ill then this place is worth checking out.  Ample draft selection along with fairly impressive bottle collection. Very high markup, but goes with the neighborhood.  Top 5 burgers I've had in my lifetime and I'm an overweight man who has spent years in SF and NYC. So, yeah. Very nice juicy medium rare that worked well with the homemade American cheese (btw not Kraft singles like when the Americans use the term).  I'm no connoisseur in terms of coffees but their espresso is not stellar, but I would say remarkable.  Friendly, attentive (but not overly so) service and if you're conscious about prices you can have yourself a fantastic dining experience for a reasonable amount.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Based on last years' visit - Great beer selection, delicious duck fat fries and mussels. Highly recommended. Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... service and craft beer variety is a 4 star.  The food... it had some gaps sadly.  Those duck fat & beef tallow fries ... Amaaaazing.    Beer bistro has been known to be for a while.  If you think the craft beer halls is all new, you need to know that Beer Bistro has been around 10 years and serving up craft beers from around the world since then.  Ground zero would be here.  The space is quite large with a huge vaulted ceilings and a large patio off to the side.  I would say it reminds me of a nice upscale bar.  Casual but not your neighbourhood spot.  There is a bar area with a few large big screens.  So if your date is wanting to watch the hockey game and pepper you non stop with questions, you got your spot.  There is also an open kitchen into the dining room so you can watch your food being created.  Service here is great... on point, always available, and pleasant.  They're incredibly well informed on the many beers that is found in their encyclopedia.  She was able to help tell us which beers wouldnt be our favourite knowing that what we liked.  They always checked in on us and kept our smaller table clean of used plates.  As for their beers... good god, the book was insanely long but thankfully detailed in highlighting key tasting notes.  I loved how they have many different types locally but also internationally.  I also really liked how a lot of these craft beer were so affordable... none of these crazy $14 per glass for a Toronto craft beer.  Rather we found good Collective Arts ones for only $7.50.  I love this and I hope they continue this.  Hog wild flat bread - You can smell the bacon and bbq sauce as it passes your table.  Thats what made us order this one.  It's a nice size for an app... good to share among a few people.  The taste was ok... the bbq was a typical sweet sauce with not a lot of zing or flavour.  The meat on it was a touch dry and not sure cause it was dried out in the oven.  The base was really dry and with no flavour.  It was more like a dried out biscuit.  It's decent bar food.  3/5  Truffled potato pierogies - Another shareable app with crisped up pierogies with a few toppings.  The inside of the pierogies was a lot but not a lot of flavour.  It was just a lot of mashed unsalted potatoes.  I didn't taste any truffles or mushroom flavours through the dish.  Visually it was appealing but not sure if there was more to it.  3/5  Spicy Red Thai mussels - A generous cast iron pot arrives to your plate and it's filled with plump and hot mussels.  Not a single one was closed or had broken shells.  That was very good to see.  There was enough broth on the bottom to soak up the sauce but for the beginning, it was so hard to try to get the top mussels any flavour because you couldnt just dig down to the bottom easily.  It would have been great if they could toss all the mussels into the sauce before serving.  First world problems.  Maybe Spicy Red Thai was the wrong flavour to get but this was not spicy... I wouldnt even say it was mild or even Thai.  No ginger, galangal, or spices that reminded me of Thai mussels I had at Kiin.  So maybe go for the other broths instead.  3.5/5  Belgian Frites - THIS... is what you come for.  The beef tallow and duck fat fries are just so good.  Possibly one of my favourite in Toronto so far.  Tried Wvrst and Bellwoods which are considered other top Toronto fries and Beer Bistro is the clear winner.  Every fry is super hot, crispy, doused in salt, and nicely bronzed.  This was just well executed and they give you a huge cone of it!  Just delicious... Beer and Fries at Beer Bistro.  Hell ya.  I didnt even use the sauces they gave me cause it tasted good on its own.  4.5/5  Not sure if the kitchen was off that day but clearly they got some things done well.  Those fries are amazing.  I have to give credit to the staff... just attentive service from a bar is always good to me.  Definitely a good spot to try a variety of beers without feeling the hipster judgement."}
{"text":"I am glad I did some research on different restaurants while visiting Toronto, because I found this great restaurant.  The beer selection was really good - even if most of the drafts couldn't be served that night due to a malfunction of their cooler.  The bottle selection and the food made up for it!    We started with the Belgium Frites and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I guess we don't get duck fat fries much in the States.    For my main course I had the Hog Wild Pizza based off our servers recommendation and it was delicious!!    The service was excellent and they kept coming back to check on us.   If you are a beer drinker and like good food, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place after walking by it on multiple occasions. I wasn't disappointed. The appetizer, Blanche de Chambly Cured Smoked Salmon, was delicious. Even though some items on the menu tend to be a little pricey, catering to the Bay Street crowd, the beer selection is to die for. They have one of the BEST selections of beer in the city. On tap and in bottles. You can come here 20 times and you'll still have plenty of beers you would not have tried. I'm definitely going to come back to this place to try another beer and maybe a pizza or one of their mussel dishes."}
{"text":"I'd will have to return to this place in order to do a better review, as my first time here was only for a couple of pints and an appetizer. I'm sure I'm beating a dead horse here with my review so I will repeat what most people are saying.  There is a large selection of beers in a wide (and I mean wide) variety of flavours. What I like about this place is that they sort their beer menu by the type of beer that it is (stoud, wheat, ale, etc.). This makes it extremely easy to quickly find a beer you like. There are a large amount of draught beers too which is nice. I ended up having two pints which were very nice, one being an apricot aroma beer which was very smooth.  As per a recommendation I had their fries. They remind me of a chip truck style of fry, with some type of sea salt. I would put them in the upper echelon of fries I've had, and they were served with two sauces; a ketchup type of bbq and some kind of mayo. Both were very good.  There is a nice patio (50 people maybe) nestled in between two buildings which helps to form a sound barrier away from the traffic.I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this place when I'm in the area and want to try some new beers."}
{"text":"I always love Beer Bistro - this is somewhere we go whenever we aren't sure what we want. I've been here many times. Beer Bistro has an awesome beer selection, and the food is consistently good. However, this is not really a hardcore \"foodie place\". I would call this a bar with pretty good food and awesome beer.    One of my favourite dishes here are the New England Style mussels. This is served almost as a clam chowder broth, but with mussels. It has big pieces of bacon, potatoes, cheese and other deliciousness. Their mussels are served with Beer Bistro's house made sourdough. The serving is massive, and nothing beats sopping up the sauce with that delicious bread.   I also really enjoy their spicy beef tacos. It's actually an appetizer, but I like to get it with a side salad to make it a full meal. The beef is tender and flavourful, and it's served in a crispy taco with cheese, caramelized onions and sour cream. The tacos always stay crispy. This is a really satisfying dish.   I really haven't had anything I don't like at Beer Bistro. I love their pizza (their hog wild pizza is to die for), burgers and fries.  I haven't even talked about the beer yet. The beer menu is huge, so take some time to read through. There is a lot of beer on tap and in the bottle. The menu can be really intimidating, but the servers always provide awesome recommendations.    The only thing I will say is that the decor is really dated. However, they're currently renovating! I can't wait to see what it looks like."}
{"text":"Went for a bite at an awkward time on Sunday, between lunch and dinner. Had the duck fat fries and buffalo chicken wings, neither of which were great. Would have been okay, but the service was just plain rude. She was stunned that we didn't want to order alcohol and was visibly impatient as we placed our orders.  By far the worst service I've ever received at any restaurant.  Food: 2/5 Service: 0/5 Ambiance: 4/5"}
{"text":"I love their wide selection of beers! Conveniently on King St. They have a lounge section and a restaurant section. My friend and I sat at the bar. I got the Zodiac 3x and shared some frites with a friend after work one night. Noise level isnt loud so you can have conversations at the table without yelling across. One of the better places to chill after a long day at work."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place and would definitely come back again! The mussels were amazing, and I easily had the best porter I've ever had. It's a little cramped so probably not the greatest for large groups, but it's great for small get togethers. The staff, most importantly, were attentive, friendly, and awesome all around."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that I haven't written a review for this place yet. I go here so often, and it's a favourite. Unless you want to hang around a very crowded bar, don't go without a reservation - even on weekdays!  Service has never been an issue. Fantastic beer selection I am told by my husband. I don't like beer very much, so I get the fruity strawberry version of it which I enjoy - it's called Fruili.   Always good food. Never been disappointed. Whether it's the beef tacos or fries to start, the mussels or drunken mushroom pizza, the meat filled pizza, butter chicken with rice, grilled chicken - always delicious. I htink for dessert I've just tried the creme brule, and it's good but I don't like the hint of orange in it (that's just a personal preference).  If you ever go for breakfast, do try their version of Eggs Benny served on hash brown instead of bread, and look out for their beer version of mimosa (well priced).  This place is crowded and noisy, so don't expect a quiet or romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"I Really liked this place!!.. Everything there was delicious, and the service was very friendly... This place has a great atmosphere!,..  All dishes are made with beer which I really enjoyed!!.. The mussels were delicious!!.. But for me the best thing are The French fries!!.. They are AWESOME!!.. The best I have had in a long time!!.. I would go back to this place just to have the fries again!!..  It is also in a great location!!"}
{"text":"Bread was stale, fries were not hot, nor were they any better than everyday fries at a burger joint. Certainly nothing like the glorious experience they describe on their website. Lots of burnt bits too. We had mussels which were fine. Beer was good, though expensive.  We won't be hurrying back. All hat and very few cattle."}
{"text":"I was here with my friend on an unusually balmy day in September.  Although the server was super nice, he didn't check on us in a timely manner. The soda with lime I ordered was flat and not very cold, but I was thirsty and I couldn't flag him down to replace it. (I was in the restroom when it arrived) He did check on us a minute after the food arrived, but that's far too early for us to even taste anything.  I had to flag him down about 15 minutes in to ask for another drink and try the 'famous' bread.  The bread reviews are much ado about nothing in my opinion.  It's ok, but nothing special.  I suppose it's great if you use it to sop up the mussel juices.  My friend had the salmon which was very good. I had the special of the day - pickerel. He recommended it, so I usually trust the server. Although the skin was nicely crisp, I found it dry, over cooked and the filet was pretty small. (Pickerel is my favourite fresh water fish so this was a real disappointment)  I know, I know... their reputation is based on a great beer selection, mussels & duck fat fries, which neither of us had. Maybe this review would be totally different if we had the aforementioned.  A couple positives -   the food was piping hot & the Bistro salad was amazing.  Other than that, I wouldn't come back unless I was in the mood for mussels"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for dinner tonight around 7 pm and dined on the patio. We were by far the youngest people there and I feel like we got treated poorly for it.  I am 7 and a half months pregnant and obviously can't drink but there was no non alcoholic beverages anywhere on the menu. Being a server myself I know what it's like when someone just orders water. I explained that I was pregnant and asked if they had any mocktails. The server seemed irritated by the question and answered with \" uh... Shirley temple...\" My fiancé ordered the sampling of beer and then I asked if they had any flavoured San pellegrino. He answered with the same enthusiasm \"no... Just regular\". Not knowing/given any other option I just got a water.   We ordered the Belgian frites and bistro salad add goat cheese to start. The apps came out quickly and both were delicious. I had to stop the server to ask for more water and then asked for a juice and soda water mix. He seemed irritated again that I had asked for more water after I said thank you for the water he just placed it on the table and walked away.   Our mains came out in good time. I ordered the braised rabbit ravioli and my fiancé ordered the duck confit pizza. I asked the blond women who dropped our food off for some cracked pepper but didn't get a chance to ask her to remove the empty frites container before she hurried off. I get being busy but she passed us another 3 times (empty handed) and never brought the cracked pepper. Our server returned with the second beer my fiancé ordered about 5 minuets later and I asked him to remove the empty frites container and mentioned that I had asked the women who dropped off the food for cracked pepper but she must of forgot. It didn't seem like she had told him about it either.  Our mains were very good. Pizza was perfectly seasoned and had the perfect ratio of ingredients. The ravioli was perfectly cooked. I loved the sauce and the rabbit.   Our server returned and asked if I'd like to look at the desert menu. I said yes. By this time he seemed to have warmed up towards us. We ordered the stout and skor ice cream and the crème brûlée. Both were on point. My favourite was the crème brûlée, very creamy and the cooked sugar wasn't burnt which sometimes happens when done too quickly. The server asked if I wanted water this time. I said yes but unfortunately never received it.   We asked for the bill and received it quickly (I hate waiting around when I am done eating). I tipped the server 20 percent, as I know about tip out and I believe in tipping karma, but mainly because I wanted to prove we did belong there.   The food was delicious enough for us to come back but I truly hope our next experience is better. If I wanted to be treated like I don't have money and I'm wasting someone's time I would of gone to mc Donald's."}
{"text":"We had the cheese fondue to start the evening off with a couple of great German beers. The special of the night was suckling pig served on a bed of kale on the side was red cabbage compote. This was very tasty. Portion could have been a bit bigger. For dessert I ordered crème Brule and my hubby had the sticky taffy both were very tasty. Service was EXCELLENT!! the staff know their stuff and are all very friendly. Large points for the service here. Décor is nice clean and modern looking."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, but I'm taking one away because my friend and I couldn't shake off the negative attitude of the hostess the whole meal.  We entered the revolving doors around 5pm and the hostess gave us a weird look, y'know the WTF look, and we stared expectantly back until I broke the silence, \"Hi\" \"Uh, hi.\" \"Um, can I get a table for 2 please?\"  \"Oh. You want a table? Okay. Sure.\" I mean, of course I wanted a table, why else would I be here? Yes I look like a teenager but that shouldn't affect the service I receive. Ugh. Pet peeve. At that point I considered just walking out but this place was bookmarked for both of us so we stayed.  The server completely turned our meal around though, he was really nice and spoke to us like he would friends.  My friend got the grilled salmon on top of rapini and cauliflower gratin ($22). I only got a bite of the gratin but it was damn good. I got the duck confit pizza ($17) and it was SO good and rich. The duck was shredded and tender, the sweetness from the caramelized onions balanced out the saltiness of the goat cheese, and the potatoes were soft while the dough was crispy.  The waiter coyly slid the dessert menu onto our table and we couldn't help but get the creme brulee ($8) to share. This is by far my favourite creme brulee because they use a wide ramekin, resulting in a thinner custard base and a whole lot more of the caramelized sugar, which I find is the best part.   I do want to come back to try the belgian frites, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough about this bar.  The beer selection is outstanding, with local, domestic, and international beers.  The prices were generally reasonable, and they offered some high-quality, more rare beers as well.  The servers are very knowledgeable and friendly.  We had a great time here, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After going to Bier Mart for brunch without doing any beer tasting, the adventure inner me feel like I have been deprived. I want to go somewhere for some decent food (Bier Mart though has an impressive beer menu, but I was not impressed with their food) and some beer tasting, that's how I ended up at Beer Bistro.   My Yelp Drinking Buddy was impressed the moment he stepped inside the Beer Bistro. Friendly staffs, great beer selections, tasty food, classy yet casual atmosphere... oh and the Patio!!!   Our waitress was so patient and help us pick our 6 beer tasting selections. I am not a real beer expert and I could not even pronounce the name of the beer correctly... but it was an enjoyable experience!   We have the Spicy Kobe Beef Tacos ($13) to share. It was a little disappointing.. so disappointing that my YDB even forgot he ate that. It was either spicy or the Kobe beef just tasted like regular beef??   Belgium White Mussel ($16.95) which I really enjoyed. Light and creamy and not overpowering, really bring out the freshness of the mussels... I LOVE mussels!!   Flourless Chocolate Cake ($9) was so good, that my YDB ended up licking the plate.. yes he really used his tongue.... hmmmm   Beer Bistro is a great restaurant for casual dinner with friends where you can hang out over a pint or a romantic dinner with someone specials... But for me, I would definitely be back for a drink or to either at the bar or on the patio!"}
{"text":"I think of this place as a restaurant with an excellent beer list, not a beer bar with excellent food. Either way, you can't go wrong. Taps can be a little uninspired sometimes but the bottle list is always a solid backup. I especially appreciate their cellar-aged/rare beer selection for the odd time you feel like spending $25 on something really unique. It would be nice if they had more west coast American IPAs (Green Flash, Ballast Point, Stone, Bear Republic, etc...) but I think that's probably more the fault of the LCBO than anything."}
{"text":"Delicious mussels (Belgian white) comparable to smoked and cracked (which I often compare to as having the best mussels). Saturday feature suckling pig was dry, but it was apparently because they forgot to coat with jus, after the waiter did that for us it was delicious. Good evening atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I think the rave reviews led to me having especially high expectations for this place. Came with one other person on a Thursday, and shared some of their most popular dishes: duck fat frites, New England style mussels, and crab cakes. Nothing was bad, but also nothing was really amazing. The duck fat frites, which are SUPER popular (both of the tables on either side of us also ordered this) were good, but I think I've had better/more fragrant ones at other places. These were basically just like regular fries. The mussels also were good - the broth was tasty and flavourful without being too salty, and there was a good portion of mussels. I wasn't a huge fan of the crab cakes because I found them slightly spicy and really they were just mediocre. Beer drinkers can rejoice though because they do have a very large selection of beers with some really unique ones."}
{"text":"Fantastic Beer Selection, Food Mediocre  The beer selection, as you would expect is awesome. They probably had (guess) 20 beers on tap, and another 100 in a bottle.   I grabbed quick dinner and a beer before the hockey game. We got seated at the chefs table, which is normally a win in my books. The food wasn't all bad, but a couple things threw me off: (1) my burger bun was still a little frozen. The fact that it was frozen in the first place was a little off putting. (2) the packet they served the fries in made them steam, which made for not great fries after the first few handfuls.  Net, net: good place to grab a beer with one or two people, but food is meh and not that cheap."}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow.  Have you ever seen a 40 page menu filled exclusively with beers?  Of course not, that is why you are reading this review trying to decide if you should go here or not.  The short answer is: definitely.  Close your browser, put your shoes on and go now, hurry.  The 40 page menu is likely to make even the most experienced of beer drinkers drool with excitement.  It contains so many different beers that some are exclusive to Beer Bistro in Toronto.  But this place is more than just beer, and by that I mean they have some of the best muscles I ever had in Toronto.  What's better?  Well they tell you what kind of beer to get to complement your muscle dish.  I think that is a pretty sweet deal and it goes for everything on their food menu.  Every item has a suggested beer type to go with it so that you can enjoy the dish (and the beer, especially the beer) that much more.  I strongly suggest you read the recommended food/beer combinations because it will really make your experience that much better.  Anyways, I've wasted enough of your time making you read this.  The best way to find out is to try it for yourself, so do it!"}
{"text":"This place has the ambiance of a hotel bar. They have a little patio off to the side. The beer selection is pretty good and the drinks are pretty cheap for Toronto. The pizza was fine, sort of reminiscent of California Pizza Kitchen.   I wasn't impressed with the fries. Maybe New York has tastier ducks than Toronto? I found them salty, which is funny, since another review says they werent salty at all. Maybe it depends on the night. But the Chipotle ketchup was a good touch."}
{"text":"Was ok. Beer selection is good.  Had the fries which were great as well as some wing. Wings were really really spicy. Server was friendly and efficient. Wasn't terrible but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the beer selection was excellent if not intimidating in how large it was.   I had the chicken curry which tasted great, although the bread (naan?) was unexpectedly crispy and not fluffy at all, and the chicken had bones that had to be picked through. But otherwise the spice and flavor was great.   My fiancé had steak frites which she enjoyed and the fries were excellent.   Other reviews mention how loud it is in here, which is very accurate - it's not impossible to hear the person you are with but you do need to speak a little louder than usual."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn, because we had one amazing dish and one not so amazing dish. First I'll say that the Hog Wild Pizza was so good that I would go back to this establishment just to eat it. It is pizza with bacon, pulled pork, roasted garlic, mozzarella and bbq sauce; so good. The not so great dish was still good but didn't meet our expectations. We had the suckling pig that is roasted each Friday. It was a bit dry, but with some added bbq sauce still good. I'll be back for that pizza though."}
{"text":"The chicken curry I got was extremely dry. Despite the overprice they are charging, the food quality and service I got was not on par with the pricing at all. I was politely asking the waiter for the bread that other table was getting, and I was offered with attitude and a disgusted look on the waiters face. Will never come back again"}
{"text":"I get knocked, down but I get up again You're never gonna keep me down  I only wanted to drink a beer drink (not a whiskey drink, not a vodka drink) but the first time I came here there was no room at the inn so I had to look elsewhere.  However, that didn't stop me and the second time I tried...success!  Started with the Potato Skins-white beer smoked salmon, housemade goat  cream cheese, red onions & fried capers. OMG! They were great.   My amigo had the Hog Wild Pizza-berkshire pulled pork, smoked sausage, beer-cured bacon, oregano, mozzarella, garlic confit.  Delicious.  I had the steak frites (which was superior to the meal I had at Hawthorne).  Service was good.  It wasn't that crowded so it was quiet (although we were probably loud).    Beers were nice but I'd had my fill for the day so mostly drank water.  Yeah, I like this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were going out to the ballet one evening and when I met her at king station she asked where I wanted to eat. We looked around and decided on this cute little classy restaurant across the street called the \"Beer Bistro\" at first I didn't realize the name but went in and took a seat.   The atmosphere of this place was very upscale but yet chill even to hang out there after a long day in the office. The bar was packed with business men and women enjoying a variety of beer this lovely place had to offer.  Our waiter was fabulous, out of this world with his knowledge, personality and how he efficient he was throughout our experience. We decided to order 2 peach flavoured beer's to set the mood. I order the Hog Pizza which is usually a man's lover being topped with many different type of meat. My friend ordered the mussels with the sweet chili sauce. I was impressed that their mussel order came with a variety of options for seasoning. I am not a seafood eater and haven't been to many seafood restaurants but I thought that was kinda neat. We also ordered the beer battered fries to start and they were cooked to perfection. My pizza was nice and thin and just the perfect amount to not feel overly stuffed or hungry and the end of it. My friend also enjoyed her meal saying they were extremely flavourful.   I would definitely return when I'm in the area. It seems like a pretty hot spot. The food was great, the service was exceptional and the atmosphere made you feel welcomed. What more could anyone want."}
{"text":"Went during the afternoon on a Tuesday. Atmosphere was relaxed, smart-casual dress. Even in cutoffs and a tank top the service was fast and friendly. Beers ranged from the 7 to 10 dollar price range. I didn't get any food but the beer selection was great.  Lots of regional and Canadian brewerys."}
{"text":"Come for the beer selection, stay for the food!  Beer Bistro has a very accessible menu, even for the non-beer drinker.  I had the steak frites which were incredible.  My wife (not a beer drinker) had the cheese & lager fondue and the grilled stuffed chicken breast which were also fantastic.  Overall a great experience.  Great, friendly service with a very knowledgeable staff.  The staff are passionate about their jobs in general and beer in particular.  They can make some great beer recommendations for you."}
{"text":"Yes, an incredible selection of beers, but the food is good too. Chicken curry, pulled pork sandwich and roasted fig pizza are all very good. Do not miss out on the frites!  Accommodating servers and convenient location make this a spot to visit again."}
{"text":"Pro: Great location, nice selection of beer, reasonable pricing, and awesome mussels (I've tried the first two mussels on the menu, and they're both amazing. My goal is to try them all). We also tried a few appetizers, I can't recall the names but they're all delicious. Con: Most servers look tired (we arrived around 7pm on a Thursday). Steak and frites (the last thing on their dinner menu I think) is not as good as the mussels."}
{"text":"As visitors to Toronto we were looking for something close to the hotel, good food, and most critically for my wife - somewhere gluten friendly for her severe allergy. Beer? Gluten friendly? Not likely combinations, but the great staff were able to figure it out easily. The duck fat fried fries were GF in a GF fryer. The mussels were modified using a white wine - amazingly good. My daughter and I tucked into the beer and cheese fondue - deep flavours that had us cleaning the bowl. We wrapped it with some great salads and a creme brûlée to call it a night. The service was spot on, the food (and beers for me) were great and the GF accommodation left us feeling like a return visit - not like an inconvenience. See you again Beerbistro!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the fries only. Months later, I still dream about the fries. Belgian-style. Fried in duck fat. Excellent portion. What more can you ask for?  Extensive selection of beer. What's great is you can try any 3 draft beers for $6 for 4 oz pours. Mussels were nothing memorable, though the sauce was perfect with the delicious complimentary bread.  We hung out in the bar area, which had comfortable seating and fantastic service. This was a short stop for us, just a quick bite and beer, so we didn't get to try the rest of the menu. But I would definitely stop for the fries if I'm in the area. And some beer."}
{"text":"Had a great experience sitting at the Chef's table viewing the kitchen and interacting with the culinary team. I highly recommend it if it's available. Food was great and service was excellent. All in all a great recommendation if you're looking for good food in an energetic and upscale environment!"}
{"text":"A nice and quiet dinner spot. We ventured here our first evening in Toronto. We weren't that hungry so we had appetizers. The bf and I shared the Belgian Frites, of course! It was pretty big to share between the two of us. They were perfectly fried and we enjoyed the ketchup it came with, tasted like a smoky flavored ketchup which was delicious! The mayo-like dip was just alright. I had the small caesar salad (house-made caesar dressing, maple bacon parmesan crisp, bacon fat croutons) and it was amazing! Loved the little bits of maple bacon in there. The size was just right. My bf had the spicy kobe beef tacos and he enjoyed them. I had a taste of it and I liked them as well! The beef and seasonings are complimented each other. We washed them down with beers and it completely satisfied our appetites!"}
{"text":"Beer Bistro is tucked in the corner of Yonge and King, and I remember the first time I was here, I had difficulty locating the restaurant. It's easy to walk right by if you don't know that it's there.   Onto the food. We ordered a whole bunch of things to share  Cheese and lager fondue- aged cheddar, emmental and hacker-pschorr edelhell. This fondue was disappointing compared to the ones I had from Bier Markt. First of all, the baguette was unremarkable and bland. The melted cheese was only lukewarm when it came out. As well, I thought the cheese had a grainy texture and wasn't as tasty as the one from Bier Markt. After we were done with the baguette, there was still a lot of cheese left in the pot.  New England Style Mussels: steamed in beer broth with beer bacon, leeks, potatoes, cheddar, parsley vienna lager and a touch of cream. The mussels were served with a loaf of freshly baked Cantillon Sourdough, which tasted a lot better than the baguette that came with the fondue. The mussels were definitely a pleasant surprise.The broth, in particular, was wonderfully flavourful, perhaps a little salty on its own, but perfect for bread dipping and accompanying the mussels. My mom was prying out every last piece in the pot.   Belgian frites: blanched in beef and duck fat, and served with house-made mayonnaise and smoked tomato ketchup. Of course, the fries here are a must-order. For $6, you get a heaping portion of very delicious fries, and these are my favourite in the city! They are also probably the best valued item on the menu.   Lobster Quesadilla: I enjoyed the combination of leeks, sweet peppers, corn, smoked cheddar, basil and cilantro stuffed in a tortilla shell. Of course, the avocado salsa and gueuze-soured cream were excellent accompaniments as well.   Applewood smoked back ribs: grilled apple, arugula salad and roasted garlic mash. I was quite happy with these ribs, and they were almost fall-off-the-bone tender. The sauce was appropriately sweet and added a smokey punch to the flavours. However, the roasted garlic mash potatoes were really awful! It was dry, chunky, and bland. In the end, we left most of it on the plate and finished everything else.   Rocky Road Ice Cream Sandwiches: coffee porter ice cream, homemade marshmallows and walnuts, sandwiched between two stout brownie cookies. You can definitely taste the beer in the ice cream, and I really enjoyed chewing on the walnuts and marshmallows folded into the ice cream.   To sum up, Beer Bistro had hits and misses. The Belgian frites, the mussels and the ice cream sandwiches were the high points of the meal. On the other hand, I would definitely stay away from the black cod and fondue in the future. That said, I look forward to coming back and trying out the other varieties of mussels."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing mussels. Must try!"}
{"text":"Danny and I had decided to take a weekend trip to Toronto, and friends of ours who now live there made reservations for a group dinner with us here. We had originally planned to go to Gabardine, but unfortunately they had no space for a group of 5. We arrived on time for our 8:30 reservation, but our table wasn't ready yet. We waited by the bar for about 15-20 minutes until our table was ready, and were comp'd free Belgian fries for our troubles. Very good finger food (no wonder; they're cooked in duck and beef fat, yum!). Looking over the expansive beer menu made me ever sadder about being on antibiotics; I couldn't taste any of them! The food menu was another bit of disappointment; it included a LOT of seafood, which I don't really eat (partially because of my own tastes, but also because Danny is allergic). I ended up going with the Hog Wild Pizza, which included all things pig (bacon, sausage, pulled porc), mozzarella and garlic confit. It was pretty good; a nice balance of savoury and salty, with a hint of sweet from the garlic confit (I'm assuming). For dessert, Danny and I shared the S'mores mug. It was a good meal, but fell a little short of my expectations unfortunately.   The next morning I really regretted the garlic confit because of the tidal wave of nausea that ensued."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  Beer Bistro is like an upscale Sunset Bar and Grill (for those of you that don't know, it's a restaurant in good ol' Boston that has a million different beers).  Located directly across from our hotel (King Edward) how could we NOT go?   Started off with the Belgian frites with house made mayo and smoked tomato ketchup.  Oh.My.Goodness.  They were delicious!!! A little on the salty side but I couldn't stop shoving them in my mouth.  Joe and I decided to share entrees instead of getting our own.  So we ordered the following:  Cheese Nacho Mussels - Yes you heard right, instead of using chips for nachos, mussels are substituted.  Oh man was it good.  Every mussel bowl is cooked in beer broth and they have about 7 different options.  I had never experienced mussels quite in that way before, but I really enjoyed it.  Duck Confit pizza - OH YES.  Made with Oatmeal Stout to create a beautiful crust, served with goat cheese, thyme, caramelized onions and sliced potatoes I'm contemplating taking the next flight to Toronto JUST to have this pizza again.  Everything about this pizza was magnificent.  I LOVE duck confit and I LOVE goat cheese so when I saw they had this on the menu, it wasn't even a QUESTION that we had to order it.  The entire menu looks delicious and I seriously wanted to order everything on the menu.  For my drink I got a Strawberry beer and it was really good.    The atmosphere is really sleek and there is even an outdoor patio which is nice.  Our waitress was nice however kind of slow.  But I didn't mind too much considering our hotel was right across the street.   I would come back in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Toronto.  It will take a lot for me to try something besides the Duck Confit pizza though..."}
{"text":"Although the food was pretty good and beer selection was great, the vibe wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be more hip but coming here on a Saturday evening for dinner was mainly an older crowd (I'm in my early 30s) for some reason so that threw me off. Nothing wrong with older crowd, I just for some reason thought it would lean more towards...\"party/chill/fun\" but I guess we are in the Financial district so...lol Good for beer selection, if you're hungry it's a bit pricey, more a \"serious older crowd\" vibe but totally legit. Just not my scene (based on it being called \"Beerbistro\")"}
{"text":"Love all you can eat frites.... Just that with drinks can fill me up!!!!  Tried their winterlicious lunch menu. It's quite good!!"}
{"text":"I took my fiancee here the day I proposed, and we had a wonderful meal. The menu options were unique and intriguing, and our choices were delicious. As you might imagine, the beer list is impressive, and our server recommended some excellent pairings to go with our food. She even gave us a free bottle of very good Belgian beer with our dessert because it was a special day for us!  My only criticism is that the big screen TVs showing sports make it seem a little less classy when you enter; however, once you're sitting in the dining section, you don't notice them at all."}
{"text":"Incredible service! We had a group of 8 and were all so impressed with how great our server was. It was a friend's birthday and they let us split his birthday dessert among everyone. I had the seafood linguini and loved the sauce and pasta. The atmosphere was also great for dinner on a Monday (note, haven't experienced it on the weekends, but I hear it gets busy!). Great way to start the week. Would definitely go again. :)   Also - lots of beer options as one would expect!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back (3-4 times now) because the selection of bars serving decent beers in this area was low, and every time I come, it never fails to disappoint at being barely mediocre. For a place called \"Beerbistro\" their selection is laughable and sad, their servers don't know much about beer at all and it is not cheap. Some of the more interesting ones are almost always out too. Food is greasy and expensive, service is quite inattentive.  I hope I don't end up back here again anytime soon; such a waste of money..."}
{"text":"I've been to Beerbistro a number of times and absolutely love the place! The beer selection is fantastic and all of the food I've tried has been super tasty. The waitstaff is incredibly knowledgeable about the beer - when my friend was having trouble picking, our waiter asked a few quick questions, chose something for her, and she loved it!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday this past weekend. The environment was cool and trendy and the service was good.  It kind of reminded me of Bier Markt. I'm not much of a beer drinker but for the occasion I just ordered the lightest beer on the menu.   I was very indecisive about what to order for food because everything on the menu was pretty expensive and not too many healthy options.  I decided to have a screw it night and my friend and I shared the fries, a meal sized cesar salad and the duck confit pizza.   The fries were UNREAL! Too good, duck fat really makes a huge difference. It was also a big portion and a good price. The salad was good but tasted like any other cesar salad and was pretty small for a $13 meal sized salad. The pizza was delicious as well but I had to pick off all the goat cheese on top but that was my bad for not reading that on the menu. Oh well!  Overall a cool experience, would I come back? probably not. No negatives I just like eating at restaurants where I can order something decently healthy like a chicken dish or a good salad."}
{"text":"To be honest, don't expect the waiters/waitresses to know much about their beers. Their automatic reply is for you to \"check the menu for food pairings.\" Yeah okay, thanks.  The food USED to be pretty good, but somehow it's gotten quite salty (especially the fries).  I really enjoyed their rabbit pasta from a long-ago menu. The New England Style mussel bowl $18.50 (beer bacon, leeks, potatoes, cheddar, parsley, de koninck & a touch of cream) was tasty and creamy, but the mussels were so tiny.  Burgers were just okay. A little pricey, but they weren't fantastic or particularly better than other pubs. Their burgers are better than fast-food chains, of course. I never quite like the pizzas at Beerbistro.  It used to be not so busy on weeknights. I often can enjoy a long dinner date with a friend. However it's so popular now, especially during the summer.  Definitely call for reservations!  Beer menu is fantastic and it's the only reason I come back. Great list of draughts, an even more gigantic list of bottles. They sort the beers by Quenching, Crisp, Appetizing, etc.... so that's unique and super awesome. If you don't know much about beers, the menus will tell you everything. Which is why: don't bother with asking the waiters. Take a look and read!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer and Belgian frites.   2 stars for the service and attitude. Results in a 3.5 star but I'll round t up to 4 because Rodenbach is my favourite beer.   The bar area is incredibly overcrowded and God forbid you come on Saturday night - you'll be sitting close enough to someone that you can see their pores. For whatever reason they only allow you to sit in the dining area if you say you are going to eat food - I had to lie and weasel my way into the dining room because there were no seats at the bar area (\"you can sit anywhere in the lounge area, and dinner area is ONLY if you purchase food\") - so you'd rather have me not stay at your establishment at all than have me come into the dining area and have drinks and an appetizer?   Now the service. For some strange reason, whenever I am there I get the same middle-aged man as the server who seems like he hate anything that moves. The first time we had him, when he learnt we are only there for drinks, the beer and the water glasses were THROWN onto the table to the point I was worried he'd break something. Second time I was there with another friend, even my friend said \"He seems to hate us for no reason\". Third time I was there with a group of friends for a late night drink (at midnight). The dining area was dead but the bar was still pretty busy. Again they almost forced us to sit at the bar area but hopefully realized that it's ridiculous and we could be allowed to sit in the dining area (the peasants that we are). No surprise, the same waiter with his flat jokes and sarcasm offering us tequila because what else would six professional women drink? And then it began again, beer throwing and endless side eyes.   I've been to this place at least 10 times and will keep coming back for beer and trying to avoid the nasty waiter man who will not get more than 10% tip."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the mussels but they were all out. Instead had the Hog Wild pizza which was good but a little greasy. The Maudite beer was recommended by the waiter and I thoroughly enjoyed. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"After going to the Hockey Hall of Fame, we hit this place for dinner.  It was right up the street and easy to find.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a wide selection of draft beer and typical Toronto prices.    They make a tomato soup that is about the best one I've ever had.  It comes out in a large bowl and pipping hot.  This is the way soup should be served.  The pizza was very good as well.  The bartender we had was a great guy.  Made some good recommendations, let us try a few beers and set us up with a couple of Flights that were terrific.    The bar itself was bright and large with plenty of seating.  TVs all over the place and plenty of Curling on.  Not real sure what that's all about, but I guess anything on ice in Canada is gunna sell.    Highly recommend you stop here...."}
{"text":"You had me at beer I'm just a guy, standing in front of a beer, asking to love it. Beer completes me  You get the picture and I really don't think you do. Come and experience the knowledge you would expect from a Sommelier, you get from Bier Markt. Sure the tab is better than most. Throw in the bottles and you have yourself a top notch selection. But wait, there's more. The gourmet brew menu has exceptional offerings you will not see again. If you think you know beer, come here and learn from the master, your bartender, David Bronfman and Bacchus himself, Stephen Beaumont. Even the servers are masters of suds. I was blown away. We did try a Lambics for $32.00/750ml and it was not for us but I'm really glad I tried it.   Did I mention there's also great food? Duck fat fries, Muscle Bowls, extremely knowledgable staff and old commercials playing at the urinals, Women, you will want to pop in and watch. The commercials...please.  If you know, you're already here. If you don't know, you will want to. Trust me and come on down."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner here.  The beer selection was excellent and had a good number of local microbrews.  We sat outside and loved the fresh air.  I ordered the mussels and the portion was very large (both of mussels and bread).  The mussels were amazing!  My husband ordered the pork chop, which was a bit dry, but we would definitely go back again if we were in the area!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Beerbistro. I had dinner at the bar and loved the huge selection of beer of tap.   I started with the Belgian Frites (huge portion) which were good (you can tell they are quality) with the provided ketchup and mayo, but I wouldn't rave about them. I then had the spicy red Thai mussels which had a delicious coconut chili sauce with cilantro, which was the highlight of the meal for me!  The double IPA from Shillow Beer Co. was tasty and dark but not as hoppy as I would have liked. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a trendy place to grab a beer and good appetizers Downtown."}
{"text":"It's Friday night and you just want a beer and some good hearty stick to your ribs kinda food. If that's the case then this is your place. But make sure you make reservations first! Friday night at 8:30pm the only vacant table in the house was the one reserved for us.  Complimentary coat check was a nice touch before the hostess led us to our cozy table at the very back of the restaurant. The restaurant was a lot smaller than I actually thought it would be but it still had a decent amount of seating. I loved our table though because depending on which seat you were in you could see directly into the kitchen and all the chefs at work or have a full view of the entire restaurant.  Our lovely waitress came over to take our drinks orders. I'm actually not really a beer drinker but there is only one type of beer that I absolutely love however most places don't usually carry it. Luckily this place has basically every type of beer on hand that you could dream of or at least something close to it.  Fruli Strawberry Beer - Deliciously fruity and refreshing with a good amount of carbonation, it's definitely perfect for those that aren't really into beer as it taste sort of like a fruity mixed drink.  Hubby wanted to try something new and asked the waitress for a recommendation as he was looking for something different but creamy like his usual choice of guiness. She did great by recommending:   Left Field Eephus Oatmeal Brown Ale (Ontario; 5.5% alc.) Roasted malt and nuts are at the forefront of this brown ale which also carries a clean and softly bitter finish. He thoroughly enjoyed it.  Onto the food. They have a great mix of bistro style foods. For appetizer we went with  Blanche de Chambly Cured Smoked Salmon - crispy potato latkes, lemon goat cheese, red onion, fried capers The salmon was incredibly fresh and the crispy potato latkes were satisfying without being too heavy, I loved the little pops of saltiness from the crispy fried capers  Belgian Frites - blanched in beef & duck fat, house made mayonnaise & smoked tomato ketchup First of the all the serving you get for just $6 bucks should be a crime! I couldn't believe the hugeee portion we got but I was very thankful as these were super addicting! Nice a crispy, crunchy, golden brown colour but the flavour - OMG - quite possibly one of the best frites I've ever tasted! Ooh and the homemade mayo and ketchup were also phenomenal.  Main Pulled Pork Primanti - beer braised & house smoked, coleslaw, gouda, potato Again another hit out of the ball park! Don't let this sandwich fool you because at first look it may look easy to finish but I really struggled to devour it all! Piled high very juicy, flavourful succulent shredded pork it was just divine! I also loved that it was a little bit spicy, perfect balance of sweet and heat. And if all that meat wasn't enough for you melted cheese, crunchy slaw, oh and those amazing frites were all layered into this amazing sandwich!  After all that goodness and literally stuffed to the max I just couldn't resist glancing over the dessert menu  Flourless Chocolate Stout Cake - with oatmeal stout and whipped cream I'm always soo weary that flourless chocolate cakes will be too dry, brittle or flavourless but this one the complete opposite. Super moist with a deep and delicious dark chocolate flavour and not too sweet which I really appreciated and that whipped cream was truly the icing on the cake!  Overall I have to say I really enjoyed everything from the great atmosphere, attentive and knowledgeable staff, extensive beer menu, and amazinggg food! Definitely worth checking out just make sure you have someone to carry/roll you out the door afterwards!"}
