{"text":"Literally the shittiest casino in the country. I was playing craps and killing it but having fun and the Pitt boss complained I was playing too slow.  I asked all the players what they thought and they totally disagreed.  The boss took the dice off me and everyone was pissed.   What a total joke of a casino."}
{"text":"What a shame that they permit smoking and ruined this casino."}
{"text":"So I go to The Rivers Casino with my 18-year old son to eat at the buffet and maybe play an hour of Limit Hold'em (just me of course).

As you can surmise, I never made it past the door.  You have to be 21 years old to just enter the casino.  Now I can see that my son couldn't gamble; but to eat at the buffet -- c'mon that's stupid.  Now my son can go blow all his money on lottery tickets, or vote, or join the military.  But he's too young to eat at the casino buffet.

Casinos throughout the country are too inconsistent in their minimum age policies."}
{"text":"Don't go near this place if there is a ball game, or an event at Heinz field......they will charge you $60 to park.  I hear you can get a voucher and get a refund... but the goons guarding the garage know nothing about this and did not offer any solution to me."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: Being that this is my virgin review so please be kind on my lack of proper grammar and spelling and if you had my elementary and junior high English teachers, you would have tuned out as well and be 3/5 literate on your good days :)   

Being that I will stick with a subject matter I am familiar with (CASINOS) I might be nitpicking and reviewing the minutia of THE RIVERS!!!!!!  

PARKING AND ENTRANCE: choice of valet or self parking garage and I went with the latter.   Easy to navigate and plenty of surv cameras so that you don't feel like you will get jacked before you ever get into the building (Btw. I can never understand why most casino property patron robberies are late hours after 94% of people are leaving with less $ than they came with but i suppose they get stalked after leaving the cage and cashing their cheques/chips/one arm bandit vouchers)   Lots of security guards in between the elevators and casino floor.  Getting carded nearing age 40 always makes me feel a bit flattered yet annoys me frothing to get to the action.  

SLOT MACHINES:  one of my least favorite gaming activities but THE RIVERS machines have plush chairs for my lazy ass with cool little TVs built into machines for ADHD people to multi task as to distract their clearLY addictive slot play.... slid a CIVIL WAR GENERAL/CLOWN PRESIDENT dollar bill into  \"blazin 7s\" and after about 24 full credit spins, my balance read goose eggs..(and people think humans continue to evolve HA)  -$50

TABLE GAMES:  I went with the lesser of all evils BJ/21.  It was early afternoon and the limits seemed a bit high so I choose a  $ 25 dollar table and bought in for 2 bills.. .. Original Dealer was quick and courteous and didn't seem to vibe off of people  getting buried or complaining about poor tipping.  Typical BJ session  and get bored with it up 7 units and getting a baby powder stench from the septuagenerarian seated to my left..... +175

POKER ROOM:  very spacious, modern and smokefree(reminded me of the Venetian Las Vegas when it was first to open such a layout back in 
~2002),,,,,, played 1/2 NL hold em for over 2 hours and was very pleased with the polite yet gregarious dealers who knew how to get the hands out fast yet not cluster f/ ck the process and confuse the players by needing to redeal or take 24858 minutes to seperate side pots..... I played tight and unfortunately so did everyone else so I lasted 45 minutes and -$65

BEVERAGES:  self service coffee/tea and soft drink stations which oddly seemed like they had more people in line for them then were in the rest of the casino.... oh and some goofball filling his oversized thermus with MOUNTAIN DEW  (official drink of white trash)HAHAHA   i loved that!!!!!!    Many bars on the grounds and being that it must be state laIw or something not to offer free alcohol to players, I proceeded to sit at a bar and drink a beer and as usual in casinos, the only person not playing a slot machine.  Was something near 5 bucks for a domestic so i threw down $8 ...-$8

BATHROOMS: large and clean in typical casino fashion and satisfying in a way that I didn't feel like I needed to blow torch my hands instead of washing them after taking a basic leak  $0 (and don't laugh as i remember paying toilet stalls when i was a wee lad in Nia Falls )


I didn't try any of the restaurants as ran out of time and patience to do so.   Overall THE RIVERS was a decent  yet a bit plain jane facility and just the vibe of any casino knowing it preying on my and everyone else's money can never make it 5 stars but  I probably will return and the next time not alone and partially intoxicated.  In an odd way it reminded me of MGM Grand Las Vegas in its color schemes and layout with a mundane atmosphere.....  THE RIVERS 3.5 Stars :)"}
{"text":"Great wide open location. The big tv in the wheelhouse is great and so is the food there."}

Poor mistreatment of employees, I dined in rivers casino grandview buffet Pittsburgh pa a few weeks ago towards the back of the restaurant and witnessed workers using profanity and a gentlemen pour a hot beverage onto a young lady and walk away. Where is the professionalism?"}
{"text":"Good casino, nice people working the casino tables and it was a good crowd. I can't comment on the slots because I didn't play them but had fun playing craps. Had a gyro sandwich to eat and it was decent, but u enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and the joint is PACKED!!!!  If you are a table game player, there's 100% chance you are standing behind someone waiting to get a seat.  Mind you, by midnight they had at least 20 blackjack tables open and they are all loaded with players.  By midnight also saw 6 craps tables open.  It's staffed well to handle the crowds.  Bad = no free drinks.  At least no Yuenglings. And that's a PA beer!  Also, last call at 1:30 until 9:00am.  Guess they don't have a 24hour license like most casinos.  All in all, very modern and nice.  Design is open concept which is completely opposite of the playbook on casino design.

Table mins on a Friday night:
Blackjack - $15 (at least 15 tables at this price)
Video Blackjack - $5 (huge TV screen with 4 chairs and a computer dealer)
Craps - $10 (one table near wheelhouse bar.  All others are $15 and $25)
Mini Baccarat - $10
Roulette - $5
Video Roulette - $1 (Huge TV screen with about 15 seats around it)
All other tables games - $15"}
{"text":"Really torn on Rivers Casino....

The good: Personally, I really like it. Go down to play poker about once a week, and I love their poker room. It's open, spacious, comfortable, and pretty busy. 
The casino interior is nice, looks a lot better than your average non-Vegas slots parlors across the country. 
I enjoyed the buffet all but one trip, but that was really late right before they closed, so it wasn't busy and the food wasn't being filled fresh. Every other time was really good.
It's really convenient. Even though the garage is fugly, it's extremely easy to get in and out. I live in Brookline, and I can walk out my front door and have my butt in a poker seat in about ten minutes!

The Bad: Smoky!! I don't smoke, and the poker room is non smoking, but one trip across the casino and I get home smelling like an ash tray. 
Table stakes can be kinda high. I like to play craps, $10 minimum bet is fine, but I've NEVER seen $5 stakes, and often it's just $15 and $25. I understand it's a business and if they're getting the action they can keep stakes high, but I'd like to get some more play out of my money. Atleast they didn't go to 6:5 Blackjack like a lot of Vegas casinos are.
Maybe it's just me, but I think it looks cheap from the outside. The color changing part is cool, but the rest of the exterior just doesn't seem like quality material or unique architecture.

The Hideously Ugly: The parking garage!! I remember thinking the riverlife organization,  or whatever they're called, were being babies when they made a stink about how bad the garage was gonna look, but they're right! It's definitely a monstrous eyesore, and the 'decorative' metal they put on the outside doesn't help much. And there's the big cheesy yellow lettering 'CASINO' you see from the west end bridge and Carson St, which I don't get when they could have used the sweet Rivers logo they have.

I want to give Rivers 4 stars, but I can't ignore the smoke and garage, which almost drop it to a 2 for me."}
{"text":"Buffet was like golden coral... Slots were tight, table games have progressive auto shufflers. Do yourself a favor and drive the hour to wheeling."}
{"text":"Very bad, very expensive experience. The food was cold, dry, hard, and any number of other descriptive terms for poor food. The crab legs looked spoiled and smelled very fishy, and were cold - that is being the first to get to a brand new batch. The sushi was rubbery and the avocado was browning. The smoked sausage was cold, and the pizza looked at least a day old. All of this, and it cost $70 for three people. We had a bad experience last time we were here, but we had a 2-for-1 coupon. we thought we would give them one more chance...We will never eat at this buffet again."}

{"text":"this casino is known as pittsburgh's bandit......!!!

rivers casino sucks everyone's money.  for the first  year it opened, it has average slot payouts.  now, they have tightened out all slots. 

their slots sucks big time....its worst slots in whole pa.  you can google it, and will get real answer....about 80 percent is payout....which is below pa gaming commission's permitted line.  what they will do, is pay fine for few thousand dollars, when they get caught about it.  that has been published in several news articles also. thats how they make millions every week. 

now, coming to table games-  big cheating scam over there also. 
what they are doing for past one yr, is manipulating the cards from the decks. 
for example,  when playing black jack--- specially on 25/ 50 dollar tables- no mid shoe entry--- 
they have automatic shuffle machines on those tables. 
what they will do with the machines, they will get rid of face value cards and aces. 
those \" 10\" value face cards and aces are good for players. 
if they remove them from 8 decks, and replace with small cards-- 2, 3, 4,5,6 .....
thats in advantage of dealers/ means house advantage. 
you will get less 20's and black jack, when they remove face cards. 
dealer's up card is 4/5/6...... and they will seldom bust....
why ??
because face cards are very few in those 8 decks...
all those are loaded with small cards...
player will stay on stiff hands according to basic strategy, vs dealers 4/5/6...and 80 to 90 percent time they will make hands, instead of busting... 

i and my friends, who are avid black jack players have observed this happening at rivers multiple times....

time has come that  pittsburgh metro area community wake up...and boycott casino...for illegal acitivities....state gaming control board should have closed this casino long time ago....but  they will not......

why?? because they get 30 percent share from the profit......
so, all they care is getting commision and money from casinos...

if you really want to go for genuinely have fun in casino....go to any casino other than rivers....

these bandit will take your money for sure.....
whether you try slots or table...
try yourself 10 times, and see how many times you come out as winner and how many times looser ....

usually, with standard black jack rules, house edge in black jack is about 2 percent.  so, statistically speaking, in long run, if u play 100 hands, you should win 48  hands, and dealers 52. 
try playing at rivers.... stick with perfect basic strategy....and your odds will be about 20 percent hnads, dealers will win 80 percent.....  

if you want to gamble---  go to vegas or atlantic city...but stay away from thugs called rivers casino...!!!!  

save your hard earned money people....!!!
be smart...!!!
please awaken.....!!"}

{"text":"The one star is for the credit department.  Avoid opening an account at ALL COSTS (even the ridiculous fees your credit card will charge).
Trust me--after MULTIPLE tries on MULTIPLE VISITS this group couldn't get a charge passed through BANK OF AMERICA (not a small community bank!!).  Then they hound you to make payments directly.  Why even have markers?!

On top of everything, they close an account due to the problems WHICH THEY CREATED.

If you are used to Vegas--this credit department will seem more like Disneyland.  Avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"Nice for Pittsburgh, just don't compare this to Vegas, this is not Vegas but a hell of a lot better than many casinos in New York, and Atlantic City. The Steakhouse is the best place to eat at here, there is good entertainment, the dealers are really good at the high end tables. Glad FINALLY Pittsburgh got a casino as it took a very, very long time to make this happen and this city needs revenue"}
{"text":"Second time there, not as good as the first. This time in the lounge in front of the big TV for the Pens game. Plus - still a great big TV and fun to watch the Pens game with other fans. Minus - exceptionally poor and slow service, and high prices for average food and drinks. Next time I'll get a free soda at one of the stations around the casino before coming in because I was dying of thirst before I got service."}
{"text":"Went there while in Pittsburgh for the weekend. Place is large, smoke free sections and smoking sections, restaurants and bars. I wasn't blown away with anything, just a vast space of people wasting their money."}
{"text":"Place is generic. If your from a place that has a lot of casinos, this place won't shock and awe you. I don't mind losing as long as I get a little value for what I spend. Not really the case here. Prob wouldn't go back. Very vanilla."}
{"text":"The good and the bad:
The casino itself is beautiful. The buffet food is phenomenal for buffet food. The Wheelhouse and Andrews are great, as well. The games are abundant and the dealers are wonderful...especially at the craps tables. 
Now the bad stuff:
the slots are very tight. My wife and I are frequent visitors and rarely win, and when we do, it's very minimal...the most was maybe $100. BUT, the things that have shifted our loyalties to the Meadows Casino is that we get much better comps there: ALOT more free play, ALOT more match play, and are usually given free alcohol without having to ask for it!! They look out for us at The Meadows, yet we spend no more money there than at The Rivers Casino. I am a big fan of excellent customer service and loyalty, so The Meadows is our new place!"}
{"text":"Not a gambler, but enjoyed Vegas' casinos when I went about 3 years ago.  They were not smokey, ashtray lined venues (NYNY smelled like apples, Mandalay bay like coconuts, you get the picture).  This place  was so smoke filled it was disgusting.  Will not ever go back!

For those who want to try it--we were dressed up, but there were those in sweats and blue jeans, and those in furs (although not many).  Anything goes, just be sure you have your ID."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  I should preface my comments by saying my wife and I travel to Las Vegas frequently.
Rivers has a captive audience; they know it and they take full advantage of it.
Ergo: crappy odds on video poker and really no comps to speak of despite playing nearly $30,000 coin in on video poker last year.
Their latest scam is advertising \"$5 Blackjack, Roulette & Craps! All Day Everyday!\".  I was recently at Rivers on Wednesday, Feb. 15 @ 4:30 p.m.  Anyone want to take a wild guess at how many $5 blackjack tables there were at this time?  Das' right...............1................ONE........in the entire casino;  and good luck getting a seat at this ONE $5 table.  What a scam.  I think the proper phrase is \"bait and switch\".  They have one $5 table open, where it's impossible to get a seat due to full occupancy, so if you want to play blackjack, you have to go to a table with a higher minimum.  What a joke.  Rivers, you have no shame.
Oh, by the way, I was there last weekend also, looking for a $5 table.  You had 4 tables on the weekend.  I sat down at one (the only one where I could find an open spot), played around 5 hands, at which time the table minimum was raised to $10.
If you want to play $5 blackjack at The Rivers............go on a Thursday night.  At that time they DO have an entire pit of $5 tables.  Any other day you're wasting your time.
To be fair, The Meadows isn't much better, although The Meadows DOES have some 9/6 Jacks or Better machines.
If you want to go to a real casino, go to Vegas.  These local casinos are consumed with their own greed.  They are full of marketing ploys to \"get you into the casino\", figuring that once you are there, you WILL gamble away some of your money."}

{"text":"My friend and I go often to play blackjack. We stopped  for a drink first. We were on our second when a bevy of security guards surrounded us and said I was drunk and weaving. How does one weave on a barstool? Furthermore, why would I be served if the very kind bartender thought I was intoxicated. I would like to see the tape of the  action I performed that caused this.   I asked the guard if I appeared intoxicated, he said \" no, but we have to follow what the bar manager says.\" Also if I was intoxicated wouldn't they want me to  take a cab? Very odd.  I tipped the nice girl very  well. What's wrong with this place? This was my first drink of the day."}

Lucky i was aware and didnt try to walk in front of him as he was driving up a dark red-purple sedan at high rate of speed..completely in wrong and i will be contacting his superior,  as i know for fact they got cameras and will be able to see how fast he was driving somebody elses car and how close i was. Casino has always been great time. But this really bothers me how this little kid conducted himself and immediately tried to get aggressive."}
{"text":".

  
I finally went to the casino for the first time. Unlike some people, I didn't go there to watch the Pitt game, or to check out the buffet, I went there to GAMBLE. The casino is surprisingly big and spacious. We walked straight to one of the bars to grab drinks before we parted with our money. Drinks weren't cheap, but that's no shocker. My vodka soda was $5 (and weak), my friend's tequila and water was almost $10. My two games are roulette and black jack so most of my time was spent there.  They have automated roulette, as well as regular tables.  There were a lot of black jack and poker tables, most with a seat or two open, which I was happy to see even if it was a Saturday night.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the waitress came around often to refill my drink. 

The bathrooms were clean, easy to find and huge. ATM machines and the cashier stations were also spread throughout the floor and didn't have a line. 

Since I won $150 at roulette, it was definitely a good experience for me. We stayed for a few hours, which was probably just enough. I'll definitely go back at some point in the near future, maybe when I get my tax return.."}
{"text":"Most of the dealers there are aholes but you'll run into a few that are alright and one or two that are pretty cool.  But it's a casino not a church so maybe i have unrealistic expectations.  I do however think that this casino accommadates to the novice players since the tables will let you ask other players how to play and the dealers will give you advice.  I don't know if other casinos allow that.  But Pittsburgh is a hometown city so it is not as serious as vegas or other places I'm thinking.  Never been but may be a good thing."}
{"text":"Smokey, hard to breath cough, cough. Beer is to expensive. They had a few events on the bike path causing a unsafe detour to trail users. The trail was there first and needs to be seperated from the outdoor parking area. Cheaper to eat elsewhere and who wants a nasty cancer causing hotdog. Slot machines so loud I cant barely hear the music or announcements. Got a headache last time I was there, no alcohol involved."}
{"text":"What's up with all the new 2cent machines.  Just returned to Pgh  after 7 months in Las Vegas.  All the 2 cent machines at The Rivers are 1 cent in Vegas.

{"text":"I wanted to post an update since Christian posted a response. Christian replied to my Yelp initially and asked for my players card number and then after providing the details he fell off the RADAR and no response until just public ally commenting asking to reach out through the website. Unfortunately, I have done that twice already and I respect my time too much to invest more of my time on them (especially if they cannot take the time to review the information they already have)."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the river. Good place to take out of town guests. Nice assortment of slot machines. The buffet is very good, something for everyone. I like the Asian section except for the sushi, wish it was better. Clean rest rooms. We enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"The Rivers Casino security treated me like a criminal when a little old lady left about sixteen dollars on a two cent machine and when I just happened to be the next person to play that machine, I was accused of stealing her money! First of all, I have a hard time figuring out the credits on a two cent machine sometimes anyhow, so I didn't notice anything off and second of all, I didn't check the machine for credits because who would be dumb enough to leave money on a machine and leave it?? Well, security tracked me down and took sixteen dollars off my voucher and when I finally left that day, the security vehicle chased me down to intimidate me I guess? Anyhow, I'll never go back. I've spent thousands of dollars there over time and no one ever wins there. There's rarely a scream of joy in the place indicating a reasonable win. Let them take that little old woman's fixed income and be happy with that! Everyone I know who gambles occasionally like me goes to the Meadowlands, so that'll be me and my husband from now on. BYE BYE RIVERS CASINO!!!"}
{"text":"I HAD SO MUCH FUN CELEBRATING MY 21st BIRTHDAY HERE!

The female bartender in the middle of the playing room was absolutely amazing. She was the nicest. I was here Friday the 5th, and I ordered a few mixed drinks throughout the night and she told me everything that goes into them and had enough patience to serve me my manhattans and dirty martinis and shots that everyone else bought for me.

The staff is awesome too. On my birthday I had a ton of people wish me a happy birthday and it made me feel really special. On the 5th, I tried the buffet (which is delicious!) and the staff sang happy birthday to me and brought out a lot of the dessert goodies with candles in them for me!

The night ended well (probably because I didn't loose too much money) and I played all night long with family and friends. A lot of the $0.50 slots are really fun because you'll hit here and there and after 30 minutes you'll be at the same amount you put into the machine or higher.

And to top it all off I even saw Jerome Bettis."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday Night.

Hit for $100 on two separate occasions playing Keno on $20 worth of betting.

all table games had a $15 minimum.

The place was crowded and it was difficult to get in a craps game or get a seat  at the black jack table.   It seemed like they could've opened up more tables to accommodate the players standing around waiting for a seat.  The dealers on the whole were a bit shaky with numerous recounts and mistakes made for and against the player.  The poker room was packed and again it seemed like the room could've been bigger for more games.   

All the bars are cool and different so its fun having a drink at each one.  If you order a drink at a table be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for your drink unless you tip extremely well.   

I will have to check this place out during the week to see the difference compared to a post-bucco game Saturday night."}
{"text":"Another Gem in Pittsburgh's Crown!

This is a tasteful slots casino offering a smooth and sleek decor with excellent views of the three rivers! 

PREFACE - I do not really dig buffets - that said...

Check out the buffet! It's nicer than other non Vegas casinos I've been to. Good service and great views give the buffet an edge. I'm excited to try other eateries on the property in the future. This is a good place to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"The Rivers Casino is not impressive. It always reeks of cigarette smoke, the payouts are just okay, security is rude, they never offer free drinks while gambling and the Rivers ridiculously overcharges for event parking. If I had it my way, I'd never go back, however, my husband is a big gambler and this casino casino is most convenient. In my opinion, save you're money and head to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always a fun visit to the casino especially on a Friday or Saturday.The entertainment is usually good but I don't know what was going on last night. 
The band was OK they had at one of these bars they just werent upbeat or interesting. Always break even or hit on the penny machines. 

The casino is a hoot to visit on the weekends.. fun to play, walk around and people watch of course."}
{"text":"Andrews Steak & Seafood has great oysters on the half-shell - fresh and smooth. Drinking throughout the Casino is filled with quick and friendly service. The bar in the middle is a great place to sit down and converse."}

{"text":"I didn't really like it. Maybe it was because of how much money I lost and how quickly, but why were the minimums so high? I didn't understand that. The whole place was way too smokey and the dealers didn't seem to be enjoying themselves and the pit bosses seems barely more professional. It is a HUGE casino and is pretty new, but man the type of gambler that was in there wasn't fun to play with nor were the dealers."}
{"text":"Pretty nice casino.  Many slot machines and a few craps tables among all the other standard casino attractions.  The bar in the back facing the river is a cool spot to have a drink.  Easy parking.  Avoid the coffee at the cafe.  Their lattes are terrible."}
{"text":"Personally witnessed a belligerent drunk who could barely walk permitted to keep playing at a blackjack table, who the staff was aware of.  Of course they didn't make him leave initially, they are too busy stealing his money, as long as he wasn't causing a scene, they didn't care.  That is ridiculously unethical, and very sad.  That these poor souls are being taken for everything they got with the hope of winning a few bucks every once in a while.  It just makes me depressed to go there and watch this.  But I guess that is the same at any casino."}
{"text":"I live in Atlantic City so I have seen a couple casinos.. this is a very typical sort of casino, but the positive feature is that since it is the only one here pretty lively place... negative is that alcohol not free on the floor, just soda.. some quite photogenic cocktail waitresses, not that i would notice something like that.. the fruit tart at ciao is great!! good selection of french/italian style pastries and good espresso. i had won $200 and only had to reinvest $5 in the casino in exchange for a delicious fruit tart with blackberries, apricot,and strawberry on a custard bed and a tasty espresso"}
{"text":"The place is still nice but now the slots are virgin tight because they have to help pay for the new Penguin's Arena."}
{"text":"I'll admit upfront that I'm not a huge gambler; however, I do enjoy the grandness and general environment of a casino. I like playing the cheap slots, watching some of the higher stakes games (from afar, of course), and maybe enjoying some free or at least cheap booze and food. I've been to the river casino 3 times and I've generally had a good time. One thing that I will complain about is that not only are the drinks not free, they're freakin expensive. From my experience this is very unique for a casino. Either way, it's a good time to spend a night here at least once to try your luck at some of the games. I may come back at some point and eat at one of the buffets, but on the other hand I may go somewhere with cheaper drinks and a better time."}
{"text":"The Manager has contacted me and I have a complimentary visit waiting.   We shall see..."}
{"text":"Could use a few improvements but not too bad..

My overall experience with this place was quite mixed. I walked in through the front doors and had no idea where to go. There was very limited signage pointing you in the right direction. I eventually made my way to the player's club registration. The staff at the registration was very nice and they were very helpful. They gave me plenty of information about the place and where everything was located.  That was very nice and to me it was a bit  unneeded  but  it might be helpful to someone.

I didn't go to any of the inside bars or the buffet but I did treat myself to the complimentary beverages they offered, However my only complaint with that is once they run out of coffee it is like mission impossible to get the thing changed. I understand that it is complimentary and they don't have an obligation to make it a main priority but if it's going to be offered someone should keep up with it a bit more. We asked numerous people and they were all friendly and met with the we will get somebody on that response. That was reassuring but near an hour had passed and no coffee change. That's all fine though as I was there for the slots. Just a minor annoyance is all.

The slot machine variety seemed very similar to many of the other PA casinos I have been to. Wolf Run, Black Knight, Fairy Something, Survivor, Wizard of Oz, Monopoly, Wheel of Fortune.  So nothing that I noticed that was too different. I didn't take notice to what 25 cent or $1 slot machines they had as I normally don't play them unless i'm feeling lucky.

There were a few ones I haven't seen before such as the Leslie Neilson airplane and Dark Gypsy.

I played a few varieties but was not seeming to win very much. So I decided to quit before losing too much money. 

Overall an enjoyable place but seems that you have to be there a while to hit some big money. I would come back if I were in the area. It was a nice smaller Casino and not a bad time. Would love to come back and try the buffet."}
{"text":"After reading mixed reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Free self parking in the garage, which was a plus since we continued on to the Pirates game! That saved at least $12 and made for a beautiful walk along the river.

Casino Itself is beautifully decorated and clean.  Sign up for a players card and you can get in on certain promos (I got the free $10 in slot play at the pirates game).  It also gives you 5% off in the gift shop and at the buffet.  Mostly we did slot machines, not really lucky there. No free alcohol, but free soda and coffee and tea.

Sunday buffet was nice, for the price of $19.95 you get as much champagne, mimosa, beer or bloody Mary as you'd like!  Typical breakfast, salads, Italian, Mongolian, BBQ and crab legs! Nice desserts too. Ask to sit on the patio for a relaxing and quieter area with nice views of the river."}
{"text":"When rivers first opened it wasn't that bad... now anymore you can't win anything. I'm a signature card holder..before that use to mean something.. now your just treated like any other customer. I spend tons of money and my freeplay dropped to $10. What a disgrace! You ask for freeplay or comps and they give you minimal. I'm a top card holder at Meadows and as soon as I put my card into a machine my hosts texts me and puts on at least  $60 in comps and over $150 of freeplay every visit!!! Not once has that ever happened at rivers! You can't even enjoy yourself anymore at rivers. Machines are so tight you lose a couple hundred within 30 mins!!! What happened to you rivers!?! So disappointed!!!"}

I found who she was(Debbie)  .. Yes.. She was the one who was at Rivers Casino all the time and Gambling on $1x3=$3 Machine ....

She got excited and start going there every other day ... she got Coupons and free play in mail and she start loosing her 401k savings + social security and as on date she lost everything and she is hand to mouth. she lost her family 4 Years back as her Kids wrote her off as Gambling addict ..  and when she asked Rivers Casino for Money she lost .. they said that they go with the Money a patron loose per year and they give free play based on that .       These Casinos are good with You when You have Money in your Pocket and will Treat You like a Sh.... WAKE UP ... Don't loose Your HARD EARNED Money at Casino .. Enjoy Time with your Family and Friends .... Please don't be another Debbie ... I feel bad for her .....Millions have lost their Jobs/Family , committed Suicide because of these Casinos ... so, its time to say NO to Casinos ..... Its a simple Math .... Casinos invest NOTHING and You Invest EVERYTHING"}
{"text":"I recently visited this casino while in town for the day. I would have to say it's very average. It didn't have a wow factor upon walking in. They seem to have the normal amount of slot machines. I didn't play any slots or table games but did play Poker. Their Poker Room is set off near the non-smoking are of slot machines. It is a nice room with quite a few tables. The only game they had going was 1/3 NLH (about 13 tables) but did have an interest list going for other games. The dealers were nice and efficient (although there was one that I think was new as he was slow in dealing and didn't keep the action moving like the others), cocktail waitresses checking on us often (non-alcoholic drinks are free), and the rest of the staff very nice. Although I wasn't in a smoking area, I did leave smelling faintly of smoke, which was a little annoying.

I also at at the buffet for dinner (which I did review) and found it to be very average for the price and quality.

Would I come here to gamble again? Yes"}
{"text":"I went to a private event held in a banquet room, the space was great - windows lined the walls to show the view of the river, downtown offices, and one of the bridges. We were served dinner, with plenty of options- nearly all of which were gluten free. They had salmon, which was cooked very well, steak, and chicken. Everyone enjoyed their food. They also had an open bar- nearly no limit in options for mixed drinks. Definitely recommend using this space for a private event- our space easily held 150-200 people without feeling cramped."}
{"text":"Review of the Champagne Brunch Buffet 

$19.95 for unlimited food and unlimited booze on a hungover sunday morning, yes and yes! 

My normally healthy eating habits were thrown into the river when I saw the spread at the buffet.  In order to get over my hangover I started off with a water, a diet pepsi and a bloody mary. I followed that with a full plate of mac and cheese, french toast, pizza, mushroom ravioli, large plate of desserts.  They had a wide variety of food (seafood, salad bar, craving stations, asian stir fry) but I was grease focused there was no room for salad or seafood on my plate. 

Did I mention they have unlimited booze? Check it out! Your pounding headache will thank you! 

Brunch is no joke in my book."}
{"text":"My favorite casino. I don't know what it is about this place. My game of choice is the large Willy Wonka game by The Spiral Bar. They have many different character games, Poker machines and table games. I've found the crowd to always be friendly. Usually some kind of band playing on the weekends. Great place before and after a Pittsburgh sporting event to wait out traffic."}
{"text":"Went in there for like 20 min after the game and was accused of being a drunk \"slut\" and was kicked out of the casino ... no time in my life have I been treated like such crap with no legitimate reason ... literally did zero things and got thrown out of a casino by other WOMEN ... I'm so disgusted!!!"}
{"text":"3.5, but rounding down because it's no Vegas or AC. :-)

This place is definitely something to do if you're bored in Pittsburgh -- nice view, free parking, and fairly clean. And you don't have to dress up or anything, because there's not much to do here except to eat and gamble. They also have a free soda/drink bar, where you can quench your thirst if the gambling gets too intense!

ALSO, I won $30 playing slots here... and I *NEVER* win anything... ever!"}
{"text":"New Years Eve Throwback Party Sucked, Seems that they were very disorganized. Lines everywhere, You'd think they could better handle the crowd. It was like this was the first time they attempted this.I arrived at 9PM and returned home by 10:58PM. Tickets were $50 each and a complete waste of money. Received $10 in free spins, but had to stand in line for 20 minutes to get the reward. Was handed a players club card but wasn't told I needed a pin to use the free spins. Wasn't asked for a pin. Had to stand in another line for 20 minutes to get the pin set-up. the food was mediocre and there wasn't nearly enough places to sit and eat the food. Nor was there anywhere to put the dirty dishes so I opted for a corner of the room on the floor. Next time, I'll spend my $100 dollars (2 tickets @ $50) on a nice restaurant somewhere else. Rivers scored a nice big FAT FAIL for New Years Eve. I tried to use the \"Contact Us\" form on their website, but they can't seem to get that correct either as it did not work."}
{"text":"This casino is probably one of my favorites of all time. The dealers are friendly along with the slot people. I enjoy making money on Blackjack while my wife plays her one armed bandit aka the slot machines. You can't go wrong with taking a short walk from pnc or Heinz to gamble a little money. And while you are there, you should check out Andrews steakhouse which has the best filets in Puttsburgh with a great wine selection. Be sure to check out great bands on the weekends along with summer concerts outside."}
{"text":"Prior to having visited Las Vegas I would have rated The Rivers Casino at a decent 4-stars.  However, since my six day stint in Sin City and it's Casinos I have come to detest (partially) Rivers and have downgraded it to two stars.

The Good:
- It is close, accessible, and it has a decent amount of parking.
- The facilities are being kept properly and the clientele hasn't run it to the ground yet.
- They run a decent amount of promotions and deals, albeit for regulars only.
- Free Pop & Coffee, although they need to do something about the funky drain smells.

The Bad:
- Cocktail waitresses are vying with the Dodo bird for which is seen less.
- Drinks, when you go grab one yourself, tend to be on the weak and overpriced side.
- For the most part, a lot of the staff seems absolutely miserable to be working.

The Ugly:
- Gambling returns, seriously ... at least keep me playing for more than 30 minutes.
- Smoking sections are a JOKE, and people smoke almost everywhere anyways.
- The Clientele sometimes is a rude and curt as the cranky employees.


...I'm torn, I used to love it but now I know there's a lot better out there.  So yeah, two stars, since \"Meh. I've experience better.\" is definitely what this place left me feeling."}
{"text":"I'm traveling from out of town and tried to get in to try their buffet.  I wasnt allowed in because I was holding a small backpack and they have no service to keep my bag with security"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday.  Tons of people for a Monday but it wasn't crowded.  Security gave my friend trouble for her ID.  Said she didn't look 29 when she is.  We went to the buffet during dinner.  The place was spacious and looks nice.  However, we find the food average.  Not one dish there was amazing.  Spare rib has to be one of the worst I've had.  Crab legs were decent but a new batch takes too long to come out.  Plus, there was no lemon anywhere to make my dipping sauce for the crab legs.  The calzones in the Italian section was good.  Pasta looked awful.  Sushi, amazingly laughable.  Egg drop soup was good at the Asian section but had to walk to the other side of the buffet to get my own soup bowl.  After dinner, we gamble a bit.  The dealers were really nice.  While cashing out, those security guards were mad dogging us.

Overall, the buffet wasn't anything special.  I definitely don't think it is worth coming here on the weekends.  Honestly, I would just avoid the surrounding areas during the weekend.  I have been stuck in traffic for over an hour with all the people trying to go there on the weekends.  Plus, the smoking makes you feel icky.  Being relatively new to Pittsburgh, I find it sad that you can smoke in many public places."}
{"text":"We actually came across the Rivers Casino from none other than the outlook from Duquesne Incline! We put a quarter into the err let's call them gigantic binoculars situated on the outlook and was taking a closer look at Pittsburgh when we found a bright ad coming from a building. It was none other than Rivers Casino! We then looked up the casino on our phones and found out it just opened. We immediately got the address and drove on over.

I really like the fact that there's a casino in Pittsburgh. It was fairly crowded and i was carded right away by the security surrounding the elevators.  They're all there to ensure everyone is 21 and over.  They even swipe your ID to make sure it's not fake.

Smoker and non smoker areas. Restaurants, buffet, complimentary soda, water, and coffee. You can find them on the edges of the casino.

The slots are pointless. I'm definitely never going to win any substantial amount of money from playing slots.  We waited a long time for a seat at one of only 2 virtual blackjack $5 tables.  They don't have any actual player tables, just virtual ones.  Fortunately we left the casino with more money than we started with! :) That being said, we're going back to the casino tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this casino 3 times and do enjoy it. Their buffet is good (I've only ever gone there for lunch), I like the variety of slots they have and they allow you to video record your slot play. They also have self-serve beverage stations - somehow here in Ohio they felt those aren't necessary and it takes forever to even see a waitress. 

I've gotten some nice free play and food offers from Rivers so I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Typical casino albeit with poor betting rules. Craps have weak odds on many bets (field, hard ways, etc) compared to many casinos. Slots are pretty tight.

Ambience is okay. A bit better than meadows casino, but they need to cut down on the smoking. Parts of the casino are smoke free, but that is meaningless when smoke just carries over from the non smoke free areas. 

The parking garage (free, easy access) is probably the best part. And at least the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Nice casino, but like a previous Yelper review, no wow factor . We got ID'd before entering and while playing on the blackjack table we literally had to beg for the dealer and pit boss to find a waitress to get a drink."}
{"text":"I planned a reunion upstairs in the event spaces (the Allegheny Room, in particular). Tom, Gretchen, Stephanie, and the rest of the team put on a superb event. We may think about coming back in ten years! It'll be hard to think of a better reunion destination in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Okay so, while I enjoy stopping by the casino to hang out with friends...errrrr, like maybe once a year...I really only like a few of the non smoking sections so I'll focus on those and dabble in my dislikes just a bit.

The parking situation is pretty easy. Can't find a parking space? Drive to another level, problem solved.

Every employee that I've encountered here is very friendly. As a matter of fact, I look forward to showing off my license to see if I get some type of  \"wow, you don't look your age\" and I usually do. Wait, maybe I need to go more often to feed my very tiny ego? Okay, back to the subject....

Do you want to hear some good music and shake your shimmy or bootay or (what do the kids call it now?)...then the Drum Bar is your spot. It had little intimate seating areas which are perfect to gather with friends to chat it up or gawk at some of the cray Cray situations going on around you. For example, one time I was here capping off my birthday and looked up to see 2 guys fondling a girl. So, not something I wanted to see but it was definitely a \"hey, what do we have going on here\" type of moment and I wasn't alone in my voyeurism. In the absence of a few drinks, I would've been pretty repulsed instead of laughing hysterically but oh well, no shame in my game because it wasn't me. Okay, back to the subject...

I'm probably one of the few folks that haven't eaten at the buffet but I've heard good things. I do enjoy The Wheelhouse restaurant because everything I've eaten here from the burgers to the salad to the desserts have been yummy. This last visit I had an Apple pie thing with a streudle top and brown butter ice cream. I usually don't get dessert and dinner out but I opted for the sweet over savory this time and was not disappointed as I kept looking for more ice cream to secretly lap up with my spoon. Damn, it's still on my mind. Okay, back to the subject....

Now, what I don't like... The smoke. It's EVERYWHERE you want to be. I have pretty bad allergies and smoke is my enemy. Sorry smokers...I will be nice to you but I hate your habit with much venom since it impedes my breathing. Anyway, the casino doesn't have a good ventillation system in my opinion. Unlike Vegas casinos, I always leave the Rivers with swollen eyes and inflammed sinuses like I recently started chain smoking. I wish they'd cut out a non smoking slot area for those of us who wanna take a chance at a jackpot without the carcinogen buffet. 

Lastly, the drinks...well, they leave ALOT to be desired. I'm all for businesses being in business to make money BUT it's a casino. They are indeed making money but when you do it by making extremely terrible drinks with a tablespoon of alcohol I kinda feel like I'm being played which I really dislike. So, while I may get 1 drink here (unless someone else is buying ), that's all I will order. The rest will be the free coffee and soda. 

I'm all for our great city trying to come up with the casino, I just feel they fell flat and could do more to make the experience enjoyable for all of their patrons. I just realized something....I need to book a trip back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worse casinos in the country. Even the West Virginia \"cafes\" are better. It has one of the worse payouts in the state, average at best customer service throughout the dining areas and floor and virtually non existent security. You would be safer and have more fun at the nearby Meadows casino. If you decide to come here expect to leave broke and be in constant danger."}
{"text":"Typical casino now that table games have become legal . I feel the best part of this place is food selections . The Grandview Buffett is 5 stars , especially seafood night every Friday . Try to get a table outside overlooking the river . The casino is very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights . I do like the fact that you can park in the garage for free and walk to sporting events . However , you can't have anyone under 21 with you because you must enter and exit thru the casino floor ."}
{"text":"I could prob write a damn novella about this place but I will keep it nice and simple. Rivers casino is WACK ! Wiggiety wack 

Food disgusting. That buffet is disgusting so gross, the view is nice....  The other restaurants are equally disgusting especially that small one in the front that sells French fries and onion rings and what not. I'm not sure how you can make onion rings gross but rivers has the formula.  The steakhouse/seafood tastes like the fish is old or sits out long just gross. 

Security check in the front annoying !!!!!!!!!!!! Rude rude rude. I've come here on different occasions where I have been subjected to an extensive review of my id. Asking questions like what's my address. They repeatedly ask me to smile and measure my height like absolutely ridiculous. I truly believe they get a kick out of ridiculing people!

My friend was completing her masters degree at Pitt during this time she lost a few pounds by few I mean probably about 20 the security guard proceeded to tell her that her ID was not hers she didn't look anything like her ID photo and was so rude about it. She had two different credit cards with full name that matched her ID. We called the police to verify her identification which they did no problem. Smh 

Like idk why the hell the security at rivers casino thinks they are the Secret service. It doesn't take that long to properly verify someone's identity. They swipe it through a damn machine. Half of the work is done just make sure the person is the person on the photo and make sure the id isn't expired. All the extra is just so annoying is the reason why i am writing this today. 

 This casino is the worst I've ever been to and it's so sad because Pittsburgh doesn't have a lot of entertainment the best thing about rivers is the bathrooms are clean and the free beverages ( non alcoholic)

Poor betting odds
Wack machines
You'll smell like smoke even if your in the non smoking section they must have the cheapest air ventilation system  
It's cold as hell in there"}
{"text":"Fun place to go when you're looking for something different to do.  We played video roulette and video poker at the Spiral Bar where you're permitted to smoke.  We didn't win anything but I think the full night cost us less than $60."}
{"text":"I am not a gambler.  One time, when I was 19, I played slots in Toronto and won $10 and called after a few quarters and never gambled again.  But I love to people-watch.  Which brings us to Rivers.

Rivers is flat-out depressing.  Between the lack of people in general to the video poker to the little old ladies gambling, it makes me sad.  The fact that it's super bright inside makes it even worse.  Rivers almost as sad as the poorly-lit Casino Niagara's smoky old slots that caters to really old pensioners and 19-year-old drunk American kids.  I used to live in Memphis and the Tunica, Mississippi casinos there are at least glitzier and make a better girls' night, 100%.

I've been to Rivers at several different times of day from after a weekend Pirates game to during an afternoon Steelers game and after midnight on a work day to a \"fun\" Saturday night out (spoiler: it was pretty boring).  The only time that I've seen it remotely busy --as in, a full circle of people around the craps table--is after a weekend night Pirates game.

The couple times I've been to the restaurants inside Rivers, I found them all to be wayyyy overpriced and not nearly as good as any of the joints near the Mexican War Streets.  The service as the so-called upscale steakhouse was painfully slow even though there were, like, three tables occupied.  If you really need to go to a steakhouse, go to The Capital Grille located Downtown.

The only plus is that if you are either gambling a lot OR female and standing with someone who is gambling a lot, you can get comped drinks."}
{"text":"Went to RC for the first time. Have to say this place is nowhere special and there are far better places to spend your money. The casino is typical of a gambling house. Full of poorly dressed bust-outs and the walking dead spending their social security checks and their poor deceased spouses insurance money. Now for my biggest disappointment. The buffet was the most atrocious collection of garbage I have ever seen. The food was so bad it makes one appreciate Golden Corral. There was not one item that was not old, cold, or dry. For a Friday night there was not one seafood offering save a pan of tilapia which seemed to scream \"don't eat me\". I did not complain to the manager simply because I was not looking for a freebie. Secondly, if management cared, they would not be serving disgusting food. If you do decide to waste your money on the buffet try the Mongolian station where at least you will end up with something relatively fresh and hot. I can't comment on the other eating venues at the casino because I have not tried them nor do I plan to. The bottom line is RC is a place to gamble. If you want a good buffet for Heavens sake go somewhere else. Anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the free parking. It's smells, it's dirty, if you are not a big gambler they harass you. The food sucks, unless you want a quick burger or grilled cheese. There are no bonuses in gambling...maybe a free buffet tix every so often. I read an article last week that they actually pay a monthly fine because they don't pay out enough in winnings. Go to Mountaineer and save yourself money and time."}
{"text":"This year they are taking my money...last year they were very good to me. Such the life of a gambler.

One thing that is really great is the service here. Yes, I have a slot host. I'm not big time, I just win (lose, spend, donate) enough. Thanks, Anthony...you're the best!
(Is it sad that this is the main mail that comes to my house? And, they're often handwritten notes? How about a Valentine's Day card this year?!?!)

Decent casino for the area and they do pay out."}
{"text":"Very nice building/design; however, I just wasn't feeling it inside. Visiting from Florida and my parents took me here as I've recently became a Vegas fan. We played slots for a bit and lots of nothing happening so we went to the buffet. No staff was overly memorable enough to comment about. Drink service in the casino was present; however, never when I was playing. Ended up just buying drinks. I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The employees at this location were incredibly helpful and eager to please the atmosphere wasn't what I was expecting but the employees really made up for it. My friend asked where the bathroom was and they physically escorted to them.  the customer service was incredible"}
{"text":"First casino I visited in PA. Convenient location, ample parking in the garage and security is great too. Layout of the casino is very good with a diverse choice of slots (I am pretty much a slot player - so I cannot say much abt table games here but they look well visited)."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the many delicious vegetarian options @ Rivers buffet. Beans & greens I believe braised in white wine, pasta fagioli, quinoa w veggies, cucumber in sesame oil w walnuts! Creamy tomato soup w bread crumbs & Italian herbs.
Usually buffets are full of meat products & not much for the vegetarians; we had many brilliant choices for dinner. It was lovely"}
{"text":"My first casino outside of either vegas or A.C

When you seen one casino I think you have seen them all really despite fancy layouts to some   Upstairs was very nice overlooking the river with a cool venue with seats outside. This is a nice step in the right direction for a city that still uses trolly cars and horse&buggy to get around.

The bar had some crazy neon lights and post art deco crap...reminds me of Call of Duty Black Ops Plaza(guys know what Im talking about).

The food was average and the staff were not the most friendly of people and my god are you slow cashing my chips in.

The casino itself was ok.  I wanted to play blackjack so bad but 90% of the tables were 50 dollar buy ins and for the few that weren't there were lines to play. 

Did anyone else see across the river the Trivia question billboard with the red lights running down the hillside?  Neat."}
{"text":"Wheelhouse lounge in Casino was very slow service. \"signature\" Fries are terrible, fresh fish sandwich good but oily, Italian sausage ok, wedding soup was tasty. Large screen sports bar is nice but drafty in the back. There is better food in the Casino, probably won't go here again.

Forget this place, pay a little more and go to Andrews."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here my first time. The layout can be a little overwhelming at first, but I'm sure I'll get used to it as I visit more often. Absolutely loved the self serve fountain drinks, coffee/tea and water. The bar was very busy, but the bartenders were beyond attentive and kind. Overall, it was a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. 

The service tends to be rather nasty. I lived in Vegas for two years and never walked into a casino as anal about checking ID's right at the door and grilling you about the info on your license to see if it is accurate or not. I am definitely not about them yelling at you when you are not standing in the painted footprints in front of the guard stand. They have also made inappropriate comments about an individual in our party and made them where some weird identifying bracelet. 

The bartender had a slighted comment for another person in our group. When noticing the bartender wearing Steelers apparel they tried befriending the bartender by saying let's go Steelers, only to be shot down with a negative comment. 

They are lucky they are the only casino in Pittsburgh or they would have problems keeping repeat business. The meadows in Washington PA is a better experience. Or better yet do yourself a favor and just save it all up and take a trip to Vegas.

Round 2- 

Went back a second time to try it out again. Same issues... Smokey... The security team acts like pissed off prison guards... This time we went to the buffet and got the crab and got incredibly sick... Christian if you are reading this, do something please!!! All of these people are not lying."}
{"text":"To summarize the Rivers Casino is a joke.

I don't like it I have gone once or twice but never will they get another dime from me!!!

I lost 7 dollars on my first trip and I think that scarred me, I've read in the paper that The Rivers Casino isn't doing so hot financially. Go figure who  builds a Casino during record high unemployment rates and a recession, it's just plain sad. 

Their hotdog special is a laugh, who wants to spends tons of money at a place that has the audacity to only offer a hot dog special. Geez. 

The inside is very nice looking and clean and well maintained for now, and there is lovely water feature in the main entrance, I am just underwhelmed by the whole idea of the Rivers Casino 

I would like it more if that space could have gone to something more family orientated. 

I certainly don't think the Rivers is here to stay."}

WHY DON'T YOU GO TO JOE'S CASINO IN UNIONTOWN.!
Nuff said.!!"}
{"text":"I can't review anything other than the front door because we weren't allowed in!  Our group was comprised of two couples.  We arrived around 11:00 a.m. (waiting on a Pirates game).  The other lady and I had backpack purses and backpacks aren't permitted however purses the size of suitcases are.  Oh, but not suitcases either.  Seriously?  If you cut the straps off my backpack it's a purse!  The guard didn't offer any suggestions - look through it, park it somewhere, etc.  She just said they \"aren't permitted on the property\".  Needless to say, we took our money elsewhere.  We had a nice lunch at McFadden's and enjoyed a Pirate's game, where backpacks ARE acceptable.  Go figure."}
{"text":"I've been to many a casino in my short over 21 life. Well short in comparison to being 100 and never once have I had to pay for a drink. I was so shocked that there isn't house drinks!!! Every casino I've ever been to has house drinks!! That being said I like that there's a non smoking section for people like me who have struggled to quit and don't need the temptation. Also Bryan won one of the poker tournaments a few month back so that's encouraging and we hit big on roulette which is my fav game. I just can't get beyond the drink thing though. If I'm going to give away money the least you can do is give me a free drink to help me cope with my loss."}
{"text":"Yikes! Parking's a nightmare in their garage, walk into the garage elevator corridor and you're knocked over by cigarette smoke.  Gross, in this day and age it's probably the last public venue for smoking.  Why they allow it here is beyond me. I will not be returning. I'd rather go to Niagara.

The casino is filled with slots, a holdover from when they prohibited table games.

Drinks are goofy, but they have a soft drink freebie station.

For my money I'm going elsewhere, but if you need a somewhat decent place on the North Shore, this will suffice I guess."}
{"text":"A casino usually has various means for gamblers to fork over cash, but the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh has acre upon acre of nothing but slot machines. It's pretty lame. Plenty of retired people on oxygen strapped to their walkers as they light up another cigarette while they slide a twenty into the slot in front of them. 

There are restaurants, buffets, and lame attempts at entertainment, but a casino this is not. Maybe if they got some table games it would be, but in its current incarnation this is just another sad attempt for a struggling city to make cash from a cash-strapped community."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so so awful. I'll never go here again. The cigarette smoke destroys any atmosphere this place has. It's overbearing everywhere and everything smells like smoke, even the beverage cups. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and like other casinos and everything in PA this casino has no real atmosphere. It's boring.

It doesn't take you to a new place, the surroundings are just a room with slot machines in it to appeal to the simpletons of Pittsburgh who have no imagination.

There is a non smoking section but you would never know it from all the smoke that is there. There are some nice restaurants and a good buffet here. 

They used to have a giant chandelier above one of the bars that would light up and every 15 minutes it would play a musical show with dancing lights. It's broken and they probably will never fix it. With the millions they make each month they should be able to do so.

You can also walk outside by the river which maybe more interesting.

Outside is an outdoor amphitheater and you can see the rivers from the windows and buffet.
The slot machines here are tight and I never win. All in all there it's a very boring casino."}
{"text":"Last night I hung out with some friends I haven't seen in awhile, and we decided to start our night at Rivers Casino. 

I like the casino for a number of different reasons. My top three are:

1. Great atmosphere. From the moment you exit the elevators from the parking garage into the casino floor, you can feel the energy.

2. Diverse entertainment options. From live jazz playing in Levels Lounge, to live bands in Wheelhouse, to a club DJ in the Drum Bar, there are options for every taste.

3. Awesome location. Very easy to access from any major highway around the city- and you can't beat the free parking. 

I really love coming here in the summer months too, especially when they have their outside summer concerts right on the river. 

If you haven't checked it out yet, you'll have to go. There's a lot more to do here than just gamble."}
{"text":"Finally, just what we've allllll been waiting for. 

Sarcasm aside, this place turned out classier than expected, and if I squinted my eyes a bit I almost felt like I was in Vegas (until the cocktail waitress asked if 'yinz want a crab cake?'). 

Anyway, I was lucky to come on a soft-opening (VIP/charity) day, so the crowds were at a minimum and you could really check out the facilities. 

Machines are organized into smoking and non-smoking sections, and they have \"video\" table-games which are as close as you'll currently get to a dealer for now. With these there's actually a huge flat-screen tv with a real (recorded) person 'dealing' to you. 

Everything was super clean, but new, sooo that's expected. 

One thing I do have to point out is the lame names of the bars within the casino. Spiral bar? Drum bar?? Levels??? Really???? 

Anyway, the bottom line is I was expecting the worst - and was somewhat surprised. You definitely have to check it out at least once. 

I personally can't wait and return when it's open to the public and it's just a sea of black & gold (I mean literally - the number of steelers/pens/pirates? jerseys will be amazing)."}
{"text":"For my 200th review I guess i shall delve into the casino.  Let me start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of any casino.  In fact this was the first time I visited in over three years.  So why would I consider stepping foot into the casino and then proceed to write a review, well let me tell ya.

I came to attend an event at the Drum Bar located within.  I was unaware that they were able to accommodate special events here.  I really don't want to go much into the Drum Bar right now because that will be another review later.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there is much more to do at the casino than just gamble.  So much so that I didn't even notice the slot machines for a majority of the night.  

With a different variety of foods at the restaurants throughout it's easy to find something to please your palate.  Everyone raves about the buffet and I would be one of those people too.  Tons to choose from, even if it's a bit pricey, it's still worth it.  Gift shop located inside as well.

This place is also nice to just walk around in.  It is a very wide open place and doesn't feel like you are trapped inside.  The views of the city are amazing, you get the right angle and you get a spectacular view of downtown.  And the view of the West End and Mt. Washington isn't too bad either.

I may have to come down here a few more times to experience all the other places to chill out at."}
{"text":"Grand Buffet Sunday Brunch at Rivers Casino - I guess I was expecting it to be \"grander.\"  It was very similar to the buffets in the Las Vegas casinos.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing horrible either.  One good thing - your beverages are included in the price and if you have a player's card (which is free), you save 10% on your brunch (not the whole group unless everyone has a card).  All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"Rivers is a nice property for the people of Pittsburgh to visit. However, it is pretty plain in terms of many casinos I've visited in the past.

It's disappointing that alcoholic drinks are not complimentary while playing at this casino. Its distance from its east coast competitors allow it to charge for beverages ordered on the floor. There are some locations to pour yourself a complimentary soft drink while visiting the location.

The dealers are friendly and conversant here. The machines were \"tight\" and didn't offer a lot of entertainment for the money spent during our visit.

They have all the amenities you would expect a few bars, a buffet, and some restaurants. Overall, there's nothing too amazing or excellent about this casino."}
{"text":"I'm sad. 

I really enjoy playing poker and I was excited that Pittsburgh has a casino with poker tables. 

Unfortunately they're fatally flawed. 

1.  They allowed a player to have his phone on loud ring at the table. 

2. He answered a call in the middle of a hand. Then he proceeded to babble and play while standing during the hand. 

3. On the next hand he played with his phone during the action while he was in the hand. Standing at the table. Playing with his phone. I'm the middle of action. 

4. When this behavior was brought to the attention of the dealer and the floor manager neither took any action as apparently this type of grossly uncivilized behavior is tolerated in this pseudo-casino. 

5. It's just tatty and rundown. See attached photo of the peeling wallpaper in the gross bathroom. 

I love my city. 

This casino does not meet the standards I expect for my beloved city. We should be better than this. 

Rivers Casino - seriously dude. Unscrew yourself."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Rivers Casino.  We ate at the cafe.  The food was much better than we expected. We spent some time at the bar with friends and the bartender mixed great drinks and was very friendly. The only negative comment would be that the dealers are not very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and I must say that it is no Vegas casino, I was impressed with it.

The place is nicely laid out and and like any proper casino has table games, slots, cafes, restaurants, and bars all under one roof.  They also offer free parking in their parking garage, a rarity for anything so close to Downtown."}
{"text":"The buffet is outstanding. Free Mimosas on Sunday is the best deal going. Parking is free unless there's a game then its $50+ to park. The Drum Bar is great for drinks. I want to try Wheelhouse I've heard good things about it. I'm not big on gambling so I spend very little time on the gaming floor. It's always open and a great outing in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The Rivers is a great spot downtown to play some slots or table games! They have non-smoking sections, a wide variety of machines, beverage service, great buffets with a ton of freshly made cuisines and free parking. Everything is incredibly clean, too! The machines are usually pretty tight but it's still fun to go!"}
{"text":"I was excited when Pittsburgh built the Rivers Casino. It rivals the Meadows in Washington County. It isn't as flashy or lavish as those in Vegas or Atlantic City or other city casinos I have been to. Rivers is boring and plan, but it's home. As accessible by car, bus or the T. Parking is free. 

We are not big gamblers and always set a limit for ourselves when we arrive. I am not a slots player, but they do have a huge selection of penny slots, five cents and above to offer those slot slaves. 

I do prefer the table games. 

The staff and guards have always been pleasant to speck to and friendly.  The events the casino offers through out the year are with the visit alone. 

Highly recommended a visit !!"}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place already, but I decided to write an update. Christian P. of the Rivers casino commented on my original post that they had a 1 cent Walking Dead machine and a supposed 32k+ win on it on the past ten days. I went back last night for a work event to search for this machine. I asked the player's club and several slot attendants, there isn't a 1 cent Walking Dead machine! Can't believe anything he says. I have to assume there wasn't a massive win on a machine that doesn't exist at this casino. 

I'll repeat, the 1 cent denomination machines are almost nonexistent and I've never won anything remotely substantial there. Go to the Meadows or ANYWHERE else. I'll never give this dump my business again."}
{"text":"While maintaining a nice atmosphere, and great views of the river, the casino itself is a great place to lose a ton of money fast.  Not once have I won on the slots, and most blackjack tables are continuous shufflers which put the player at a huge disadvantage.  Usually it's just put your money down, or in the machine, and lose it quickly. 

The drinks at the bars are ridiculously expensive.  The mixed drinks are weak and the beer was warm. WARM!  

The Buffet is pretty good though, and has a good bit to offer.  The food is always fresh and tastes good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why others don't like it, it's a casino, not a theater or showplace like some out in Vegas. Parking is free (except maybe during Pirates or Steelers games), the view along the river was nice, I didn't stick around for dinner but the restaurants looked OK. 

Yeah, no free alcohol drinks but soft drinks were free and it's pretty easy to build up points for free meals. 

Maybe my having a winning day on my way home helped with the rating, its always nice to leave with more than you started with."}
{"text":"Like many others, I'm really torn on my review of the Rivers Casino. To begin with, anything that adds to the diversity of activities in a city is always a plus. It's definitely something different to do in Raleigh and definitely worth checking out at least once to form your own opinion. 

On the other hand, I'm not much a gambler and that which I do play (blackjack) typically starts at $10/$15 depending on the evening. Thus, I usually end up sitting at a table in the Drum bar and enjoying the beautiful view of the rivers and the point. I will say, surprisingly, the drink prices are not horrible and the smoke definitely isn't too bad when you're sitting in there. Although, like some have mentioned, you will go home with the smell on you. 

I haven't eaten at any of the restaurants; however, last time I went was with a member of the Triple Diamond Club. If my review was based on that alone I would certainly give the Rivers 4 or 5 stars. The drinks are far cheaper in the club and the free buffet is typically pretty good: prime rib, shrimp cocktail, a great dessert selection, etc. However, I'm betting that the amount of money that it would take to get to this level is better spent on a nice dinner at one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh. 

So if you haven't been yet, I would definitely recommend checking it out at least once. While it's not my favorite place in Pittsburgh (and certainly doesn't compare to Vegas), it offers an  interesting alternative activity for an evening out."}
{"text":"Not bad for a local casino, but keep in mind this isn't Vegas.

It is to Pittsburgh what the Horseshoe is to Cleveland. It is a gathering place geared towards keeping younger crowds (who don't know how to play basic strategy - more on that later) and older degenerates in downtown.

I want to like the blackjack here. State rules on blackjack are extremely favorable. However, management here decided to install continuous shuffle machines onto most table games, which I despise. The rules are still amazing (as are the table minimums), but the CSMs take away from the games itself by \"randomizing\" each game.

People here do not know how to play blackjack. I'm dead fucking serious. I've seen people stay on a 14 vs. a dealer 7 and on a 12 vs. a dealer 10. Who in their right mind would do that? If you want to win money, learn how to play the game first. Jesus titty-fucking Christ.

I can't comment on the buffet here; however, the bars here really are good.

I'd check this place out if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Met some friends for a birthday dinner at the Grandview Buffet on a Saturday evening.  

Was pretty easy to get to by car and I was immediately herded to the 7th floor of the parking garage upon arrival.  From their I descended into the Casino and made my way to the Wheelhouse Bar to meet some people.  I'm not a gambler so I nervously passed by all the flashy lights.

All of the food and drinks are MAD EXPENSIVE.  I mean, I understand it's a casino, but this is Pittsburgh, they easily added a 100-200% markup to what you would pay anywhere else.  OK, enough about money.

The food at the buffet was good.  It was a bit like a dormitory cafeteria.  There are different stations with things like \"Asian\", \"American\" and \"BBQ\" and \"Dessert.\"  I chowed a lot of the BBQ and Italian and it was all pretty good.  I think dessert was a little lacking.

After the dinner, we hung out for a while in the Drum Bar, which was nice but played a lot of random music.

It was a weird night.  I have no intentions to go back."}
{"text":"Winner-Winner - Chicken Dinner

I won!   All I can say is that the casino was nice and clean.    The people were friendly.

I played some blackjack and won big so all i can say is \"Woohoo!\"

I will be back - I found a chip I have to cashin :-)"}
{"text":"This is my first time being in a casino, it was pretty okay albeit I didn't win anything on the slots. I did have a great time playing black jack the dealer was honestly so kind and patient with me. He even gave me good advice. So all in all it's a decent casino especially for the area. I'd probably come back in the future."}
{"text":"Way too much cigarette smell, I felt like passing out nicoderm patches.  Just saying!"}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to come here because of the reviews, can't be around smoke.
Decided to just go and I'm so glad I did.
The place is HUGE- clean and did NOT smell like smoke at all!!!!
They are laying down new carpet @6pm tonight-- the slots were very loose. Won $173.00 + $46 + $36
All in the clear!!
Lots of tables such as blackjack, roulette etc.

Nice casino!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Rivers since it opened 7 years ago.  I have read a lot of these reviews and am just amazed that it gets a lot of bad ratings.  I have never encountered a rude employee, in fact, just the reverse, everyone has been great.  Of course it's not Vegas but I enjoy the time I spend there.  For anyone who complains about machines being \"tight\" and not winning, if you go to any casino with the attitude that you are going to hit a jackpot, that's just delusional.  I only spend what I can afford to lose so if I win (which I do quite often) it's just a plus for me.  Food is fairly good, have lots of slots and many table games.  My only complaint is that I used to get offers on my mobile app.  Haven't seen anything in over a year.  Did they quit that?"}
{"text":"Love this place, game day was packed, but loved the prices on draft or bottled beers, played some slots won money, drank for free , great day if you ask me. Smokers rejoice, the liberals haven't killed it. I'll be back again. Love this place."}
{"text":"The Rivers Casino, always has a lot of people sitting at slot machines, not playing, I think it should be the responsibility of the casino to have these people move, and not the user."}
{"text":"By far the tightest machines in Pennsylvania,WV, Ohio. Rivers charges you double to win the grand on a Machine . If it's three dollars at the meadows to win the grand on a machine ,because you have to play 
max bet ,it's six dollars at the rivers for the same machine! Well (Robert B from the rivers casino), maybe I'll get you PICTURES of the exact machines that you have and the exact machines that the meadows have , to show you the difference! For instance ,You charge $8.80 max bet on a machine, for the EXACT machine at the meadows its $4.40 max bet!  Get it together !!"}
{"text":"Great place for smokers, if you don't smoke your options are, well...a bit slim.

They offer free pop and coffee in at least 2 locations within the casino and have a variety of restaurants including the buffet located on the second floor."}
{"text":"Let's just say if you are a smoker you will be thrilled with the place. If you aren't, run away. It was disgusting. The ventilation system in this place doesn't exist. Take that and the super tight slots and we will never be back. Spent a few hundred and would lose $20 in a few minutes. I kept trying to give it a shot bc it's gambling after all, but this was plain ridiculous. What's the point of just throwing money away like that?"}
{"text":"Meh. Although a lot better than mountaineer and it does quench my gambling thirst, the dealers, pit bosses are mostly awful. As a frequent visitor to Vegas (I know, who can compare), I would say that the service Rivers provides is awful.

The comps are bad (don't even bother getting a player card) the dealers are awful (i had dealers take my money when they shouldn't have on MULTIPLE occasions) and the pit bosses are SO rude. Granted my favorite (Tony) is awesome. 

I once cashed in for 2 thousand at the BJ table with my bf and there was a chair missing. I asked the pit boss where I could find the nearest chair (i didn't ask him to get me one, mind you) and he just told me I could stand.. WTH?

I wouldn't visit this place again, i rather go to vegas.. you know.. where the REAL casinos and experienced dealers are."}
{"text":"This was definitely a nice surprise!  A casino in Pittsburgh!  My husband and I absolutely love to gamble, so we were happy!  I won the whole time I played, so I left with more than I started with (that never happens).  I don't give 5 stars because this is the only casino I have ever been to that doesn't have free drinks for players.  Boo!  

B-"}
{"text":"This is a review of the brunch buffet. 

I sort of wish that I would have passed on this place and saved a few bucks, but it was alright. I would have preferred this place as a lunch buffet over a brunch buffet. Some of the better looking food was too heavy for my brunch-taste. 
There are, however, bottomless mimosas! One star for those little gems, and one star for pretty good service (even on New Years Day). 

I'd skip a lot of the stuff they have and go straight for crab legs, and I would spend more time cracking than talking to get my fill. 

Maybe I'll give it another go, but then again, maybe not. I hear good things about the Harris Grill Brunch."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. Lost my money on a Ladybug penny machine and had some drinks. If you like casinos you will like it if you don't like them then you won't like it. The place is beautiful and overlooks the water."}
{"text":"We decided to try the buffet because we heard good things about it. Seldom have we been so disappointed. The food quality was way below average. You are dependent upon the servers for beverage service. Service was scarce to say the least. We were not offered a second cup of coffee until we were getting up to leave. Most dishes we tried were tasteless. The Philly Steak Cassarole and the Crab Spinach concoction tasted as though they were made from the same tasteless batter. 

We can suggest several places nearby that are better bets."}
{"text":"If you've been to Vegas, or a casino in the islands, or Monaco -- Rivers isn't for you.  While we rate Andrew's Steakhouse as excellent in both service and food, the casino is just \"meh\".  Agreeing with Darren, the waitresses scurry around looking busy, but rarely, if ever, ask if you want a drink.  The one time I was able to flag one down, she was clearly pissed.  And, don't bother to dress up -- ANYTHING goes.  (See, e.g, \"People of Walmart\")."}
{"text":"the casino is there to make money, not for you to make money.

this is no las vegas casino environment, although I was only 12 when I visited Vegas so my memory is 10+ years old, but it's pretty unique inside for Pittsburgh. I've always enjoyed the water fountain inside the front doors.

 I've only won once-- okay twice,the 2nd was $5. my boyfriend put $1 in a penny machine then hit max bet & we won $60.  i usually decide we should go somewhere else when he brings up he wants to go.... you lose more altogether than total winnings.

fyi- dont waste your time or money at penny machines. the one time I won also meant a lot of losing 2 other days that I spent 10 minutes there. I graduated to the quarter machine now-- the 2 days of the year that I end up here."}
{"text":"Not a good casino. Free parking garage is convenient and so is the proximity to the train. I also really, really enjoyed my Sunday breakfast there at the buffet. However - these aren't exactly traits a good casino should aspire to put forward.

Here's the thing - this entire place STINKS of smoke. I'm a non-smoker, so when it hits me, it really hits me. And it hit me both when I walked in the entrance and again when I returned from the buffet. No matter how long I spent in the non-smoking section it didn't matter. And, there were at least six people smoking in the non-smoking sections. What a joke.

Rivers, you have to understand a lot of us don't ask much from a casino. If the place is clean, serves a good coffee, and the people are nice, guys like me will hang out and spend money all night long even if we're losing. But you suck - hard - at the fundamentals, like managing air.

I travel through here often, and I've been here many times. I told myself this past time if the place still stunk, I'd Yelp it and not return. So, there you go."}
{"text":"I visited Rivers Casino many times since it opened. I gambled a little bit on the slot machines (never played the tables) and never won anything. I ate at the Grand View Buffet many times. I did enjoy the all-you-can-eat crab, but often it was overcooked. The steakhouse Andrew's Steak and Seafood had food that was just OK (e.g., shell and little meat in my crab cakes, overly thick creme brulee). The reason why I stopped being a customer at this casino was the way that I was always treated at the door. I am in my 30s, but I was treated as if I am a juvenile delinquent. One time several security officers (several! why not just one?) were waiting for me at the entrance. They had spotted me on their camera when I was in the parking garage. They inspected my ID and questioned me for several minutes. I thought that their reaction was extreme and inappropriate. After dealing with similar incidents for several visits, I stopped going to this casino. My husband wanted to go for his birthday, and the thought put me in such a bad mood, that he ended up choosing another place."}
{"text":"I do love the Casino.  It is the best Casino in Pittsburgh...ok it's the only Casino in Pittsburgh.  One of the nice things is I usually get carded when I walk in.  

I love playing slots of all kinds.  The high roller room is a great place to win big money.  There is always someone winning in that room.

The bartenders are very nice but you will pay more at the bar than with a waitress not including tip.  The hard thing is to actually find a waitress.

I do agree with the other reviews in that there is alot of smoke inside.  There are non smoking sections but I always go home smelling like smoke.

They usually have specials on the weekends and great entertainment.  The concerts in the summer on the water are fantastic.  The bands that play at the Levels bar are also fabulous.  Drum bar usually has some dance music playing.  The Spiral Bar is usually good if you want to take in the baseball game and have a drink.

I love the seats at the Levels bar.  They offer sofas and seats that are very comfortable and moveable to accomodate any size group.

The Casino is great for anyone.  You can sit and relax, listen to entertainment, or take a gamble."}
{"text":"This in the worst casino I've been in. The cigarette smoke alone should tell you this place is low class and not inviting. Virtually no place to sit and relax if your tired or if you spouse is gambling and your not."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Rivers since its opening, fun time for a group of people or a couple wanting to do something different. Positive Note-enjoy the food at The Wheelhouse; food is consistent, servers are knowledgeable and friendly. Buffet-food is not unique, and I think bland. Andrews-excellent. The Women's room is always clean; and their is always a woman working very hard to keep it clean. 
Negative Note-\"Smoke\"!!! It is impossible to sit in the non-smoking area and not be affected by the smell. Ventilation is very poor; why have smokers in the casino?? I think more people would visit if the smoking was eliminated. Also, Drum Bar has probably one of the best visual locations in the casino. Each and every time, same problem; not open yet, and you have plenty of people wanting a drink. When open, usually one bartender? During our visit; it was 6:30pm (outdoor concert nite), the bartender was setting up; the bar sign said opening @ 6? 2 to 3 deep at the bar.  No waitress for the tables. 
The bartender thought it was only 5? We asked for a glass of wine; no wine key; she left for 20 min to find the key. Returning she was carrying many large plastic bins of fruit. (Poor thing, she was frantic) we asked her if she got the wine key; she forgot? Finally, after patiently waiting for 40 minutes we left. 
I can't understand the \"Drum Bar\" location is a valuable piece of real estate, and could be generating more $$, if it was managed properly. 
We will keep returning. And thank you!"}
{"text":"Flashing lights, lots of noise, pushing buttons, etc.  Either I just described a toy you buy for a two year old, or the reasons I like casinos. Well, I like casinos! Something about total sensory overload combined with the promise of turning my $20 into $24. That's how I roll. 
I've never been to Vegas, but I've visited numerous casinos so I have a decent basis of comparison. Riverboat casinos in St. Louis, Greektown gambling in Detroit, some stellar facilities in Canada, and other local-ish casinos in the area, like Mountaineer and The Meadows. Compared to the local competitors, Rivers is sprawling and feels much cleaner.  From my driveway to Rivers Casino is literally a 4 minute drive, which is pretty nice twice a year or so when the mood strikes me to play some nickel slots.
The smoke in this place is ridiculous. Beyond unbearable. Even the non-smoking section is smokey. The ventilation system is subpar and the designated smoking area seems to take up 75% of the casino floor. The boundaries are not enforced and gamblers walk with their lit cigs anywhere they want. My clothes are always carefully chosen when knowing I'll end up at Rivers to ensure I can throw everything directly into the wash immediately upon getting home. Why in 2013 is there still smoking allowed indoors?!?! 
The food here is unexciting. Hardly any vegetarian choices and what I have found to eat here has fallen somewhere between lackluster and downright nasty. I've had better food at a roller skating rink concession stand.
Please ban smoking at Rivers. I don't want to have to drive to Canada every time I want an enjoyable casino experience."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the rivers casino. 
How do you define a good time at a casino. 
I left with more money than when I went in. That includes drinking and eating and gambling. 

Drinks are reasonable in price. And the food was pretty good. 

The taxi situation is a little off but if that's the worst thing about your night then it's been good."}
{"text":"I love the view that this casino sits on (fantastic location especially if your a hometown sports fan) however when it comes to playing slots machines and poker tables it's easy come easy go."}
{"text":"Awesome, fun, and different, Pittsburgh bars and barely existent club scene only get you so far. When you're getting bored of your usual haunts, cross the river and you can gamble! And watch old ladies and men with oxygen tanks play slot machines. 

Sure, it's no Vegas or even Reno but you also don't have to fly anywhere. Parking is free and valet is available. Great way to spend an afternoon or an evening."}
{"text":"We used to love going to Rivers and you'd actually hit something on their slots. Over the years my kids and I have become Signature members but seriously you are not treated any better!  Yes you get a host (which we had a wonderful guy, Anthony who would stop by to talk with us and give us free play or comps but he's no longer with them) after he left we were thrown between several different ones until we finally got a permanent one. She's nice but has said Rivers made a lot of changes and they can't give you free play now on days they give you any (which now they find a way to give you even $10-20 so it covers them from handing out anymore). Which $$20 doesn't go far.  So even if you're $500-$5000 in hole doesn't matter to them and being a Signature has no clout.  So why bother!!  Their machines are so tight you can't win anything and if you do it seems you're penalized and don't win again for months. Over the years we've met a lot of nice friends there and they've said the same thing and refuse to go back. Well we feel the same way. It's not worth it!!  Save your money or go to Meadows or Wheeling.  We get so much more free play and are treated so much nicer and you actually hit something there and come home with money. Even at Meadows they bumped us up to the Gold-Platinum level and every so many days send me at least $60 plus in free play. Their Adios room compared to the 446 at Rivers is so much nicer and much better food."}
{"text":"The Casino is what it is. I was disappointed that we couldn't find a place for my Mom to dance, but if you exercise some restraint, playing the slot machines can be fun. I also like the valet parking, which is super convenient. I wouldn't come here often, but again, it is what it is."}
{"text":"Too much smoke for me.... won't be back. Rocky Gap is closer and I don't have to second hand smoke a pack of cigs while I play or leave smelling like an ashtray..:)"}
{"text":"Im Pittsburgh for work and I decided to stop by the casino. It's a nice casino with a wide selection of games. 
My only and biggest issue with this place is the excessive SMOKE! 
I'm a Maryland girl and we don't allow smoke in ANY public establishment"}
{"text":"People watching that's better than the airport....I promise.  2 1/2 stars.  The 1/2 is for the non-smoking section, which was greatly appreciated.  Drinks at the bar were $5, not bad.  Live jazz as well.  All parking is free now.  It looks so much bigger on the outside than it is on the inside.  Must be for all the parking.
Didn't get to scream \"Winner, winner, chicken dinner\" as I did my share supporting the Pittsburgh economy.  Damn slots."}
{"text":"Please get your ID. It's not like caesers or MGM. Though indoor free parking is good."}
{"text":"When your wife win $1000+ you have to give five stars!!! The good: staff everywhere, spacious never felt trapped, tons of slots and great number of tables. The great; location, view and parking. The not as good: Smoke, I almost forgot that PA isn't Smoke free in 2018? Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Parking is a bit insane, especially on a Friday.  It's free, but there was a huge line and from what I heard shortly after I found a parking space, they were completely full.  And this garage is massive!  So just keep that in mind if you plan on going on a heavy traffic evening.

As for the inside, I was very impressed.  Maybe b/c it still has that new building glimmer, but I didn't even feel like I was in Pittsburgh anymore.  There were slots everywhere, I couldn't really see the table games - I guess they're tucked away - or maybe I wasn't paying attention.  There were also a ton of people of all ages. 

Everywhere you looked there was a bar or a restaurant.  I'm not much of a gambler so I can't really comment on any of that.  I would think this would be a great place for a group of friends just looking for something different to do in the 'Burgh.  

I'd definitely like to go back again!"}
{"text":"Poker Room Review (only):

I always look for the good things Casino's have to offer and Rivers Casino started off doing things right. The desk staff was very helpful in getting me started with a comp card and telling me about the games. It was my first time here and the only gaming I wanted to do was play some poker.

The poker room was a good size 30 or 40 tables and it had the usual games NL, LH and Omaha. While I will never critic the level of play of players, the games were active with lots of action.

My objection with the facility was the lack of cleanliness. The poker room was littered with beer bottles, water bottles, plates, napkins, etc. It was just not only my area of play, it was throughout the poker room. I have played in most of the poker rooms in Vegas and AC; and have enjoyed a facility that has pride in keeping a room well maintain.

Additionally, the bathroom had no hand soap. This is bad on my book for a plethora of reasons. While I did see the bathroom service a couple of times it still lacked soap. While I mention to staff about soap situation; I just found another bathroom fully stocked at the other end of the Casino.

Would I come back; yes, if I happen to be in town. It seems the Rivers Casino is the only game around so, putting up with some dirty floors and so on, is not the end of the world. Water and soda is comp, but beer and liquor you pay. Corona at $4.50 not bad, but com'on man I need to be Comped."}
{"text":"I just unenjoyed my last time at the Rivers playing tables. They would not let me grandfather into the table my last bet by a few dollars. Not a way to treat customers. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"What a shit hole!  Been going there since it opened and didn't mind the low class, dark decor due to reasonable and fair winning percentage.  However over the last 12-18 months have really reduced visits due to zero winning percentage!   Food sucks, seats torn, stained, and WET!  Place is simply a hangout for drugs perverts and crime, won't go back ever again! There are other places to gamble that are so much nicer!!!"}
{"text":"Need a spark for fun? Pull a few penny slots, order a few shots of vodka, or try to gamble your luck at Rivers to hit that fruitful jackpot.

Likes: Fun and enjoyable place for you and your friends' entertainment, friendly dealers, bartenders are spot-on with mixed drinks and orders, and the restrooms are well clean.

Dislikes: It can get crowded real quick (especially when there are Steelers, Penguins, Pirates or even Hounds' game or any other event occurring in the downtown area), parking is ridiculous even though it's free, the casino is pretty small if you truly looked at the entire layout so there is little to no room for walking, and the security isn't very secure.

Overall, Rivers is an exciting casino to spend your few bucks or hefty paycheck. Can't go wrong with one of many Pittsburgh's hotspots!"}
{"text":"Was here a few years ago (4-5 yrs ago). Put $20 in won $500 on a quarter machine. I never ever win at slots anywhere else except Vegas, so that was really nice. Haven't been back since (I live out of state) but I'd love to go back when I visit family again."}
{"text":"I would give this joint a 5 star review just for the giant man with a FUPA the size of little Italy, who wore tight cotton shorts, an \"I like my attitude problem\" shirt, and Velcro sneakers. He was bent over the side of a craps table, holding on for dear life, as he pissed away more of his hard earned (govt assistance requires someone working hard) cash. Seriously, it was epic. 

The Grandview Buffet was good. It's no Bellagio buffet, but the food quality is above average with a nice range of choices. I like to remind people
That if a buffet has 400 types of cuisine, it's highly likely that they all will give you dysentery by the time you waddle out of the casino. They had nice, fresh salad bar, peel & eat shrimp, several types of food (Chinese, Italian, Mongolian BBQ, American), and a dessert station that served treats in mini containers, and nice small portions. At the end of a buffet, most people want to taste a little of each dessert & these sizes were perfect & left for less wasting of food. 

The casino smelled like what I would imagine's eminem's mom's trailer smells like. 

Oh & parking was free. I dont get it when people criticize the aesthetics of a concrete parking structure. Most are ugly. A garage is A-OK in my book, as long as it's not a poorly lit death trap with one of those spiral exit/entry ramps that give leave you dizzy, nauseous, and fearing you will scrape the side of your car the whole way up/down a level. Giving the place a 3 because of the smoke."}
{"text":"Visited the casino after a disappointing loss from my Steelers :(.
The place was nice and clean, the smoke was not too overwhelming.
The drinks were good and the crowd was great. Normally, I am used to a bunch of drunk,
loud, noisy kids but the atmosphere was energetic without being too overwhelming.
The dealers are friendly and take the time to explain \"special bets\" and rules I didn't know.
I ended up breaking even $100 and my $65 valet parking was comped!
I would come here again."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the Rivers Casino. Its clean, modern and classy. I lost $10 in one minute on the penny slots. It happened so fast I can't believe it actually happened at all. There is a smoking and non-smoking section, but there are so many smokers and the entire area is filled with cigarette smoke. Parking is free and so is pop and coffee.  This is a really nice place to hang out if you're a senior citizen and/or have money."}
{"text":"Casinos:: What to say about Rivers Casino
     We haven't been here in quite sometime and hubby likes to play cards so we decided to head to Pittsburgh for the day. The atmosphere was a lot of fun and busy because the penguins were playing that being said traffic was crazy in downtown Pittsburgh . People were happy and having a good time so it made for a fun night of gambling. For the smoker it does get pretty smokey in this casino when it's busy but they do have a non smoking side. 
     Grabbed a bite to eat and wasn't disappointed at all we had burgers and chicken sandwiches and our food was actually really good and service was awesome. 
     If you run out of money at least you can take a walk along the River so you have something to do while your waiting on your friends who don't want to leave because they are winning. 
     The slots weren't to bad considering some of the casinos I have been to lately. We played all day had dinner and headed back home after the game was over. 
   Something to do when your bored....."}
{"text":"I appreciate the comment from Christian, however as I mentioned in my review the non-smoking section is not well ventilated so the smoke is still overwhelming for the non-smokers."}
{"text":"I visited casino for the first time in a long time for a holiday party. This was the first time that I had been at the casino for an event.

The party was hosted in the Ohio Room on one of the upper levels past the Drum Bar. The casino was decorated for the holidays, especially with the lighting within the escalator area having green and red lights. The Ohio Room wasn't magnificently large, but held a decent amount of people and gave a view of the city. The food catered was also better than I expected, including fresh veggies and freshly made pasta.

The event provided us with a $10 to play downstairs in the casino, so we made our way down to check things out. After taking a little longer than I would have expected to get set up on a machine, we played a few rounds on different machines. The key is apparently to spend $1 before getting your promotional credit.

There was a wider variety of games than I expected and I liked that there was a non-smoking area. That said, as with most places that allow smoking you're going to get some of the smoke whether you like it or not. After some time and even sitting in the non-smoking area, it became too much to stay and ultimately what led us to leave.

Overall a decent casino, with lots of different spaces, free soft drinks and parking."}
{"text":"Big gaming floor, nice location on the water in downtown Pittsburgh. Plenty of parking with a short walk to the casino in there parking garage. Drinks are moderately priced and some decent food options. They also have all the new slots."}
{"text":"Looks like some really mixed reviews here. For me and my group, we had a great time gambling before the UNC vs. Pitt game on a Thursday night. The place filled up before and after the game with other like minded game attendees. We found the dealers and pit staff to be very friendly, conversational, and helpful when needed. Wait staff at the tables and bars were great too. Is it on the same level as an upper end Vegas casino? No, but it's a great time nonetheless and I will gladly go back."}
{"text":"I have Been  to a lot of casinos around the country This place has the tightest slots I have ever experienced I don't expect to win but rate at which I lost was stunning"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but I hate the idea of gambling. 
Being the cheap person that I am I can't imagine losing that much money on something so trivial."}
{"text":"Don't want to disclose the money I have lost here... I used to get free play of $500 a week and all kinds of comps ...in last 3 months I didn't go many times as I was busy in setting up my other business in other city... guess what !!' Now I get free play of $25 and my host doesn't even reply to my messages ... it's an eye opener for me as I got their reality before I lost everything.. another thing .,, in the room of high slots .. it's written .. only active players allowed ... I have seen many visitors standing on your back commenting and explaining their friends ... once I got pissed off when someone commented ... he put in xxxx dollars and other said ... he (me) is crazy ... I prefer meadows and they really take good care of you as high profile customers.. I think rivers took for granted that I will not go anywhere else.. they were wrong.. we have options.,,"}
{"text":"I don't particularly like to gamble and I always find it pretty dirty feeling in here BUT, the garage is free (ssshhhh- I still think not enough people know that) so this is the perfect place to park before a game or when going into Downtown. I've parked here for the Pittsburgh marathon, Pirate games, Pitt football games, and to go have dinner downtown. The T is conveniently located nearby so why not? They have complimentary sodas, coffee, and water, which was nice after the marathon. I've had drinks at a few of the bars and it was, well, basic. What you'd expect at any bar. And service was subpar. Another word to the wise, expect to come out of here smelling like smoke. Even in the non smoking sections. The ventilation system is terrible. I think it's great what it has done for the city of Pittsburgh in general, however, is it Vegas? Not even close."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed each visit to the Rivers Casino. Yeah, it's a casino and has slot machines that you'll probably lose all of your money at, but it's a nice casino, it's pretty and features amazing fews of the city.

Located on the North Side near the stadiums, it's a great place for pre or post-game fun. The parking lot has ample space, and of course there is valet. I like that there is a large non-smoking area because I'm not a smoker, but I do feel like overall, it doesn't smell that badly inside there. Ever go to a casino and no matter what you reek of smoke? It's not like that here.

A bonus is that is that there is free complimentary soda stations for those of us who don't want to pay for a drink.

My favorite aspect of the casino is the glass walls behind the one bar (I believe Drum bar) that shows the river and Mount Washington. Such an amazing view. And it's a great place to take photos.

The buffet is amazing here, especially their Sunday brunch so check that out. You may lose all of your money there, but I guarantee you'll have a good time while you're there, but don't get too salty if you walk out with zero cash. I try not to, but that's usually what happens when I leave there."}
{"text":"player club employee very rude, after waiting a good half hour in line, asked about comps, since i never received any. was told i was sent comps in the mail. i never received them . they said it wasn't their fault my mailman didn't deliver my mail to me. i signed up on the first day it opened, i think there's problem with their computers or they're keeping The e comps for themselves. going back to the meadows much nicer employees there."}
{"text":"Like any casino, the food is questionable and so is the cigarette smell. However, the slots are fun and so are the table games. I usually am here only for events in their meeting space; which is questionably small. It would be nice if they took out some of the parking to expand the casino a little.

The only good food is the buffalo chicken dip at the wheelhouse. Visit for the beer and stay for the dip!"}
{"text":"It was a good casino. Free parking, 10-15 dollar tables, and friendlier than Vegas employees. The only drawback was paying for drinks but I can deal with that if the atmosphere is as good as Rivers."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea! As soon as you walk in, you're blasted by the smell of cigarettes like there was no type of ventilation. Don't get me wrong, I'm a smoker and it was bad for me! Tons of slots to choose from but I play on the tables. Tables were pretty much packed and to top it off, they charge you for liquor!!!! I ordered the same drink and EVERY time, they charged me a different price! Definitely not the type of casino I'm accustomed to."}
{"text":"Husband and I have been here a couple of times. While not on the levels of a LV casino, it's still a great place to visit. The buffet is good too.. A good place to visit overall."}
{"text":"Unlike many of the reviewers, I enjoyed my stint here.  I've been to several casinos in different states (ok, not Vegas so we'll not be comparing it to the mecca of betting venues) and I have to say this one did not disappoint me.  

This was my husband's and my second time here, but the first was just to walk through it.  This time was our first venture to stay awhile and bet to pass away some time before an event close by.

We first parked in the attached garage (for free, by the way) and took the elevator to the casino.  We headed to the cashier first off to get the lay of the land. Did they have a player's card for use in the slot machines and at the betting tables?  Yes, but you don't need one.  Ok, we opted to just use cash as we are not frequent visitors.  We learned that the floor is divided in half by smoking and non-smoking sections clearly marked and that they are a duplicate of one another in the games they have.  Great!  I was worried I'd have to sit next to smokers as I am not one.  We learned that soft drinks are complimentary.  Yay for me!  Also, there's a complementary coat check (with a tip jar) so we took advantage of that and left a tip at the end of our journey.

We next headed to an ATM inside the casino (ok, here I admit we should have taken care of money before coming here as there is a 5.00 charge per ATM transaction.  Ouch.).

There are lots and lots of slot machines, craps tables, baccarat, and black jack tables.  My husband opted for slot machines while I opted for the black jack table.  It was around 3:30pm so there were a couple $5.00 minimum tables, though I did have to wait about 15 minutes for a seat to open up.  My experience was good; the dealers were cordial as were my table mates.  I settled in trying to remember the details of playing.  Fortunately, it all came back pretty easily and I was able to hold my own for the time I wanted to play.  At 5:10pm (weird time), the table minimum went up to $10.00.  We had plenty notice as they put out a sign to let us know.  

After playing, we cashed in our chips and headed to the buffet.

I had a good time, didn't lose but a little bit in the process, and ate a decent meal afterwards.  I think that counts as a good outing."}
{"text":"I'll give this place three stars because they have a craps table operating at all times, AND more importantly, they seem to always have a $5 table operating.

The issues I have are the smoke, the fact that they seem to penalize non-smokers, and drinks are both not free for gamblers, and expensive for non-gamblers.

So first, the smoke.  As soon as you walk in, it smells like you're in an old bowling alley; obviously air filtration is not high on their list.  I'm used to smokey casinos, so I'll still play, but I mean come on, you can do better. 
 Where it gets weird is that they seem to want to half way support the concept of a place for non-smokers by having a non-smoking table game area.  If you're going to try to accommodate non-smokers, then go 'all in' and actually have reasonable air filtering, otherwise, it doesn't seem to serve much purpose.  If the casino itself is super smokey, then the only thing a non-smoking table accomplishes is reducing the risk of someone blowing a big cloud right into your face; you're breathing in the same air at either table type.  Second peculiarity is that the regular table area is the one with the $5 table, and the non-smoking table was always $10 even when empty, and even when we asked if we could play for $5 given it was empty.  So, if you're a non-smoker and want to play at the non-smoking table, and there's already a $5 table going, AND the non-smoking table has NO players at it, they will still require you go to the smoking table if you want to play for $5.  Makes no sense to me but perhaps some mathematician told them they net more profit doing it this way.  I'm still giving them three starts in light of all of this because I like the fact that there is a $5 table at all times, even if crowded, and even if it's in the smoking section.  If they actually filtered their air, I'd bump them to four.

Next up; drinks.  No free drinks while you play; it is what it is.  Where I got mildly annoyed was when hanging out at the bars with non-gambler friends.  They charge a lot for cocktails; $12+, and they were weak.  I couldn't tell if they're doing measured pours or not, but the end result was a pretty poor drink for that price.  So that of course meant non-gamblers didn't really want to hang out there all that long given they were spending a lot on drinks and coming out smelling like a chimney.

So, three stars for the fact that I can play craps 24x7 when I visit Pittsburgh, but there's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Nice to have a casino here, but it could be so much better. Way too many slots and not enough other machine games. There are only a handful of blackjack, roulette, and poker machines. Place is really smoky, even if you're in the \"non smoking\" area. No free drinks either, unlike Vegas. And the drinks are expensive."}
{"text":"Ate at the Grandview Buffet on a Friday evening.  We were disappointed from start to finish.  To begin our dining experience, we were sat at a table that had not been properly cleaned (both the table and chairs were dirty)  Then, we proceeded to the buffet.  The quality is far, far below what was expected for the price: $26.95/person.  The shrimp was overcooked, the salmon was dry, the crab legs were small (even small for snow crab) and nothing great.

We didn't try the American or BBQ offerings - the reason we went was \"seafood Friday\".  Perhaps those choices are better, but based upon this experience we would not hold our breath.

I'm giving two stars because we had a great guy clearing our table and checking our drinks.  He was the only one really hustling as most of the other floor staff were standing about the cashiers table watching the clock."}
{"text":"I was here for the Susan G Komen brunch, on the second level. (review is based on their event catering).This casino is beautiful with a great view of the city and three rivers. I was able to take some time to capture the view at Drum Bar (I was told they have love bands on the weekend)
Now, on to the food and room atmosphere. Again, in the second level banquet room. The view was absolutely gorg! The food was wonderful and was served buffet style. I sooooo enjoyed the pumpkin and sage ravioli.
This is an excellent venue for an event. And the service is great--they are so helpful and will accommodate your needs.
Im not into gambling, but I love good food and drinks. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed visiting the casino for drinks, a quick bite, or fun events and concerts they host. It used to be one of my happy places but today I left in tears due to racial discrimination.

My boyfriend (a white man) and I (a black woman) came today to get dinner and see the Chris Jamison concert at the outdoor amphitheater. We parked in the garage and checked in with security as per usual (I'm 25 and he's 26 for reference); after they checked our IDs they gave us the wristbands \"so we don't keep getting carded\", again as per usual. We eat, go out to the concert, and when we come back in with a large group of people I'm singled out of the crowd by a tall gentleman in a gray suit with dark hair and a goatee- I wish I got his name but he was clearly high up on the food chain as he wasn't in the standard security uniform. He asks \"how old are you young lady?\" first seemingly as a joke. But then he continued to accost me and I blurted out \"21\" which isn't even my age but I just got nervous and intimidated. He asked for my ID and I showed him my wristband which I'm 1000% sure someone couldn't fabricate or get through any other method than security. He said he still needed to see my ID due to \"reentry\", which is when my boyfriend asked him, \"well then do you need to see mine too?\" to which he answered with a firm \"no\". I show him my ID so as not to cause any trouble but I was still confused.

What made it clear to me that discrimination was involved was when we then observed how the people coming in after us were treated. Obviously the older patrons were not carded. But TWO VISIBLY YOUNG girls, one not even with an older relative or anything, walked in after me and the gentleman let them go without a word. Obviously you could guess this but they were both white. I wish I had the nerve to confront this man further or at least question his discriminatory tactics but I just fell apart emotionally as this has always been a place where I never felt vulnerable to being singled out for the color of my skin. But now I know I'm just as vulnerable here as anywhere else, and I definitely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I must preface this review by saying I grew up in New Jersey and frequented Atlantic City countless times.  Perhaps gambling and gaming have different rules here in Pittsburgh then in AC but.... one super downfall for this casino; you pay for your drinks.  WHAT !!! In AC, if you are in the Casino and playing you will get free drinks.  You give a good tip to the server and drink all night.  Well here, you pay for your drinks, not much ($3-10) but still it makes the night more somber.  One of the perks to gambling is the free drinks, well FREE is a misnomer but, you know where I am going with this.
That being said, it is a very small Casino in comparison to Atlantic City and paying for drinks ... well .. that sucks.  
I did win a bit at craps and left the Casino ahead, so I guess it is a win for me.  
Im not a gambler so not sure Ill go back anytime soon but, I can say this, if they offered free drinks like AC does, I may be inclined to go back just for a day of fun."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was a little iffy on coming here after reading all the reviews talking about the smoke being a problem. I have a really bad sensitivity to smoke, to the point that I cannot breath if someone has a lit cigarette near me.

That being said, it honestly was not as bad as I thought it would be. As a transplant from California, I am very familiar with Vegas, Primm (Stateline), and Laughlin, and I have to say that on the grand scale of casinos this was not that smokey at all. At least not compared to Vegas or Stateline. It does get more noticable as it gets later, especially on a Friday like when my fiance and I went. But when we arrived there at three in the afternoon it was not bad at all. 

We got the Player's Club cards, because valet parking is worth it, as is 10% off buffet and the gift shop (which I never found, but was not actively looking for). They apparently do take the cards at the table games, as we found out when we walked up to the lone $5 craps table (rest were $10), which was very busy. The dealers were all very nice and professional... though not all the people at the table were, as the other side of the table kept tossing bets down at the same time as everyone else near them, sometimes as the dice were being rolled, so it did slow the game down while they had to sort out people's bets. Our side was just as crowded, but apparently had more experienced players who knew to wait patiently. We both walked away winners though, so we were quite happy.

Took a walk around the casino, very nice grounds, and we noticed that the casino looks much bigger on the inside. Also spent some time in the Levels bar (because it was non-smoking), had a very nice midori sour and bloody mary... kudos to Josh, our bartender. Ate dinner at the Wheelhouse, also nice, and watched the Penguins game in their lounge... I am sad that they do not do the pre-game show during the playoffs, but they did have some promotion with Miller Lite going that won us a Penguins shirt and hat, so that was cool.

Overall, I came with very low expectations and I was very pleasantly surprised. I hope to be back soon to enjoy more of the casino and also check out the buffet... and to have more of the really awesome coffee that they have in the free drink stations. Minus one start because I could not find the no smoking area of the casino or more than one drink station."}
{"text":"I do not know what more the diner could hope for in a buffet: extraordinary selection, quality, and quantity: the best salad buffet in the region, soups, multiple ethnic food stations with entrees and side dishes, prime rib, vegetables galore, fresh fruit, extraordinary desserts: everything prepared to appeal to the eye and the stomach.  The restaurant is spaced for comfort and to avoid crowds at the buffet tables.  Outdoor dining and seating at the large window make the experience especially nice.  The host and server staff have become more accommodating and friendly with the passage of time. The problem is that the casino does not trust customers to pay on the way out, so at times that it is busy, there is a line of people waiting to pay upon entry.  I have waited in line as long as thirty minutes, which is absurd. The casino is currently offering a buy one, get one free promotion Mondays through Thursdays through October 31, 2013, with presentation of a Pittsburgh Pirates ticket with the promotion printed on the reverse side: unbeatable at two for $21.99.  I wish the buffet was open later, at least on weekends, and that the casino made an effort to get exiting Pirates fans to come for the buffet.  It closes at 9:00 during the week, 10:00 Fridays and Saturdays, too late for those that attend the baseball game."}
{"text":"The service was amazing when I dined at their buffet. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. I wouldn't recommend going to eat there an hour before closing. Unfortunately the chefs left and I couldn't get Old Bay seasoning for the crab legs. The price for the beer was great. I recommend dining at their buffet."}
{"text":"I came here on a recent visit to Pittsburgh and had a really nice time. 

The Pro's: 
A reasonably-priced buffet with lots of options!
Many tables and slots - a well-sized gaming floor!
Complimentary all-you-can drink coffee and soft drinks.
You'll be surrounded by rowdy Steelers, Pirates, or Pens fans! 

The Con's: 
Odds are, you're going to lose some money.
The gaming floor is really smoky in areas. 
PA doesn't allow the casino to give away free alcohol. 
You'll be surrounded by rowdy Steelers, Pirates, or Pens fans!"}
{"text":"Now that I am finally 21, I got the chance to go to The Rivers, and I have to say I was extremely pleased.  First off, I do not know what the minimums are for a Friday or Saturday night, but when I was there Sunday afternoon, many of the tables were $5 minimums!  That beats Niagra Falls' $15 and $25 minimums by a long shot!  

Obviiously if the review were based off of my happiness of winning and losing, there would be a few less stars, but based off the casino itself and not the fact I lost $40, I would say I had a solid time.  Unfortunately for my wallet, I will be going back!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a Casino. Pretty much what he name says. Not sure if you get free drinks I was here for about two hour and I was never offered one. They did have free sodas but you had to get them."}
{"text":"I would probably give the River's a higher rating if I was gambler and a smoker. I tried playing slots once but after listening to that monotone drone of a sound and feeding $20.00? worth of quarters into a machine I just lost interest. I decided I liked listening to bands and feeding $20.00 to a bartender much better while tasting some great beer and catching a buzz... but that's just me. And I used to be a smoker so I have no room to judge those that do. But neither of those two things influence my opinion of the Rivers Casino and why I went there last night. I went for the Irish Festival. 

Although I'm German & Polish by nationality (American at heart), I've been told, by some that believe in such, that I must have been Irish in a past life. I love everything Irish: the food, the dance, the music, the beer, the whiskey, the history, the culture etc. I've traveled to Philadelphia and cities in Ohio just to go to Irish Festivals so you can imagine my excitement when I learned that the Rivers would be hosting an Irish Fest featuring \"Donnie Irish\" and a dinner at the Grand View Buffet just two days after my Birthday. 

I'll write more about the Grand View Buffet in a separate review, but here's a quick note: it was only about average.  I tried a little of just about everything and nothing really stood out as being really good and worth coming here for. The piece of General Tso Chicken that I got was about as hard as a hockey puck and literally inedible. I'd have to say that the grilled veggies where the highlight for me.

The festival itself was a joke. It was simply a bunch of chairs in what looked like a dark conference room with a small stage for the bands in front. This isn't a festival! Where are the vendors? The side performers? The beer stands? And the thought crossed my mind earlier as to what \"Donnie Iris\" had to do with an Irish Fest but I liked his music so I originally thought, \"What a bonus\". When I got there I quickly learned that one letter can make a whole lot of difference and can be a pretty cruel trick. The festival had \"Donnie IRISH\", not \"Donnie IRIS\". And although the Donnie Irish Band was entertaining, they were honestly about as average of a music group as they come. I can't say much more about the other two bands that were there. 

The Festival was supposed to last from 5:00 till 9:00 but the music was wrapped up at 6:45 with nothing more Irish to follow. I suppose the River's wanted you to smoke and play slots for the rest of the evening. My girl and I went home and watched House of Cards."}
{"text":"Gambling Problem? Not so much. Smoking Problem? Oh yeah, this certainly exists here!  The casino itself could be pretty nice except for that cloud of smoke that exists everywhere. There's no differentiation of where smoking & non-smoking sections end & begin other than signs. People puff away as they wander through both areas. 

Figure out what the Vegas casinos use & copy it! They know how to extract smoke so you never realize its there. Or better yet, ban it! All that puffing paints Pittsburgh in a very negative light. So much so that it ruins the Casino."}

{"text":"This review is mostly for the Buffet but I'll start with the Casino.  The casino is half smoking and half not.  On the non smoking side and going to the buffet, the air smells recycled/cleaned from the smoke side(very stale).  The slots were more outdated than I have seen as compared to casinos in Eastern PA, CT and of course Vegas. Now for the buffet, just disappointed.  The host and staff were quite friendly and helpful, I was surprised at how the food stations were not kept clean and filled.   I was there at dinner time but there was still open seating.  There is a lot of variety but greasy, over cooked and/or not replenished.  I ate a small salad and meat from the carving station, and picked stir fried veggies out of one of the Asian stations.   I should have made a reservation in town at a better restaurant and spent my money there."}
{"text":"If you have been to Vegas, this place will be disappointing. If you just want to go to a casino and play a few games, this place will satisfy that urge.  It is not huge, it is not fancy, it is a casino with table games and slot machines 'o plenty.  The Wheelhouse restaurant is very good and a better value than the buffet upstairs.  

It is geared towards locals and close out of towners (Ohioans and West Virginians) with plenty of bus pick up and drop offs.  

I walked out $19 richer so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Rivers Casino is pretty nice for a Pennsylvania casino. The layout is nice. Lots of options for slot machines and a nice selection of table games. Parking Garage is attached, which makes things easy. You can not compare Pennsylvania casinos to those in Atlantic City or Vegas... it's just not that type of atmosphere. Rivers has a great location near Heinz Field and walking distance from PNC Park. Great stop before or after a game!

With that said, there are no free drinks on the playing floor and there's no hotel. It's just about the gambling. I've heard the food is good, but have yet to try it. I had drinks at one of the bars and they were $5 for a Bud Light draft. A little pricey for the area, but not really for a casino.

I won $360 on the slot machines... so I'm a happy customer."}
{"text":"On a recent trip for a wedding in Pittsburgh,  we decided to have a guys night out in downtown. We found out there were a few casinos locally, so we knew this would be on the itinerary. 

From the outside, the casinos looks nice. It's a pretty big place compared to some of the casinos we go to near Texas. Walking in, the casino seemed nice as well. It really did not have a wow factor. The place could definitely use better ventilation.   I play table games, but there seemed to be way more people than tables. People were crowded around all the tables that were open.  I also did not like the fact that drink service was not up to par like other casinos I have been to.  Apparently they stop serving alcohol at a certain time, and from what I understand,  they charge for alcohol. If I'm spending big money at a table, I want complimentary drinks.  

Although I did come out ahead, I probably would not go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is a nice casino if you're into casinos but I as a millennial am not. I cry when I lose twenty dollars and I cry even more when I don't understand why I lost said twenty dollars. The games don't entice me. Even the ones I do understand get boring after a while. I'd rather lose my money at Dave and Busters and at least leave with a prize. The food here is delish. I went to an event here and enjoyed the Buffalo chicken dip. They also play very nice music and the staff are very attentive to your needs. Be prepared to drop a wee bit of money on drinks because they can add up. My favorite thing about this place is the view of the river."}
{"text":"After a highly memorable meal to commemorate Kay's mother's 50th birthday, we headed here to dance as per her wishes. 

We never found a dance floor.

Instead, we saw rows and rows of arcade machines designed for gambling- addicted adults with names like Witches Riches, Land of the Titans, Cashman,  and Mystical Phoenix, all of them offering variations on the simple, stupid theme of matching up rolling symbols. 

20-somethings and senior citizens alike could be observed staring blindly, soullessly at the contraptions, pressing buttons, feeding these glittering boxes while smoking or drinking complimentary fountain beverages. 

Sullen cocktail waitresses of all shapes and sizes passed us hurriedly in revealing outfits as we took in our surroundings. 

I even saw a co-worker of mine, one who...plays hooky quite a bit. I called to him, but the casino obviously had him under a spell.

Bass pounded relentlessly amidst a din of clatter.

\"It's like this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year,\" I said to myself.

Kay handed me a 20 dollar bill.

\"We might as well,\" she told me, caving in to temptation.

The 20 dollar bill was gone in 10 minutes.

I felt sick. I needed to leave. I needed to escape that which swallows Social Security checks and cons the poor and working class into thinking that financial security is a roll of the dice away. 

\"But...we might win. We can't stop now,\" I overheard a woman say to her companion.

There has to be a better, less sleazy way to bring revenue into Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"21.95 for brunch that includes all you can drink champagne, Bloody Marys and beer...I am there! 

Brunch at the Rivers seemed like the perfect cure for my hangover the day after Halloween. The food was ok...it was a standard buffet fare. The champagne and Bloody Marys weren't bad either. My only grip is the servers gave me an eye roll every time I asked for a drink! I don't want to feel bad for ordering another round. I was not visibly drunk, loud or rude. I just wanted to hang out with friends, talk about last night's debauchery and enjoy a glass of champagne. 

Well joke is on you Rivers...I ate your food, drank your booze and walked away with $20 in winnings! The house didn't win this time!!! :)"}
{"text":"I love going to this place any time im in Pittsburgh. Ive never been to any other casino in my life so I cant really measure this against others. It does make a first impression on you when you first walk in with a very nice water fixture. But at the same time, it has a Pittsburgh atmosphere to it. Ive gone here after Pirates games and seen plenty of ppl wearing buccos jerseys. Also, the slot machines ive played have lil tv screens on them showing whatever is on root sports. That alone won me in. Something that was unexpected to me was the free parking(a rarity downtown) and the free fountain drinks and coffee. Im not really a table gamer so I cant say much about it. I did end up winning some money in the slots so that made me happy. Overall, this is a great place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Wife and I had gone to Andrews Steak House in the casino and after diner decided too do a little gambling.
My wife is strictly a slots person, But I went directly to the craps table.
I started with $20 and about an hour later I walked away with 150.00.
So overall I was really happy with winning.
I have to say that the smoke was horrendous and my eyes where hurting it was so bad.
I like Texas hold em and craps.
wife and I where not staying long so I choose craps.
I might go again in the future.
The biggest negative for me was the smoke as it was terrible.
The other thing I did not like I have never been to a casino other than on a cruise ship that did not comp the drinks when you where gambling.
Rivers does not comp the liquor drinks.
They do offer free soda and water self serve.
If you are not turned off by the smoke then you will love it there."}
{"text":"This place has potential, but i have a feeling that it will never live up to that potential. 

As soon as you walk into the joint, the guards are as rude as can be. I get it, i look young, but no reason to spend literally 5 minutes looking at my id. 

No matter where you go in the casino, it reeks of smoke. Or it did last time I was there.

It looks rundown, like they care more about taking your money than cleaning up the place. 

The machines are as tight as your grandpa that hides his money throughout his house. You could spend hundreds and not win a dime. 

The buffet definitely has potential if they actually kept up with the food. It's almost always lukewarm when I'm there.

Parking will always depend on what's going on in the city that day. But usually you're fine. 

I would recommend leaving the city of a little while to make the trip up to Meadows, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This review is kind of a unique due to the circumstances my friend and I encountered while visiting Pittsburgh. He drove us to the Pittsburgh International Airport instead of the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport and we missed our flight and ended up having to pay $600.00 for 2 one way tickets back to Florida. Due to the long wait time for our new flight we decided to go to this casino to win money to cover the $600.00 mistake. When we arrived we went directly to the buffet and had some drinks and food. The food was good and we both enjoyed the nice layout overlooking the river from our table. Complete Sunday brunch with Prime rib, Ham and other great selections which included Italian & Chinese choices. This dining experience was outstanding. We spent a short time at the Blackjack table and won enough money to cover the $600.00 airport mistake. Rivers Casino is located in downtown and they have a great selection of table games and slot machines. The overall experience was outstanding. Definitely a nice casino & worth checking out if you want to have some fun."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Andrews restaurant is nice. We loved the view and had a delicious meal with great service.  We thought it was worth the price tag.
2.  Free, attached parking garage or free valet parking with Players card.

Bad:
1. The Worst part: Smoking allowed, and the ventilation isn't great. Yuck. I stunk when I got home, and I avoided direct contact with smokers. The non-smoking section is small and poorly labeled.
2. Good luck finding a cocktail waitress. We didn't see one in three hours of slot play in several sections. 
3. Poker room spreads are ALWAYS high.  We asked.  E.g., Lowest limit spread is 4-8.  We play in WI, NV and CT, and they always have at least one table with a lower spread.
4.. Table limits are high if you can get a seat at all. (Caveat: It was early Saturday night but still.) $15-25 CRAPS, $15-20 Pai-Gow.  (Also, only one Pai-Gow table.  Boo.)  Ouch!  The virtual BJ machines -- which were $10-$15 and full anyway -- are super creepy.  Since it's all programmed, every hand the machine plays the same video back.  Weird.
5. Some guy was announcing stuff all night long.  It was very annoying.  It's already loud enough!"}
{"text":"Decent casino.  Located in the North Shore sports and entertainment district.  Close to the last stop on the Light Rail/Metro system.  Wheelhouse restaurant has lots on tap and decent pub grub.  Good mix of machines and tables.  Tough to get at the lower priced ($5 minimum) tables.  Sadly - this place still allows smoking."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is enjoyable. 
It deserves 5 stars for the food, entertainment, atmosphere and overall vibe.
The downside for me was that they didn't offer assistance for newbies at the table games."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this isn't AC or Vegas.  That said, rivers is pretty nice for what it is.  There are some drawbacks sure, but it does well.  It's laid out nice, has a good selection of table games and slots.  The card room is always has games and the tournament structure is pretty good.  They have lots of free giveaways and plenty of promotions to keep you coming back.  The food is good, the better being Andrews steakhouse and the buffet.   Protip - the champagne brunch is really good. 

The cons?  To start, drinks on the playing floor should be free.  There's no hotel.  There's nothing really live or upbeat.  Friday and Saturday nights should have live bands, dancing, and be really uplifting.  It just doesn't happen here.  It's pretty much all about the gambling."}
{"text":"Packer fan review here so listen Steelers lovers this is an unbiased review haha.  #GoPackGo

Visiting Steelers Nation to support the bf which we tend to come to Pittsburg at least once A season to watch a live game. Because it was a busy day around the city super packed (no puns here #gopackgo) so we decided to just head over to the stadium. 

Stopped at Wheel House for a few pregaming drinks and ended up having a full on meal. Decided on the Shrimp Alfredo & Pittsburgh Cheesesteak which were well prepared and delicious. My cheesesteak came out with onions which I asked to not include but whatever drinks were great and my waitress was super apologetic so no harm at this point. Ended up meeting some super cool Steelers fan and ended up tailgating with them. There is also what the locals call the worlds largest tv around the corner so check that out too. 

I would definitely comeback since I won a few bucks gambling lol."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard, smoky casino. I like that it has a parking garage attached for access.  There are tons of machines and tables and games, but it isn't anything unexpected or special for a casino."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased to find this establishment in Pittsburgh. Let's be clear: this is a 4-star rating for a casino in Pittsburgh and if it was in Vegas, it would only get 3 stars, but it's not in Vegas, it's a 30 minute drive from home.

We've been here on a Saturday night and a Thursday night, both times between about 8pm and 11pm. If you can, go with valet parking, because, as many others mentioned, parking is a beast here. 

So let's start with the pros:

Lots of table games. It's a little crowded on the weekends, but on Thursday I sat right down at a nice, sparsely-occupied table. Craps tables were still busy, though.

Clean, well-decorated interior. It's classy and well-lit and easy to get around in.

Ample walkway space around the pits. Numerous bars. 

Great dealers (last night I got to play roulette with Doug and a dark-haired gal whose name I didn't get; both were A++). 

And now the cons:

Lack of cocktail waitresses. I'm a great tipper, but in order to find that out, you would have to pass by my table at least ONCE in two hours. 

High minimums. This is Pittsburgh, not Vegas. $10 minimums on most tables on Thursday night was a little disappointing. 

Tacky ID check system. You get wrist-banded at the door, not classy. 

And the biggest con of them all: I have to pay for my alcohol. I believe sitting at two tables (me at roulette, my husband at craps) for 2 hours playing with a generous budget entitles us a to some complimentary drinks. 

But, as a rule, we love to hit the casino every couple months and Rivers is nice enough that I can sit down and play for a few hours, have a great time, and fool myself into thinking I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I must say I was very impressed by this casino. Usually any casino that's outside of Vegas is not even comparable to Vegas casinos. But wow, I was very pleased with how huge, clean, and friendly this Casino was. The only downfall is they don't bring you cocktails while you're gambling, but other than that, I literally felt like I was in Las Vegas while I was here. 
There's plenty of restaurants, bars and lounges as well as live music which give this casino a very lively feel. 
Side note- I ended up breaking even so I can't complain.

MUST GO!"}
{"text":"This place is HUGE with tons of tables. We always have a good time and find good people and dealers to sit with. If you're not a gambler, I don't know what you'd think of the place, but we're fans!"}
{"text":"A casino is a casino is a casino. I like that they have a non smoking section. I like the abundance of restrooms. I have been to a few events in the Monongahela room and the view is beautiful, Heinz Field and the skyline and the river. A nice variety of slot machines. I know they have a lot of tables games but I do not play those. It is casino, a little above average."}
{"text":"You know I don't get out everyday but rivers casino is a place of pure in-the-moment happiness. You can do anything you want here drink smoke eat great food it's completely in your P(NC)ark. I just got a fish and chips and gotam they gave me everything from waffle to steak fries as if I was the king of France. Shit. Is. Dope."}
{"text":"Meh. Underwhelming. Maybe if I had never been to Vegas and had nothing else with which to compare, I would be pumped. I've had more excitement with scratch-off lottery tickets. On a more positive note, the drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The casino itself could be good for a city casino.

It is way to smokey and definitely needs better ventilation for how big the smoking area is.

My big complaint is how tight the slot machines are.

This is  by far the worst and I mean the worst casino when it comes to slots.

I have been here multiple times and spent upwords of a 1000 dollars and have never once been up more then 70 dollars.

I have been to casinos all over the States and abroad and have never seen anything like it.

It's a shame cause I love to gamble but to mever hit more then 70 dollars in well over 50 visits in 4 months.

But I will not ever return and tell others to just stay away.."}
{"text":"Went in with a couple hundred, had dinner at the wheelhouse (that will be another review) had a few drinks then hit the nickel slots being the high roller I am.

So I go get a card and fill out the info. Behind the counter was a wheel with different amounts of cash, so the dude helping me spun the wheel and it landed on 200, so that pit that amount on my card.... Good deal. Got a t shirt to for playing tic tac toe with the chicken, it was a tie.

Left with more than I came with, that's always good!

The casino is very classy in design, it's not Vegas or even Atlantic city, but that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Rivers Casino is a popular destination for my family. It offers a variety of bars inside that have different specials during the year, a steakhouse, the Wheelhouse, and the Buffet, as well as smaller food stops. It allows my family of usually picky eaters to be able to get whatever they want. As far as how our pockets feel after the gambling, not so good. Rivers has a low payout rate compared to other casinos around."}
{"text":"Really a horrible place that just cares about getting into you're wallet and taking as much as they can from each Patron.  Some particularly evil features.....  They give the wealthy  players they're own line \"Signature Players\" so they can cut in front of the rest of us.  That's right they comp others at my expense!!  Either you want my business or you don't!!  Horrible place for comps and poorly trained staff at the gaming tables, rather than  let you leave any table they demand to color you up so they can keep their beloved tray in tact.  Not here.  None of the dealers feel any part of you're loss.  I don't tip because 1 it does not go to that dealer anyways it only goes to a pool for all table game dealers, and 2 the dealers don't give a damn about me.  I wish other venues offered Poker so I would never have to set foot in this place.  As I am a winning Poker player I am there almost daily.  The comps are very small compared to the rake..... $1 an hr vs $5 a pot and they do very little for the players.  The Rivers needs more competition so they don't rake as much and give so little back.  Also they never say in advance when they will charge for parking, and have taken away the 3 chairs upstairs where People could sit and watch the river.  They manipulate and destroy People's lives without allowing a union.  Where does the money go??  And by the way I track every penny when I am in there and am ahead almost $6,000 this year all from Poker without winning any major jackpots.  Poker room staff are mostly nice, but the rules are not player friendly in any way.   Upper Management is just awful and I have had dealings with many of them!  I would not recommend the Rivers Casino and this is from someone who is in Vegas and AC alot."}
{"text":"I have been to Rivers twice now. I'm not really into the gambling scene but Rivers still offers a fun experience and lots of food/drink choices.

My first trip here was also my first time inside of a casino. I couldn't believe how huge the place was... slot machines appeared to go on for miles. I totally understand now why people say casinos are disorienting and that it's easy to lose your sense of time. We each had a drink and played the slots for a bit, but we set strict limits on how much we were willing to spend, and pretty much lost our money right away. It was still a fun experience but I just don't really \"get\" it... to each their own!

My second trip was today, and the entire purpose was for the Sunday champagne brunch at the Grand View Buffet. My company was a sponsor for the March for Babies, and a group of us decided to get brunch and drinks after the walk was over. Buffets are so hit or miss, but I did enjoy this. With tip, the total price came to about $26. I think this is pretty reasonable considering it includes an unlimited Bloody Mary/mimosa bar (I think there was also a domestic beer offering) and tons of food options. I was expecting the entire buffet to be traditional breakfast items (they did have some), but they really offered a full range of options. To me it's a little odd to service french toast and crab legs at the same time, but I guess that's the point of a buffet.

Everything that I tried was good, especially the desserts. They had a whole variety of small dessert items served in shot glasses and mini martini glasses, which we enjoyed. Nothing really blew me away, but that generally seems to be the case with buffets. A million options but nothing is particularly spectacular. 

One thing I did appreciate was the attentive staff. My \"bottomless\" Mimosa was truly never bottomless and there was always somebody with a bottle of champagne nearby to offer refills."}
{"text":"Wow what a horrible place.
The people are rude
I am a jew,I heard many anti semetic remarks
The security sucks,they never protected me
I go to Meadows casino,they are a 1st class organization 
Rivers casino sucks
Horrible"}
{"text":"All that comes to mind while walking through Rivers Casino is - this is nothing more than a glorified bingo hall. The average age here (on a Friday night) is somewhere around 60 and you have to wind your way through smoke-filled aisles and the nursing home-like coughing almost drowns out the sound of the chiming of the slot machines. Rivers is proof that people will leave the house wearing *anything*. Real \"klassy\" Pittsburgh. 

The bars are nice, but for $5 you get a rocks glass filled with 99% cranberry juice and the remaining 1% is the ice, lime, and vodka. Weak drinks and stingy slots. Where is the revenue from this place going again?

I guess Las Vegas has ruined me on casinos - there's no comparison. Rivers doesn't even try. The decor is boring, the constant announcing of prizes over the loudspeaker is tacky, and leaving smelling of smoke and feeling dirty is just plain foul.

I don't see a separate listing for the Grandview Buffet - so I'll add it here. Also, one star. We paid nearly $60 for the buffet on a Friday night because it was the \"seafood buffet\". I can't eat crab - and the bulk of the items contained crab. The buffets were all slopped up and dirty and they did a poor job of refilling items. I think all of the food came right out of the back of a Aramark food semi-trailer. It's bland and some of it is just plain bad. I was really worried I was going to end up with food poisoning because of the temperature and quality of the food. This has got to be one of the worst buffets I've ever been to. Akin to a hospital cafeteria. Are we sensing a theme here??"}
{"text":"For someone who doesn't gamble I sure have been here a lot. To me you may as well open a window and throw cash out hoping some of it blows back. But I have a friend who loves it here and when we go to shows at Stage AE she's able to park at casino which means stopping in for a few rounds before getting the car. I mean as far as casinos go it does have all of the bells and whistles complete with restaurants and live performances."}
{"text":"How do you rate a casino when you don't gambe?  Hmmmm....

On aesthetics?  Casino's are usually dim and little shady.  But this one isn't.  Well it is in some parts and isn't in the parts by the river.  The windows overlooking the river give you a gorgeous view.  There's even a tiny outdoor concert pavilion which I'm sure is a great time to be at when someone good is playing (is there ever anyone good playing there??).  It's like it's a bit bi-polar. 

I've also been into many casino's in Vegas and this one is very nice in looks but considering you can still smoke in casino's (in my opinion ban it if you want to keep it classy) you have to have the right ventilation system.  The thing that blows me away in Vegas is that most of the casinos you don't smell the smoke at all.  As soon as I walked into River's the smell of smoke hit me.  Ew.   It's new, so I'd expect it to be a better system but it's not.

I also had the pleasure of going to an event here.  The space is really nice, and smartly facing the river.  It's also great to have an outdoor balcony where you get a beautiful view of the river and sunset if you're attending something in the evening.  I would have been happy spending the entire evening out there.  

The food was catered by the casino and I was not impressed at all.  The veggie tray had overly salted veggies, the grape leaves were dry and the little bites of food were all bland.  I know catering is hard when things are massed produced but I've had delicious catering before, so I know it's possible.  Maybe tonight wasn't there night... On the other hand I have heard the brunch buffet on Sundays are awesome, so I still have faith they could redeem themselves.  But we'll see...

If I ever threw a quarter in the slot machine and hit it big maybe the star rating would go up... just maybe..."}
{"text":"Worst casino ever. Wouldn't let us in for being \"visibly drunk\". Never heard of it. Was the worst experience of my life  at a casino. Never go there"}
{"text":"Walked over here before catching a flight with my buddy and went in for 10 minutes. I put 40 bones into the wheel of fortune machine was down to my last few bucks and ended up wining 500 bones. Then walked out immediately to airport! Haha... I love you Rivers!"}
{"text":"This is going to be a two part review, half about the casino itself and the other half about the buffet.  My wife and I had been here twice, once when it first opened and our second time today.  It had only been a year since our last visit, and the casino is already starting to look \"run down\".  There is not nearly enough non-smoking sections, and the overall layout of the floor is terrible now that they have added table games.  It was very busy today which made it hard to get around, most of the nicer machines were occupied often times with people waiting to take the seat.  I counted a half dozen or so table games that were completely empty, just a dealer standing there staring off into space.  Although the high stakes room was packed to the point that you could almost not walk in.  Our main interest was the video black jack tables, unfortunately it took us almost 10 minutes to find them.  We ended up coming across them tucked in between a grouping of $1 slot machines.  There were 4 machines in that area, ranging from $5 to $25 minimum bets.  Quite frankly I don't feel that River's is worth the almost 2 hour road trip for us.  Mountaineer is good enough, and half the driving time.

Secondly I'll briefly get into the Grand View Buffet.  I could not have been more disappointed really.  The quality and quantity of the food does not justify the ridiculous price.  Costing nearly $50 for my wife and I, and charging us for soft drinks on top of that.  They did give us a 10% discount because of our players card, but it was hardly noticeable.  The salad bar was a mess, food all over the place, mixed in with other food.  The desert bar is an absolute joke as well.  I won't even get into detail about the rest of the food, your local Home Town Buffet is leaps and bounds better and for half the price.  Overall this was a lackluster experience, and more than likely our last trip here for quite a while."}
{"text":"Just MY opinion...

The atmosphere was nice and clean. Great Pittsburgh atmosphere. That's why I added the extra star. In my opinion, the food from the buffet was just OKAY. Although the pulled pork and green beans were good. Crab legs were cold and had no meat. 

In the casino, the girl offering to bring drinks took like 40 minutes to return to tell me there's no mint leaves for the mojito I ordered and it will take another 15 minutes if I dtill wanted it, si I declined and ordered a Bloody Mary that came back sooooooo peppered up, by reflex I almost spit it right out if my face. I asked her can I just have a \"sweet girly drink\". Took over a half hour. Finally got my first and last drink of the night. It was okay tasting. I'm not much if a drinker and was happy it wasn't loaded up and overpowered with alcohol. I was glad it actually arrived before the ball dropped for the new year 2015.

I had a good time, but food and service lacked...but I guess it's a casino, they want you in the gambling seat not for food & drink."}
{"text":"Had a fun time tonight. I really enjoyed the experience and the variety of games. I look forward to returning even though I only gamble maybe once a year. The staff is very friendly and will answer any question you may have."}
{"text":"Visiting family from California and my Fiance and I decided to visit this dump...big mistake. Slots are tight the patrons that wander this shit hole remind of a Friday night at your typical Pittsburgh area wal mart (stained shirt/sweat-pants/velcro sneakers) since it was mid March and Pnc park wasn't open yet this was on our to do list. If you are from Pittsburgh and have a Gf/Bf you want to show around Pittsburgh don't bring them here!! Exp. If they have been to Vegas before they will look at you like you are crazy and say \" So this is Pittsburgh?\" Trust me take them to Penns Brewery or the Carnegie science center before you waste your time and money here"}
{"text":"Machines didn't really pay out and the casino smelled horrible! It didn't matter if you were in the non smoking area, it still smelled like an ash tray! Plus, the other people stay at the same machines for hours without bathing. Talk about some nasty BO!"}
{"text":"It is a casino. Duh. It's not pretty to look at and it's definitely not a high-class establishment like some I've been to. If you can overlook some of the typical nonsense that some casinos have and understand that this is a locals kind of place where everyone comes - then I think you will have a really good time.

I played on the $5 Blackjack table and left $100 large when I went in playing on $20 bucks. It was a golden night especially when you're someone like me and like to play with very little, but still enjoy the thrill of the game. My friend, on the other hand, left empty handed. He spent $60 on slots and swears he will never play them again. We'll see how true that holds knowing him.

The dealers that we encountered had extremely positive demeanors. That was refreshing. What wasn't refreshing was that one of our dealers was due in 2 weeks to deliver her second child and the people at the tables are smoking around her. She said she needed the money. I wouldn't be pregnant working in a smoking casino if I had the choice. I hope she nor the child was affected by the second hand smoke.

Parking is easy and free. Just make sure to remember where you left your car since the garage can be a bit of a pain in the behind."}
{"text":"Poker grinder looking for a casino with a great poker room with good tournaments which allow longer play. Saturday deepstack fits the bill. Sad that we don't have casino poker tounaments in Cleveland. Smoking allowed in casino not in poker room, but smoke still comes into the poker room so not a fan of that here. Free soft drinks and parking is usually free. I only play poker so it's an above average poker room outside of Vegas. If you play tournaments Rivers does it well. Shuffle up and deal."}
{"text":"Gambling- convenient, laid back, this is not Vegas, and most certainly not as casual as West Virginia but it's a happy medium. I wish the air tasted a bit less like an old cigar wet but it is what it is. It's fun. It's a casino in Pittsburgh. You're getting what you pay for.  A fun time out with friends and family. Although I think of you were there alone for any length of time it could become kind of lonely and smelly. 

Food

Andrews- love the Beet Salad. The pierogi app is weird. This is Pgh- pierogis are an art in their own. So if a menu is going to deconstruct and reconstruct them they better be a show stopper. These have too much Rosemary.. or spice... or something. Not fancy or foodie- just not a show stopper and memorable in an awkward way. I do not suggest making this part of the meal. Which is a disappointment, as the pierogis are one of the few options for those dining with carnivores who aren't enthusiastic about meat. 

Must be upfront, I'm not an enthusiastic red meat eater. You might already know this. I'm kind of eh, about meat. I tend to make alternative choices compared to my husband. He's diehard meat, mushrooms, and a side of meat. Myself, the crab cakes - amazing. Whatever you order- whatever- even if you already know it's too much food- ORDER A TRIO OF SIDES. Do it. Your entree is the after thought. The sides are the real show stealer! Wow! Yum. 


Wheelhouse - If the price of a hot dog is $8 at the West End Cafe, then just skip going there and grab a spot at Wheel House for the Kielboski sandwich for $10. Same w the buffet. You'll be much more satisfied having a dinner from the Wheelhouse that comes with soup or salad & potato. Check out the menu. The concept is  casual bar restaurant food. Nice place to catch up w friends before going to play. 

Ciao - some of the best food choices. Grab and go. Starbucks and fresh quick picks. Soups, wraps, chips, good stuff. Could use a little more variety but some of the best the venue has to offer in terms of food. 

Buffet- terrible. The worst way to spent $20 in the building. Yes you'll leave stuffed but not satisfied. I really can't say there is anything that's outstanding. The roasted cauliflower is an easily overlooked pick that stands out when eaten. 

The entire pasta bar isn't worth putting on your plate. The Asian Station is hit or miss. The build your own stir fry is worth making as well as some of the sushi rolls depending on your tastes. The American style food is all ok. It is not that fabulous. The meat on the carving station tends to be on the tough side. The baked potatoes are usually good. 
The desserts are plentiful. I'm not a huge dessert person and typically find all of them disappointing with the exception of the baklava. When the baklava isn't there, I'm heartbroken. 

West End- There isn't anything offered here that I like. It's all warm or breaded quick picks that seem too heavy and high in calories. And price. I wish there were some lighter and smaller options. Healthier choices to grab and snack on while chatting w with friends and playing games. Sadly it's a real disappointment. 

Free Pop & Drink Machines - yes please. The free coffee is delicious."}
