{"text":"this was the worst butter chicken I have EVER had.  maybe the worst Indian food.  The sauce in my butter chicken tasted like they had opened a can of Heinz spaghetti, removed the noodles and tossed some chicken in.    the naan bread wasn't cooked through so I had sticky glue with garlic on it and the aloo naan (also undercooked) needed seasoning.  Never have I heard of indian cuisine being accused of needing seasoning but there's a first for everything I guess.    The mixed vegetable jalfrezi was a bag of frozen peas/carrots/corn/and LIMA beans with a hot - although not spicy - sauce  the best part about this meal was the samosa  and even they were something I could have picked up from a subway station.   eating this meal made me sad."}
{"text":"I love this place! How convenient that I just moved next door. My go-tos are the butter chicken (I don't know what it is with that sauce- it's like crack and I find myself craving it all the time) and the chicken pakoras. I know- chicken-y, ultra American choices. But I like what I like. I switch it up for the other dish every time. And everything else has been a hit as well. Except that one dish that nearly killed me from spiciness, as I did not heed their warning.  Seriously, everyone go check out this place- they do eat in, delivery and takeout. I'm worried that I'm their only customer and they won't be able to survive on my business alone. Then what will I do when I'm too lazy to cook or walk a few feet?!?! Guess I better keep eating to keep it thriving!"}
{"text":"Indian in the sense they serve Indian food.  I don't think they taste their food, because it's not very good.  Indian should be an excellent celebration of spices and veg and rice.  And if you are two blocks south of Little India, you had better get your ducks in a row.  This place, had little going for it.  For a place that boasts a chef with 20 years experience in England, I honestly wonder if he really gets it.  English curries were never really that good though.  I chase Indian around the planet, and this place isn't remarkable outside of how common it is.  Having the kitchen open and hearing the microwave beep, is not \"Traditional Indian\".    Chef, if you read this, be proud of what you deliver.  You're not doing anybody any favours with what you have now."}
{"text":"This is an unusual place to find \"real\" Indian food in Toronto.  It's several blocks from Little India, perched on the edge of the theme village of Pleasantville. It's run by staff who come from Sylhet, the region of Bangladesh that has provided the UK with staff for Indian restaurants there; after a stay there, many come to seek their destiny in Toronto. But if you want quality ingredients cooked fresh for each order, this is one place to come. The staff have surrendered to the reality that Little India is dominated by cheap buffets, which does to Indian cuisine what McDonalds did to French steak and frites. They've sought their niche and dignity preparing take-outs for Pleasantville. As I argue in my book, Food for City Building, this is one of the things food does for a city -- it provides the first rungs on the career ladder that immigrants can climb. Coming from another culture, speaking another language are an asset here, not a barrier, and two teens delivering the take-outs will likely pay their way through college with their earnings.   Because of this valuable social mission, I argue that restaurants and the food industry generally have to be treated differently by staff in economic development departments and food tourists generally. My faves there are Tandori fish and Baigon Bhurtha."}
{"text":"Very pitiful Indian food from what I remember. I've only ordered food from here once - never again - even though I love Indian food and I live close by."}
