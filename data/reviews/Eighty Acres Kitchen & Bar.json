{"text":"This place is really cute. Normally you'd find a restaurant like this in Lawrenceville or downtown. I'm proud to say that this place is in my backyard..it isn't a huge restaurant. Nice ambiance. They have a big bar. Their cocktails looked good. A bit pricey for Monroeville but they seem worth it. I had parpardelle bolognese and it was delicious. I think that meat and potatoes has a better dish, but this is a close second. My friend had the buffalo burger. The waitstaff was friendly, but service was very slow. I think that they need to hire some servers so the waitress can focus more. I did order a salad, which the waitress forgot but it wasn't a big deal. They can split checks and they take credit cards. I went with my friend but I think it'd be a nice place for a date! There were families too."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Dishes my table had were the wild boar with ricotta gnocchi, papperdelle with Bolognese, flat iron steak, and seared ahi tuna. Everything was perfectly prepared, especially the gnocchi! My friend, whose very Italian mother makes amazing gnocchi, has said he needs to lie about how light and delicious the gnocchi are! Truly this area needs a place like this. Beautiful inside (you would never guess it used to be a pizza place!) and friendly service!"}
{"text":"As close to home cooked meals you're going to get without actually making it yourself. Fresh high quality courses. Great daily dinner specials. Modern decor. Amazing food with great service."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant at all.  For the area it may be nice, but for the greater pittsburgh area, it is far from superb. It has a small menu that lacks creativity. Ordered the charcuterie gathering board, one  type of meat, two cheeses, and the rest was picked vegetables. Not worth the price of 18$. Dishes ordered were crab cakes that had a distinct flavor that was unattractive, and seemed to be of a canned decent, and a special shrimp risotto, 5 shrimp, and lacked flavor.   Outdoor decor lacked, inside was rustic and spacious, however they sat us right next to other customers,  not sure why. Service was ok, slow at first, and thought we were forgotten for a minute.  My wine was definitely forgotten about, then found out they didn't have what I ordered.   Did get a complimentary glass though which was nice.   Don't believe I will return, so many better places to go."}
{"text":"I dont understand the good reviews. This was the worst meal ive ever paid for.  The food is bland at best and the veggies were pureed. Bad baby food. The drinks were weak and the pumkin creme brulee was  ice cold."}
{"text":"Upscale, first class with friendly atmosphere!  Awesome food, great people, the place to be!  A must try!!  You WILL go back!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food and wonderful service.   The cocktails are always delicious.   Had the shrimp risotto,  pasta bolognese,  flat bread and Mexican mule last night and all were wonderful.   Favorites are the queso, the gnocchi, the risotto and flat iron steak.  The pork chop looked delicious and we will be going back soon to try it."}
{"text":"LOVE! Never disappointed from the food to the drinks and the service! A true gem in the area, amazing brunch too."}
{"text":"This place is really a great treat in the burbs--farm to table with the same vibe as my favorite places in the city.  Hubby had the walleye and said it was fabulous.  I had the chicken risotto special of the evening--loved every bite.  We had a couple drinks that were tasty and innovative, and the appetizers of roasted brussel sprouts and flatbread pizza were also really delish.  I wish I could remember the name of our waitress, because she was truly a gem!  She knew everything about the items on the menu and made great recommendations to us--I love it when the waitstaff is as enthused as the patrons.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our first dinner here was very good from start to finish. The inside has a nice feel to it and doesn't try to be something it's not.   Our service was very good, and our server passed the first test of keeping our drinks filled. Food came out promptly and we never had empty dishes stacking up which seems to be so common anymore.   The meal was great. I had the Surf and Turf and my wife had the salmon. The surf and turf was a different take...scallops and pork belly. I liked it very much. People looking for steak and lobster may be disappointed but I knew what it was when ordering and was still pleased. I thought the prices we spot on with the portions and the meal choices will have us coming back.   As a note, we had lunch here days earlier and were super pleased...probably our new lunch spot.   If you're looking for bar food or similar garbage you should keep looking. If you want a good meal that clearly is created by a chef, this is a place to consider. My review is only 4 stars because I like to see if the experience will be repeated on our next visit."}
{"text":"I ate here a week or so after they opened. We are happy to finally have a place in the neighborhood that has a \"different\" and innovative menu!  It's bright and fresh inside.   We had the shrimp corn dogs appetizer.  Excellent accompanied by a spicy dipping sauce. you only get 4 though, so not necessarily for sharing unless you just want a couple bites. I got the wild boar and thought it was fantastic and a nice sized serving. My dinner mate got the flat iron steak and I had a bite and it was tender and cooked to perfect medium rare.   Most entrees are priced in the $20s, which I am happy to pay for good food. Salads are ala carte.  My biggest complaint....NO bread!  We asked, and our server told us they didn't serve it. Maybe this has changed since we were there?  Our bill with a drink and 2 desserts was $80. Like I said, I don't mind paying for good food, but if I'm going to have an $80 bill, plus tip, give me a darn basket of good bread, or include a salad. It pains me when a good restaurant skimps on something like that. And oh how wonderful a good piece of bread to sop up the delicious sauce that my boar was braised in would have been!    Service was pretty good except for a couple of little things. I got an iced tea which was brought to me but without any sweetener, so I had to ask. It was also brought to me without a spoon to stir it with (they only give you a knife and fork at your place setting). So, even though I was stirring my sweetener into my tea with my butter knife when the waitress brought our appetizer, she still did not bring a spoon. Alas, a knife works fine.  The only other thing to mention was that I asked if you could sub a different side dish than what was stated to come with your dinner, she said \"yes, some things, but there might be an up charge\". But she did not ask what I might have wanted to change so she could go check on it. Like I said, little things, but notable. But she was attentive and provided good service throughout.   I am looking forward to going back to try again....love the menu!"}
{"text":"Great find off HWY 22. Fresh ingredients and great specials. Looks like an old school supper club in the outside and a new build out on the inside. Great selection of drinks and regional craft beers."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service. Would recommend to everyone- incredible that this quality of restaurant is here in Plum. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After several meals, we continue to be excited about 80 Acres.  Every menu item we've tried has been terrific-full of flavor and arrived HOT--I hate it when my food arrives cold.  The Walleye, the pastas, salads, try the Brussels sprout starter, all favs. And I do like their Old Fashioned. Very nice spot, give it a try...."}
{"text":"Eighty Acres is wonderful, and a very heartening - if ballsy - addition to this corner of the (greater) 'Burgh. Open for a mere nine weeks, they are fresh and the staff very friendly. In particular, the bartender Carrie is lovely.  For a late lunch, the fiancée and I started with the veal meatballs (a bright, flavorful sauce made the dish) and the Brussels sprouts, which were superb. The combination of flavors - sprouts, lime aioli, Parmesan and white anchovies - was brilliant. The anchovies (marinated, not the icky canned ones that everyone hates) really elevated it into something quite unique, and repeat trip-worthy.  The fiancée ordered the portobello and quinoa and I had the smoked duck quesadilla. His was a very respectful treatment of seasonal vegetables - not something you find often, or at such a reasonable price, around here. Mine was very smoky and rich. A touch more salsa added on the side cut through that richness to create a genuinely satisfying and thoughtful meal.  Eighty Acres, is a home-spun outfit, inspired by the chef's father's farm and enlivened by his long history in the culinary field. A veteran of the Coyote Cafe in Las Vegas and, more recently, the Tuscan Inn not too far away, Chef Don knows food and it is obvious that he takes the time to source high quality ingredients. We are very lucky to have him, and this restaurant, so close by.  Go. Try something new. This restaurant is excellent, and a necessary addition to the Pittsburgh foodscape."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews we were excited to try this cozy modern place. We were greeted by the polite manger and seated promptly.  Ordered standard bar drinks and coyote queso. Queso was awesome. It had chorizo which my wife isn't big on south of the border flavors, but it gave just enough kick to make the queso interesting.       Wife had Salmon, was under cooked for her tastes and sent back. It came back like it hadn't been touched. Kids had bison burgers, they had a couple bites but couldn't get past the gamey taste. I didn't try so can't give an honest adult opinion.  I had filet cooked medium, it was MW/well but still fork tender. I ended up splitting it with the family since they didn't really eat.  Manager came by and asked about the salmon, but she won't complain for free meals, the fact he asked was very nice. Service was great and ingredients are upscale for the area. They change the menu frequently so I would try again."}
{"text":"Try the bacon jam crostini!  To die for.  So tasty .  Loved the shrimp and grits. Drinks are always phenomenal and never watery  The maple bar with ice cream is also incredible.  I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  Best restaurant ever!!!"}
{"text":"We have dined at this establishment 4 times in the past.  The service and food quality has always been interestingly delicious and the service has always been 4 star worthy. Tonight the three of us showed up and decided to sit st the bar so we could watch the penguin game on their tiny tv's. We were pleasantly surprised that they had a r&b singer as entertainment. He and his surprise guest were absolutely AWSOME.  Our steaks were Ditka quality and our bartender Casey , made this pricey Sunday dinner worth it.  We will be back, just not very often."}
{"text":"Very good food, prices reasonable for the quality and what you get.  We were very excited that there is finally a decent place to eat close to where we live. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While I'd like to give a local place like this a stellar review, I just can't do it.  It's an ok place, the food isn't terrible or great.  The decor is fine, seems like they went a little cheap on it, but I understand that when you're on a budget opening a restaurant.  As for the food, it was ok, but nothing that got me excited enough to come back.  Maybe the more traditional food is ok, but they have some unique things there like bison and duck, so you feel like since you can't get that most places you almost have to try it.  Both were just sort of whatever.  I got the bison, and I've eaten a lot of more exotic meats over the years, and they covered it with gravy, which is basically what any person does in their home when they're trying to mask the meat that doesn't taste that great.  The duck was ok, nothing I'd be interested in eating again though.  It seems like this place is trying to go exotic instead of coming up with stellar meals.  I think they can do better."}
{"text":"I have to admit it, I was heartbroken when Vincent's pizza closed a few years ago. I have been to Eighty Acres a few times and they have never disappointed me. The cocktails are original, the salads are fresh, the entrées are the perfect portion (crab cakes are my favorite) and desserts are superb. The French toast on the brunch menu is delightful. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent environment, friendly staff, and delicious food!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of this restaurant before until now.  They participated in restaurant week winter 2016. While browsing through the numerous restaurants and featured dishes for this event, Eighty Acres was one of the few whose dishes really stood out to me. Also my husband LOVES trout so he was sold immediately!  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Based on the outside, I didn't expect it to look the way it did on the inside.  I almost didn't notice it when I walked in but they have an open kitchen! So you can watch all the cooks and chef do their thang!  We went during restaurant week. However, true to form, I did not order from the restaurant week menu. But my husband did because he loves trout.  I, on the other hand, ordered from their \"specials\" written on the chalkboard. Barramundi Australian sea bass. Very good! Everything was seasoned just right, with fresh ingredients.   Ordered a few appetizers as well. Charcuterie board was huge, but comes with 2 cheeses, pickled beans, carrots, and other veggies, flat bread, honeycomb, whole grain mustard, cured meat. It was almost like a meal. Fun!  Overall, the food is fresh and amazing, prices won't break the bank, fun atmosphere (btw, I love the music you play), and close to home! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I had a burger and fries for lunch.  The burger was less than ideal.  The burger bun was soggy and nothing special was going on."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise in Plum. The brunch is really good with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"What a special place! I came here for brunch with my grandmother. The atmosphere is really pleasant, and their delicious food was accompanied by kind, patient, and accommodating service. I normally live in LA, but I hope to return to Eighty Acres next time I am in the area.   My personal tip: add a chive biscuit to your brunch meal, whatever you choose -- I am still dreaming of the one I ate on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal at Eighty Acres.  My mother in law is vegan and they were able to make a dish for her on the spot, quinoa stir fry with pea purée, pickled ramps and veggies.  She really enjoyed her meal!  My husband had the pappardelle bolognese and I had the special, pan seared Halibut with cauliflower purée, sautéed spinach, pickled ramps and ramp chimichurri. The flavors in all our dishes were amazing. The bread was grilled yet soft and chewy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, good selection on wine, and relaxed atmosphere. The quality of the food is sorely needed in the area otherwise overloaded with fastfood chains. 80 Acres can stand up against the best restaurants in NYC or SFO in terms of food quality and service. The lamb chop is simply out of this world and beats lamb chops I've had in restaurants in NYC that charge 10x as much. This is a highly recommended hidden gem. I definitely will come back very often."}
{"text":"Appetizers house made ricotta gnocchi - tasted like someone already ate it and then put it on the plate. it was very bland. just tasted like mush. coyote queso - awesome! the flat bread was not stale like most places and it was very delicious! I advise you to try this. Caprese Salad - It was good, however the ratio of tomatoes to cheese was off. You only get three small bites of fried cheese vs. a plate of tomatoes.  Entrees Pappardelle - Not balanced. too much cauliflower. the noodles were too long. the broth was tasty but there was only a teaspoon of it! Scottish Salmon - Bland bland bland! The fish was cooked PERFECTLY, but there was absolutely no seasoning at all. It arrived in front of me on a pile of cooked spinach. Again, very bland. maybe one or two single pieces of quinoa made it on the plate. but it was mostly unseasoned spinach in a big clump.  Overall, this place was too pricey for the quality of the food.   the atmosphere was pleasant, although the diners were extremely loud despite there being no music. the decor is missing something."}
{"text":"I made a lunch stop at Eighty Acres last Friday. Let me first say they did a wonderful job with the remodel from the old Vincent's that was in this location. I was stunned when I walked in. The bar seats about 15-16 and the dining room probably another 80.  They are also finishing up a outdoor seating area. It looks great. I also love a bartender who not only recommends a beer by also a dish. I believe her name was Casey and she was a cool cat.  I went with the Crab Cakes and vegetable medley on the side. It was incredible. The price, portion, service, everything was top notch. I admit I went in after lunch and it was a light crowd but I like it when a place steps up and rolls it out. I want to add three people asked how my meal was. I'm pretty sure it was the GM and the owner but that says a lot.  By the way, I tinkled and the bathroom was clean too. Give this place a shot, well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a gem of a restaurant and bar this place is in such an unassuming perch along the Golden Mile that is 286.    With an open setting, set with \"Fixer Upper\" style and decor, this place serves up some fresh, farm-to-table style cuisine that is downright delicious!  They also partner with local bakeries and sweet shops to deliver dynamite desserts at the end of your meal.   It's the kind of place where I don't know where to start my review...everything was terrific...  The pre-dinner cocktails...amazing.    The appetizers and snacks...they lasted 45 seconds on the table.    The soups and salads...consumed like wild animals were eating them.    Then came dinner...I can not recall sharing more bites and passing around more plates at a dinner table in a long, long time.    With ample portions and reasonable pricing for noticeably fresh food, I'm an instant fan.  This place is well deserving of the coveted 5th star!  Eighty Acres...you're 100% awesome in my book!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I was expecting a good meal from reviews I've read but wow! I wasn't expecting such a high quality meal in Plum. The exterior leaves little to the imagination but once you step inside, it is a complete transformation. The greens and beans were the best I've ever had. Perfect texture of crisp greens, not to oily and the beans were cooked perfectly.  I finished with the cheesecake that was not disappointing.  I will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"First off, great food menu!  One page, simple.  Really interesting stuff:  wild boar, buffalo burger, duck, etc.  Nice touches throughout,  Love the tableware.  Coffee cups are awesome and so is the water bottle.  Drink list includes some seriously complex stuff to try.  Server was nice and had the answers to our menu questions.  GM Vinny stopped by our and chatted for a few minutes.  Great new restaurant in Plum.  If you're out this way, it's a great spot.  Even if you're not, it's worth the trip.  Check 'em out on Facebook at:  https://www.facebook.com/eightyacreskitchen  Give 'em a like!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good lunch spot on the way to Pittsburgh and found these guys...I was glad the inside didn't match the outside!! Very nice little place to grab a bite...great burger...her shirred eggs were good as well...service was a bit lacking though...sure, Sunday brunch is going to be busy but they should understand this...maybe someone called off?!?...We were seated quickly, took awhile for a server to come over & take drink orders, once we ordered the food it came quickly & again was very good...I was never offered a refill which I needed...and it was a bit of a wait for the check as well...  Nice place, good food...service needs improvement...will return!!"}
{"text":"** Updated review at the bottom. ** We went here for Sunday brunch with out of town friends. I was so excited to give it a try since I have had my eye on it since we moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago. The exterior is unassuming, but the interior has a mixture of shabby chic/rustic chic charm to it. Nice, spacious bar, two large dining areas, and patio space that is probably open in the warmer months.   Their brunch menu is short and concise, and you will likely not find any of your traditional favorites on it (eggs Benedict, waffles, etc.). This is a farm-to-table concept restaurant though, so I appreciated the variety of flavors available. I ordered a maple cinnamon muffin, huevos rancheros and the Bloody Mary bar.   I loved the Bloody Mary bar! You get your choice of 3 different types of vodka, regular, bacon-infused, or pepper-infused. Then you're shown the DIY part of crafting your cocktail. Stuffed olives, regular olives, celery, plenty of hot sauce choices, Worcestershire sauce, pickles, and horseradish. The one thing I was really hoping for was some pickled asparagus or some other pickled item to throw in mine. I chose the regular vodka, but I think I will go for either of the other two options next time since the tomato juice is strictly tomato juice and not another spiced mix.   The muffin I ordered was perfect. It wasn't too sweet and was a perfect portion. I shared it with the others at my table.   The huevos rancheros on the other hand were not good. When the plate came to the table, something about the smell of the tomatoes hit me like a ton of bricks. There wasn't enough flavor in the dish, and so the tomatoes were overwhelming. I ordered my eggs over easy but they came out over hard, and I don't know where the crispy tortillas were because there was mostly black beans and tomatoes. None of it tasted very good and I had to have the plate moved away because I didn't care for the smell. I was a bit disappointed that the waitress didn't ask me why I hadn't eaten any of my food. I paid for something that I took two bites of and pushed away.   I wanted to like this place. I really did! I will go back to give their dinner menu a try some time since that seems to be the majority of what is reviewed. They also have lunch, which would be great on a Saturday afternoon.  ** Update ** We have since been back to Eighty Acres for brunch again, and I have been back for lunch. I have to say that these two experiences have turned me into a fan. The brunch menu changed from our previous visit and what I ordered (I cannot currently recall) was delicious. The Bloody Mary bar was still just as good, too! One day, I decided to order a salad for take-out and was pleasantly surprised that the price was great for the delicious salad I got. I would definitely do this again! We still need to go back to check out the dinner menu, but all in all, I recommend giving Eighty Acres a try!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Sunday brunch ! An excellent and somewhat eclectic menu selection. All foods are local, fresh and prepared to order."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch, I don't frequently get steak and eggs but this one sounded so good and it was awesome.  It is served with home fries and fried bread. The jelly was a fresh compote with berries. We also had the breakfast tacos, could have been a bit spicier but still very fresh and delicious. The brunch price is the same as others in town but the quality sets it apart! Can't wait to return to try out their dinner."}
{"text":"Wow, wow and TRIPLE WOW. The food, the atmosphere, the service, the energy... the list of five star qualities goes on and on. We've been here about a dozen times and each time is more inviting and exciting than the last. Do yourself a favor, stop in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Enjoy a bloody from the bloody Mary bar and relax. You'll want to make this a weekly stop. Love it here... it's a shame yelp caps you at only 5 stars."}
{"text":"On recommendation, my partner and I dined at Eighty Acres. We did so without regret.  The establishment is located directly behind a Burger King: sat atop its domain like a beaten monarch unwilling to die. From afar, Eighty looks weathered. Cloud infested skies during our visit aside, the restaurant's exterior is a peeling, blotched mess that inspires thoughts of grease drenched entrees and food poisoning.   Then, you walk through the door.  One questions if they hadn't suffered a black out and been transported to a presentable establishment upon entering. We were welcomed, not only by their kind host, but by pristine tiling, bright white walls, a glimpse of their spotless kitchen, and brimming hardwood dining room floor. Trace scents of new paint and recently completed construction conjured ambition and lofty dreams as the host took us to our seats.  We were greeted by a knowledgeable, if not timid waitress. She accommodated our questioning which is saying something considering how alien the menu was to us. Kudos for not lecturing us on how to properly pronounce \"PAPPARDELLE BOLOGNESE\", by the way. She walked us through the specials of the day, conveniently listed on a chalk board a few feet away.  The table came with a bottle (for two) of self-serve water. In addition, my partner ordered a fresh-brewed iced tea. I took it a step further and attempted the Eighty Acre's Old Fashioned.  It was a bold cocktail. Not a dessert and yet not a challenge to be completed. The cloves added freshness not expected and yet not easily received. I sipped it slowly throughout the meal. While I would order a different cocktail on repeat visit, it would not be for dissatisfaction.  We ordered two appetizers: the Coyote Queso and the House Made Ricotta Gnocchi. When prompted by the waitress for a bacon option on the Gnocchi we declined, but only for my partner's preferences.  The gnocchi was mild and comforting. I'm a man of few pastas and many meats, mind you. I won't say that the dish converted me, but I wouldn't shy away if it was on the table.  The queso was served bubbling hot which was enough to win me over. If there's one thing I can't stand it's stale food. Instantly, I set in on it with a piece of what I could only assume was house-made flat bread. Its crisp surface and fluffy insides hearkened me to days of homemade tortillas as thick as the fingers that made them.  My partner, more likely to graze than inhale (as I am), offered me the last of the gnocchi. For a moment I was ecstatic, until I realized she meant to take the last of the queso in exchange.  I was sad.  Then came our entrees. I opted for the Surf and Turf while she picked the un-utterable, \"PAPPARDELLE BOLOGNESE\".  The S&T was a succulent cut of pork belly atop speatzle. To touch this pork with BBQ sauce would've been a sin. It was sweet and juicy without needing its hand held. The spaetzle resembled scrambled eggs. Mind you, this is coming from the palette of someone who is beyond uncultured.  Regardless: good pork and scrambled eggs, pretty damn good.  The \"S\" portion of my S&T were a family of medium seared scallops (cook-to-order) the size of half-dollars atop a bed of \"whole grain mustard gastrique\" which looked like red-lettuce coleslaw. In effect, it was exactly that: a sweet and sour relish to add a kick to the scallop's subdued flavors. Speaking of, upon taking a bite of the scallops, it became abundantly clear that I had a problem.  Anywhere else I ordered scallops would have Eighty Acres to compete with, and I was sure I had a lifetime of disappointment ahead of me.  My partner's bolognese was as described when simplified, \"lasagna in a bowl\". What we both tasted was wide noodles bathed in a satiating meat sauce. Again, spoken from a \"meat man,\" but still, not bad.  This far into my review, I have a confession to make. Fair as the portions were, I had not eaten all day. That fact, added with a modicum of lawn work done before coming out lead to my personal decision of picking out two desserts instead of one, as suggested by my better half.  So it came to be that we ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake as well as the Cheesecake.  We were warned upon requesting the chocolate cake, so I will return the courtesy.  It. Is. Rich.  To call it a cake is inaccurate. The F.C.C. is a dense pastry that opens eyes on taste. I would hazard to call it a brownie, but then I've never had a brownie that good.  The cheesecake was a bit mild. Good, but not anything to exaggerate about. I might suggest it to those without sweet toothes who crave something sweet.  Overall I rate Eighty Acres well. Do not let the exterior fool you; this is THE restaurant for anyone in the area looking for a change of pace.   To the owner, if you're listening, put a damn coat of paint on the place. I want this place to survive long enough for me to try the Wild Boar and a Libertyville!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING and always fresh! Every time we go, we try something new. Not one thing we have tried was anything less than delicious. Nice to have a chic restaurant in Plum."}
{"text":"Have been here 4 times each time with 4 or more people with a bill of over $400 . The food is always good the atmosphere is very nice But I can not say the same for the service . We always wait forever for drinks for Valentine's Day we brought in our own bottle of wine the server never brought us wine glasses so after asking twice i walked up to the bar and got them myself and the last time the server just could not get my husband and I drinks right we had to constantly ask the missing pieces of our drinks either olives or limes etc . I've worked in restaurants I under stand people get busy but we've been here for Valentine's Day when they are packed and on a random week night when there's not many people and service still the same. I just think for what we spend each time and still leaving $100 or so tip that the service should be just a little better ."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to eighty acres for a date night. Its a cute intimate restaurant which is perfect for a date night or even a business lunch/dinner as they have a semi private room in the back. The service was prompt but felt a tad forced, it probably wasn't a good night for our server. Nonetheless the food was incredible! We ordered a couple of cocktails, their flatbread for appetizers and crab cakes and walleye special as our mains. My walleye was lightly pan fried and came on a bed of brown curried lentils- so good! The fish and crab cakes were simply amazing!! Definitely worth going back for, which I guess we will soon!"}
{"text":"Recently celebrated my birthday with family & friends and on our first visit to this restaurant, we were extremely impressed by the decor, menu & wait staff. I highly recommend Eighty Acres if you enjoy fine, fresh cuisine. So happy it is so close to me!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best $100 meals I have ever had.  I will go back here the next time I am in the area.  For appetizers, we had the fresh fried mozzarella and the charcuterie plate.  The fried mozzarella was golden brown and place on top of a marinara sauce that was very good.  The charcuterie plate had a nice collection of pickled cauliflower, carrots, beets and olives that were very good.  The only criticism I have is that for $18, I thought they should have included more meats and cheeses.  For entrees, we had crab cakes and duck.  The duck was cooked perfectly and accompanied by green beans, red cabbage and pretzel spätzle.  The crab cakes had very little filler and had a great flavor.  They were served over a mélange of vegetable that tasted good as well.  For desert, the three layer autumn trio which consisted of a layer of carrot cake, banana cake and what seemed to be a pumpkin pie and was covered with a cream cheese frosting. I thought the frosting was a little sweet but the cake layers were excellent.  I would definitely recommend this establishment to any one in the area.  It was a completely unexpected find on a Friday night in December"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here on a Sunday night, sat out on the patio.    Great selection of local beers.  All food is locally obtained.  Great menu.  Service was excellent.  We both ordered the specials which were spectacular."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went recently on a Sunday evening. The restaurant is nice inside we sat at a small table far from the too loud band.  I found the food to be mediocre for the price. I got the special Mahi Mahi it was over seasoned. I loved the vegatable coulis. John got the duck which he loved. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, that was the best dish all night. The server was nice but slow.  It was a decent meal for too much money. Even though the band was loud I enjoyed them. Don't know if we'll go back. If we do it will just be for the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and honestly with every visit, the place gets better. The staff remembers you, and the place is just homey. The food is absolutely delicious, I would highly recommend the filet, it was cooked to perfection! The merlot demi glaze was to die for, and the mushroom risotto, oh my! The only part I could have passed on were the green beans, as they were just your standard french style fresh green beans. Their house Chardonnay is very good as well, and I would definitely recommend it. I have been here both for date nights with my fiancé, and for date nights with my daughter, so it is definitely a place that can be used for any occasion or with anyone. The owner, Amy, is especially friendly, and out of any restaurant around, I'd prefer giving my money to a local restaurant with great people like her and her husband, over a chain, etc. Definitely will be going back soon! Even on New Years Eve, the place was organized, homey, and the food didn't take long come out, which should definitely give an idea of what to expect any time from them! Exceptional!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic from start to finish. I moved to Monroeville from closer to the city and was so grateful to find an amazing, reasonably-priced option amidst a sea of gross chain restaurants. Everything I've tried so far (and today was my 5th visit in two weeks) has been spectacular from the service to the cocktails to the food. Worth the trip as a destination restaurant if you're not local. You'd never get a reservation at this place if it were in the city."}
{"text":"Great apps and really good main course. The service was on point as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Looks better than it is. The atmosphere was great, but the food was bad. The presentation of the food was beautiful, but the taste was off. I had the duck breast. It was rubbery and not seared in a hot enough pan to crisp up the skin properly. Everything else was ok, other than everything on the plate was cold. I left this restaurant with a bit of a queasy stomach."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Fresh food. Daily specials. Not overly crowded.  It is a beautiful place. Wide open dining room, chic farmstead decor, impressive bar area, fresh flowers on the tables. Quality food and a friendly comfortable environment....perfect combination. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One word - stellar. It's so hard to find good gnocchi. I've been to local Italian restaurants that claim to have little Italian grandmothers cooking in the back, and their gnocchi is gummy and dense. But the reviews for Eighty Acres were so positive, that I decided to give it another shot - and yes, they are exactly as they should be. Little fluffy potato pillows of goodness. The entree was just as good. And surprising, too! After a massive helping of gnocchi, I went with the lightest entree available - the rice cakes with seasonal veggies. They were very tasty. All the veggies were done right - not mushy and overcooked. We had a great waitress at Eighty Acres, too - knew the product, answered questions knowledgeably. And the pistachio gelato was possibly the best I've had in years. All that in a nice, clean, but not pretentious atmosphere. Thank goodness for Eighty Acres!"}
{"text":"This is another difficult review... on the outside it's a bit run down looking and really needs some tlc and it wouldn't take much. From the outside it is not inviting and it certainly doesn't look like a place you would go for $30 plates of food.    The inside is much more inviting, clean and comfortable. Except waiting awkwardly in the hall not knowing if you should just sit down or wait. Finally the bar tender welcomed us in but we wanted a table and waited for a server to seat us, and they really weren't busy.  The female server we had wasn't very friendly, and could use a bit more customer service training. Neverless we ordered.  The husband and I both picked the Bison burgers with fries since one they were a cheaper option on the menu that actually sounded appealing an seemed it would be filling.  We both wished there were better and more selections.  When the food came it looked good, but even the burger was a smaller one...  it tasted very good.. even though I ordered well done and it was still bleeding in the middle. We had waited a bit for food so I just ate around since I was so hungry. Its kind if a shame since the part I ate was very good.   Maybe we will try it agian.  We both left still kinda hungry and stoped for froyo down the road, but for a bill over 50 bucks I don't think that should have happened."}
{"text":"Accidently found this place while trying to catch a really late night dinner. We used to frequent this place when it was Vinny's pizza place. The only thing reminiscent of Vinny's is a slight grease smell. The decor was interesting and cute. The barn doors to the outside patio was a great touch. If it wasn't for the reason we would have been outside!  I was impressed with our dishes. I ordered the Amish Chicken with mashed potatoes. But what I was extremely impressed with was the drinks! I had the 1910 and a basil drink that were THE BEST drinks I've ever had! No wonder there were so many people sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"Had the Scottish Salmon. Cook perfectly, wonderful flavors and the wilted spinach was delicious! Nice dinning area, very good wait staff and knowledgeable about the menu. Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise for me and my husband.  We are almost never on this side of town, but we were both looking up restaurants on Yelp and found this place.    The service was pretty good, and luckily we got in before the rush on a Friday (6:50 pm).  By the time we left there wasn't an empty seat in the house!  Happy hour ended at 7 so we were able to get a quick beverage in. We both ordered a $5 HH draft beer.   We ordered the mussels as a starter.  They were just ok...  Nothing to brag about. Typical white wine sauce.  Came with one slice of toasted bread (we asked for more b/c we are \"dippers\").  The mussels were lightly flavored, but I wanted it to be more robust.    For the main orders, I ordered the shrimp risotto (a special on the chalk board) and my husband ordered the duck (on the menu). Both were really good. I actually really enjoyed the shrimp risotto - it hand some sort of cheesy flavor in the risotto which reminded me of how some restaurants make shrimp and grits.  I was happy with my food.  The duck was soooooooooooo tender.  I'm not sure what red horseradish flavored caviar-looking topping, but it was good with and without the \"sauce\".  For dessert I ordered creme brûlée because the dish is simply meant for me.  It definitely hit the sweet spot!  I can't remember my server's name (oops) but she was extremely nice and helpful with the food choices.  It was a really pleasant experience.  If I'm ever back on that side of town I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this for dinner on Friday and we were definitely surprised. Pleasantly, but still surprised.  For the area, we certainly weren't expecting such a high end menu, which could be pretty shocking to someone who is craving that typical pub menu (and prices). Fortunately we went in with no expectations or cravings.    We sat on the patio which I loved.  Nestled right on top of the hillside, the view isnt spectacular (the golden mile isn't exactly what I'd consider scenic), but its still really nice and a relaxing atmosphere. The menu is small, but well rounded with plenty of options for all kinds of different appetites.  I'm thinking maybe it changes periodically, because the other reviews I read mentioned some dishes that I didn't see while we were there.  I ordered the white sangria for my starter drink, which I expected to be somewhat sweeter, but still tasty. For my dinner, I had the Pannadelle, a perfectly portioned pasta dish with tomatoes, cauliflower, tossed in an oil based sauce.. surprisingly light, yet filling. Sometimes when you order pasta at restaurants you end up feeling overly stuffed and sluggish, but this wasn't that way at all (and it's vegetarian friendly!). My husband had the mussels that were tossed in a pesto sauce and served with bread.. they looked really good, but sadly I'm allergic to mussels so you'll just have to accept my husbands word and bowl of empty shells this time.    For dessert I had the creme Brule  which was small, but so good.. the perfect size to compliment the end of any meal.   Our service was decent. Not horrible but we weren't overly impressed. I feel like when servers see a young couple, they automatically assume we're cheap or just \"don't know\".. we both spent 6 plus years bartending and waiting tables, so we're not cheap and we do know, and we tip based on service, not expectation. So when we get mediocre service, you get a mediocre tip.  Anyway, I'm digressing..   We enjoyed ourselves a lot, and we'll definitely go back for round 2. It's nice to have a higher end local place so close to home."}
{"text":"Really nice little find, amongst what seems to be a plethora of nasty, poorly rated restaurants in the area. Don't be fooled by the outside, the inside is very modern and minimalist, with very attentive staff. The menu is just what I like to see - not too many items, but a wide selection of options from vegetarian, poultry and red meats. We had starters, mains and desert. All of us enjoyed our meals, I would say that the desert was nice, but felt like it was day-old cake since the cake itself was slightly stodgy feeling and not light and fluffy (although it was still very tasty) . It is a little pricy, but certainly worth it than risking it at one of the other local establishments."}
{"text":"In Monroeville on business and looking for a place for dinner, the choices seemed limited to Italian, pizza joints, chains and fast food. That is before I discovered  this foodie jewel. The outside is very non-descript do don't let that deter you. The food is the bomb diggity. I had an appetizer special of grilled peaches wrapped in bacon. Sweet and salty goodness. I actually heard myself coping with delight over the lamb which is locally sourced. Service was great and I enjoyed dining on the outside patio. Tomorrow my flight is at 8 and if there would be enough time I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Much-needed break from chain restaurant after chain restaurant near Murrysville & Monroeville... Atmosphere is welcoming & cozy inside. Always a fresh flower on the table. My husband laughs at me every time we sit down & I touch the petals to make sure it's real. I do really wish there were more entree options, however... We've been here three times, and there's just not a whole lot left for us to explore food-wise. We'd certainly come back to try some newly added entrees worked into the mix."}
{"text":"Really, really good. I would probably give this 4.5 stars, just because I think they need an in-house pastry chef, but I don't want to take it all the way down to 4 stars for that. Service was great, and as the kitchen was running a little behind (enough that I wondered where our mussels were but not long enough that I was upset about it) and the chef kindly bought us a round to make up for it. Drinks were delicious and innovative. Food was perfect and filling. Only complaint is the aforementioned pastry issue - the house-made creme brulee was a bit grainy and overcooked or improperly tempered, and by the server telling us where many of the dessert items came from (i.e. not there), it was clear they're lacking a pastry chef. But the flourless chocolate cake (from somewhere else) was awesome!"}
{"text":"4 stars for atmosphere and drinks. I had the duck which woulda been great except for the cherry jus (yuck). Mules were really tasty. Had to wait a while for the check to get picked up. Aggravating. But the waitress was busy I guess. Get there early bc they run out of a lot of menu items before 7:30. I'd recommend for small groups. Bar is decent size but tvs are small. Not a Sunday football spot."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Golden Mile corridor!  The risotto was excellent...and I gauge my likeliness to return based on the caliber of a vodka sauce or risotto.  So far so good!"}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place.. But every time I have been here it is always just okay but the bill is on the higher end. The meal seems to be pretty special (especially for the area) but the meals I've gotten always seem to leave me looking for something else. I have always had decent service here however I have friends who refuse to return because of their experience. I honestly won't necessarily suggest going here with many better options down the road in both Murrysville and Monroeville."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant with a nicely stocked bar. The food and service are always great. I would check out the soup and specials of the day. If you like lamb you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing menu top to bottom. Had the jerk shrimp tacos, toasted taco shell and delicious inhouse salsa. Everytime I'm here, I find something new to love. For some reason I cannot upload my pic yelp?..."}
{"text":"Repeat visits just keep reminding us how much of a true treasure this restaurant is in any of the Pittsburgh area, but especially in Plum.  For us Monroeville residents, there aren't a whole lot of non-chain choices so to come here is like finding water in a desert -- very refreshing and needed.  Tonight's fare for us was crab cakes for me with a side salad and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and the daily special of shrimp risotto and a glass of Merlot for my husband.  Service, presentation, ambiance, food scrumptiousness all on target.  The main reasons for updating my review are twofold -- 1) to say that this visit was on a Thursday and there was live music -- a bass, guitar, and singer.  It was lovely music and especially nice while dining.  We were going to dine outdoors on their patio but opted for inside when we noticed that trio playing and 2) to say that this venue participates in the Yelp cash back program.  This is the first time I've participated, too.  Search for cash back in Yelp and link your debit or credit card to the program.  That's it.  That's all you have to do.  This particular restaurant provides 10 percent of your purchase back to you on that credit card.  It's the next day and we've already gotten an email regarding the money back.  Sweet.  Ten percent back at this venue is very worthwhile."}
{"text":"One of the best and most consistent restaurants in Pittsburgh. I haven't had a bad thing there. Pricier than your average dinner but well worth every penny. Every dish is thoughtfully made and delicious. I'm waiting to have something I don't love. The east of Pittsburgh is lucky to have a gem like this. Great atmosphere and very modern rustic inside. Will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Relocated back to Westmoreland County after a decade in Western NY. Just so happened the month we move in is the same month as my wife's birthday - so with all of the new move in responsibilities I shorted my birthday celebration duties. Fortunately I found 80 Acres right down the road (less than 2 miles from home!) Other than the non-descript sign and exterior from 286, there's nothing I'd change about the restaurant or my dining experience. A farm to table restaurant with a cute farmhouse interior, fresh ingredients, solid bar selection, and friendly staff. The charcuterie plate was very diverse and well portioned, the grilled pork chop was better than half of the fine dining steakhouses' filets I've gone to, and the prices were reasonable for the quality of food. Even if I weren't right down the street, I would definitely add 80 Acres to my \"must go\" list. It's so nice that you can get a quality, fine dining meal in the suburbs and not worry about going to downtown to a place that is probably 2x the price and 1/2 the quality."}
{"text":"Definitely off the beaten path, Eighty Acres is a diamond in the rough. The exterior of the building is nothing too attractive and if I hadn't have read about this place in Pittsburgh Magazine, I definitely would have turned around and went elsewhere.   The interior of the building is decorated to the tune of Rustic Americana.   I had the Roasted Beet Salad that had a perfect balance of deep fried goat cheese paired with crisp apple in mixed greens.   Next I devoured a mushroom, roasted tomato, pesto and goat cheese flatbread. It's basically an awesome 12\" pizza. What I might have liked best is that there were plenty of vegetarian dishes to choose from.   The only downside is that the service I received was less than great, but I went at a weird time of day, so I'd consider that one my own fault."}
{"text":"Loved my dinner - strip steak - husband got the walleye.  The cheddar potatoes were awesome.  I'd go back again - Nicole was awesome.  Very busy but she had the confidence to tell us the kitchen was backed up?  I like honesty when I'm waiting, then the wait isn't so bad.  The arugula salad with goat cheese, almonds and pears was amazing!"}
{"text":"Dined there for the first time lat evening.  A little deceiving from the outside.  Inside was beautifully decorated.  Cozy, comfortable atmosphere.   Dinner was exceptionally good.  Excellent service.  Extremely pleasant experience.   Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Eighty Acres Kitchen & Bar and it lived up to my high expectations since every bite I tried on trip 1 was amazing.  I was visiting for a family event and was so happy this gem of a restaurant was selected for our lunch.    We shared the Coyote Queso with pita and a Gathering Board to start.  What's a Gathering Board?  Good question! From their menu it's charcuterie, cheese, pickled vegetables, house made preserves, brick oven baked crackers, honeycomb.  I love my veggies but what they use to pickle would make a fan out of anyone.  I tried everything on the board and raved over each bite.    Coyote Queso was decadent, hot and oozy.  Truth be told, we ordered a 2nd because the first was so tasty.  For my entree, I had their Salmon with Quinoa and Spinach with a lovely red pepper sauce.  Another winner. Salmon cooked perfectly and it made me feel okay about what was to come.  Our table ordered one of every dessert on the menu.  Embarrassing to admit but we were swept up in the moment and the descriptions sounded so good we couldn't decide.  How good is life when you can try THEM ALL??  Hard to pick a favorite but the maple bar would be mine if forced to choose.  Service was friendly, quick and accurate.  Don't be scared off by the outside.  It doesn't give a clue to the pretty space inside.  This is a place you can come for a special occasion or for no reason at all.  I'm in town again in August and I've already made plans to have a meal here.   This is BY FAR the best restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh.  If you don't live nearby, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Nice enough place. Nicer than expected considering the location. Fine dining feel in a local atmosphere. We started with a couple cocktails and then had the gnocchi. It was enough to share very creamy. We added the bacon for an upcharge. Do not expect more bacon than enough to sprinkle in flavor. (My suggestion would be to keep the bacib as a standard in the gnocchi and people could ask for no bacon, might be a better selling point). Meals are small plate style so do not come ravenous! Luckily I was not so the flank steak portion worked out for me. I also would have changed around some of the sides but that was personal preference. The waitress was very friendly and the place was not too crowded so you could have a conversation. They also had a nice bar that looked appealing. Overall it was a nice place."}
{"text":"Service was really good.  Food was good.  Nice atmosphere.   I ordered the Bloody Mary bar. It was ok.    I had fish taco to eat.  It was good.  I would go back.  Prices aren't bad.   The restaurant is cute."}
{"text":"It's lovely that there is a kind of restaurant like this off of Golden Mile Highway, but too bad it didn't impress me much.   Decor was very upscale rustic and menu is very simple. Hubs and I went here for our anniversary and they don't do anything special. With entree prices starting at $25 - $35, there's not even free bread. It's rather cramped inside and our 2-person table was TINY. I could hear every word from the table beside me. Our waitress was brisk and the very phony-nice type. She said the polite things she's supposed to say but refused to make eye contact and didn't check in very often. Drink menu is super overpriced and small.   My wild boar presentation was gross. It was muddy, monochromatic and turned into a game of try to find the meat! I was surprisingly full afterwards so I guess the portions were on point. This isn't a place I would go back to or recommend anyone."}
{"text":"Plum is an area that for a long time was in desperate need of a good place to eat, and a nice upscale bar. Eighty Acres is a fantastic bar serving a wide variety of beer, wine, and top shelf liquors.   From the outside the building doesn't look like much, but inside you find a very modern yet natural decor. It isn't gaudy or elaborate, but it has a very nice clean feel about it. The bar is large, beautiful, and is really the focal point of the establishment.   The menu isn't huge but it provides lots of local and organic offerings. The Bison Burger in particular was wonderful. Most times they feel sort of like a gimmick, and too dry, but this burger is something else. It is really a masterpiece on a bun. Succulent, juicy, and perfectly cooked and at a reasonable $9 I will be back for many more.   The dish I tried that shocked me the most was the meatloaf. It wasn't like what mother used to make, which in the case of my mother is a very good thing. It was rich and piping hot and served in a large portion.   Stop in if you are tired of the typical dive bar offerings you have on this stretch and you will be surprised how affordable this hidden gem really is.  And of course if you love the Farm to Table concept, hormone free, and supporting small new businesses this is the place to go. The owners are often working and are wonderful to talk to. Ask them how the place got it's name it's a great story that I could not do justice on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Great Local Brunch!! Valentine's Day Victory!  For Valentine's Day I had to spring into action and come up with a last minute set of plans for Brunch.  Although most places were packed, I gave Eighty Acres a chance. I heard great things about this place.  I called and talked to a very nice guy who squeezed us in. We got there at 12:45 for our 1:00 seating and sat right down.  The interior is so cozy and comforting.  Even with extra tables added there was still enough room to not be on top of your neighbors.  We got to order use their regular Brunch Menu instead of a Valentine's Day Menu.  For Drinks my girlfriend got the Bloody Mary Bar, and I got the Allegheny Sparkler (Prosecco, Mulled Berries, etc.) For an appetizer we split a Cinnamon Swirl Maple Frosted Muffin. It was DELICIOUS!!! For our meals, My Dear had Huevos Ranchero, and I had the Sourdough French Toast.  Both were Great!!  The French Toast has Raspberry Sauce and a homemade vanilla whipped cream.  After our meals, we got one of the Valentine's Special Desserts.  The had a Raspberry Almond Bar with Homemade Vanilla Gelato, and Raspberry Sauce poured on top.  Eighty Acres knocked it out of the park!!  This was a GREAT BRUNCH!!!  I will definitely be back to try some other items on the list.  This was a great place for a holiday and a brunch!  Great Brunch just around the bend!!!"}
{"text":"My family went to Eighty Acres for brunch. After reading all of the good reviews, I was expecting a fine dining experience. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. I ordered a blueberry muffin and a hamburger with fries. (I know, odd combination.)  The muffin was small and came to the table cold.  Not room temperature, but refrigerator cold. Maybe warm is too much to ask, but cold?  The burger had a nice flavor, but there was too much bun and way too little meat. On top of that, the bun was stale. My wife ordered the omelet special, which was ham and cheese plus some veggies. They used chipped ham!  You know, the kind you get at the deli counter. I just don't understand the good reviews. Maybe it's the atmosphere, which I found to be pleasant. But for me, the food has to live up to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eighty Acres is a much-needed restaurant in Plum; nothing like it exists in this area. To dine like you do at Eighty Acres, you'd have to venture into the city. Glad to see Plum expanding its palate!   The service: Excellent. Called to make a reservation, and had no problem securing a table for six same day. Waiter was attentive and gave friendly advice when we could not decided between two entrees. Every employee had a smile on their face and were incredibly amiable.   The food: SO. GOOD. Portion sizes are on point. No leftovers at this table!   We order three appetizers-- shrimp corn dogs (fun idea, but tasted like carnival food), coyote queso (I did not partake in this, as it has chorizo in it, but the meat-eaters at the table cleaned plate), and mussels (drenched in buttery goodness, surrounded by beans and tomatoes). We ate every bite. It was the perfect amount of food.   I ordered the Scottish salmon for my main course and was incredibly pleased.  It was cooked perfectly and sat on a bed of quinoa, spinach, and some sort of tomato salsa that added a great flavor to the dish. Despite being full with three bites left, I forced it down-- too good to waste. Everyone at the table ordered some kind of seafood and was happy with their choice. We all agreed that we had made the right decision to come here for dinner.  The ambiance: The decor was beautiful-- wood panelling on the walls, soft lighting, nice bathrooms (important stuff, you know), fresh holly on each of the table...we couldn't stop commenting on how well the place was decorated.   Will definitely be back over the holiday season!"}
{"text":"Burger was good and the place is very clean. Service was good and quick. It's important to be quick at lunch because of time limits. The only problem is a limited menu with few selections. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly great place.   Very accommodating and attentive staff. Food is very high quality, especially given the unassuming location. Patio is a beautiful option for a nice evening.    Two negatives: The major one is they have no dedicated  kids menu -price nor portions. So becomes challenging for elementary age kids without sharing or expecting to take a lot of food home.   A minor negative is no espresso. Given the ambience and quality of food, this omission may leave you wanting in terms of finishing a nice meal.   If negatives are of little or no consequence to you, would recommend giving it a try."}
