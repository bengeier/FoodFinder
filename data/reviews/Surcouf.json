{"text":"One of the best French restaurants in la belle province - bar none! They have been in the same location in the Ste Anne village since 1976 and the quality of their food has never wavered!  Try the superb lobster bisque (laced with cognac - natch!)...and follow it up with an excellent choice from their table d'hote or a la carte menu. The rack of lamb is to die for!  They have an extensive wine list and the owner refuses to profit excessively on the price of any bottle - max. 200%! And...they have many privately imported labels which are not available anywhere else!  The ambiance is casual, warm (especially near the fireplace in winter), with attentive and friendly service.  The prices are a little upscale but the dining experience is more than worth it!"}
{"text":"This was a lovely evening.  My husband and I were seated by the front window over the gardens.  We had the onion soup and lobster bisque, shared the Chateaubriand for two, and then profiteroles and chocolate mousse.  The Chateaubriand was truly spectacular, perfectly prepared and served, with just the right accompaniments.  The bearnaise was perfectly balanced.  The meat was so tender and melted on my tongue. Every bite stopped time.  The profiteroles were also excellent, particularly the chocolate sauce, which was not too sweet and probably made with Dutch-processed cocoa.  All in all, it was one of the best dinners I've had.  And after dinner we had a nice walk along the canal!  Beautiful!"}
