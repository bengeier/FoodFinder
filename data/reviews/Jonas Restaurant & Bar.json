{"text":"SO GOOD.  Just do it. The service is great and the food is so grandma-style tasty.  It's veggie friendly; I got pasta with dill & feta, and my dude got chicken paprikash.  Both dishes were large & delicious."}
{"text":"Jonas' is one of those rare places where the food is as fantastic as the service. The couple who own this place are SO NICE and you can tell they absolutely love what they do. Even when I call to place an order for takeout, she's very friendly and helpful. The food is out of this world, too. I always have the chicken paprikash but I've tried the schnitzel off my friend's plate and it was to die for. Highly recommended, I hope they stay open for many years to come."}
{"text":"The best Hungarian next to my moms of course :) 

You have to try the chicken paprikash. Amazing!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, love the chicken paprikash and the cabbage rolls (huge!).  The full dishes are big so share with your friends so that you can try everything.  Great service from a well run family business.  You will love it if you have ever visited Eastern Europe and you miss the food."}
{"text":"To my tastes it doesn't get much better than this. The restaurant is cozy. It really feels more like eating at your Hungarian grandmother's house than a restaurant. I'll quickly note that I don't have any Hungarian grandparents but I'm assuming that this is a pretty good approximation. The owners are always present, one being the only chef in the kitchen and the other being the only server. They are incredibly sweet people and have really put their hearts into the restaurant. Needless to say, inconsistency is not something that you will experience here.

As for the food, it's really remarkable. Over the years I've cycled between favorite dishes (Beef feta stew, schnitzel, Paprikash to name just a few). They have a set daily special for each day of the week and all of them are fantastic. I'm particularly partial to the Wednesday roast duck and the Friday potato pancake. They're just ridiculously good. I can't think of any good reason not to end your meal with a sweet crepe. The walnut and chocolate is my favorite.

 Prices are extremely reasonable and under no circumstances will you ever leave hungry. I really couldn't ask for much more from a restaurant."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. Cabbage noodles are a must. The bread, butter and hot peppers they put on your table is a great start. Careful on the cream chicken. Not for the lactose intolarant. Try to keep room for dessert. Get the crepes with a glass of the sweet fruit liquor. I gave it only four stars because of the rice pasta sort of thing they serve. Not my favourite starch."}
{"text":"Don't expect much and you'll be fine. Schnitzel is good but the food was just reheated in a microwave. The side veggies were from a frozen bag and I'm pretty sure the spatzle was too. Cute atmosphere, nice service, food was edible but yeah...not worthy of the rave reviews. If you are wanting a decent schnitzel in Calgary just go to the Rustic Bakery on 17th Ave...save your money."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for over 15 years. The best chicken paprikash I have had. Scary decor (which always proves the food is good) Great  service, and consistent!!"}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food.  I always feel like coming here on a cold, winter day."}
{"text":"This was my first stab at Hungarian food and I will be back. After reading the reviews for Jonas, I ordered the \"famous\" chicken paprikash. It was very tasty and a good sized portion. I ordered the small ($13) for dinner at it was a perfect size. 

The decor is pretty tongue in cheek old world European but the hostess/owner more than makes up for it. 

My only issue was that the paprika was reheated in the microwave right before being served which caused the pasta in the paprikash to have some heat spots while other sections were only luke-warm. 

While I dont generally support restaurants heating food in a microwave, in spite of this faux pas, Jonas Restaurant has made a fan out of me."}
{"text":"First came here in 2006 and food is still exceptionally good. Would be nice if they had other Hungarian dishes on the menu (Lecsó for e.g.) but can't complain about the exceptional food they already have!"}
{"text":"Everytime I eat a Jonas, I over eat.  I usually go with my good friend A, and we each order a dish and share.  Each time we go we try to order less, it never works.  Jonas is a hungarian joint that serves ample portion sizes at a great price!

This time we ordered chicken liver dumpling soup, chicken paprikash, breaded catfish, cabbage pasta AND a crepe for dessert to share.  They have a special every night, be prepared, that night was duck and as we sat down we were told they had JUST run out!
Personal favourites include chicken liver night, which I think is tuesday or wednesday.  So delicious.  

The atmosphere is kitsch and very intimate.  Large groups beware and call ahead, they also have special platters for large groups.  

This place is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Friendly service and big portions of authentic Hungarian home-made meals. Over the years, I have never been disappointed with the quality of the food and service. Also, they have lots of gluten free options. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a hearty and delicious meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. If this is what Eastern Europe is really like, I'm in.  The bread that comes a the beginning of the meal came with fresh jalapenos.  Already sold, but then ordered the Chicken Paprikash, and it was probably the best thing I've eaten in Calgary.  Finished off with apricot crepes and was not disappointed.  The owners are friendly and great to talk with.  If you're in Calgary, this is the one place you have to try."}
{"text":"A great little authentic Hungarian restaurant! I had the chicken paprikish, based on reviews here and it was great and just like Mom's.  The larger size is quite massive though and had I known I would have gotten the smaller size.  The cucumber salad is amazing if your into cucumbers!  Also had a cinnamon crepe for dessert, which is smothered in chocolate and loaded with cinnamon, very good."}
{"text":"What a neat little place!

A friend and I came here for a Friday lunch, not knowing what to expect. I've never had Hungarian food before (except some pastries and goulash made by a distant in law when I was a kid). It is not often you get to try something totally new and take a leap of faith.

The service was fantastic, fast and friendly. But the food was the real winner. My friend and I split two small entrees-the weiner schnitzel and the chicken stew dish. Both were delicious, fresh and hot. It was the perfect amount for both of us. It was so nice to have real, homemade food that tasted like someone's grandma made it.

I have to admit I was a little unsure at first but I will definitely be back. The decor is interesting and really gives you a sense of the owners' pride in their culture. Nice to see such a unique spot doing so well downtown.

I would recommend making a reservation during peak times, especially if there is more than 3 people in your group."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place in downtown Calgary. It's kind of long and narrow with Hungarian decore on the walls. Somewhat dated. The server was polite but a little impatient.  The menu was limited, but that may be an artifact of Hungarian food, which though good, is not all that diverse.  I had the chicken paprikah with the dumplings.  Presentation was somewhat plain for the $17 with the chicken in sauce on one side of the plate and a large dollop of very small oblong shaped dumplings on the other side.  Looked more like a Mexican dish.  But did not taste Mexican.  Also tried a side order of one cabbage roll....my goodness it was huge and I mean huge!  It was full of meat and rice and had a distinct European taste, but I was too full of the chicken to finish it.  The litre of semi sweet white wine was good.  All in all a good place to visit once, but for me it was too much meat and potatoes and not enough veggies and variety for a second visit."}
{"text":"Well, most people I take here are always surprised that such a quint little place exists downtown. The food here is very filling and although the menu is small, the authenticity is very nice. Great place to take your date too IMO."}
{"text":"FAN-EFFIN-TASTIC. 

Seriously.

The people that know this place know what a gem it is in our city.

The food is excellent, the service is superb and the pricing is beyond reasonable!

If you've never been, the only person missing out is YOU.

GET. THERE."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying two words; Chicken. Paprikash. I recommend this is what you order your first time visiting Jonas. It's unpretentious, uncomplicated, and is totally satisfying. 

Jonas Restaurant is a small and unassuming restaurant that you might overlook if you weren't on foot or purposely seeking it out. But the little hole-in-the-wall feel it has is cozy and casual. 

Each table of guests receives a basket of European-style rye bread with butter and fresh sliced of jalapeno peppers. A seemingly odd combination at first, but fun to eat while you wait. Order one of the beers they keep in stock from central and eastern Europe and sip away the time while you wait for your paprikash. The small drinks menu on the table also lists a few Hungarian words and phrases along with their English translation, which I always think are fun to try and learn.

The chicken paprikash is served with Hungarian nokedli dumplings, which are reminiscent of German spaetzle. They make the perfect sponge to soak up all the thick, creamy paprika sauce. The chicken is always tender and flavorful as well. 

For dessert, the Hungarian-style crepes are also delicious. They are pretty much exactly the same as Czech \"palacinky\" which are basically a thicker, slightly more rubbery version of a French crepe. Worth a try if you can even think about eating another bite of food after drowning the woes of your day in paprikash."}
{"text":"I have been to Hungary a couple of times and can say the restaurant experience and the food is authentic.

It's a great place to go even if it might look 'old fashioned' but this is what typical a restaurant looks like in Hungary :)

Love it and will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a not to be missed treasure for Hungarian, and all food lovers in general. The portions are huge and the taste is amazing. You can really tell that the chef loves his work. The menu isn't enormous but the selections cover the main bases of Hungarian classics from Goulash to Chiken Paprikash. If you are very lucky you may get there in time for stuffed potato pancakes. these are only available certain nights and are so delectable that they sell out fast! Its a small place so reservations are pretty much a must. Add to that the coziness makes it an ideal first date spot. I absolutely love this place and can't wait to go back, again and again, and again!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST GO! Its a family run restaurant with a cozy casual atmosphere, great value and most importantly - AMAZING FOOD.

The menu is small and each day of the week has a special meal.  Its traditional Hungarian style food which means good portions and very tasty.  I rarely call out places as must go, but I have had nothing but great food, service, and experiences here.

Good for families or more intimate meals.  It can get backed up during the dinner rush, so if you are in a hurry go during non peak dinner times (6-8), otherwise, relax and try some tasty Hungarian wine while you wait."}
{"text":"For $20 I would expect freshly prepared potato pancakes and fresh vegetables. The veg I got tasteless coming from a frozen bag you buy in superstore. The pancake was precooked and tasted nothing like the one I had several times in Hungary."}
{"text":"I love going to this restaurant.  The inside / decor is nothing special but the genuine warmth / love of the owners shines through in the food.  It's real food, prepared like at home.  The portions are quite large.

Try the crepes for dessert if you have left room!"}
{"text":"Best *Hungarian* food that I've tried and too bad there is nothing like this in Vancouver!! All the times I've went the food has always been consistent and superb! Ever so tasty and portions big enough that you can share. Make sure you save some room for Hungarian dessert - Hungarian crepes.  

I recommend the stuffed cabbage role, schnitzel but there is lots of great food on the menu if you're wanting to try other dishes. Place that I'll keep going back to over and over again! : )"}
{"text":"It really doesn't get better in terms of authentic Hungarian home-cooked goodness. This is a stick-to-your-ribs kind of place with excellent, friendly service and a really cozy atmosphere.

My advice--go on a Friday and get the special for the day which is a beef goulash wrapped in potato pancake with paprika sauce. Your friends should get the schnitzel and the chicken paprikash for the whole experience. The portions are enormous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"On the recommendations of so many others, I tried the grub here.  Perhaps Hungarian food isn't my thing, but I found myself rather indifferent about the whole experience.  I won't return to Jonas unless someone wants me to go there."}
{"text":"As a Hungarian,  this restaurant can't get any more authentic. It is a warm, classy environment with native Music playing and food that is absolutely amazing. For the portions , the prices are fair as well! And there are always leftovers for lunch the next day! The service is always prompt and the owners take great pride and care in their work to ensure a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets. Jonas is a little bit of Hungary in downtown Calgary. The restaurant is small but you can tell the owners have big hearts and are eager to share their food and culture with you. I rounded up a group of 11 of the Calgary Opera Chorus members and headed for dinner on a brief rehearsal break. Mrs. Jonas (I don't know how to spell her first name) suggested we go with the family style meal they offer for large groups and it was a hit. We got platters of chicken paprikash, wiener schnitzel and cabbage rolls. All were delicious. The cabbage rolls are giant size and as authentic as you can get, made with sour cabbage. The schnitzel was lightly breaded and crispy on the outside. Food was served with potatoes and dumplings (was what I know as spaetzel). There is pay street parking. The place is small so reservations are definitely recommended. Great value for $22/per person. The meal was pre-ordered to facilitate speed and the large group."}
{"text":"I had the goulash, a chocolate crepe, espresso and wine. It was all delicious, and had the home made taste and feel. A unique cozy feel in this restaurant. Felt like I was at my grandmothers house. Worth the visit. Prices are even good :)"}
{"text":"the chicken paprikash was excellent for a chicken dish.  Egg noodles are also called dumplings at this place, and i think in most backwards part of hungary.  Normally dumplings are always big filled with things.  even Perogie dumplings from ukrain are  dumplings.  Spietze is more precise and its called egg noodles - not dumplings.  Even edelwiess village at the german deli calli t egg noodles.   But I had to have an arguments.   I would say that Shnitzel really is not Hungarian - but german.

I guess if you enjoy bland home cooked regular food then you will enjoy this.  I could never understand - having disliked cabbage rolls and rouladin and vereniken etc from a small child having them all the time.  I would go to friends houses who had chicken wings everyday and hotdogs and think how lucky they were.  They would come to my house and have meatloaf and say it was the best thing theyve ever eaten in their lives.  I guess its all in the perspective"}
{"text":"This is one of Calgary's hidden Eastern European gems.  The food is delicious and is comfort food especially on a cold day.  The owner is so friendly and we had lots of laughs.  I will definitively go back and introduce others to this great place.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I written a review for this place before?!!!

The food is greasy yummy eastern European goodness! It feels homey with the traditional Hungarian decor and classical music.

It's home cooking 101. Reminds me of my grandma's place where I used to stuff myself so I couldn't move anymore."}
{"text":"I just got home after eating some of the best cabbage rolls I have ever had. Honestly, they were as good as my Czech grandmother used to make when i was a boy. The chicken schnitzel was so moist and so full of flavor. The owners of Jonas really offer some great service and atmosphere that make you feel like you are in Budapest at  a  homey Hungarian Dining Room that offers the best food they can, and they go out of their way to make sure that you are enjoying everything that is under their control."}
{"text":"This small Family run Hungarian restaurant is to die for.  The food is just like your grandmother would make (if your grandmother was from Eastern Europe like mine).

If you're not sure what to order the cabbage rolls and the chicken paprikash are good options.  Reservations are highly recommended if you're going to try for lunch, dinner reservations are probably not required most nights."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely outstanding, with service to match. Home cooking in a warm atmosphere, will deffinitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great little place with a very warm atmosphere.  I got take out which was a great option, but it seemed the service had I dined there would have been great.

The food was excellent - I had the goulash and the chicken paprikash - both were so delicious.  Portions were very generous but I literally could not stop eating it.  Great homecooked flavor."}
{"text":"Szia yelpers! Hogy vagy? 

I learnt that from the back of the drink menu at Jonas over lunch today. I'll let you go check it out to find out what the words mean.

I love love LOVE Jonas! Twas my first time visiting them today at lunch. It's tiny, it's cozy, and it's oozing with traditional Hungarian touch.... from the food to the decor. Walk through the front door. You'll see.

The menu is simple with some lunch specials, soups, salads, entrees and desserts. Believe it or not, they've also got a vegetarian section (though it's mixed with their pasta section). You could order your own entree and enjoy a small or large platter of quality AND quantity of yummy goodness on a dish... or you could do what my friend and I did today and split 3 small entrees between the two of you. It's more than enough, I promise!

We ordered the chicken paprikash, wiener schitzel and cabbage rolls. Mrs Owner was the one serving our food to us... as she came back with a couple of empty plates so we could split the dishes, she caught my lunch mate pretending to take all the food and with a little wink said \"hey! Don't do that, that's not very nice.\" 

What else is there to say about the food except that it's delicious, hearty, homemade and more than worth the price tag on the menu (which isn't actually that much... around $11 for most small entrees, and just under $15 for large).

Just watch the peppers that come with the little basket of bread at each table... they're spicy!!

Vissza Jövök!

{"text":"I've lived in Calgary for almost 16 years, every day of that time in the inner city, and am ashamed to say that until two days ago I had never dined at Jonas. I'd got takeout before and extolled the chicken paprikash with spaetzle but had never eaten in. In anticipation of the Kraftwerk concert some central European food seemed appropriate so off we went. I got the \"Wiener Schnitzel\" (it's actually pork, not veal, so strictly speaking it's \"Schnitzel, Wiener Art\" but I prefer pork schnitzel anyway so no biggie) and partner got that amazing paprikash again. Both dishes were stunning! BIG portions for the \"full size\" orders we both got, nicely plated with some neat attention to detail there. My schnitzel was three cutlets, as good as many I've had in Germany and more tender than some, and the accompanying potatoes were completely delectable. We split a chocolate and walnut crepe for desert and the total damage wasn't even $50. Service was really friendly, endearing even. The space itself is...homely I suppose but it all works, reminded me of mom and pop German restaurants in Wisconsin more than what you'd experience in Europe per se but for Calgary it's unique and pretty amazing as it's Calgary's only Hungarian resto- thank goodness it's good!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!

A friend suggested this place to meet for lunch downtown today and I was more than pleasantly surprised!  The food was amazing and the portions were big enough that I get to have to same lunch again tomorrow :)

I had the mushroom paprikash and the Hungarian cabbage salad.  The paprikash was tasty, hearty and oh so comforting.  The salad was absolutely perfect for me as I don't like creamy coleslaws as much as vinegar based.

I will absolutely be here again.  And again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Rude waitress who was according to pictures on the wall the owner.
We came in and asked if she has a table for 2 (there were clearly a few available without reserved signs). She said she has to think about it?? Then left and started taking orders for a table of 6. We waited patiently, but then she started clearing away another table and ignored us completely. Will never come back here."}
{"text":"This is an intimate and authentic restaurant, which Calgary doesn't have enough of.  

I tried the Potato Pancake stuffed with Beef in Paprikash Sauce.  It was so heavy and hearty that I could still feel it in my belly this morning.  It was a bit salty but I enjoyed the multiple textures.  I'm very picky about beef and this was done well.  No fat and flavorful.  I was a little disappointed that the vegetables were not fresh.  They appeared to be the frozen variety that you buy in the grocery store.  I still ate them though and it was fine.

The bread served was good too and I made the mistake of putting the accompanying peppers on it.  They were so hot that they robbed me of use of my taste buds for a few minutes.  The entree was served very quickly after we ordered.

My dinner partner and I shared the Ground Nut and Chocolate Crepes for dessert.  Hello!  That's worth the extra full belly for.  The nuts were made into a paste and the chocolate was melted and thin but yet still seemed rich.  It certainly is not Nutella.

I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Being used to homemade Hungarian food will probably not endear one to Jonas' slightly-off dishes (I guess it's the complaint with any ethnic food - it's never like your mother's!), but for people wanting to experience an authentic Hungarian meal will not do better than Jonas - mainly because there is no alternative in Calgary! I jest: I would recommend it. The chicken paprikas is quite good; I don't normally use sour cream in that particular dish, but it works well. The portions were huge, but the seating is not: call ahead if you are in a group."}
{"text":"Delicious Hungarian food!! I had the chicken paprika and it was great!!.. The cheese crepe for desert was very good as well.. I went there for lunch and everything was excellent!,.. I definitely will go back there!!"}
{"text":"Cabbage rolls!!! I love the giant cabbage rolls here and it makes for a good place for take out. It's got a very homey feeling and I definitely come back here over and over again. would recommend!"}
{"text":"Just visited this wonderful little restaurant. My husband had the goulash soup and chicken paprika while I enjoyed the cabbage rolls. All tasted wonderful. Good authentic flavours. The restaurant is cozy with plenty of Hungarian decor. It feels a little like being invited into someone's home for a great home made meal. We enjoyed the food and atmosphere and will certainly return."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Hungarian restaurant before Jonas, but have eaten a lot of Hungarian food since my Grandma is completely Hungarian.  I have to say that comparing her home-cooked food to this restaurant, I was not disappointed.  I really got the feel of Hungarian-style eating and restaurants at this place.

I've been back a few times after my first visit to Jones because I enjoyed the previous experiences.  I loved having different (and I mean different) meals to choose from each time I went.  I'm a huge fan of the culture and dishes, so I love visiting this place when I'm in the mood for something different.

Jonas has a wonderful home-cooked feel to it, and I would know since I've eaten my Grandma's home-cooking for so long.  The prices for the dishes are not unreasonable for the amounts that you get.  I have never, ever left this place still hungry.  I guess Hungarians really know how to feed your hunger!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Liver Special only available on Tuesday - Yummy!!  Give it a try!

Had to have my liver dumpling soup.  Great for these cold, cold days."}
{"text":"I used to live in the building above Jonas and never realized I had such a gem of a restaurant beneath me the entire time.

I've thoroughly enjoyed every meal from there, and you can't beat a family owned place.  They are so friendly and accommodating. 

Favourite dishes are:

Chicken Paprikash - this is a difficult dish to make at home, I've tried it and it never quite tastes as good as it is at Jonas'

Chicken Schnitzel - this is authentic schnitzel, its large, flattened and thinly breaded.  The potatoes it comes with are to die for."}
