{"text":"I don't want to be all negative Nancy about this...but this review is intended for out-of -towners  who are not familiar with the quality of fine dining options in Cleveland. This is not the best seafood, not even close. The food is average, very bland, reminds me of dining out in the sixties, before we were introduced to flavors. The mussels were of good quality, but no flavor, the cocktail sauce for cold seafood was bland, the tarter sauce for the small and just-okay crab cakes tasted like it was from a jar.  The bouillabaisse was fair, scallops okay too. There  are dozens of restaurants with fantastic food in Cleveland- fire, Dante, Lola, l'albatros,  and on and on...  That being said - the service at Pier W was exceptional, every server, bus staff, food runner was remarkable. Truly impressed with the staff. And of course the view is the reason to go. It was spectacular. The space is perfect for a romantic date and it was fun to see all the couples enjoying a night out!   So, go to Pier W! Enjoy the view! Bask in the glow of the romantic couples! But don't go for the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, but very disappointed with my reservation.  I called on a Monday to reserve a table on Thursday BY THE WINDOW since I had an out of town guest with me.  I thought it would be nice to overlook the lake with a view of downtown.  I was told those seats were 1st come, 1st served.  I would think that a call on Monday for dinner on Thursday would qualify as \"1st come\".  Would I suggest this restaurant based on customer service ?? ...probably not!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!   Called to get a table for 4 and told nothing available but that we can sit in lounge with no waiting.   We did.  While sitting and having dinner we watched and saw empty tables the entire time we had our meal and several drinks.  What's up with that?  Kinda upset us because we would have been in and out but settled for a spot near the bar on a high top!  Dinner was average,  atmosphere great!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've eaten at in the last few months.  I ordered nine oysters (three types x 3), the lobster bisque, and the sorbet trio.   The meal began with a plate of bread (rosemary and plain) and whipped butter and hummus. The crust was authentically flaky and crunchy, and the inside of the bread was chewy, the way bread should be made. 10/10 on the bread.   The oysters were melt-in-your-mouth fresh. The miyagi oysters were exceptionally tasty. I didn't need to add any sauces or lemon juice, either- they were delicious by themselves.  Lobster bisque- not excessively salty, and the flavor was deep and colorful.  The sorbet trio was luscious... I found the sesame shortbread piece to be out-of-place taste-wise and I wondered why it was there, but that aside, perfect. Strawberry, raspberry, and mango. Strawberry is typically a difficult fruit to use in puree form (from my experience) because it's so watery and the flavor is often not as strong that of other fruits, but the chef did a fantastic job in keeping the flavor without using excessive sugar. Maybe a lot of churning and keeping it at a very cold temperature helped also.  All in all, a magnificent meal. The view of the water was lovely too."}
{"text":"Service was okay, we felt rushed food presentation very poor as well as food was very bland, chef really needs to taste his pallet,  restroom were dirty l will not go here again was told by someone to take my wife here for dinner not worth my money or my time. Thumbs down from me and my wife , very disappointed l cook better at home."}
{"text":"The Cajun swordfish and sriracha potato special was to die for! Teri gave great service!!!"}
{"text":"The service and the ambiance are fantastic. The view from the dining area makes you feel like you're eating at the edge of the pier, almost out on the water. That being said, I was quite underwhelmed by the food, especially given the price point. While the oysters were quite good, the bouillabaisse lacked the flavor I would've expected and the salmon served on a wooden cedar plank, while interesting, again didn't have much unique flavor. Perhaps the minimalist approach is what they were going for, but it was only OK for me."}
{"text":"Don't let the circa 1960s/1970s condo towers scare you away, Pier W is a great spot for happy hour (or dinner if it's date night) with a cool vibe inside and a breathtaking view of Lake Erie and the downtown skyline. (A side grumble that we don't have more venues like this on our shoreline).   While this is a great place to take that special someone, as the dining room offers many tables by the glass hull-shaped walls, and the food offerings range from gourmet to safe (for those that may have a limited palate), my favorite part of the restaurant is the bar. With killer cocktails, different levels of tables and bar seats available, a great bar menu and the piano player, this is one of my favorite spots for a happy hour or pregame spot. Don't miss out on the angus sliders on brioche buns, or the grouper tacos if you choose to nosh on some of the bar samplings."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant in CLE with a view of the lake.  This is a real gem from the view to the food.  The modernization of the restaurant several years ago was well worth it - great dining experiences.  One of my last visits was for lunch on a beautiful sunny day.  Just lovely.  The food is some of the finest in town.  Pier W also has an extensive wine list.  Check out the bar."}
{"text":"Went to Pier W for dinner last night.  It was my son's first time.  We have been there for happy hour which was great. For what we paid last night for appetizers and dinner I thought the portions were very skimpy  My son ordered the boullabaisse. What a rip off. Barely anything in it. He also had oysters Rockefeller.  I had half of one and did not detect any oyster or flavor in it. I got crevice which was good. My husband got the miniscule crab cakes and for dinner a small portion of short ribs. My dinner of pumpkin encrusted fish arrived luke warm. Sent it back and was still like warm but the plate was hot??? The drinks were great. Will go back for happy hour but never dinner. It was not the Pier W I remember. Don't order the boullabaise!"}
{"text":"We were here for New Year's Eve and it was delicious. The shrimp and scallop linguine was one of the best pastas I've ever tasted.. and I typically don't like to order pasta since it's so easy to make at home but this one is the best. Steak was really good too. Perfect for a special occasion or night out."}
{"text":"I have been to Pier W several times, and each time has been a pleasant experience.  Views are nice, food is fresh, service is great.  If you are looking for a special dinner out, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I had heard that this was the best brunch in town!  Now I believe it!  Great selection of breakfast and lunch foods - mimosa, good seafood, and incredible desserts!  Great service!  We had a table right on the water and it was gorgeous!"}
{"text":"The meal was solid.  The waitress was very professional and the ambience provided for a nice evening-you could actually hear the folks you were dining with!  A nice place to take out of town guests to showcase Cleveland and the surrounding region."}
{"text":"Pier W is a classy, unique spot great for a business lunch, romantic dinner or to celebrate a special occasion. I think this place would easily impress a date, your boss or your grandparents (maybe not at the same time). I've been here at least 20 times over the years and have always had good food and good service. The menu is not trendy (there's plenty of that elsewhere in Cleveland) - it's focused on more traditional seafood and steak dishes. What's really unique is the building is actually cantilevered out over Lake Erie so you get unobstructed views of the water and the Cleveland skyline from almost everywhere in the restaurant.  One thing to note - because of the unique architecture,  the restaurant is a flight down from the parking lot. There is an elevator but even pulling right up to the door will require everyone in your party to walk at least 30 yards to get to your table."}
{"text":"Great service.  My filet was ordered med-rare, it came overcooked, I sent it back and it came back rare.  My wife had the scallops, very good.  They took the steak off my bill.  Overall excellent will return."}
{"text":"This place will give you a perfect evening. The view is to die for. And the seafood is great. I love the oysters they offer especially. The service is good. I actually went pretty late so I understand why they were rushing my party and sometimes forgot when I made an extra order of oysters. All is forgiven because the food is amazing :)"}
{"text":"My opinion is solely about their brunch as I've never been here for dinner. This is the best brunch I've ever been to. It is a \"buffet style\" and runs about $35 per person. You couldn't get a much more gorgeous view anywhere else in Ohio. The restaurant is on a ledge overlooking the city and Lake Erie. They have a balcony that you can stand on too. When you take an elevator into the dining area you go through a fish tank and then a wine cellar. There is a pianist playing throughout the Sunday brunch. The brunch consists of everything from raw oysters to bacon and eggs and EVERYTHING in between. They have an amazing dessert bar as well. I would recommend this brunch to everyone in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Pier W is a Cleveland staple--it has been open for fifty years. It was our first time here and it was an INCREDIBLE experience.  First things first, this place is classy and beautiful inside. The atmosphere is very upscale. You have views of the lake, the cliffside, and the downtown Cleveland skyline. We were given a wonderful table. We had a booth in the middle of the lower level with lake and city views. And for it being a Monday night, the place was pretty crowded too.  We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay to drink. Our server informed us that certain wine bottles are 30% off. That was a nice surprise. I'm not sure if that is offered every day or if that is only a Monday thing.  To start, we ordered the shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, and the scallop ceviche. We really wanted to try the Oysters Rockefeller, but they were out. We were a bit taken aback by the shrimp cocktail price ($15), but when it was brought to our table we realized why: the shrimp are huge and well worth the price. The crab cakes are kind of tiny, almost bite size, but they were delicious. The same could be said for the scallop ceviche, which was served with two orange slices. A bite of both orange and scallop is a great taste combination. The appetizers here are definitely on point.  My boyfriend ordered the bouillabaisse, a French seafood stew in tomato broth. There were clams, shrimp, crab, fish, and mussels. My favorite part of this dish were the tomatoes. They were cooked to perfection and added so much flavor to the dish. My boyfriend HATES tomatoes (which I know is ironic since he ordered a dish cooked in tomato broth) and he even agreed that the tomatoes were good.  I ordered the crispy fried yellow perch. My dish was excellent. The fish was served with a rosemary and garlic potato salad and a side of vegetables. The vegetables were alright--they definitely weren't the highlight of the dish. The perch was soooo good and there was plenty of it. But you know how when you eat too much fried food it sort of starts to taste bad? Maybe I'm the only person that experiences this, but that was the problem I had with this dish. It was great that I received so much perch, but since it was all breaded and deep fried, I could have ate less of it.  We ended the meal with two delicious desserts: the strawberry lemonade mousse and the peanut butter bombe, both which were recommended to us by our server. The strawberry lemonade mousse is such a unique and genius idea. I think it was served frozen, so the mousse is more firm than usual, which I loved. It came with fresh strawberries and granola. The peanut butter bombe is peanut butter mousse with a chocolate shell. If you're a peanut butter fanatic, you have to order this.  Our sever, Shannon, was awesome. I asked her to course everything and she did a great job doing so.   The only real complaint was when we first walked in. They have some issues at the host stand and seating people and that's definitely something they need to fix because it is a bad first impression. When we walked in, there was a group at the host stand that waited several minutes to be sat while the host figured things out. As someone who used to be a host, it shouldn't take that long to seat someone. After they were sat, my boyfriend and I also waited several minutes to be sat and we had a reservation. With a reservation, we really shouldn't have waited to be seated. Every time someone needed to be sat a manager or two had to come over to help. Seemed a bit dysfunctional.   All in all, it was a great experience and I do plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing- best seafood, totally fancy. Got the seafood tower & it was so good! Amazing view & a great date place"}
{"text":"The food drinks & atmosphere are great here. My question is \" Why have a television if you do not have the Cleveland sports on?  I asked if they could put it on and no one knew the channel \""}
{"text":"A:  Water view; strategic seating to allow guests the best aesthetic vantage point during dinner.  Fresh flowers on every table.  Appropriate level of conversation noise.   Mix of couples out for date night, prom (?), special birthday/occasion.  Menu makes you think of tie and jacket - but the feel of the place eases you into thinking you can slide with khakis and top button undone dress shirt - that's a good thing.  B:  Basically what you would expect for fine dining.  Maybe 10% higher than reasonable for the taste - see \"C\" below.  C:  We decided on Pier W because of the Yelp reviews - this meal was the culmination of and reward for a long day of house hunting.  Was also a chance to settle down for the evening and feel civilized over a fine meal.  I'll cut to the chase - I felt underwhelmed.  We ordered braised short rib pierogies for apps - pork was good but making it into a pierogie - shrug.  Snootery here is from eating pierogies in upstate NY.  Entree we had Walleye and the Lobster Papardelle.  Heavy, creamy not for faint of heart or heart attack - ample amount of lobster.  Walleye was cooked well in terms of technique but flavor - shrug.  Nothing was memorable.  I admit that whatever reviews posted to elevate the popularity of this place is probably true in the eye of the reviewer and diner; I would go so far as to say maybe the high ratings are that it has become a local favorite for residents of Lakewood.  For me - I am grateful that this place provided me with a great view, professional service and a meal to discuss where I am going to live in OH.  But when I flashback to all of the other fine dining locales and flavors of my past - Pier W places 3 stars."}
{"text":"High end seafood place. One of Cleveland's fanciest options. Delicious and fresh food, Sunday brunch to die for, incredible views, and first rate wait staff. Great spot for date night or a special event or occasion. Not the most vegan and GFree friendly choice around but it's not meant to be! Incredible lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Over rated Over priced. Walk in no one is in the seats. We are over booked. Some of the menu is worth it . Most of it is over rated. Portions are small. $$$$$"}
{"text":"I've only been here for Happy Hour, but the appetizers and the martinis are excellent!  I highly recommend the calamari.  You can't beat the view the restaurant offers and the Happy Hour is a really good deal!"}
{"text":"Love the HH on Sunday. Very festive and fun. You have to get there early to get a seat and we did. It filled up fast. We had a party of ten and even though they told us we couldn't pull up an extra chair at a table of nine, they didn't hassle us when we did. That's good service! I got the lobster bisque, which was awesome. Followed by the mussels. They were great too. Decent size portions too. The bisque is just a cup, not a bowl. I also tried someones sliders, which were good and the salmon burger was the only thing that I didn't love. We took that home with us, but I wouldn't order it again. Even though we did eat it all! Beautiful scenery and the service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"went here for our 2 year wedding anniversary, and we enjoyed very much. server was fantastic, gave great advice, and very meticulous about cleaning our table, and addressing all questions. we sat by the large windows which surround this place for fantastic views of lake erie. the only reason I gave 4/5 stars was the food itself. I feel for the setting and how nice/classy this place is, the food could be taken up a notch. It was great, don't get me wrong, but nothing fantastic. I ordered the pre fixed lunch dishes, which was an amazing value, and my wife had the trout. Both were great, and prices very fair. I think the dishes could use a bit more attractiveness and taste to them though."}
{"text":"WOW is all that I can say. This place has an awesome Sunday Brunch and an amazing view. You'd think you are truly at the \"coast\" when you dine here. The seafood selection was extensive and always full. I live on a coastal town but the seafood here was so fresh I almost thought I was home. The view was amazing, just like you were at the ocean. The price was fairly reasonable for what you got. I kept going back for more and more, don't think I had to eat for at least 24 hours afterwards. Definitely on my list to revisit when I get back that way."}
{"text":"Always an amazing meal and time here. We love when we can partake in the happy hour. What a deal and great time, food is great and reasonably priced, service although slow at times is friendly and helpful, and why rush through such an experience here! And the Sunday brunch is over the top! What a treat. A combination of brunch delights and seafood galore. A bit pricey but worth the treat every now and than!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places until I took a friend, who was visiting from Chicago,  there for dinner last week.    Of the five of us, three ordered Salmon, and all three were overdone.  It was 6:00, the place wasn't very crowded.   First time ever the salmon wasn't perfectly done.  I asked for just a side salad with mine, the server had to \"check with the chef first\".   My overcooked salmon arrived on a very small plate on top of a limp salad swimming in dressing that looked as if it had been prepared much earlier in the day."}
{"text":"By far the best happy hour in Cleveland. There calamari is delicous, I always start with that. The view and atmosphere is excellent, and service is always awesome. Only negative is the limited seating at the bar for happy hour, but you could usually find a table somewhat quick."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Pier W is a great special-occasion restaurant with a killer view. What they don't know is that there's a good, reasonably-priced lunch menu daily, and the best kept secret, the amazing bar menu. Even better is the happy hour, with half-price drinks and bar menu items. I eat here often without blowing the budget."}
{"text":"The food was very well priced. Service was amazing, food came very quickly. If it's your anniversary you get complimentary champagne and the most amazing bread pudding I have ever had! This bread pudding is so good it made me like bread pudding and I have tried all kinds of different variations of it and hated them all. It has a slight coffee taste but oh my word! I will be back specifically for the bread pudding and I even emailed the restaurant asking for the recipe! I also recommend the filet and colossal shrimp appetizer. Very good experience!  Amazing views and ambiance! Pianist is amazing and even plays Disney movie songs like The Little Mermaid- A part of that world, which I jammed to! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate an anniversary. The ambiance was amazing, and the staff was super nice. I had the crab stuffed shrimp, and it was delicious. We decided against dessert, but were still presented with two cookies and a Happy Anniversary chocolate, which was very thoughtful! Thanks Pier W!"}
{"text":"An upscale restaurant with great service. We had the perfect seat by the window and the view was great! The service and food quality are woth the price. Very good place for special occasions or maybe just want to treat yourself with good seafood and desserts. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary and was very impressed with the entire menu...food and wine. Great selections. Very fresh and great combination of flavors in their dishes. Service is very good as well as ambiance. Great as a treat for that special person in your life."}
{"text":"We just did Easter brunch at Pier W and I can confidently say we will never go anywhere else in the future. It was incredible! We had 8 ppl-Brunch was $40/person and quite honestly, I would've payed whatever they asked me to pay--it was absolutely phenomenal. Juices and coffee, along with a complimentary mimosa, were all included. The food was INCREDIBLE. I've never had food made in 'bulk' (on a buffet line) that was that superb. Everything from standard breakfast items to oysters to eggs Benedict, prime rib to sushi to custom made omelettes. It had a huge desert selection and the service was wonderful. My favorite touch was the pianist who played old classics to Disney songs to the Bunny Hop. And yes, the Easter bunny was there too. So offen at nice places you have great good, but your 'nickeled and dimed.' Or you get a good deal but the service is awful and rude. None of these things happened during our brunch. It truly made for a perfect Easter and we were so so so beyond impressed. Thank you Pier W for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Can I just mention AGAIN how fantastic the happy hour is? They just added a fresh salmon BLT to the bar menu that is g-o-o-o-d. And a delish calzone with a side salad of field greens. It's a super-duper bargain and very schmancy. The happy hour menu has been adjusted slightly (I'm writing this update in late May 2009); the crab cakes are gone, they've added another pizza and a lip-smacking short rib pierogie dish with veal reduction."}
{"text":"All you can eat brunch.  At a seafood restaurant.  With an amazing view.  What more do you want? Excellent service, delicious food, beautiful ambiance."}
{"text":"Fantastic and romantic. Great views of the city. If it wasn't so expensive I'd eat there more often."}
{"text":"It would be impossible to love this place more. I have only been there a handful of times to sit in the bar during the happy hour - but the happy hour itself is amazing as far as value and how good the food and drinks are and the setting is awesome. Love the atmosphere, love the food, only wish I could go more often! I LOVE it."}
{"text":"Had not been to Pier W since they redecorated.   Went last week.  New decor nice. View awesome. Was not impressed by the food. I had the shrimp stuffed with crab.  It was ok. Other guest had the walleye tempera.  Way too much tempera and hardly any fish--plus too hard to eat--too crispy and big, big, big. I will try again because the location is great."}
{"text":"What they are saying is true. This place has an breathtaking view, even if it is just Lake Eerie. The servers are polite, concise and have a personality. Probably the best service I have had in quite some time. A little on the pricey side, but the food, view and service make it worth every penny."}
{"text":"Wow= So underwhelming. Thank God for the view.  Seafood was not fresh & overpriced.  When quality issues were brought to servers attention nothing was done. When the manager was called they were in the same boat- defend the kitchen, the customer doesn't know good food. We will never be back & do not recommend  you go unless you only want drinks & a view. Wish I could have a redo & make this night go away."}
{"text":"Went to Pier W for the first time since moving to C-town more than 30 years ago. My favorite restaurant has always been Giovanni's on Chagrin, but I will have to say Pier W does give it a run for its money, partly because of the much-better view.   I've read that Pier W used to be much better in the past, but I thought it was very good. Went with my wife for our anniversary and really liked it. Started off in the lounge during happy hour, which was nice because drinks and apps are half price. The apps were very good, we tried the lobster bisque, tempura shrimp, fried calamari, ceasar salad, and another order of tempura shrimp. The salad was pretty average, but all the other apps were delicious, and we thought, a good value for the half price.   Continued with dinner in the dining room with a nice view of downtown Cleveland. My wife thought her blackened swordfish on pruple Mayan mashed potratoes was absolutely delicious, and my South American Cobia with grilled new potatoes was also extremely good. Only problem was we were pretty full from all the apps. Nonetheless, both fish entrees were just as delicious the next day warmed up in the oven.   Very good food, nice ambiance with live piano music, overall an excellent experience. Will be back again for a special dinner, or maybe the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice romantic dinner with my boyfriend! The atmosphere was really nice and we had a great view! Service was excellent! I ordered the red snapper with lobster something if cant remember exactly what it was called but it wasent that flavorful so I was kinda disappointed. My boyfriend really enjoyed his food and when I tasted his fish I was instantly jealous that his was better then mine lol! Overall it was a great time. Our bill was about 85.00 so it's exspensive but not to bad. We  had an appetizer as well"}
{"text":"I have been to Pier W a number of times and have enjoyed exquisite meals, appetizers and breathtaking views of our Lake Erie. The last time I was there I was treated so poorly by the one they call \"Amy\" I completely walked out. She was disheveled and down right crass to me and my boyfriend. I will not be returning anytime soon. Shame on the management for putting such a two faced person in a position to be the first face you see. As we were walking up the steps, I glanced back at the blond haired shiksa and she had an evil mug on her face as she rolled her eyes. We will miss Pier W."}
{"text":"This place is just... Special.  The view is amazing (especially in the winter), as is the food.  I've never had a bad experience.  Ever.  The staff is unbelievably knowledgeable, and accommodating, always making for a fantastic experience.  The Lobster Bisque is what made me fall in love with this place my first time here.  They actually have HUNKS of lobster in it.  You don't usually find this at other restaurants.  This soup is dreamy, folks.    They always have a nice selection of oysters, and a delicious mignonette.  If you're visiting Cleveland, you must try Pier W."}
{"text":"This is not your parent's Pier W. Gone is the heavy wood and old ship motif. Pier W is new and sexy and my only question is, when will the rest of the city join in the fun?!  In an effort to extend the fun of a beautiful sunny day spent kayaking in Lake Erie I went in search of the perfect summertime dining experience, hopefully on the water.  On a Saturday night we walked into the restaurant through the lounge and were pleasantly surprised by the newly remodeled space. Cool tones of gray marble, stainless steel, and white fabric were off set by the Tiffany blue light  which glowed on the demi-lune bar. Dining room seating affords a view of Lake Erie from every table and creates the illusion that you are actually floating on the water.  The lounge feels modern and sophisticated and promises a unique experience. The sound of jazz piano and bass fill the room while gracious staff make you feel like this is your hometown bar. It just looks so good.  While pricey it is a fantastic value. Live Jazz and great food in a beautiful elegant setting is my idea of a good time. We started off  in the dining room with oysters on the half shell and chased them with ice cold vodka shots. Amazing!  We then ordered more appetizers, calamari frite; maybe the best in town, delicate and crisp served with a spicy  tamarind dip and a gremolta sweet  sauce. Halibut tacos and smoked salmon  and Ahi tuna  tar tare followed. By that time we were ready for more \"oyster shooters\", as we were calling them by now, and our entree.  We decided to split the Wild King Salmon which was the most flavorful moist delight on a bed of braised spinach and hearth roasted fingerling potatoes. Chardonnay for me and beer for my friend both complimented our meal. and  It was time to retire to the lounge for more \"oyster shooters!\"   Mr. Dewey Jeffries was at the piano and the lounge was lively with the jazzy rich music you might expect to find in a New York night club.  The following week we went back and made it strictly a bar night. More calamari frite $10, and the best Kobe beef burger with fries $12.50,  and a couple of beers, and more magic for half the price of our first night but just as fun.   If you can't afford the full dining experience I still highly recommend that you try the lounge, order from the bar menu and treat yourself to a truly special experience that will make you believe in Cleveland all over again."}
{"text":"Amazing. I didn't even get exactly what i wanted..and every bite was amazing. I will definately go back as much as possible."}
{"text":"What an amazing view this restaurant has. Don't forget to walk out on the deck and see downtown Cleveland. Overall a great experience. Happy hour in the bar had good food options but food was just OK. Server was not very knowledgeable about drinks or food information but had a great personality. We will give it another try."}
{"text":"Both times I've eaten here have been great. The food is impeccable - my mouth waters when ever I think about it. The service is great.  And the atmosphere is very upscale ( although on the Valentine's Day we went, they were playing Xmas music, but we found that to be hilarious, so no points against them.)  Go for the seafood AND for the steak. Both will leave you dreaming about it afterwards.  I would only skip the dessert. I am a basic dessert kind of person and their selections were a bit too adventurous for me."}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour with some friends from work and it was not a good experience. First off it is a beautiful day so why can't we sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view?  Second the seating is first come first serve and the manager is really rude about it as you can't save seats. You get packed into the bar area like sardines. We had one drink which was good. Our waitress was really nice but I am disappointed with their rules and lack of outside seating. It was my first time here but it did not make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner tonight with my lovely family. Start to finish absolutely awesome experience! The staff is great! We will be back."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Get seafood if you go.  A little dark, need to turn the lights up a little."}
{"text":"In summary, you are paying for the atmosphere.  I'll start by saying that I have only eaten items from their bar menu (sandwiches and burgers, salads, heavy appetizers), so the full restaurant experience may be different.  That being said, my bar menu experience has not been strong enough to convince me to eating in the main restaurant is worth the expense.  Pier W reminds me a lot of those older restaurants in New York that were THE place to be 40 years ago, but haven't kept up with the times and slowly became outdated.  They still have their following of loyal clientele, but when it comes down to it, there are other better options out  there - especially considering the prices.  The positives: - The interior of the restaurant is cozy, and if you are seated in the main dining room, you have a very nice view of Lake Erie.  Great atmosphere for a romantic dinner - The service is what you would expect at a fine dining establishment.  The servers anticipate your needs, the staff goes out of its way to acknowledge the regulars, and the bartenders know their craft. - Their Happy Hour is decent in terms of some wines by the glass and some cocktails  The negatives: -The Menu is outdated  - execution of the menu items is inconsistent - based on the quality of the food, the menu is overpriced.The Happy Hour Menu prices are really what the regular prices should be.  If I had paid the full price for the items that I ate, I would have been unhappy.  And something that may or may not matter to you:  Though the bar is packed during happy hour, the clientele may not be what you expect.  Two thirds of the customers were aged 50+, and I'd guess that one third was 60+.  (There were two ladies there who were at least upper 70s, eating their Happy Hour discount hamburger and taking half home for later - quite honestly, good for them!).  There was only one couple in their 20's, and the rest of the 30 and under crowd was with groups from the office or parents.  The age of the customers makes no difference to me - this is just a heads up to those who are expecting a happenin' scene.  Just a few of the kitchen execution issues I have experiences: - Angus Sliders - buns were way over-toasted - I had to scrape the black off with a knife  - Tempura Blue Cod Sandwich - A few people around me had ordered the tempura shrimp, and it looked good.   But when I received the Sandwich, it didn't appear to have been battered.  The cod was greasy, and the Texas Toast Bun has also heavily buttered.  When you add these elements to condiments such as aioli, cole slaw (in mayonnaise), and potato chips, you have a very heavy meal.  - Pork Wings - The are just the ends of pork ribs that have been deep fried.  A few of my wings had been deep fried to the point where the edges had carbonized (I initially thought I had bit into a bone shard).  And the sauce was nothing special at all - just the Thai Sweet Chili sauce that is available at any grocery store with a little soy sauce mixed in.   Again, I expect more from a place that touts itself as fine dining.  Given my previous experiences, I doubt that I'll go again.  I live in Lakewood, and places like Deagan's and Forage offer better food, better execution, and better prices."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - right on the lake overlooking Cleveland city.  Service was cordial, but not overly friendly.  They mostly left us alone while we ate our meal, which was nice.  Food was out promptly, but wasn't the best fish I ever had."}
{"text":"Good brunch, as usual We were accommodated despite the very short notice and Sunday's crowd."}
{"text":"seafood cooked to perfection, solid great food, plus a slanted floor to enhance the view,good wine selections"}
{"text":"Expensive but they meet the 5 star rating for its location and service. Request for a window table during reservation for a good experience."}
{"text":"Attended a celebration dinner here and it was fantastic from the minute we walked in. Music was wafting through the bar and restaurant and the pianist took requests. The bar flowed nicely into the dining room with great views of the lake.  The food was exquisite.  Salads crisp and fresh, soup savory and hot, appetizers were wonderful and the entrees wonderful.  Selections were salmon, trout, tuna, lobster, and NY steak with perfectly cooked vegetables.  This restaurant is on par with fine dining restaurants in SF or NY. A completely magnificent dining experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING restaurant!  I absolutely love eating here!  You should definitely give this restaurant a try if it's in your budget (but if it's not, visit during Happy Hour). It's great for special occasions. I came here with a very large party before and they were able to accommodate us by letting us dine in the private dining area.  The owner even came to greet us.  He was a very kind, warm man who seemed to be just a pleasant person overall.    Happy hour here is awesome - cheap food and drinks, but the bar seems to be always crowded!  If the bar is completely filled, you'll still be able to enjoy happy hour at one of their dining tables/booths.  ATMOSPHERE  - Beautiful, classy, and modern decor - Lively and fun (mostly in the bar area), but can be intimate and romantic - Private dining area available for large parties - GORGEOUS cliff-side view of Lake Erie and Cleveland's downtown skyline  - Fancy aquarium (Photo included) with elevator system - Clean restaurant and restrooms - fresh-cut, live flower adorned on every table  FOOD:  The Lobster Bisque (Photo included) The lobster bisque here is to die for!!! I can't get enough of it! The creamy texture is just perfect and it was presented in a lovely manner. I recommend dipping the free bread that they usually provide in this lobster bisque. (During Happy Hour, the lobster bisque is only $4.75!).  Pier W's Famous Bouillabaisse The stew/sauce was kinda mushy, but the taste is good/okay. Portions are very good, but the dish is still pricey.  The fish, mussels, and clams were delectable and cooked perfectly.   SERVICE:  On every visit, the service here was always impeccable. For a fancy, high-end restaurant like Pier W, high quality service is to be expected, and they definitely know how to please.  They seem to go the extra mile when trying to satisfy customers and they're very knowledgeable about their menu items/special   Try the lobster bisque, seriously. O_O"}
{"text":"We came here for a special dinner and the food was good and the service was great. The atmosphere here is super friendly. My boyfriend had ordered flowers for the night and they were especially helpful in that regards. We didn't sit by the windows, we sat somewhere near the center but the windows were big enough were it felt like you were getting a great view no matter where you were sitting. The lobster bisque was delish! Would recommend to anyone who wants to make a special date night at a fancy place with friendly faces!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to celebrate special occasions! The short ribs never disappoint, the lobster bisque is amazing! Emery is always professional and a knowledgeable server. John is an extremely skilled bartender too! Overall, an impressive visit, yet again."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Pier W is one of the best restaurants that you will find in the Cleveland area. Just a few miles outside of downtown, Pier W provides some of the best lake AND city views that you can find.  Outside of the having some of the best, fresh seafood in the area, Pier W offers much more. The outdoor patio also provides an opportunity for beautiful pictures, capturing the lake, landscape and city all in one.   Pier W's elegance can be felt throughout the day, whether it is for a happy hour, or a higher-end dinner. Having tried almost every item on the happy hour menu, the calamari and sliders are among my top choices. Transitioning to the dinner side, the Crusted Trout has been an absolute favorite of mine. What truly keeps me coming back is not only the delicious options and views, but also the service. Their caring and knowledgeable staff is always prepared and helpful in any situation.  When coming here for dinner, be prepared to spend a pretty penny, especially if you are planning drinks as well. However, for someone looking to experience Pier W in a more casual or less-costly setting, be sure to check out the happy hour opportunities. An absolute staple in the Cleveland restaurants scene, this site is one that everyone should experience at least once when in the area."}
{"text":"Pier W exceeded all expectations, which were already quite high. It was easy to make a reservation and the quality of service was outstanding. The decor is modern and offers an intimate, exclusive feel. The most beautiful sight of course was the view of the Cleveland city skyline at night. It's a view worth paying for. The food was also outstanding. There was a group of four of us and we weren't shy about ordering many plates of food. We began with a trio of oyster variations which were fresh and a great start to the evening. We also had the calamari which was delicious. I had the simply prepared salmon with potatoes and vegetable. It was fantastic and prepared at a perfect medium. The pomegranate martini was an excellent choice with a good balance of sweetness. We surely enjoyed our evening and will most definitely return."}
{"text":"One year later, this restaurant on the water still rocks.  Fresh chilled oysters.  Super filet with a wonderful twice cooked potato over sauteed escarole and mushrooms.  Excellent and friendly service to boot.  Beautiful, yet relaxed atmosphere.  Diverse crowd.  Can't say enough."}
{"text":"Hmm, called to make reservation, told nothing available until 9pm....no one here....hmm 1 hr later, still PLENTY of seating available. Looks like you lose Pier W. ...short ribs were tasty, service just ok..... Step it up Pier W!!"}
{"text":"The view of downtown is always a delight. The staff is helpful and informative. Celebrating the 32nd anniversary of our first date. We had some wine, and shared a delicious meal of seafood, I want to say it was the grouper, it was good. Would love to go back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner last year (yeah, it's taken me that long to get a review up...). I was hoping to get sat by the water and thankfully we did! If you're lucky enough to get a table by the water (apparently it's done on a first-come, first-serve basis), you'll enjoy a beautiful view of Lake Erie. It was very romantic.  For fancy dinners, we go all out. We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our waitress, and it was delicious. We also ordered bruschetta as an appetizer, and it was perfect - the bread was crisp but not so crisp you'd break a tooth. The tomatoes were perfectly seasoned. We also ordered salads, which were crisp...I can't stand wilted lettuce!  As an entree, I selected the \"Simply Prepared\" grilled salmon...and it was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and came on a cedar plank that really accentuated the flavor. The braised spinach and potatoes were done to perfection. My husband ordered some lobster dish, which he declared was fabulous and I think I caught him trying to lick the bowl. I was very impressed with the quality of the seafood as Cleveland isn't exactly near the ocean.  Our server was very attentive without being intrusive, which I always appreciate.   Definitely recommend this gem! We'll certainly go there again."}
{"text":"Wonderful special occasion restaurant. Seafood selection is unparalleled and the wait staff are superb. The view of the lake and downtown add to the classy atmosphere of Pier W. Also great for happy hour, with a nice bar area and patrons."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their Sunday brunch I highly recommend it! The food was superb along with the service and who could forget the view? They have everything for brunch you could imagine: seafood, prime rib, eggs benedict, dessert table, french toast, pancakes, cook to order omelettes and much more. It may seem pricey but you get a lot of good food for the money along with multiple trips to the buffet woohoo! They also have a piano player which is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"i've been to pier w on several occasions, and they were just that - days that were occasions and we wanted to step up our dining game.  i wasn't as impressed with dinner.  i went there for a birthday once.  they have this table where apparently a lot of people in clevo sit when they get engaged.  avoid this table.  then again, it might not be there anymore, since they remodeled.  i didn't check the last time i went in.  but what i *will* yelp is their fancy pants brunch.  holy candy craps, their brunch is the stuff that dreams are made of.  yeah, you're paying more than if you went to lucky's for their amazing brunch, but this brunch is HUUUUUUGE.  and it's not the type where you order one item on the menu and they serve it.  it's the get up and grab what you want fancy pants buffet style.  they offer everything.  omelette's made right there in front of you, pancakes, waffles, fish, steak, everything.  GOOOOD.  it's the type of place you take mom for mother's day.  or you take your friends for that \"hey let's get together and feel bougie\" brunch.  or just to treat yourself.  but definitely check out this brunch.  i'm pretty sure it's my favorite in all of cleveland."}
{"text":"Just had a lunch set here for the first time. Food was really good. My girlfriend had a lunch serving of the bouillabaisse and it was just the right amount.  I had the burger which was a good size and cooked well.   Atmosphere was welcoming and made me feel like I was dining on a big boat with the nice view. This place is definitely one of the top restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everytime I have a visit from out of town I take them here and they are always impressed with it. I have probably had everything on their Happy Hour menu. They are pretty consistent, service varies a little bit, specially on Sundays but not enough to stop me from going back. We always take pictures with the downtown view from their terrace and the interior decoration (everything simulates a cruise) is beautiful.  Cocktails are great, the only bad one is the mojito... but I just tell people not to order it. Do not order the cod fish tacos either, it is the only item not on happy hour and I am not sure why, they are not good.  Lobster bisket is usually a favorite, the fried fish sandwich and the rib pierogis are my favorite items on the HH menu."}
{"text":"Absolute BEST happy Hour in the city. Pretty views of the lake and many selections of wine/cocktails for $6. Lots of half price discounts on food and 20%off all other drinks. Gotta get there early though, fills up fast and they won't let you in if there aren't any seats.   Never had dinner here but they also have an incredible brunch. $40 all you can eat with a mimosa. High end options like bouillabaisse, bagel and lox, grilled and broiled fishes plus all the standard breakfast favorites. Eggs, bacon, Benedict, fresh waffles. Not to mention the wonderful desserts!  So fantastic :)."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour last week, and I think it may be in my top 3 Happy Hours ever. It was so great - the drinks were delicious, the service was great (Happy Hour is in the bar only) and the appetizers on special were delicious. It has an amazing view of the city, and it was just all around a great time. Happy hour lasts from 4-7 so make sure to get there early to snag a seat because it fills up fast.   I had the short rib pierogies, and I think I died and went to heaven with them. They basically melted in my mouth, they were so good. I also had the mini sliders, which I only ate one of because I was so full from the pierogies. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a first class restaurant. The service was exceptional and the view was wonderful, but the best part was the food. The Mahi Mahi was delicious. I'd highly recommend Pier W."}
{"text":"Salmon BLT was quite good and the service at the bar was excellent.  Seems like it would be a good place for a nice date night, especially if you can score a table by the outside walls with a view of the lake."}
{"text":"This review is based off of their Happy Hour!  I think this is one of the best Happy Hours in Cleveland! It has one of the best views of Cleveland and the prices of their food and drink items is a steal! If their regular menu is not in your budget make sure you check them out during happy hour that lasts until 7pm!   My food favorites are the Short Rib Pierogies, Mussels and the Faltbread. Glasses of wine and Martinis for $6? Yes please! It is easy to stay here the entire happy hour time!  Note: Thursdays and Fridays fill up quick and you can only get happy hour in the bar area."}
{"text":"Lived up to it's reputation.  As good as it gets.  Came in for my wedding anniversary with my 2 daughters.  When I made the reservation, I had an option to select Anniversary as a special occassion.  The menu's we received said Happy Anniversary on the very top.  Nice touch!  Started off with bloody mary's all the way around except for Jess, who got a glass of Riesling.  The bloodies were very good!  Then ordered a shrimp cocktail.  Came out with 5 large shrimp and some cocktail sauce that was only a bit spicier than ketchup.  I asked for some horseradish on the side, which I mixed in and WHOA!  That's a spicy cocktail sauce (Harry & Izzyesqu).  For dinner, my wife had the crab stuffed shrimp and found it to be very good.  Jess had the Amish chicken and loved it.  Bridge ordered a filet which, though medium well done, could still be cut with a fork.  The steak was very good.  I got the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna.  6 very large pieces of seared Tuna that restored my faith in Tuna.  The last few times I had Tuna at other establishments, it was bland.  No flavor.  This one, however, was outstanding.  Accompanied by a wasabi drizzle, 2 spring rolls and some colorful veggies, it was just fantastic.  They brought us a courtesy red velvet cupcake with a white chocolate Happy Anniversary medallion on top.  It was divine!  We then proceeded to get sorbet, peanut butter bomb, a smore, and a itty bitty piece of Wisconsin cheddar cheese.  Everything was top notch.  Service was outstanding, too.  Amos took care of our table and was on top of everything all night.  Views of the city and Lake Erie are beautiful, and I would not hesitate to come back again."}
{"text":"5 stars for EVERYTHING here.   My male companion took me here immediately after proposing and, though the whole evening ended up a blur of excitement, I can say that this is a fantastic establishment that everyone in Cleveland needs to experience. We were happily greeted at the door and given two options for seating. One was a small \"view\" seat and the other was in the middle of the dining room with a view of nothing but the other diners. Of course, we had to have the legendary view here if the option was given to us and it was, so we went for it.   The atmosphere was perfect. It's perhaps the most romantic venue in the city, with the perfect view of Cleveland's skyline and intimate seating to provide for a incredibly memorable experience. (Though I may seem biased here...) The food was perfect and delicious as well. Our server was nice, polite and able to work with our dietary specifications and everything turned out as well as it possibly could have been. I even tried oysters for the first time here and they were delicious. I knew that if I tried them anywhere, this was probably the place to do it and I was right!   My fiance had the scallops and I had the walleye. Both were very tasty dishes and we could find nothing wrong with them. The breads and oysters that we had to begin our meal were also mouth watering and delectable.   This is essentially the best special occasion location for Cleveland lovers, since you'll get the view and not only a meal, but an entire experience here."}
{"text":"FOOD: I thought the food was average and would not have paid that much had it been another location. The lobster bisque and the bouillabaisse was good. But I was very disappointed by the Hawaii tuna that was neither fresh nor well cooked. The tuna had a strange grey center instead of the lovely red, it didn't have the miso taste, and the egg roll was very soggy instead of crispy.   ATMOSPHERE: You are really paying for the nice environment and the awesome view of the lake. The service was great and I love the live piano player playing some oldies songs.   Overall, it is a great place for a date with a unbeatable view and dining experience but don't except exceptional food for the price you are paying."}
{"text":"I no longer live in Ohio, but every time I fly in this is one of the spots I must hit.  I have always had dinner here and wasn't sure how lunch would be, but because I flew in early on Friday, lunch was the only time I could make it work and my lunch experience was as superb as my dinner experiences.  The view is spectacular.  The ambiance is classy without being stuffy. The seafood is delicious and simple rather than disguising flavor with heavy sauces or breading the fish.  I highly recommend the clam chowder and the walleye.  And I recommend spending an afternoon here to enjoy the view of downtown while eating and then relaxing on the patio while watching boats go by after the meal."}
{"text":"My favorite fine dining restaurant hands down.  There are many great restaurants in Cleveland but Pier W is a classic and its reputation for excellence remains.  As with all restaurants, check out the menu and pricing online first to see if it is within your budget and price range."}
{"text":"A group of folks from our board of directors met (in a small private room) for a recent dinner gathering.  The spaces at Pier W are beautiful and if you are lucky enough to get seated at the far-end dining room you'll have gorgeous views of downtown Cleveland right out the large pane-glass windows.  Since we were conducting an actual board meeting, we did not drink and only had soups / salads and entrees.  I ordered a salad to start, then a fish dish as my main meal.  The chopped salad was a nice beginning, topped with avocado, bacon crumbles, beans and I really enjoyed the herb Parmesan dressing.  The blackened grouper I ordered was moist and served with a delicious, creamy avocado puree...but the black bean blinis were dry and luke warm (at best).  Maybe due to the larger sized group we had, the dishes were not brought out at the peak of readiness; who knows.  Being from South Florida it is hard to judge seafood in the Midwest, but it seems Pier W does its best to try and present the freshest seafoods they can.  But for me personally, it left a little to be desired given all the hype it gets.  Still good, however."}
{"text":"Rude staff. And manager was a rude as well. Will never go back. Over priced for food you can get at the Cheesecake Factory for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"I live next door to PierW and I love this place! They have an AMAZING Sunday brunch- call early to get a reservation because it books up fast. My favorite foods I always get at PierW are the filet, and calamari. I also always get the lobster bisque... omg it's the best I've had and so rich in flavor... desserts are always amazing and they switch it up! My husband always gets the surf and turf. The verlasso salmon is really good too! I have some pictures of some of the times i went! Hope you all enjoy it."}
{"text":"Who knew you could have a nice meal while being cantilevered out over Lake Erie with terrific views across the lake to Cleveland?  Not me, until I came here!  The views are fantastic, and the architecture is unique.  As an added bonus, the food is good!  A nice selection of fresh fish, cooked a number of ways, with tasty sides and salads.  I'm not sure this place would be a favorite of mine based on the food alone, but the quality of the dishes does not detract from the killer views, so I give it a thumbs up!  Pricey?  Yeah, a little, but every city needs a 'special' restaurant where you can drop some dough.  This one works for Cleveland.    (I'll have to come back on a really foggy day sometime and see whether it's still as good without the scenery!)  :)"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was not good. We accidentally spilled water on the table, but our waitress could care less and didn't even bother to help clean. She also forgot our drinks, and one dish until we asked her where they are. Was kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome Birthday Dinner! I love the view! Wonderful service staff!  I loved the live piano music! My food was delicious! The lobster bisque was very tasty. I really wanted to get another order of the short rib pierogies-they were great! but I would not have been able to enjoy the delicious crab stuffed shrimp entree.  Everything was seasoned well and at the perfect temperature. My dad really enjoyed the pan seared walleye, it too was very flavorful, and the farro was prepared perfectly. Mom went light with the crab cakes and salad, and was very pleased with her choices. My brother ordered the shrimp and scallop linguine, and too was happy! They topped off a great dinner by surprising me with a birthday treat, of a mini chocolate cake with a very tasty whipped topping! Great place to celebrate!! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The single best view in Cleveland!! The seafood doesn't get much better than this.  I would recommend getting a reservation very far in advance if you're going for a special occasion.  The lobster bisque and clam chowder is to die for.  The menu is packed with a ton of great innovations so you're not reserved to just lobster or the standard seafood dishes. The crab stuffed shrimp is excellent.  The dinning room gets a little noisey when it's packed for dinner time (from what you would expect from a place like this)."}
{"text":"The good. Staff is wonderful.View is great.Mary Beth is a great host. The bad. The food. My wife had the prepared frozen Lobster tail dinner not bad. But for the price where's the life lobsters? Our friends had a prepared fish. They said it was okay.It looked like controlled portions that were defrosted. Maybe so ,maybe not. The terrible... I am on a low salt/no salt diet. One reason I went there is for a chef to come up with a dish that's tasty with out salt. Yes I did call ahead of time. I love grouper live in Naples during the winter and catch several types of grouper (something like 12 different types in the gulf) So I catch and cook through the winter season. What i got was not fresh (perhaps a frozen portion?) of grouper I have ever had. Looks like it was steamed(?) not sauteed no spices ...it was ugly....same with the vegetables except for the potatoes. Price 38 dollars. They did not even try. You can create taste meals with out salt chefs.....Guess I will stay away from Pier W after decades of eating there.....Prom 1969"}
{"text":"We had our daughter's graduation dinner there and it couldn't have been more special. Everyone was so nice and really made her celebration extra nice! The food is outstanding, the drink selection was amazing and the view of Cleveland couldn't be better! I highly recommend, the service is above and beyond great."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a LOVELY dinner tonight.  Went to celebrate our anniversary.  Service was outstanding.  Teri provided a friendly, professional greeting, and wise menu tips when asked about choices.  The food was all fresh and beautifully prepared.  It's always nice to obtain both great food and great service.  Pier W delivered both tonight, for sure."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Pier W for about two years before actually eating there. In terms of the ambience, I haven't seen a better one in Cleveland. The interior design is very fresh and modern. And don't get me started on the view!!! Perfect views of Lake Erie and beautiful downtown Cleveland.   I've had better food in Cleveland. Pier W is not better than Blue Point, which still holds my title of best food in Cleveland. Nonetheless, the food is good and fresh.   Finally, get ready to spend a lot if money! Don't think you're getting out of Pier W spending any less than 100 for two people. But if you like good food, then it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience from beginning to end.   We recently moved to Lakewood and had been wanting to try Pier W. We walked in as a party of 3 Friday night at 715pm. Hostess said they did not have a table available until 830pm. As we were walking back to the parking lot my husband checked Open Table and found a 730pm reservation for 3 available at Pier W. So he booked it. We waited until 728pm then again approached the hostess and asked for our reservation. She informed us the table was not ready yet, that it would be just a few moments. I could tell she recognized us from 10 minutes before. Yet she did not offer up any explanation or apology. 10 minutes later, at 740pm we were seated.   We ordered 3 appetizers (beef pierogis, shrimp cocktail, and calamari) and they were good. Nothing special but fine. The bread is very good though.   Our 3 entrees were the \"special\" of the evening scallop carbonara, the seafood boulliabaise, and the Ohio pork.   The boulliabaise was just ok, not a lot of flavor at all, pretty bland. The carbonara was terrible. The spinach pasta was so over cooked that it was mush.  So essentially it was a $32 meal of 5 medium size bland scallops. The Ohio pork was very good.   Service overall was poor. Our waitress was nice, but she seemed distracted and overall too busy. There were long periods between when she checked back with us and just overall was not attentive.   Also, can't give tangible examples, but this restaurant has the atmosphere that they think it's a lot better than it actually is. My neighbor said this when I was telling her about our disappointing experience and I agreed with her completely. $220 dinner that was at best a C- experience. We will not go to Pier W again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was thinking ahead and ,made reservations for Valentines Day here. We had such a good time and had a wonderful romantic dinner. Started with the calamari and it was the best I ever had it was buttery with a perfect breading and melted in your mouth.  He had the fish on the cedar plank which he loved. I had the linguini. It was packed with shrimp and scallops. The service was exceptional. Our server was hilarious and there when you needed him but not overbearing. Just perfect.   When we arrived it was in the middle of a blinding snow storm so the city light were not visible. Luckily as we were finishing our drink the drifting snow subsided and we were able to take in the view.  The drinks were delicious and had adequate booze. We got desert to go which was the smores cheesecake. This was the only part I did not enjoy. It was too dense, too chocolatey, didn't taste like cheesecake just kind of a brick. I was so happy I got to come and experience what everyone was ranting and raving about. It was a perfect date and I had such a great time. I can't wait to go back and check out the happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been to Pier W a few times before and I was very pleased. However, this past visit last weekend left quite a lot to be desired.   My boyfriend and I went on Sunday for their brunch. For $38 a person, you get access to a buffet and they even give to a complimentary glass of champagne, mimosa (or in my case orange juice because I'm a non-drinker).   The food was fine. I feel like the buffet is pretty on  point every time I've been there, but it's not the food that was disappointing, it was the service.   I have never had a bad waiter/waitress before at Pier W, but this past visit that we've had anything less than exceptional service. I won't include names, but I felt as if we barely saw our wait person.  We were there at 11 in the morning so it wasn't that busy to begin with. We even had to repeatedly ask for refills on water. It took almost 15 minutes to get water refills. I used to work in food service so I try not to be a pain, but 15 minutes is a long time for just water."}
{"text":"I went here with my prom date for dinner and it was fabulous! Food was delicious and the service made me feel like a princess! I fully enjoyed my entire experience and I would love to return for another special occasion! Seeing that I am now a broke college student there is no one I'll be returning soon because it is pricey!"}
{"text":"Accommodating, but over priced.   I was at this restaurant with a local who lived in the apartment building next door. He eats there often and money isn't an option for him, so I can see why he's a fan. However, this wouldn't be a place I'd eat at on my own.  There are no easy options for vegans on this menu, but they will make you a plant-based dish of steamed vegetables (mushroom, fingerling potatoes, beets, watercress, carrots, green beans, and white rice), if you ask for a mere $18! The portions were WAY TOO SMALL for anyone who eats this diet - we were hungry 20 minutes after we left.  BUT, rest easy knowing that if you're a plan-based eater, no oil, the staff will bend over backwards to make you what you need. Remember, don't be afraid to tell people you have a special diet! More often than not, they'll find something in the kitchen to feed you."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  Has Prime Rib that was served to perfection along with Asparagus Tips in Holland Sauce!  Seating along the windows to view Lake Erie!  Expensive but worth every penny!  A unique treat that happens once in a blue moon for me.  Also has a great Sunday Brunch!  A place to go for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Holy S---!  I say G.D.!!!  Just returned from dinner at this West Side spot.  This was actually the first time I've eaten there since my childhood friend Scott's Bar Mitzvah some 18 odd years ago.  What the hell have I been waiting for???  Everything was FANTASTIC!  Oysters Rockafeller, the delightful mix of spinach and cheese with plump oysters will Rockafella more that Jay-Z ever could.  The beet salad, seemingly demure, will pop in your mouth with delicious results.    Two of the patrons at my table just returned from France where NO single bouillabaisse came close to the spectacular offering that Pier W presented.  My pan seared walleye with fingerlings and spinach was a perfect mix and expertly prepared.     Dessert? After the experience so far?  Most definitely!  The table ordered the dark chocolate s'mores, the coconut ice cream and the maple creme brulee.  Good lord in heaven.  I don't claim Jesus as my savior but if these are the rewards of paradise, consider me a convert.  These palatable offerings in addition to my perfectly-prepared dirty martini, excellent by-the-glass wine selections and generous scotch pours made the 2.5 hours we spent there pass faster than a rock star's sobriety.    The renovation of the place a couple years ago did quite well for the ambiance.  In the immortal words of David Starsky: Do it, Do it!  Absolutely worth the price."}
{"text":"I came to Pier W for dinner and the restaurant, view, and food was a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"My expectation was a 5-star experience and they delivered! The seafood was delicious and the service reflected a dining event and not a fast food in-and-out. They don't rush you but are available if you need anything. It gave us time to enjoy the gorgeous view from our corner window table (we made a 5 o'clock reservation just for that reason). The prices reflect what you receive - it should be on your special occasions list of restaurants if you live near Cleveland."}
{"text":"Where do i start. So many good things to say. Ill focus on the food. The mussels to start off were delicious and you get a mound of them. They dont skimp. For the entree I had the big eye tuna. On a scale of 1 to 10 this dish was a solid 15. If your bringing grandma out to dinner and she forgets her teeth order her the big eye tuna. Melts in your mouth! The spring rolls that accompany the tuna are a perfect compliment. My date had the diver scallops. Again...melt in your mouth. Great portion. We are both still talking about this meal 3 days later. Now...once you think it cant get any better...order the pumpkin cheesecake. I had them drizzle chocolate over it. This cheesecake will make you slap your mama. Im not kidding. Needless to say we will be back a few more times. Cant wait to hit this place up in the summer. A window table is a must if can get it. Surprised i didnt see a proposal. Its the perfect atmosphere for it. Well done to the whole staff."}
{"text":"Great place to take out-of-towners.  if you want the  downtown view, make your reservation for 8pm or later.  Nice to see downtown by day and night.  Rather than dinner, our party of 4 chose soup, salad, appetizers and dessert.  Lobster bisque is totally decadent, rich and lots of lobster meat--beware the pepper Melba rounds in the bisque--not good.  Salad was so-so.  Cheese platter varied and could be shared with one other.  Chocolate mousse rich; peanut butter mousse not overpowering with peanut flavor.  Very decent wine selection.  Service attentive.  One strange thing:  for such a high end restaurant, why don't they  crumb the tablecloth?  We resorted to using our napkins to brush crumbs to the floor rather than having them all over the table."}
{"text":"Went for lunch New Year's day. Even though it was overcast and cold, we had a window seat and the view was nice. I found the inside  to be cozy, without being overdone or tacky. We split six oysters on the 1/2 shell. I had a baby green salad and the crab stuffed shrimp. My wife had the Mahi Mahi. Everything above was great. We also had a dessert sampler which was pretty good. My wife had a glass of wine from their extensive list and I had a good beer from a local brewery, Franklin Brewery Kolsch. Service was great. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I could say our experience was good but it was only just o.k.  I expect better from this place.  Don't order the fish taco, waist of money.  $12 for a glass of wine, short pour. Come on management step it up a notch."}
{"text":"The coconut crusted Mahi Mahi and Crab stuff shrimp was awesome. The calamari was o.k. A little over cooked but seasoned well. I would ho back again.  And not to mention the view of the lake is great!"}
{"text":"This is a really neat restaurant with probably the best view of downtown that you can get in Lakewood.  Beautiful interior and very nice staff. Some of the menu items are quite pricey but some are reasonable so you don't have to splurge to go here. Also the happy hour deals at the bar are excellent! It's VERY affordable to do the happy hour and everything that I have eaten or had to drink here has been very worth the money."}
{"text":"To start off this place has an amazing view! We started with mussels which were not disappointing and the sauce/broth was so good we were dipping our bread into it to soak up more of it! I had the crab stuff shrimp it was good not great though as I had expected. My boyfriend had the tempura haddock which I though was delicious! Both of us has vegetables prepared perfect ally with the meals. Dessert here was the game changer though- mango ice cream really hit the spot but you have to get the creme brûlée"}
{"text":"The view alone at this place renders five stars! I didn't feel like I was in Cleveland with such an amazing view of the city.   Now on to the food...we started off with Calamari Fritti, which was served with a delish dip of Sriracha Aoli and Sweet Spicy Tamarind Dip followed by Cedar Planked Organic Salmon with Spinach and Potatoes for me and Pacific Rockfish with Udon Noodles for my friend. Both tasted really good, although I may get the Salmon well done next time, not in to the whole fish being juicy type.   All in all, if you're looking to impress your date or visitors from out of town, take them here and the view will definitely have them taking out their camera! Oh and if you're not looking to spend some major bucks, they have a happy hour at the bar, so turn that frown upside down and check it out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. When we booked our reservation for our anniversary we weren't expecting it to be cheap, but I wasn't super impressed with the food and it was very expensive. It just wasn't worth it. The creme brûlée was pretty delicious though.   On another note, we got seated next to a couple on what we think was their first date and it was extremely entertaining."}
{"text":"We went a couple times and it was great. We take our family when they visit from overseas, first for the good food and excellent service but also for the breathtaking view of Lake Erie and Downtown.   The brunch is just amazing!!! And we're looking forward for the next time."}
{"text":"Great view of city.  Good service.  Sometimes the menu lacks creativity.  Too standard in the industry for food.  Reach outside the box, can you?"}
{"text":"I officiated a wedding here on the patio outside today. It gave a gorgeous back drop for the ceremony. I had a salad and the chicken with creamed spinach which was delicious. The goat cheese, pecans and strawberries were perfect in the salad. The creamed spinach was a perfect compliment to the chicken. Cocktail hour had black bean burger sliders and the largest shrimp cocktail I've ever seen. It was a wonderful meal and service was attentive. I know the bride and groom were thrilled."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 19th anniversary out on the town for dinner. We had reservations for 7pm. We arrived on time. We were greeted by the hostess with a \"how can I help you\", not welcome, our how many today? As if we were uninvited guest. We got seated and our waitress     Appeared, she didn't go over the  specials or the menu. We ordered surf and turf and asked what kind of vegetables comes with the meal. The waitress told my wife. I guess I asked the same question and she did one of those \"Duh I just told your wife weren't you listening type of answers.\" If the food was not so good, I would have given them a half star!!! Great place if you get the right server!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I came here to celebrate our engagement.  The food was delicious; the service was excellent, and Pier W has the best restaurant view in Cleveland.  We have since come back to celebrate many other holidays and events, and I would give them 4-5 stars each time.  They have many great seafood dishes, but whenever I crave oysters, this is the place I come to in Cleveland.  The seats with the best views definitely need reservations FYI.  The bread came to us slightly burnt, but the entrees made up for it.  I had their seafood bouillabaisse and my husband ordered their Hawaiian tuna. Both were delicious, as were the oysters we ordered.  The shallot sauce was tasty and sweet.  For the bouillabaisse, very fresh fish, scallops, and lobster were used with a well developed stew flavor.  I can't say it was the best I've had but it is definitely up there."}
{"text":"Put on your best shoes and prepare to be WOW'd at Pier W. One of Lakewood's premier restaurants, Pier W is nothing short of stunning. First, you walk down the stairs and are greeted by a really neat aquarium. The hostess is always friendly as well as the wait staff. Ordered the Tuna and it was prepared perfectly! Even if you're not into seafood, there are other options that will surely please you. Highly recommended for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the real reason to go here is for the views!"}
{"text":"I'm a foodie ... but a poor one.  I've never had \"fine dining\" until today!  I'm so lucky I married a foodie also.  I took my wife here for our anniversary.  It was great.  The ambiance was perfect.  the view really set the mood.  And the service was great.  For starters we had avocado tacos ... soooo delicious wife had the halibut baked ... yum i had the NZ lamb chops ... they did kinda burn this .. wasnt' really impressed (much better at Outback).  But hey, you can win it all can you.  Overall a great place to bring that special someone and a great place to show off to out of towners.  ;)"}
{"text":"Happy Hour and view are as good as it gets!  Food is delicious as is the atmosphere!  Try the Lobster Bisque :)"}
{"text":"Went here following my college graduation and had heard great things about the food here and yes, the food was terrific. However, my family and I were sat at an inconvenient, drafty location towards the front of the house that was dimly light. We did have 1 family member in a wheel chair and they did their \"best\" to accommodate, however the overall seating location really ruined the entire experience for me. The clam chowder soup and the following lobster dinner were both superb. Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable, but I was not overly \"wowed\". I would have given this place a 4 stars on food alone, however the poor atmosphere and poor seating location and so-so waiter brings this rating down. I will be looking elsewhere for future dining experiences."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and view is elegant, but overpriced for the taste.  It was a birthday dinner and off course we got the best of the best, but it wasn't the best.  The menu has a decent seafood and steak selection.  However, the meal was mediocre for taste.  The lobster was nice, but it's nothing special that I could have gotten at home or at another gourmet seafood restaurant.  The steak was just like any other grilled steak from Outback.  The meals were not exceptional good nor tasty just decent.  The desert was pretty good, especially the chocolate cake.  The bar has a decent selection of champagne, wine, liquors, and beers to choose from.  The service is quite good; the waiter was very attentive and kept the glasses full.  This place is definitely for older, wealthy people, not for young and trendsetters. I don't think I will come here again for awhile.  Expect to spend at least 200.00 for a table four."}
{"text":"Pier W had been on my bucket list for a few years, so I chose it for my 40th birthday dinner with girlfriends. Our evening was such a disappointment - the view isn't quite as breathtaking when the first person who greeted us, the hostess, is condescending.  The Saturday night piano music was lovely, my tempura battered walleye was good but not amazing (too greasy, but the tartar sauce and the soy dipping sauce were amazing). My friends grilled walleye was overdone so she sent it back. Our server agreed it looked overdone, had her transfer it to a side plate, then brought her a new meal by the time we'd finished. She still paid for her dinner but he allowed us a dessert on the house. The peaches and cream cake we chose was divine - so we ended on a high note. Overall, for a renown restaurant with these prices, I expected a better overall experience."}
{"text":"Shared our anniversary dinner with another couple this Sat. We were seated promptly upon arrival and although our table was not a window table as we had hoped(you can request but it is not guaranteed) we all had the windows in our sightline. The piano player was also a site of interest and enjoyment. The food service and cocktails were divine! Our entrees included Bouilliabase, Crab stuffed shrimp, tempura walleye and lobster paparadelle with added seared scallops, Salads of poached pear with greens and the beet and watermelon salad hit the spot. Too full to order dessert but the waitress bestowed a sweet treat in honor of our anniversaries, two silky smooth dollops of cheesecake topped with fresh whipped cream and set atop a generous drizzle of dulce de leche. Happy Anniversary was written out on a carefully positioned  rectangle of white chocolate. Nice touch. Will definitely make a point to put Pw into our favorite restaurant rotation and not just wait for a special occasion! No wonder this establishment is celebrating an impress anniversary  of their own, 50 years in business!"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed with the service here. The waitress that served us needs to learn respect and customer service. She was mumbling things about us under her breath to other waiting staff. I then went to speak with the manager regarding the experience and she proceeded to argue with me. I liked the food and the other waiter was nice, but I'll never be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, atmosphere was very good, the view impeccable and the service was top notch. The only issue was the person at the next table in jeans, a hoodie and a backwards baseball cap, left on for his entire meal. While this in no way affects anyone else in the restaurant, it is clearly stated on the door that proper attire is required. Proper attire is the expectation at a restaurant like Pier W and it should be enforced."}
{"text":"Pier W food is always delicious. My favorites were the beef short rib pierogies (3 pierogies in an order) and the S'more Baked Alaska for dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and to try something new. Danielle was very knowledgeable and attentive. Offered great red wine suggestions as a novice in this arena I appreciated her insight. And the view? Enough said.  This  place is a must if you're in Lakewood and have some time to kill. Go for the View! Stay for the food!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location. This is time and again one of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. My family has shared many great memories here including my grandparents 50th anniversary and my youngest brothers wedding. The food is always above and beyond expectations but what really ties everything together are the views of the lake and downtown Cleveland. You will be hard pressed to find anywhere in the city that can offer you views like this accompanied by excellent food and the highest level of service. Believe me the ambiance is incredible.   With all of that being said, we recently got to experience Father's Day brunch here. I can honestly say I have never experienced a brunch like this. Some of the highlights were the fresh shucked oysters, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, and mussels roasted with vegetables. They also had an array of breakfast foods, smoked seafood station, plenty of different salads, and a great take on fried chicken. Then when you think you just can't eat anymore...boom...the desserts. There was creme brûlée, canolli, cakes, cookies, so much I can't even remember it all. I'm not really a dessert person but my advice to you...grab a creme brûlée...grab two...it was to die for.   This experience was just another on the list of great times and great food our family has had at Pier W over the years and we can't wait to continue to add to it. Well done Pier W."}
{"text":"This review \"update\" is for Happy Hour.  Friday my friend and I stopped in Pier W before heading to Cinema at the Square at Playhouse Square to watch Rebel Without a Cause. (I heart James Dean).  The bar was packed.  Every seat was taken and while this was not a problem for my friend and me it obviously was for some.  We sidled up to the bar, yelled our drink order and promptly received two glorious beverages.  Soon after, we landed a spot to sit and our cocktail waitress was sweet and attentive considering the hubbub around us.  Still true to form the W offers great service and drinks (and food even though we didn't eat this time).  The W is of the best spots for a more up-scale happy hour!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have every visited!  I have had two bad experiences here.  One was for a Sunday buffet that was way over priced.  It was very crowded and the tables are very close together.  The server was friendly.  However we where offered omelets that we were not told that they are à la carte.  We also were offered orange juice à la carte and not told.  So for a party of 4 we ended up paying $160.00 for a buffet without tax and tip.  And the food was nothing special.  Second time was for a special chocolate menu that was to be a buffet also.  All where were served was a plate of so-so dipped chocolates with no explanation as to why there is no buffet which is how they advertised.  Went back the next day and they gave a full refund."}
{"text":"I visited pier one in the last few months and it far exceeded my memories. The food was very well prepared, service excellent, and the view amazing. Even on a cold winter night, it was romantic and provided the ambiance for a beautiful evening. Thanks for an impressive evening, we will be back and this time, with not so many years between visits."}
{"text":"Oh yum. So yummy. Scene: Monday night happy hour at the bar with my friend Steve, who recently celebrated a birthday.   I had the salmon burger--it was cooked just right (medium rare) and came with asparagus and red tomato slices, and had a spiced mayo-esque sauce on it. A helping of what seemed to be homemade potato chips rode shotgun--tasty when dipped in the tangy tamarind sauce that came with Steve's fried calamari. He also ordered the (New England) clam chowder. I asked for a slurp and Steve obliged. After slurping, I silently resolved to get a bowl the next time I'm at this establishment--it was perfect. Not too thick. My father would have flipped his wig. And he preferred Manhattan clam chowder.   We shared a mocha cake for dessert that came with dollop of berry sorbet and a good-sized shaving of chocolate on top.    Curtis, the gracious bartender, not only offered a recommendation on desserts for the occasion, but also brought us out a dish of three or four chocolate-covered strawberries after I mentioned it was Steve's birthday. I'll say it again: Curtis--you are a gentleman and a scholar."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious! We were started with mimosas and beignets. Coffee was hot and very good, and bonus: we never had to ask for a refill.  The brunch is all you can eat, so we grabbed our plates and headed to the food. There are tons of choices and something for everyone. From waffles and French toast, to eggs and omelettes, calzones, seafood, pastas, sushi, charcuterie, it goes on and on.  Desserts were great too - all bite sized so you can get more than one. The peanut butter cake was amazing, and my husband loved (loved!!!) the creme brûlée.  The food was great, I'm taking off one star for them having a dress code and NOT enforcing it. We dressed up but there was another patron there in board shorts, t shirt, and flip flops. Why have a dress code then?!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. Place is amazing. Such a great view of the lake and downtown. Food was great. You have to try the lobster bisque. Server was very attentive and made sure we had a great experience."}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood.  I can hear all of you. I've heard everything you can possibly say to me, from \"you don't know what you're missing\" to \"why not?!\" to \"whatever, we're too cool for you landlubbers.\" So you can read the rest of this review as an anti-pescetarian eating at a seafood restaurant.   We had originally planned to go here a week ago, but someone in the group didn't think reservations were necessary and thus ruined the evening when we had to go to another restaurant. No further comments. Make reservations on popular nights.  Anyway, onto the food. Since I don't eat seafood, I didn't poke into everyone's dishes like I usually would. We had the beef short rib pierogies because of Yelp recommendations. There were three on a plate with ample amounts of sauce. I don't think any of us particularly enjoyed it; as Asians, we love our potstickers/gyoza/dumplings, and these pierogies were shaped exactly like Asian dumplings, but with thicker skin. As I was eating it, I was almost expecting it to taste like an Asian dumpling. Instead it felt like 50% dumpling, 50% pierogi...like it didn't have an identity. (As an aside, I've had dozens of styles of pierogies before, these were just really, really different from what I've had in the past.)   I got the medallions, which came with mashed potatoes and some asparagus. The medallions were really salty! I was almost tempted to send it back, but our waiter was no where to be found, so I countered the saltiness with the mashed potatoes. The asparagus was tasty, but it was 2 thin, limp, sad-looking stalks on top of my mashed potatoes. Maybe if it was roasted or something, it'd make the dish look prettier.  For dessert, we shared the creme brulee and the cheesecake. It wasn't anything special and I wasn't impressed by either. I did leave relatively full and happy, but I am still sipping on a lot of water at home from the medallions..."}
{"text":"This place has a great view. Unfortunately due to it being dinner and night time couldn't take pics since we kept getting the reflection of other diners more than outside. Great ambience as well, live piano was a nice touch. It's their 50th anniversary so we got a free glass of sparkling wine and a free flute. The service was regular nothing out of the ordinary as was the food. My friend had the clam chowder and noted it was good and more clam than chowder. I had the bouillabaisse, it was ok. Friend had the crab stuffed shrimp, it was ok. Could you a little more flavor in everything. The cinnamon roll dessert was way too sweet and the chocolate covered bacon that came with it was just salty. The chocolate mousse dessert was great.  Overall I don't think the food was worth the price. Up in the air whether I'd ever eat there again if I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"My family took me here for a special celebration. It was a nice experience. In summary, the food was good and the staff was exceptional. The service made the experience the best part.   The food presentation and taste were good. If you are a food connoisseur, this is not an exceptional place to make a special trip. Combining the atmosphere, service and food, it was worth it.   The wine list was overall good with a great selection of Italian wine at a reasonable price. Just tell your waiter your preference and you will have a good wine. Mine was over $100 but that was because I preferred great wine.   This food review is only on what I had. I had Wellfleet oysters, beet salad, sea bass and French coffee. The oysters were fresh and too mild for my palate. Beet salad opened up your palate with the combination of sour (pickled shallot, I believed) and mildly salted beets. (Btw, there was no watercress, truffle per the menu.) The sea bass was cooked to perfection but no fish flavor. Combining with the sides delivered an pleasant mild flavor with a hint of spicy experience. Coffee was with Chambord, Frangelico. I preferred a great cup of good coffee with a hint of liqueur. This was the other way around.   The servers were attentive, and tailored to your needs. Never rushing, but sincere. Always appropriate and prompt.   I still recommend this place due to the combined experience of service and food."}
{"text":"It's pricey, but the view alone is worth it. It's quite literally ON the water. If you're lucky enough to be seated by a window, you'll feel like you're floating on the lake while you're enjoying your meal.   A group of friends and I went when they were participating in restaurant week and so we got a three course dinner for a fair price. The portions are a bit on the smaller side, but I'm not sure if that's because of the special restaurant week menu or if its their normal offering.   The food is super super delicious and the best of all is the dessert. We had a creamy cheesecake that just melted right in my mouth. I've got a soft spot for cheesecake and this is definitely one of the better ones that I've had.   I liked the simple tastes that Piew W offered. Nothing was too strong or overdone. I think the beauty of seafood is its original taste. The chef did a great job enhancing the natural tastes of the fish without overpowering it.   Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely come back again (once I save enough money)."}
{"text":"Staff is not nice. Act like they are doing you a favor taking your reservation.  I will not be back. The view is not worth the service. Time for new Mgt."}
{"text":"Pier W was spectacular. We reserved a window table and had an amazing view of the lake and Cleveland. The atmosphere was cozy, modern, yet warm. The wine bottles we ordered were pricey however the best wine I ever tasted. We tried the crab cake appetizer, delicious, the calamari, very good, and the pirogies, scrumptious! I ordered the blackened swordfish. It was so good! I could have done without the sweet potatoes (they weren't my favorite). I tried a family member's dish choice \"blackened Florida grouper\"- very good. Needless to say, the food was dynamic. The drinks were delicious. The view was spectacular and the service was too notch. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone (especially for special occassions). This occasion was a celebration for completion of a Master's program. It was memorable and I thank Pier W and it's staff for making it the best experience there!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome view, awesome service! It was my GF's birthday and they even had a menu that said \"Happy Birthday\" on it. They took care of us from beginning till the end, host/manager gave us the greatest table, server was AMAZING, and wine was reasonably priced and delicious. We will be back for happy hour, we saw that there was a $7.25 burger that looked very big!"}
{"text":"does anybody know how to spell PERFECT?  Aaah, the terrace ambiance, PERFECT; the elevator ride, PERFECT; the food, PERFECT...I am under the spell of Pier W, and yea, I can spell PERFECT even though I am under the spell..."}
{"text":"A beautiful view of Lake Erie greets the clientele that make their way to Pier W.  The view makes up for a slightly disgruntled set of servers ...  Decor is stately, and reminiscent of maritime traditions, with deep woods and large glass panes.    Still, the fare wasn't bad (3.5 stars), with the typical surf heavy selection of a place located \"on the waterfront\".  Turf was alright, but not spectacular.    My sense is that Pier W survives based on its location and panorama.  If you don't like the lakes, don't come.  If you really appreciate a view, dine in the main room, with a date..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and couldn't be happier with our visit. He got the scallops and I got the salmon. We also got their calamari and their apple creme brule. (Usually we don't eat so much when we go out, but at Pier W we wanted to try a bit of everything.) Oh. My. Gosh. It was THE best seafood I've ever had, and possibly the best MEAL I've ever had. The view is amazing as well. Try to get there around 5 or 6 (depending on the time of year) because you'll get to see the sunset as well as 2 different views (day vs. night). It definitely has 2 different ambiances between the daytime and nighttime, and I'm glad we got to experience both. Another cool thing was they had a free glass of champagne for each of us since it was their anniversary, too. We got to keep the flutes, which was a cool keepsake for both anniversaries. If you live anywhere around northeast Ohio, you definitely should get dressed up one night and go here for a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Definitely a staple for excellence. Love it here. Reservations are few and far between so you have to plan ahead but it's always worth it. Definitely need to ask for Mitch as he's the best!"}
{"text":"So disapppinted. I love visiting pier w for brunch.  Son the for his 21st birthday and he got food poisoning. Spent the rest of his day vomiting.  Talk oabout guilt!  Happy birthday son, now enjoy your day of vomiting!  Also the food was cold :(  I loved this restaurant but..."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting Pier W twice -- once for their famous Sunday brunch and once for Happy Hour.  The brunch is just fantastic!  So many choices and all of them delicious! Although it will be hard with such wonderful brunch choices, be sure to save room for dessert.  There are plenty to pick from and they are all fantastic!  The Happy Hour is an affordable way to try out Pier W.  But it does get busy!   You have to sit in the bar area to get the happy hour specials.  We arrived at 4:45 pm on a Tuesday and snagged the last four seats in the bar area.  There were people waiting for seats to open up when we left.  It is well worth getting there early to try out one of the best Happy Hours in town!  And the view is just amazing; the restaurant is cantilevered over Lake Erie and you have a great view of downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must for anyone living or visiting Cleveland . This is not only the best dining experience it has an excellent view of Cleveland shoreline.  The food is outstanding and the service is fantastic!! If you are looking for a 1st class dining experience, Pier W is your place. mfj"}
{"text":"Very good food and service and quite an awesome view! Overall a five-star experience, for sure. I had the bouillabaisse--generous with the seafood and a delicious broth. Good wine list, and some solid beer and cocktail options, as well. Really enjoyed Pier W overall."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the happy hour. Remarkably affordable. Got the upper-class experience for a tremendous price. Clam chowder ($4.25) was small but delightful. Smooth taste with succulent bits of seafood. Calamari fritti ($6.75) was quite good and the siracha aioli and sweet spicy tamarind dips it was served with were wonderful. Those sauces - they were lick-the-plate good! Moscow mules ($6 each) were delicious. Bartender couldn't have been nicer. Ambiance and view were stunning!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday brunch.  Hands down, THE BEST brunch place in all of Cleveland!! My boyfriend and I made a reservation about a month in advance (I highly recommend reserving really really far in advance as many people know about the amazingness of their brunch!). We were seated near the window and were able to enjoy the gorgeous view of the city and lake. Even if you don't intend for it to be a romantic brunch, it's hard to avoid it because of the restaurant's location! Then we set out to fill plates and plates of delicious food. There was a huge selection of cold and hot seafood dishes! I went to town on the oysters! The desserts were also delicious too!  We spent a good 2-3 hours here!   Overall, the price is definitely worth the quality of the food and service :) I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"Arrived ~6pm ish on a Sunday night, without reservation.  No worries - we were seated promptly in a beautiful glass dining room.  The view here is amazing - in the dining room, there a floor to ceiling windows looking out over Lake Erie and they also have an outdoor deck upstairs that you can enjoy pre/post dinner.  Starters: we ordered the jar of pickles and the calamari.  Pickles were okay - watermelon was a nice surprise, but pretty average.  The calamari was really, really good - light, crispy and lightly salted.  We also ordered the pistachio-crusted trout and the scallops, with a side of crab cakes.  The portions were quite large - the trout especially was two big pieces and the scallops   were quite filling, which is not something you usually see from a scallops dish.  Good flavor and very fresh.  Definitely worth a drive to the lake - that view and the freshness of the seafood is good stuff."}
{"text":"First time here and what a wonderful surprise.  We arrived very early and were seated.  I was so hungry we ordered several apps before our friends arrived.  Our waitress accommodated all of our needs.   The food was incredible and service was impeccable.  If your searching for good seafoods you'll find it here!!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I've heard about this place since I was a kid. So when my boyfriend wanted to go somewhere nice for our anniversary, I said we should go. He called and made a reservation 6 weeks in advance, asking for a table with a view of the water since it was our anniversary. They said they would make a note of it. Fast forward to when we get there. They seat us at this table in the middle of the room far from any window. We ask to move since we requested a view. Were told they could not accommodate it. So we sat down disappointed but hopeful. The only acknowledgment of our anniversary was a paper menu with \"happy anniversary\" written on it. And as if the lack of view wasn't enough to ruin the romance, we were seated surrounded by other booths adjacent to ours where we could easily hear our neighbors. And the decor left a LOT to be desired. I felt like I was eating dinner on a bad cruise ship. Didn't help that over 50% of the people there were 70 or older. You just couldn't have asked for a less romantic atmosphere.  We were hoping the food would at least wow us to make up for the atmosphere. It didn't. It wasn't terrible; but it was nothing to get excited about. I also asked for Parmesan cheese for my seafood pasta dish, and waited about 15 minutes for it, at which point I had already eaten most of it just so my boyfriend and I could get out of there quick enough to see the sunset on the lake from Edgewater-- since we couldn't see it from our table-- which was the point.  Let me save you from a night like ours-- there are SO many wonderful restaurants in Tremont, Ohio City, Downtown where they will make your romantic or celebratory evening special. Don't choose this place."}
{"text":"OHMAAAAAGAWDDDD I LOVE THIS PLACE!   Came here on a busy Saturday evening, and even with that, service was among the best I've ever had, that's saying a lot! As an appetizer, we ordered the calamari, which is again one of the best I've ever had. It had a little spice to it, and was fried to just the perfect crisp...yum!   For the entree, I can't remember the name but it was some sort of lobster infused pasta...TO DIE FOR. Flavors were bursting everywhere...oh my god! We also ordered the beet salad, which is hands down, well everything down, the BEST beet salad! It was so refreshing, especially with between the calamari and pasta. I really loved it and cannot wait to have it again.  This place has an amazing view, so try to get seated by the windows. Also in the summer, they have outdoor seating which seems gorgeous, I look forward to coming back here in the warmer weather.  Overall the experience was wonderful from start to finish, I would definitely come back again. :)"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Pier W on 12-14-16.  Once again, this place is top drawer in all regards.  Food is spectacular, ambiance is quietly understated and comfortably relaxed.  A piano player was playing the piano in the lounge area.  Service was impeccable.  I had Steak Diane which was especially toothsome.  My friend had the oyster sampler and a grilled lobster tail.  We each had chopped salads, too.  Chocolate bread and another rustic type of bread was served with whipped butter.  Yum and nods to all things Pier W.  this place is consistently wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here. The overall experience was delightful, but maybe the food was a bit underwhelming considering the price.  I want to emphasize how great the service is. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly (even though it was clear we were a bit out of our element). The rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly throughout the evening. Our menu had a nice Happy Anniversary message at the top, and they included a nice anniversary massage on our dessert.   The food was great. We ordered 2 appetizers, the seared crab cakes and shrimp tempura. Both were delicious, especially the shrimp tempura.   I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass for my entree. It was tender and well-seasoned, served over rice with toasted almonds in it. My wife ordered Crab-stuffed Gulf Shrimp.   Both of our dishes were great, but I wasn't blown away. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of (non-ethnic?) seafood. I think the emphasis is on the quality of the ingredients and freshness of the seafood. I tend to like Chinese and Indian (heavily spiced) seafood. So, as stupid as this sounds, my Sea Bass entree focused too much on the flavor of the Sea Bass itself.   I would give Pier W 5 stars, because we had a wonderful time there, but the food doesn't justify the price in my opinion. If you like seafood (and have the money) please check this place out. The service and the ambiance are awesome!"}
{"text":"The view is really nice, even from the back of restaurant (I had requested a window view on a late Tuesday night). I have read so many reviews about how the service is phenomenal. I was not really impressed. It was not terrible, but it was not great. It was our anniversary, and no one said a thing to us about it. My wife's trout was very good, but did not come with enough sauce. My tempura walleye was OK. I was disappointed in my dish. I guess I was expecting more from the other reviews. Our last anniversary meal was at Norman's in Orlando where we had the best service ever, so maybe it's it a tough act to follow."}
{"text":"Do you want to impress someone? Are you 30 or older? Do you like a beautiful vista? Do you like seafood that is delicious, yet sometimes pretentious? Don't apply to any of those things, but still like a food centric happy hour? Then this is the place for you. I really think Pier W is that perfect westside date place. But maybe the 3rd or 4th date. You better really like the person to share something so nice."}
{"text":"Best dining experience I have had yet! Ambiance of the place is wonderful, staff are very friendly, beautiful view of downtown and my husband said the food is almost as good as.....well you get the idea. LOL! This was a perfect place for our anniversary.  We could not have chosen a better place than Pier W."}
{"text":"I want to say this is really a 3.5 star review but could not get it to do that! To start, I was pretty excited to come here. We have Been talking about it for over a year! First I'll say we were promptly seated, even though we were 10 min late for our reservation, though not as close to the window as I wanted, we could still see everything. We waited a few minutes before a server arrived (no biggie). She was very pleasant and took our drink and app order. Everyone said get the lobster bisque, and since I am such a huge fan of the stuff, of course I listened! The presentation was very cool, however so was the soup.... Dinner was blackened grouper which I think was a good choice.  However My boyfriend got the short ribs which were better than the grouper. The standouts though were the drinks and the amazing Cheesecake. The Grand Marnier sauce was delicious!!  I would go again for drinks and dessert but maybe nothing else. Also had to ask multiple times for water even though there were at least 5 people walking around bussing, dropping food, filling water, etc. Overall, definitely worth trying but don't set your hopes too high."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful birthday dinner last night with Mike, Stephani and Richard and from drinks to dessert I was not disappointed . The lobster bisque was excellent as was. The crab stuffed shrimp. Server could been just a bit more personable ."}
{"text":"STILL OUTSTANDING  My wife & I had a very nice lunch here on a 92 degree day in September! We each had a pleasant glass of wine and started by sharing the Seared Crab Cakes appetizer. They were quite nice. We followed with the Cod & Linguini Special and the Pier W Club Sandwich The former was good, but the club sandwich was rather pedestrian with way too much deli sliced turkey and limp French fries.   We love this place and plan to return.  Location - 5 Stars Ambiance/Decor - 5 Stars Food - 4 Stars Service - 4 Stars Value - 4 Stars"}
{"text":"I grew up in this restaurant. I don't live in Cleveland anymore, but I came through town and stopped in for old times sake. The view is nice."}
{"text":"$9 for a draft of Christmas ale? The decor was straight out of Sex and the City and, needless to say, outdated and tacky. I ordered the pumpkin biscuit dessert and it had an overwhelming amount of cinnamon. Really it just wasn't very good, but the service was fine."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best meal I've had in Cleveland! I came for dinner with my family to celebrate my graduation. First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. There are tons of windows to enjoy the view of the lake and the city! The meal started with the free chocolate bread. It really smells like chocolate! I was glad it didn't taste like chocolate though- it was a warm fresh sourdough. For our appetizers, we got some oysters, the calamari, and the lobster bisque. My dad loved the oysters and said they were really good quality, the calamari was delicious and not greasy, and the lobster bisque was seriously on point- it wasn't too heavy and had a great lobster flavor. For our entrees, I got the surf and turf, and other dishes we ordered were the Cajun shrimp special, and truffle-crusted cod, the simply grilled salmon, the lobster scallop linguine, and the clam chowder. My surf and turf was seriously perfect. The meat was perfectly medium rare, the lobster was a nice big hearty tail, and the twice baked potatoes were amazing!! Everyone else loves their dishes as well. I had a taste of the clam chowder which was full of tasty clams, and the cod had a unique seasoning on it. To end the meal, we decided to order the pumpkin biscuit with cinnamon ice cream, and they brought out a complementary place of chocolate covered strawberries because of my graduation! Both desserts were delish!!   Obviously I really enjoyed the food, but the service was equally as good. Our server was attentive without hovering, and she anticipated everything we would need- she gave us new spoons before we received our soups, and she brought out extra dishes to put shells from our meals.   Overall, this restaurant definitely gives diners a five star experience, and I would most definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday a couple of years back and really enjoyed our time and had a fancy meal"}
{"text":"This was first time eating here and I only have superlatives to offer regarding their food. The Sunday brunch at 36 dollars per person is high but the quality and variety of food supports the higher cost. I tried to stay away from foods that you  can get  similar quality somewhere else like scrambled eggs and fried chicken and lettuce salads. I stayed with special seafood dishes and prime rib and exotic salads. I tried small amounts of many different dishes to sample the quality and flavor.  The sauces on the salmon and cod and perch were deliciGREAT and the highlights of my meal. There were lots of exotic salads that were yummy so try small amounts so you can try them all. You will find a \"fav\". You get a free Mimosa with your meal. YOU GOTTA SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! It was  tough choosing because they all looked so tempting and I really wanted to try them all but ended up choosing the decadent creme Brule which was to die for and the Chocolate cake with butter creme icing. It was outstanding and so good, I went back for seconds even though I was stuffed."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I have given five stars. Truly impressed with all that is Pier W.   We had drinks for appetizers - the martini selection is the one downfall. Smaller selection and not great flavors. Though the fresh baked bread and homemade butters were fab. Had I been in the mood for wine it would have been a bigger hit.   For dinner I got the sea scallops and they were truly the best scallops I've ever had - with Ken Stewart's a close second. The sides were good too, although I now can't recall anything but the amazingness of the scallops.   My date got the tuna and said it was also great - top 2 ever.   We opted to get the chocolate cake and it was heavenly. Moist and flavorful.   The service was top-notch. I enjoy watching servers interact with other tables to see how they are able to adapt to different groups of people. Ours could mix and mingle with all. Impressive.   I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour on a Friday night after work with some friends and never been to this place but my friend always raves about it.  The happy hour menu was great just about everything on it. I got the mussels, lobster bisque and calamari. I tried my friend's short rib perogies which was different but great. I had a vodka cucumber lemonade which was sweet and refreshing as well as a lemon drop martini. Only issue we had was finding enough seating for our party outside of that I think I will be a regular for happy hour as well as dinner."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:50pm tonight. Was told couldn't have a table without a reservation until 8:15 pm. Sat in bar. The entire restaurant is almost completely empty. Open Table says tables open at 7:45 pm. Very odd.  At almost 8:15 we've been served our food and eaten. The entire time we have seen a table for 2, a table for 4, and multiple booths sit empty the entire time. Clearly the hostess staff is playing games.   Our waitress in the bar was very good and could have served us at the tables that sat empty just a couple feet away.   Others in the bar area are making the same observations.   One group at the bar just went and asked the hostess about a table again and amazingly they are now going to be seated finally in the dining room.   Very disappointing for a restaurant we have frequented many times each year and never had this treatment."}
{"text":"This is Cleveland's crown restaurant. Great location, stunning views, courteous staff, great food and good service. We had bridal shower for my sis in law and they did outstanding job managing it. Loved the food and vibe here. Guess this will be go to place next time we visit Cleveland :)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pier W. It's been on my short list of places to try.  My friend and I had tickets to a show at Playhouse Square, looking for somewhere different to dine, prior to.  We had originally made dinner reservations, thinking that we would start with Happy Hour and then proceed to the dining room.  Needless to say, we fell in love with Happy Hour and cancelled our dinner reservation, opting to stay in the bar.  The server started us with a serving of homemade thick cut chips, which were tasty (I ordered a batch to-go, as well).  I started with the calamari, Caesar salad and a burger, along with the raspberry limeade cocktail.  The Caesar salad was tasty, nothing spectacular.  The calamari was very good, hot and fresh, with 2 side sauces for dipping, sweet chili and siracha mayo.  My friend ordered the fish sandwich, so we split our sandwiches and shared.   The burger was cooked perfectly, as ordered, medium well.  Nicely seasoned.   The fish sandwich was just ok, little bit soggy and overdressed.  All-in-all, I will return to Pier W., looking forward to trying the weekend brunch and dinner, at some point."}
{"text":"We went for Brunch last weekend for my birthday. Had window seat and loved the view. The food was fabulous. So many choices and they keep it fresh and new at 2pm as they would when they first opened the buffet up. you can go to the website to see the huge selection. My favorites were the salmon, cold shrimp, bouillibase, scrambled eggs were done \"right\" soft, moist and not dried out and overcooked. The tiramisu is the best I have tasted thus far. and I order it everywhere. Little Italy included. THe crème brule. YUMM We spent 100.00 with the tip and thought it was well worth it by the top notch food and choices.  Only drawback was the waitress (who was very nice and SUPER BUSY) was not back to fill our coffee often enough. Bigger cups or leaving the pot would have solved that. Mimosas were a nice touch too. Go, you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"I went here last month for the first time and had a wonderful dining experience with my sister.  My sister lives out of state and I wanted to take her somewhere nice during her visit to Cleveland.    Pier W has a great atmosphere and you can't beat the views of Lake Erie and Downtown.  I moved here nearly a year ago from California and I'm still amazed of the lack of lake front dining in Cleveland.    My sister has a gluten allergy and it is always a struggle trying to let the restaurant know that nothing can be thickened with flour or breaded.   Our waiter immediately understood and recommended a wonderful tuna dish.  I'm not a huge seafood fan... I love sushi, but not a huge fan of cooked fish.  I loved the tuna!    I had such a great experience last month that I am returning tonight with my fiance.  Fingers crossed that we will have an equally great experience!"}
{"text":"Old West Side standard, it continues to serve up excellent cuisine and service.  The wait staff was very attentive and we had a rock star table beside the lake.  I particularily liked the beef short rib perogies as an appetizer.  I have never had anything like it.  The shrimp cocktail was glorious--when they advertise colossal sized shrimp, they mean it."}
{"text":"We had a discriminatory and awful experience at Pier W. My friend was told by the hostess via the manager in her ear piece that if we wanted to stay and have brunch he would have to borrow a suit jacket because sleeveless shirts were not allowed. She was standing in front of us the whole time, obviously embarrassed as she was just about to show us to our seats. She said she wasn't aware of a dress policy ever being communicated before. As we were waiting we saw people multiple inside eating that were wearing shorts and sandals and women with strapless pool cover up type dresses. Meanwhile both hostesses were wearing sleeveless shirts ? There was no dress code on their website and we looked professional, clean, and were ready to spend $100+ for brunch. I don't know how the food was. The view was pretty. The service was discriminatory."}
{"text":"Rolling down the gold coast of Cleveland and entering Lakewood, stately old homes, wide streets and the impending high rise skyline pop into view. Something special seems about to be happening. Upon reaching the gold coast high rises, signs for Pier W begin to pop up. The lakeview starts to unwind before your eyes. There is a small glass structure that people walk into. Entering that small glass structure you immediately feel as if you are leaving the chaotic real world and entering shear elegance. You walk down the staircase lined with glass railings and enter a dining room surreal with the greatest view of downtown Cleveland. Does the food and the service match the view? YES!!! In a resounding fashion.   As a disclaimer, it is simply not possible to get east coast caliber seafood anywhere in the Midwest. But the seafood is as good as it gets in the Midwest. In fact, I'd equate the seafood here to be even better than Legal Seafood. Our waitress greeted us in a very friendly manner and had an impressive knowledge of the menu. In addition, she was happy to answer any questions we pleased.   The Oysters for appetizers were served in a pleasant garlicky juice and had an appealing texture. The clam chowder was tried and true. It was a bit on the potato heavy side. Where the real news was at was the lunch special. For under 20 dollars, the lunch special came with soup, an entrée and desert. The entrée was a swordfish, mahi mahi  combination. It was served with a sort of broccoli tempura and a neatly cylindrical roll of rice that was of the typical grade of rice found in Sushi. The presentation was artful. Even though the presentation of the food made the food look small, there seemed to be plenty of food.   The crème brulee was excellent and sophisticated. It was a great way to wash down an excellent and rewarding meal.   Pier W is an innovative dining experience on so many levels. While many restaurants these days serve very good to excellent food, not many restaurants can do this with top level service and a unique and breathtaking atmosphere. But Pier W does this and more!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. We had a large group dinner here. What I didn't love was the restaurant making our group select between 3 entrees, 2 apps and 2 desserts. If we are spending that much money at this restaurant, and we definitely did, let us order whatever we want. At a seafood restaurant, we want seafood options. Our menu only offered salmon.  Was not a fan.   The lobster bisque was amazing. It was creamy and perfect and delicious. Get it.   My friend and I split the filet medallions and salmon. Both were really great but I definitely had my heart set on scallops. Either way, a great dinner experience. Dessert we got the coffee creme brûlée and cheesecake. Both were very good, although we had very little room for dessert by the time we were finished!"}
{"text":"Not really good. Plain good.  Beautiful place with a great view but the food is just not at the level that their prices suggest.  I had expected much more. To start I tried the short rib pierogi and they were bland and the pierogi undercooked. For the main dish I had the snapper in lobster sauce. It was an overcooked breaded filet splashed in lobster bisque. Very disappointing.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Awesome view and good food but just a bit underwhelming. We got the bouillabaisse and the swordfish. Both were tasty but also a bit over salted. Also, the accompanying chickpeas and salad with the swordfish was fairly average. For an establishment with such a reputation we expected a bit more."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Lakewood and maybe even all of Cleveland! The view and ambiance cant be topped. It is located in the side of a cliff with an outstanding view of downtown, great for photo ops. The menu is pricey, but the food is delicious and perfect for a fancy date night or special event.  The best part about Pier W is that you can make it a fancy dinner destination or a casual event with friends due to their awesome happy hour. It is everyday. thats right EVERY DAY. including Saturdays and Sundays (Saturdays 4-6, Sundays 4:30-6) what could be better? Although the happy hour is only in the bar area (you wont get the awesome view) and is limited to the bar menu, you can still try great dishes like the fried calamari and angus sliders. Most items are $5-$7. The drink prices are also unbeatable at $6 cocktails and $5 glasses of wine. So, If you want to try pier W, but don't want the price tag, come for happy hour, but don't bring a large crew or you might not fit."}
{"text":"Two years later and STILL my absolute favorite place in Cleveland hands down! That's saying a lot. I would go here for the panoramic view of the lake/ downtown, calamari and oysters  (best in the city) alone and that's just listing the tip of the iceberg for me. My husband and I always go here for brunch on Holidays, since both of our families live out of town and we don't always feel like traveling. Pier W is just an absolute MUST for us to visit every few months."}
{"text":"A little background, I'm not from Ohio, but I went to school for 4 years in Cleveland. So I have a decent grasp on the food scene and where to and not to go.  Recently I visited friends after graduating, and I lost my wallet. After being wired some cash, i was dragged to brunch. Little did I know that it would be worth spending half of all ($45) I had to eat here.  The views, the food, the unrivaled ambiance. W-O-W. Did not know anything resembling this place was anywhere near Cleveland. Only excuse for not going here is that you're in jail or dead."}
{"text":"Best restaurant with a view.  their sunday brunch is no joke.  Plus they have a great happy hour you definitely try to hit up if ever visiting."}
{"text":"They have one of the best happy hours in the city! I went to happy hour here on  Sunday - yes happy hour on a Sunday! Not many places offer that. First off the view inside is wonderful as u are right on Lake Erie. Lake was still frozen when I went but still beautiful nonetheless. We arrived right at the start of happy hour, it wasnt very busy. Wait staff and hostess were very friendly and professional. I ordered ceaser salad and sliders - both were excellent. My sliders were so adorably cute and came with a side of chips which clearly were made in house. Chips were crisp and delicious and perfectly salted. Sliders were served at the requested temperature. Ceaser salad was also excellent as well. My friend ordered the lobster bisque and the salmon burger which she reported as PHENOMENAL! Between us two we had a few cocktails and a few glasses of wine. Overall service, food, and atmosphere is excellent! Definitely worth checking out for happy hour or any time!"}
{"text":"This one was tricky.  The food was good, but for the money, my expectations are higher.  We went to Pier W for the first time on Sunday for Brunch to celebrate my MIL's birthday.  We were seated at the table heading into the kitchen doors and all the buffet traffic, so all atmosphere was lost on us.  When making reservations they said window seats were first come first serve.  Was disappointing as there were much better 4 top tables open when we arrived, but they said those were not an option.  Our server was spotty and we found ourselves trying to track her down to get drinks refilled, etc.  Like I said, the food was okay, but I have had way better brunches in CLE for less money.  Without the view, just didn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try Pier W for months, and I'm a little upset we didn't go sooner! The service was spot on, and the food was outstanding. The atmosphere is very chill with a live piano player and the view is one of the best I've seen in Cleveland.  I ordered the Swordfish special, and must recommend this dish. The blue cheese crust was unique, and the cook on the fish was perfect.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour,  spectacular!   Dinner for Seafood Champions!  Cocktails for the Vintage, Craft taste and the Timid, Newbies to drinking.  The view is breathtaking even on a foggy day. The patio is relaxing comfort as long it isn't Midge season because those dang bugs will ruin a good time!  The stairs that ascend to the restaurant is beautiful,  view of amazingly colorful aquarium tank. We eat here at least every other month!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Very good atmosphere. Live pianist gives it a very classy touch. You can see the Lake from pretty much anywhere you are at. However, viewing the cityscape can be a little harder.  Service: Waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. I got complimentary champagne, and bread pudding since it was our Anniversary.   Food: Amazing. I got the 14oz NY Strip. Cooked Medium Rare. Everything on my plate was cooked and seasoned to perfection. One of the best steaks I have ever had, outside of the Wagyu steak served at Hyde Park.   Price: a it of people talked about how expensive it was and I do not agree. The main courses themselves were a bit pricey but everything else was very well priced. I mean heck I got a bottle of beer for $3.    Overall: 5/5. Did not have anything negative too add, it was a wonderful experience and I will return."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for our anniversary on 7/19. The service was unacceptable, we set down for 15 minutes without having a waiter come to our table. We left early because of this."}
{"text":"While the service at the bar was a tad spotty, once we were seated the service was perfect and the food was deelish. I had the Hawaiian tuna with black rice and snowpea tempura. It was wonderful, and it was full of different textures and flavors. The black rice (which I never had before) was coconut infused and it was heavenly.  I also had the clam chowder (yummy!) and lots of moscato. Very very good!"}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. It is on the water, so the views are absolutely wonderful. The food is delicious. I've had the scallops, crab stuffed shrimp and now the sea bass- all very good. First time I was too stuffed to order dessert since we ordered appetizers this time. If you are in Cleveland- dress up and go for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing...and lets not get it twisted...you pay for the atmosphere.  try to get a seat at the window facing the skyline.  i've been here 3 times and have been fairly pleased, although with a few gripes.  one, the greeters always seem stuck up.  maybe it's just me, but if i come here during the evening and spend my money i want to be treated as such.  two, a few times my wine glass was not clean.  unacceptable, for this level of dining.  thirdly, the seating is weird.  you kind of have to request a good seat, and then either get there at a prime time or wait until other patrons have left.  other than those gripes, i REALLY enjoy it here.  the food is very good, although in recent years the portions have gotten smaller.  also, the servers i have had personally have been really good and insightful on food/wine mixtures and recommendations."}
{"text":"Great view specially around sunset. Staff are friendly. Food was good. I would definitly recommend it and would go there again"}
{"text":"horrible service  The waitress in the bar was rude, over and over............. I travel the world and love great restaurants.......but this women made our visit horrible."}
{"text":"Returned recently and it has actually gotten even better. The food is spectacular, service was on point, and the view is still amazing"}
{"text":"Took the husband here for his bday, first visit for both of us. Asked for a window seat, the hostess was hesitant at first until I mentioned we were celebrating a bday, then they were accommodating. First run to the buffet was for the traditional breakfast food. I found it was lacking in temperature, such as eggs, eggs benny, bacon and sausage. However, the rest of the food was really good and plentiful. As for the carving station, they were only serving prime rib, no leg of lamb even though it's advertised. The desserts were amazing! We had a really attentive server named Amos, he was the best. All in all we really enjoyed our long relaxed brunch, overlooking the lake. Can't wait to go back. I'm sorry I had to take away 1 star for the lack of temperature on some of the items. Long live this gem!!"}
{"text":"Tempura Walleye & Veggies. Excellent wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is mainly about the view of downtown Cleveland while dining atop the edge of Lake Erie.  It's a definitely a nice, upscale date night sort of place.   The seafood was in OK category and we found it did not quite live up to the Yelp ratings.   Wife had the North Atlantic blue cod, and I had the almond crusted trout which turned out to be overwhelmingly buttery.  5 stars for the view though."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. The rest of the day was a bummer for other reasons but our dinner there was fantastic. The server was great and the food was delicious. It's a little more expensive, but the quality can't be beat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Elvis, deserves 5 stars in addition to the food. We came on a stormy night. He asked if we wanted to sit closer to the windows to have a better view of downtown and the lightening show. He was attentive and incredibly nice. The food was exceptional. Order: Scallops or the Ahi Tuna."}
{"text":"Great service. ..thank you Allison!  Really interesting food.  Great drinks.  It's the service that makes it 5 star.  Had a blast."}
{"text":"Consistently good, but not anywhere near worth the price.   Scheduled reservations 2 months advance (I believe that's the furthest out you can) for my wedding anniversary and requested a seat by the window. We got special \"happy anniversary\" menus, our dessert had an edible \"happy anniversary\" chocolate sign, and our receipt had a special $0 line item that said--you guessed it--\"happy anniversary\".  But where did they seat us? In the MIDDLE of the restaurant. To be fair, I should have complained, but I'm the sort to make reservations on OpenTable and will go out of my way not to deal with a human when ordering food from home :)  Anyway. 3 other things I will say about Pier W:  1. The service was friendly but dreadfully slow last night (a Friday).  2. It was very loud, which clashed with the ambiance such a setting _could_ have.  3. In the past I have enjoyed the brunch--a decent buffet but (again) overpriced."}
{"text":"Perfect view and great food. What could be better?!  We came here for an anniversary diner. It was always on my list of places to try, just never got around to it. With our reservation there was no wait and we were seated right away. And we might have gotten the best seat in the house. We were on the window edge facing Cleveland. It was a breezy fall night and the view was amazing. The edge of the building actually hangs off the ridge and it seems like you are suspended over the lake. Very cool.  Now onto the food. We got the scallops and the salmon. The scallops were amazing. Pure and simple. The salmon was tasty and the sides were perfectly paired to the main dishes. We were super impressed.   For dessert we went with the creme brûlée. I have been getting creme brûlée a lot. And because of this, I have become quite the creme brûlée connoisseur. This wasn't the best but it is definitely top ten of the last places I have been too.   I can honestly say that I will probably try to make this an aniversary tradition. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful anniversary dinner here. Food was delicious. Had the prosciutto cheese board for appetizer, and scallops for dinner. My husband had the ahi tuna. Food was very good quality and the service was great. Views are great at night of cleveland and the lake. Will absolutely come back here."}
{"text":"One of our families favorite local establishments. I've been coming here for 10 years with no complaints. Extensive wine list, great fresh seafood and an ambiance like no other in the area. Looking out over Lake Erie and Downtown Cleveland can be spectacular especially in the winter.  Try the Sunday brunch. Although pricey it's all you can eat and has tasty selections including bouillabaisse, sushi and a carving station.  You will usually find me getting pulled away from the elaborate dessert table."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to get a nice atmosphere and awesome view of the lake also to see downtown cleveland from across the lake the service is really good here and its great to sit out on the patio thats just over the side of the cliff to sitback relax and have a drink."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service.  Sam is the best waiter ever!!!  First visit of many to come.  Perfect atmosphere for a romantic dinner and outstanding meal.  Cannot wait to return and share with friends."}
{"text":"Dined here for dinner.  Food was good and the view was fantastic. However, the service definitely needs improvement. I felt like I was at Denny's! Our server came to take our order with a pile of dirty dishes from the table across from us.  He tried to prompt me to order by standing in front of our table.  After seeing my confused look, he then finally asked us if we were ready to order.  I said we were. I thought he would drop off the dishes and come back but he held the dirty dishes in front of us the entire time we were ordering.  It just set a bad tone for our dining experience.  Pier W needs to invest in properly training their servers."}
{"text":"I either go for their happy hour special or sunday brunch.  during happy hour i recommend the discounted martinis and the sliders (good to share)  make sure you starve yourself on saturday night if you plan to attend the sunday brunch"}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how to review this place.  Pier W has been serving a critically acclaimed seafood menu since 1965.  The unique building architecture is designed to resemble the hull of a luxury liner cruising along Lake Erie. This full service, white table cloth, contemporary seafood restaurant is located in a unique waterfront location in Lakewood, Ohio. Its minimalist dining room design frames the spectacular views of Lake Erie and the Cleveland skyline.  I started off with a glass of moscato and calamari. The actual squid was very smooth, almost buttery, but I was a little disappointed in the lack of seasoning. The sauces that accompanied it were very good, though.  For my main course, I ordered tempura Great Lakes walleye and asparagus. Again, I was disappointed in the blandness of the food and I had expected a much lighter breading. I was able to pull the breading off and just eat the fish, but I probably should have avoided the fried food all together.   The accompanying ginger sauce was absolutely delicious and the view breathtaking. I'd go again, but I'd order something different and just be mindful that it's the view, the atmosphere that make Pier W what it is.  That evening and the next day I had an upset stomach from the food. It was probably the fact that it was so fried or rich or who knows.  I was disappointed in the food.   However, I will say, that the view and the ambiance are absolutely stunning.  If you can get a table by the window, even better, but call early for reservations because this place was packed!  I sat by the pianist.  I drank my wine.  Enjoyed my fancy food.  Stared out over the lake, watching the sun sink toward the horizon.  It's a very romantic place and I was alone for business so that wasn't very fun. Made me miss my husband!  This would be a great date place!  A big perk is the outside patio and the amazing view from there.  Also, I didn't get there early enough but I heard the happy hour specials are outrageously low which would make this a more affordable option if you want to go but don't want to spend the money."}
{"text":"Pier W we can not say enough! Our experience was by far a 5 Star all the way! My Husband had emailed and asked for a table for a very special occasion. They went above and beyond with complimentary champagne upon arrival, amazing service, incredible dishes and when we were too full for dessert they packed us up a complimentary red velvet cupcake(which we enjoyed the next day, it was delish!!)  There are many beautiful restaurants in the CLE but this one takes the cake! The view, atmosphere and food is a must try when visiting or if you live in town and want an wonderfully romantic night out! Thank you again Pier W for a wonderful memory!"}
{"text":"Talk about romantic! This is my all-time favorite place to go not just for the food, but the ambiance. The view here is amazing - I suggest calling ahead for a window seat.   The food is amazing as well; I've never gotten a dish here that I haven't liked. (Get the beef pierogis for an app - they rock!)   The service is great too. A few months ago we had ordered a red wine that we both loved and couldn't recall the name of it on our next visit. The manager took the time to look up our bill and was able to find it."}
{"text":"Crashing your parent's anniversary dinner for a gourmet meal and a view never hurt anyone, especially when the food is pretty delicious.  The service was extraordinary, and our server was amazingly attentive and helpful.  Though I wasn't overwhelmed by the beet salad, though the presentation was gorgeous, the salmon special was tasty: an Asian-inspired glaze with vegetables and noodles and well-cooked, though I would have preferred a bit more vegetable and less noodle.  However, the star was the dessert: a strawberry-lemonade frozen mousse.  I can't recommend it more, the texture is amazing, and the flavor combination of mint, strawberry, and lemon is one that I've noted down for whenever I decide to experiment with dessert.  Also, they handed my parents a special on-the-house dessert for their anniversary."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours around! Good food and martini/drink specials in the bar area. Very nice place with great views! Get there early or you will have to wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland!! If anyone asked for a recommendation for a special occasion, this would be the first place i'd recommend. On a clear night, I love the view of the lake and downtown Cleveland across the water.  The ambiance is very laid-back and relaxed.  The service is excellent and the wait staff is always willing to help or recommend favorite dishes.   We came here most recently for my brother's birthday. We started out with soups/salads and martinis. I had the Red Delicious Martini which tasted exactly like the name states.  I shared the Lobster Bisque and Poached Pear Salad with my mom and sister.  The lobster bisque was very rich and had nice, large chunks of lobster and was fantastic.  The pear salad was great with caramelized pecans and goat cheese and dressed to perfection.   For my entree, I had the Seared Scallops which were out of this world.  They were cooked perfectly and the spaghetti squash and sweet potato puree that accompanied the scallops were equally spectacular.   Our waitress gave us a free birthday dessert for my brother, despite telling her that we were going home for dessert.  It was a chocolate mousse that was very good.   I can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"A beautiful location with excellent food. We made a reservation on OpenTable (highly recommend doing so) then enjoyed drinks at the bar followed by a lovely dinner. Both seafood dishes we ordered were prepared perfectly. The lobster bisque was AMAZING. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best view and romantic date venue in Cleveland. Period.   Oh, and the seafood is divine, too!   Yes, I get it--Pier W is pricey, but that's part of it's vibe. It's meant for special occasions, fancy brunches and well, romance. So, stop bitching. This place has every right to charge what they do. Between the ambiance, service, view and high quality, artfully cooked seafood, you get what you pay for. And the icing? Cleveland looks absolutely gorgeous from this restaurant. You're literally sitting on a cliff above the Lake.  Now, although I have to step my \"laid-back\" attitude up a few notches when I'm here, it's totally worth it. Your life honestly slows down when you're dining here. Our server was genuinely interested in our anniversary experience at Pier W. She mentioned her favorites without us even asking her, which was super helpful and she checked back just enough to make us feel special, but not over-whelmed. Heck, she didn't even judge us for having our cell phones out to check-in on Yelp, lol.   Another part of what I love about Pier W is how elegant it is, but your not required to wear a jacket. That's right--you won't be humiliated for forgetting a sport coat, gents.   Now on to the food: Expertly prepared seafood and steaks.  We started with a plate of bread, apparently brought in from NYC (wish they would source locally, but whatev), served with butter and hummus. Delicious. Then our server recommended the mahi mahi tacos, which were really good, but definitely an indulgence. I really loved the execution too, as they used scoops of guacamole to hold the mini tacos up.  Then, the main courses... *insert Homer Simpson drool noise here*  I had the scallops with potato basil risotto and Jason got the chardonnay poached wild Alaskan halibut with potato pearls. And don't tell anyone, but we ordered an extra side of the lobster mashed potatoes to try... shhhh. Basically, these deliciously heart stopping taters are topped with a big scoop of fresh, lobster bisque with huge chunks of meat. The scallops? Perfectly seared and tender with a different, yet amazing preparation of risotto-like potatoes. The halibut was snow white, served in a broth with veggies and aromatics. Seriously, so good. And to top the meal off, a trio sampler of sorbets: pineapple, passion fruit and raspberry with little shortbreads.   Seriously, if you want to seal the deal with a lady, this is where you need to wine and dine her. Now, excuse me while I have day dreams about my glorious meal."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this restaurant. Everything is delicious and the staff very knowledgable and friendly. Great specials!  Ask for their wine specialist, they'll be able to recommend something delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great view! Decent prices. Had the calamari as an appetizer. Lightly fried, not greasy, wonderfully spiced. Entree was Blackened Mahi-Mahi. And we finished off with the Pear spring rolls. all the food was great!  Go here and enjoy a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is wonderfully wonderous! Appetizers 1/2 off... in one of the most beautiful places to dine in cleveland. Several wines priced lower than normal- but the big deal is the appetizer specials! A little side note- there is a truffle bar for Valentine's treats (book ahead!)"}
{"text":"Impromptu weekday dinner with friends.  We had originally planned to go for happy hour, but with the bar completely packed, we instead decided to grab dinner and one of the tables with a view at the back of the restaurant--and it is an impressive view, especially as the night was just beginning to fall on the Cleveland skyline.  Later in the evening, outdoor lighting from the restaurant casts a glow on the Lake Erie waters below.  The Grilled South American Cobia was pretty good; the miso glaze went well with the relatively fatty cobia, which I had never eaten before.  The sides were not quite as good:  The sticky rice was okay, but the tempura vegetables--even though I can understand them trying to put together an Asian-themed plate--just did not fit quality-wise with what it was served with.  For dessert, we shared a trio of sorbet, including a pistachio sorbet that was very well received.  Service, except for one long stretch towards the end where our server seemed to disappear, was pretty good.  One of the wines-by-the-glass seemed to be really off taste-wise--probably from sitting around too long--but it was returned and replaced with another wine without any fuss.  On the topic of wine, Pier W has a pretty good wine list with a wide selection of medium-priced options as well as a reserve wine list in a separate book with some very nice (and, of course, more expensive) selections for celebrating a special occasion or simply enjoy LTD. ;D  Overall, Pier W is a solid restaurant with extraordinary views and an impressive wine list.  They are also known for having an excellent brunch, though I haven't done that in a very, very long time.  But, as far as Cleveland seafood, my top pick remains downtown's Blue Point Grille."}
{"text":"Gentlemen -  this is the ultimate date place in town.  The view is wonderful, the live piano music is lovely, and the food leaves nothing to want.  It's absolutly an amazing experience.   Take note from those below, call early, and get a seat by the window.  It's the best view in town."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch and while expensive it is worth it.  Although the brunch is a buffet the service was excellent.  Our waiter cleared our dirty dishes immediately, supplied new silverware, and made sure we were never without coffee.  The food was great and there was a wide variety from traditional eggs and bacon to oysters, mussels, and salmon.  This may not be a spot for a quick bite but for a special occasion once in a while it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Pier W at the end of March to celebrate our one year anniversary. He had been to brunch a few times and I had been once previously for dinner. While my meal was delicious, I was a bit disappointed with the service. The gentleman that waited on my table during my last visit was amazing but the woman that we had this time around wasn't the best. She just came off kind of cold and uninterested. Other than the service everything else was great. We had a table by the window with an obstructive view of downtown Cleveland. I had the filet and my fiance had the swordfish. We both were very satisfied with our meals but the best part was dessert. The ginger spice cake was so delish! Just enough ginger but not overwhelming. Took me back to my favorite season, fall! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best view in Cleveland.  Great selection of happy hour drinks & menu. My swordfish was cooked to perfection with an Asian flair. Good wine selection."}
{"text":"*Story time again!    I've heard a lot of great things about Pier W so when I had a half day off work I decided to hit up their happy hour early to avoid the crowd. Happy hour goes from 4p-7p and while there was only a sprinkling of people at 4p it did quickly fill up! Bartender Allison was personable and did a great job making sure I was content while I lounged at the bar. I started off with a glass of wine $6 and a cup of their delicious lobster bisque $5.75. At this point in time a VERY sociable man came in with plans to work on his laptop at the bar but he quickly struck up a conversation with me and became my guide by showing me the wonderful views of Lake Erie and downtown Cleveland from the west side of the restaurant. He also persuaded me to sneak into this young professionals meet up where I got to try a complimentary beef slider and another glass of wine.   Side note: Ya'll need to check out The Cleveland Professional 20/30 Club on Meetup! I met several pleasant people!   Back at the bar I munched on some of the calamari $6.75. Good standard calamari. It came with two sauces that I did not really care for so I would probably not get this again. Since I was at Piew W for a couple of hours I got one more dish, the fish sandwich $7.25.  This one was a complete let down but that's probably due to a poor choice on my part. Just too carby for me and by that I mean fried chips, fried fish, toasted texas toast... after the calamari I think was just fried out. (Side note, apparently I became instant friends with the guy next to me because he just reached over and started eating the chips right off my plate! I mean, at least they didn't go to waste? haha)  The gentleman on the other side of me purchased an expensive bottle of wine and shared a glass with me while he waited for his dinner date to show up (I'll be honest, the price didn't make it taste any better than the happy hour wine). We chatted about his recent retirement and successful children and then there was an older gentleman who told us about how he buys businesses, builds them up then sells them for major profits (stuff like hair dye and air ambulances!). Just all around interesting conversations, plus some compliments thrown my way. One of them might have been \"you have the personality of an old man but in a beautiful body\". I'm going to still count that as a positive compliment.   To sum it up I like Pier W and had a wonderful time sampling their happy hour wine/food and engaging in conversations with strangers. I will admit that after four glasses of wine I could definitely understand why younger women get with much older men. They treat you better and have a lot more money. Haha seriously though, Pier W is a good time full of adults just looking to relax and chat over a drink, a harmless enjoyable experience that I recommend!   I'd like to come back and try their famous Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would.  The food is spectacular.  The prices are very affordable. The venue is amazing as it sits out over the lake. Elegant atmosphere and the staff was very polite and knowledgeable about every"}
{"text":"I am a gold medalist when it comes to brunch and I would have loved to give my last experience five stars but I couldn't due to the service. The food is always incredible but I couldn't say the same for our waitress. The brunch comes with one complimentary champagne but we were all wanting another glass or two. The waitress failed to ask if we needed any additional drinks and was very short with us. She would stop by and ask \"are you guys okay?\" but by the time she was done talking and I was ready to say something she was halfway across the restaurant. Anyway, I'll come back because I love brunch but I would like  the service to better. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I confess to only having been to Pier W for a few (very reasonably priced) happy hours, but each time has resulted in a great experience.  It is clear that the happy hour isn't exactly a secret. Every time the lounge has been busy (with what appeared to mostly be retirees) but there has never been a problem finding a seat. Based upon the happy hour, I expect that a full meal would be on-par if not better than other fine dining establishments in Cleveland.   Although the lounge doesn't benefit from the same views of the skyline and the lake as the dining room, the entire restaurant is decorated in a modern nautical theme (including an aquarium view from the glass elevator) but without going overboard.  Service is polite, warm, and has the general sense of being taken care of without being smothered.  As far as food I particularly enjoyed the burgers and sliders (and am looking forward to trying the salmon burger during a future visit.) Vegetarians may be disappointed to find only a few vegetarian options (at least on the happy hour menu) but it is a meat and seafood place after all.  That said, there is a Margherita Pizza that I know my girlfriend is interested in checking out sometime soon.  Maybe next time there is a special occasion (or an unexpected windfall) we'll splurge for dinner. I just hope the happy hour hasn't managed to set an unreasonable expectation!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent evening with Sean B as our server. He explained everything clearly, was pleasant, humorous and fun to talk with. Great sense of humor. Several parties around us knew him as well and had developed a relationship with him from previous evenings out. We would absolutely inquire if we could be seated in his section for a repeat visit. Food was fantastic from start to finish. We frequently travel to Seattle and the fish was on par with any you would find on the coast. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant multiple times and I have a great experience every time. The brunch is good with a wide variety of food to choose and the dinner is a nice calm romantic experience as well"}
{"text":"I took my wife there last night for her 40th birthday.  This place has helped us to realize that we need to explore Cleveland a bit more.  Not only was the food top notch, but the view was excellent.  Make sure to order the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"The food and views in the restaurant are amazing. The best cream of crab soup I've ever had!"}
{"text":"All i will say is make reservations for a table by the window, and enjoy."}
{"text":"There is good reason Pier W has been around for so long. Excellent food and service.  We had a reservation for 7 and they were nice enough to let us know that if we didn't mind waiting 15 min we could get a window table. So glad we did   The view is fantastic even in the dead of winter.   Went with 2 other couples.  We all shared appetizers of calamari, crab cakes, beef short rib pirogies and bruschetta     Sun Mon and Tues specially marked wines are 15% off so we splurged and got a bottle of a fun bottle of Rose Brute. I had the lobster bisque. Very rich and tasty.  The table fell silent as everyone dug into dinners of \"simply prepared\" swordfish and scallops. Which means no sauce so you can enjoy the flavor of the seafood. Other preparation options are available as well. Stuffed shrimp were large and full of crab meat.  Surf and turf and 2 fillets were prepared exactly as ordered.   Everyone got desserts which were fresh and tasty.  Our server was attentive but not intrusive.  Prices were reasonable for such a nice place.  I don't know how I overlooked this place before but it is definitely on my return list."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a long time and it didn't disappoint. The service was a little slow after we got our drinks to order, she took about 30 minutes to get back to us. But she was able to recommend a great wine and had the extensive specials memorized! The food was amazing, I had the salmon and my date had the fresh walleye. For Deseret I got this chocolate peanut butter thing. It was delicious! I had put in the reservation it was his birthday and he got a free cupcake with a candle. The views are spectacular and I loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town! Vodka cucumber lemonade, lobster bisque and chorizo and scampi flatbread are all my go to orders. Delicious with awesome views!"}
{"text":"I've been there four times with my friends and my boyfriend already. I love their pasta and the view is amazing!! :)"}
{"text":"I really need to come here more often.They have the best lobster bisque I have ever had! Service is great and the views are phenomenal.  In my opinion the best restaurant in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"What is so great about this place? Compares to Applebee's in my opinion...my food for the price wasn't what I expected but the service was good. Will not be returning thou."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorites for years. Some of the best food in Cleveland.  In answer to the comment about Select Restaurant Group having people write reviews for them simply isn't true.   The view from this restaurant is magnificent.  Great Sunday brunch, too!"}
{"text":"Very average sea food, very pricey check. For the price I expected a little better. Good wasn't bad but not amazing by any stretch."}
{"text":"Was in town for the Steelers game the next day and I googled Pier W which was right off of Lake Erie near my hotel. I sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice and welcoming. I ordered the oysters and he recommended the sampler oysters which was one of the specials and it was amazing. I then ordered the best Hearth Oven Roasted Cedar Plank Salmon I have ever tasted in MY life!! Fabulous customer service, awesome pianist, great atmosphere, and fantastic food. I will come here again when I'm in town. Thank you for contributing to my birthday weekend experience. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"This place has been a local icon for years.  Back in the 1970's and 1980's it was one of the finest restaurants in the area.  Very romantic.  Great for special occasions.  I proposed to my wife here, so it has special meaning.  It fell on hard times and became little more than an upscale Red Lobster for a while.  It underwent renovation, reopened with a new menu.  Last went there a few years back, but felt no urge to return.  I really like seafood, and my daughter wanted some to celebrate her birthday, so we went here.  First the good:  the view is still amazing.  You get a beautiful sunset view and panoramas of downtown Cleveland.  No other place in the area can match it.  Next, the not so good.  The dining room was very noisy, but got quieter as the night went on.  The live piano player who played Broadway songs and classic rock ballads was a nice touch.  Service was very inconsistent.  Certainly not upscale.  Had to ask for drink refills multiple times.  Got our bill wrong, we got someone else's bill.  The menu is nice, offering a decent selection of seafood.  But you cannot order lobster alone as an entree.  I like the simply prepared option, where you can order basic seafood without all of the sauces and seasonings.  Sides are downright boring.  Salad are uninspired.  We got the frozen tower appetizer.  The oysters were great, the shrimp also.  Lobster OK, crab not so much.  Tasted processed.  Desserts were good.  Enjoyed the unique coffee creme brulee.  Will I rush back here again? No.  I will continue my search for an above average seafood restaurant in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for a brunch. And I have to say every penny you spent here is worth! Their crab salad and lobster salad are delicious. The view is great. Just ask for a table next to the window, and you can see the entire Lake Erie when you enjoy the food. Definitely will come back here next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best happy hours in Cleveland! With breathtaking views of downtown Cleveland and overlooking Lake Erie, the view alone is worth the trip.  For their happy hour, I recommend their braised short rib pierogies--they are by far the best pierogies I've ever tasted in my life. They just melt in your mouth. I enjoyed the sliders I had as well. Service is top-notch at Pier W, and the drinks are delicious (but potent).   Happy hour only takes place in the bar, so make sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"Kind of underwhelming, given the hype this place gets. You're pretty much paying for the atmosphere and the view, which is admittedly beautiful, relaxing, and classy. They also had a live piano player dishing out Christmas tunes, so that was nice.  Service was lacking. When we did have the attention of our waitress, she was very courteous and informative. As soon as she walked away from the table though, it would take her forever to come back and check up on us, especially when it came to paying the bill.  The food was alright, but nothing spectacular. I dove into the lobster bisque with great expectations (I blame you, yelp) and was let down. The calamari app was average at best. My two lobster tail dinner was good enough but again, nothing special, with two very disappointing sides (potatoes and spinach). My girlfriend had scallops in sweet potato sauce with gnocchi and spaghetti squash. I enjoyed that dish very much for its nice combination of strong flavors. I would say the only thing that truly stood out to me though was the oysters a la carte. I was worried because they were very small... but they ended up being the best oysters I've ever had. BY FAR. Do try them if oysters are your kind of thing. For dessert, we had the caramel apple cheesecake. The presentation was impressive, as they pitted an apple, filled it with cheesecake, topped it with caramel popcorn and caramel drizzle, and had a nice, complimentary \"happy birthday\" sign made out of white chocolate.   It's definitely a classy, intimate place to take a date. I enjoyed the experience, but the food was mostly average."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment and service. The view of the lake is great but I recommend making reservations to guarantee a table with a view. The happy hour is such a great deal ! If you sit in the lounge area drinks are half off and the food is too. I got the angus beef burger which unfortunately was a bit too salty so I didn't finish it. I also ordered the fried calamari but that too had too much salt and I didn't finish it. I took my parents with me and they also felt the food was a too salty so we didn't finish our food because of it. We also ordered the margarita pizza which was actually really good and not salty at all. The service was great and so was the atmosphere and drinks. I would definitely come back the atmosphere was great and so were the drinks."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here to celebrate her birthday. She's a big seafood fan and I'm allergic to the stuff so I was nervous my choices would be very limited. Luckily they were able to accommodate my allergy and I got the short ribs and my mom got the grouper special. Both meals were superb and well worth the price. Portions were big and we both took half our meals home. I had called ahead to notify the restaurant we were celebrating my mom's birthday. All the staff from the hostess all the way to the manager wished her a happy birthday. They even brought out a little something for dessert to celebrate. I'm thinking I might make this place a tradition to come celebrate her day."}
{"text":"So I ventured out to Pier W with a large group of friends to check out their happy hour, and I have to say I was pretty happy with the result.  The restaurant is a classy spot located in Lakewood sitting right along the edge of Lake Erie, and it really has a lovely view of the water.  The happy hour menu offers a bar menu with a range of plates that are served half off.  Also, several drinks are offered at a reduced price of $5.75.  As this was our first time here, of course we were interested in almost everything off the bar menu.  And thus we ordered most of the dishes to sample!  We started out trying the soups;  I had gotten the lobster bisque, while others gave the clam chowder a go.  The bisque was creamy and flavorful, although perhaps a bit too salty for my tastes.  Tasty, although I would probably end up getting the clam chowder next time.  Then we had the calamari, which was cooked just right, with delicious fried breading surrounding the soft insides.  The calamari came with 2 sauces, both of which were pretty good.  We moved on to the sliders, which were juicy and cooked well.  And then we had the mussels, cooked in a garlicky broth, which was perhaps understated but very nice.  Then came the tempura blue cod sandwich, which was a fried fish sandwich with ginger aioli served on buttery toast.  The fish was cooked nicely, still moist on the inside, and the toast, filled with butter, really brought the dish to a new level (albeit a quite unhealthy one too, haha).  Finally, we finished with the beef short rib pierogies, with tender meat surrounded by gravy, which were tasty although perhaps not the highlight of the meal.  I'd say we did a pretty good job of sampling the happy hour menu!  Of the dishes that I tried, I was really impressed with the calamari, and I also greatly enjoyed the sliders and the fish sandwich.  As far as drinks went, I tried the chardonnay, which I felt went well with my meal.  A friend ordered the Vodka Cucumber Lemonade, though, which was really divine.    Regarding other aspects of the restaurant, the service was kind, and the classy look of the restaurant with the view of the lake was really lovely.  So in terms of the happy hour, I was quite pleased with my experience and would definitely be up for coming again.  The varied offerings and good prices made this one of the better happy hours I've had here in Cleveland, although admittedly the food is on the richer side.  In other words, I think I may need to take some time to exercise before my next visit, haha."}
{"text":"Definitely come here if you're looking for a fancy night out with your significant other! The food is delicious (although pricey) and the view is absolutely beautiful. It's a wonderful environment and the staff are all really nice and helpful.   My boyfriend and I came here during happy hour on a Sunday and their bar menu has 50% off food & 20-30% off drinks! Our bill came out to be $21.01 (not including tip). A great deal for this classy environment :)"}
{"text":"Came here to the supposedly the most romantic spot in Cleveland with my family.  We were able to catch dinner on a nice summer evening.  The place was beautiful.. with the view of downtown just pass the river.  We started off with some calamari and clam chowder and both were delicious! The clam chowder wasn't salty at all! It was the first time where I tasted the sweetness of the clams from the chowder.   We then had the lobster and the shrimp pasta . Both again were cooked well.  The one thing I would comment was that the pasta was on the saltier side ... however that could be personal preference.   As we finished out .. the night view of the city was so picturesque ... it was perfect to end the evening"}
{"text":"Go for the happy hour!  I know I said Lava Lounge was my favorite happy hour in the city, but this is a close second.  I went with my Dad this evening and we each got the lobster bisque, which was both delicious and presented very nicely, and the blue cod sandwich.  We also each got three cocktails, which are an absolute steal at $5.75.  The basil martini is one of my all time favorites, with the caipirinha right behind it.  All together our bill for six drinks, two soups, and two sandwiches was $60.  Not bad at all considering the quality.    As expensive as the dinners are, the happy hour menu is dirt cheap.  Most of the bar menu runs about $6 - 7 per item during happy hour, and I actually enjoyed it more than the full dinner I had last time I was in the dining room.  The dining room experience wasn't bad at all, I just don't know if it was worth the high price tag.  I will say service has always been good whether in the bar or dining room.    It's been said over and over, but this restaurant is absolutely beautiful inside.  Tons of ambiance and very relaxing regardless of where you're sitting.  The view IS fantastic, but honestly, you can go down the street to the Lake House Cafe on Edgewater and get the same view for much, much less.  (Granted, Lake House is more like a Denny's with a lakefront view, but if you're on a budget you've gotta make do with what you can get.)    In terms of atmosphere, service and view, it can't be beat.  This would be a great place to impress a date or have a fancy birthday/anniversary dinner.  In terms of the food (at least in regards to the regular menu) you could probably find better tasting for less.  I'm glad I experienced the dining room once, but I'm not in a hurry to do it again.  Hitting up the happy hour, however, is going to be a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"The food and service was awesome! We did not get a window seat like requested but it was dark anyway. The ambiance was great. I look forward to going about again to enjoy fine dining."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad dish here. Just tried the bouillabaisse for the first time. It was great. You will not know  true bliss in life until you've tried the lobster bisque here. There is no room for modesty - get yourself the bowl, not the cup. Enjoy. Calamari is also some of the best in Cleveland. This is hands down my fave restaurant for happy hour - which offers awesome discounts - or for special occasion dinners. The view is gorgeous, as it is located along Lake Erie and offers floor-to-ceiling windows for easy enjoyment of the spectacular view."}
{"text":"We were so surprised at how well this restaurant is doing. What a nice little when treat we visit family in Ohio. The king crab was delicious but the lobster pappardelle was outstanding!! The service is top notch but the views are what really won us over. We spent a beautiful summer night here. Our dinner started at 8:30pm (which is a perfect time to catch the sunset).   Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everyone says its the best happy hour in Cleveland and it's true!  The service is fast and friendly and I have yet to have a drink or menu item that I haven't loved. The restaurant is cantilevered out over the lake, so it has great views and a great atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend it for a date or just a chill place to grab a drink after work with friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and view are AMAZING.  Food is just as good.  SUUUPPPERRR Delicious.  Expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"I went here for a weekend brunch. Was very good experience. Great food great views .. My server looked little tired to say the least but overall a great exp. the weekend brunch here is rated on of the best in town and I think that certainly is the case ...."}
{"text":"When it comes to food. You can't really go wrong with W!  I went and had dinner here a few years ago. But, had brunch here yesterday. Incredible buffet. From crab and lobster to pancakes amd bagels. NOT to mention and incredible dessert table.  We ate so much we hurt when we left. The mimosas and coffee were an excellent touch.  Parking was easy and the staff was super friendly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Views are breathtaking!  The service was horrible.  After we were finished eating, it took the server 30 minutes to come to our table and ended up telling the bus boy to box our food.  We sat there with our food boxed for another 15 minutes waiting for the server to acknowledge we were still there. (So total of 45 mins before our server talked to us). We ordered two lobster bisques to go and waited an additional 30 minutes before I had to get the attention of our server and ask her if our lobster bisque was coming out.  She brought it within 2 minutes.  When she brought us our to go order, she said sorry and walked away.  When you pay $130 for a meal for two people, you expect great service.  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. I've been going there for years and have never had a bad experience. Even something as simple as a dirty martini. You'd think that those are pretty much the same everywhere. Wrong. Every time I've had one at Pier W it's amazing. How can a simple martini be so much better? And yet, it is. The service is always great, and of course the ambiance is part of what you're paying for. I've read a number of reviews where people complain about not getting a window seat. Well, EVERYONE wants a window seat. Fact is, I'm pretty sure they have some regulars who drop big money in there. It's likely those folks who get preference and I'm okay with that. I've had window seating in the past but not gonna happen all the time.    So, was there again last night and though I've never been a seafood guy, it occurred to me that this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the area so maybe I should try something beyond the crab cake appetizers for once. Ordered the Chilean sea bass. Holy smokes! What I've been missing over the years! It was phenomenal. They just make you feel special at Pier W from the minute you walk through the door . Even the bread they provide is perfect. Thick crunchy brown crust but soft in the middle. If I ever hit the lottery I'm gonna buy a top floor condo at Winton Place facing northeast and become one of those widow seat regulars ."}
{"text":"I took my fiance on Sunday to Pier W for her Birthday.  We were seated at the most northerly window table overlooking the Cleveland skyline,  truly a wonderful view. Kevin was our server and represents this restaurant with knowledgeable expertise. Drinks were served, orders taken, quite relaxing. The dinners were presented and cooked perfectly. When I made the reservations it was noted for a birthday. Kevin brought a Red Velvet desert for her. The whole evening was excellent. Thank you Pier W for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I could never get enough of this place!  Food is worth the price. While I have a seafood allergy, they are very accommodating and have options for those who do have allergies.  By far the best thing about this place is their Sunday brunch. Yes, it's $45, but it's like the Wonky Factory of boozy Sundag brunches. Never ending food options, desert table and champagne.   Service is also some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Place is so good in it's own unforgiveable bourgeois way that I can easily see how it can motivate masses to skip paying taxes or even rob banks. Trust me, their scallops are that criminally good. The service makes you feel like Prince William is your redheaded step-brother and they have been waiting on the edge of the seat to wait on your hand and foot. Did I believe that my salmon was helicoptered in this morning from some cold Norway? Yes, it was. For its all $36 worth I plan to believe in that story and you'd better do the same. I thought place is the best in summer when you can sip on the cocktails and watch Cleveland skyline from the deck but turns out it's absolutely magical in winter as well.  And for those who are still circling the dating drains: yes it is worth to take a girl here on a date. First of all, she will appreciate it more than some authentic discounted Asian noodles facing the kitchen in Tremont; and secondly, no she is not going to think you own a borehole in Middle East and will buy her Gucci every weekend. Why not? Maybe because she googled you in and out. Or if not maybe because you drove her there in the Honda with a mileage equal to 3 trans-Atlantic flights. Regardless she will never forget Pie W. Or you."}
{"text":"This was my first meal at Pier W.  My party of 5 was celebrating a birthday.  We arrived around 9:45 p.m. and the restaurant was still 3/4 full.  Diners came in after me.  I ordered a dozen fresh oysters.  I could tell the oysters had been shucked previously and were sitting on ice before being brought to the table. The service was good but we had to repeatedly ask for condiments for our meal.  I had the king crab legs.  The portion was large but the crab legs were very dry.  I thought the crab legs had been cooked earlier and were placed in a heated tray for serving.  All in all, I would give the service a 8 out of 10 and the food a 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"awesome HAPPY HOUR!!! first of all it's just a really cool place. cool vibe with wonderful lake views. i felt like i was walking into a sort of futuristic place with the walk down the path to actually get inside. then you venture downstairs you are met by a sight of an awesome bar / dining room overlooking lake erie. the feel of the place was very low key, but good for some people watching. very mixed crowd from younger professionals to older retirees.......just beware:  YOU CAN NOT save seats at the bar. i was scolded by the hostess for 'saving' a seat for my friend who had not yet arrived. uh, awkward. i felt like a preschooler who was just yelled at for not sharing my toys....  but putting that aside, the menu is amazing, the drinks delish and super cheap! everything on app menu is 1/2 price, WITH the exception of the cod tacos...but there is a LOT to choose from, not to mention full size servings.....and then they bring out hot, spicy peanuts where the smell alone, will  warm your belly! ( i did not try these firsthand, but the patron next to me swore on his life, ok, not really on his life) but said they were fabulous! the drink list is extensive!!! all wine/beer are either 1/2 price or specialty cocktails were right around $5.....definitely a place to hit up for hh. oh, and they offer these prices M-S. i overheard someone say, normally from 4-7 but on saturday, until 6:30.....good times indeedy!"}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week with a group of friends.  I made a reservation for fairly late because they said they couldn't accommodate a group of 6 earlier.  We got there around 9pm, asked for our table and she told us to wait at the bar for our table.  Well, we ended up waiting almost 45 minutes for our table even though it didn't seem that crowded.  We asked after about 20-30 min of waiting and we're pretty sure the hostess just forgot to get our table ready.  No apologies either.  We all got something from the restaurant week menu.  First, the best part of the night were the appetizers, they were all AMAZING.  I got the Coquille St. Jacques (scallops) and my friends got Seared Tuna.  All cooked perfectly and soo good.  We were really excited for our entrees but sadly we were disappointed.  A few people tried the clam chowder and lobster bisque (which were all pretty good, very creamy).  Our entrees were nothing special.  I got a Cod over rice dish which just seemed like they threw a bunch of stuff together and put a piece of cod on top.  It had a little too much going on .  Someone got the Tandoori shrimp which was ok, but the shrimp were overcooked.  The desserts were ok, nothing special (I believe there was a chocolate cake and some kind of apple thing...not memorable obviously...).  Our waitress was nice, but seemed a bit off her game--she'd forget things or get confused (such as asking us if we were interested in dessert when we all got the 3 course menu and had already told her what desserts we wanted).  In summary,  3 stars for great appetizers and ambiance. It's very romantic with a beautiful view of the city (definitely good for special occasions or dates). The entrees we got were disappointing but maybe for Restaurant week they were just missing the mark on what they were offering.  Unfortunately the service seemed a bit off the day we came too.  I've heard such great things about this place, I'll probably try it again in hopes it'll be better next time.  I'll at least come back to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"Always a hit.  Can be difficult to make reservations at times, but that comes with its stellar reputation."}
{"text":"Although I only stopped in for a drink and dessert, I feel like I should say something nice about this place. Great atmosphere, live piano player, and friendly courteous staff all made me wish I could have made it for dinner. The peanut butter bombe was delicious. Beautiful view of the lake as well. Next time I am in Cleveland this place is on my list for a complete dinner and probably that fifth star."}
{"text":"An upscale seafood restaurant located in Lakewood, in a pretty cool building that sits over a cliff. If you're lucky, get a window seat that overlooks the Cleveland skyline. If you're not so lucky, like us, a window seat will overlook a dark shadow of a tree. Lol.  We went for our anniversary on a Friday night and they had a piano player, which was a nice touch. The scallops with sweet potato jojo's and a mango wasabi sauce were prepared perfectly. My Husband got the grouper with a black bean pancake- the pancakes were very unique but pretty good. The grouper was really tasty and had great seasoning. We got the cheese plate as an appetizer- everything veggie wise that came with it was pickled, so make sure you like pickled stuff (I do not. So I just ate the cheese and prosciutto) We also got oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer and they were stuffed with a cheesy spinach mix which I really enjoyed. Their beer selection was mediocre, and their cocktails were a little pricey and nothing stood out as very creative.  Their dessert selection looked awesome but we were way too full, sadly. The service was very good, and the restaurant was clean and classy. Good place for a date night."}
{"text":"Best views and happy hour in Cleveland. The Lobster Bisque and Clam Chowder are amazing!"}
{"text":"The ambience and view is absolutely wonderful. I really enjoyed the atmosphere - it was modern, yet refined, but not stuffy or the least bit pretentious. The wait staff was very attentive and professional. Our server took good care of our party of 10. We enjoyed the relaxing meal and caught up on conversation and laughs with our good friends after a long week.   The food was good, and I don't think its necessarily overpriced, especially when you consider the location and breathtaking view. I do wish, however, that the it had a bit more flavor. Some bold spices and variation in texture would have been great. I had the organic salmon, and it was a bit greasy for my taste. I'm not sure whether it was added oil or the natural fats in the fish, but the fat overwhelmed each bite. The potatoes that accompanied the dish were also glistening with olive oil. The spinach was nothing special - merely sauteed with some garlic.The crab cake was underwhelming, as was the creme brulle (we didn't like the peanut butter chocolate addition to what should be a very simple dessert made of cream, eggs, and sugar). We ordered the beef perogies too - they were delicious. A friend enjoyed the oysters so much that he ordered a second platter. He said they were delightful.   They have an extensive wine list and our friends who ordered from it were quite satisfied. I will probably dine here again and try out something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is horrible . Came in for lunch . The sword fish lunch special was served raw twice . The second time the fish came back burnt on the top and still raw . The food is minimal quality . While eating a waitress dusted a table cloth all over us and out meal and drinks . Particles flying everywhere and she had nothing say and walked off.  Horrible service . I will never be back ."}
{"text":"Party of five. Two had bouillabaisse and raved. Thumbs up on the scallops, too. BUT two of us had overly salty entrees...one was sent back and good for the management for replacing it and not charging for that meal. I see that the salty complaint is repeated in other reviews or I would have suspected a new recruit. Management really needs to get the kitchen staff to go a little easier on the salt. View was great as were the martinis. Service was fine."}
{"text":"You're paying for the location and atmosphere because I believe the food is overpriced for what you get. I love the lobster bisque. It is probably the best I've had. I've been rather underwhelmed with the bouillabaisse and the crab stuffed shrimp. The bouillabaisse was just okay... not a whole lot of flavor and the crab stuff shrimp tasted old and fishy to me. It was served over lackluster potatoes with a little bok choy that felt like it didn't belong.   I love the piano player. Love the city and lake views. Has great service. However, when the server packed up our food and brought it back to us, she gave me my brother in law's dish all packed up with a sticker closing the box in a bag. Didn't notice until I opened it to eat it the next day. This is unacceptable to me. Half of my meal was given to someone else. I paid for that....  I'm sure I'll be back for some lobster bisque, but probably just for that and a glass of wine...."}
{"text":"For seafood go no place else than Pier W. For romantic setting with perfect views of the lake and Downtown Cleveland in the distance go nowhere else as well. 5-star food, good service and amazing location. A must if you come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Last time we wre there it was late November. After that , we had never came back.  First my visit was great. However, at my last visit, I got not prepared fish! I did some bites and I understood that something was wrong. Even , the manager acted quickly , and changed my order- I had upset stomach. That night, the staff was probably very busy, so we did not had proper service too. After last experience, we decided to not come back- there are many othr great places to dine. Be careful with not prepared fully meal ;)"}
{"text":"How can you beat this view of our gorgeous city?!  The service is spot on, the wine list is impressive, the piano player adds to the romantic atmosphere, and the food is superb.  Try the calamari! It was great! Lightly breaded and cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"So happy to finally dine here, and especially for a special occasion, my husband's birthday.   We had a 6:30 reservation on a Wednesday night and showed up at 5:50 so we could have a drink in the bar before dinner.    Much to my dismay they said we couldn't enter the bar because it was full.  They actually had a barrier put up so you couldn't get in.   I have NEVER encountered something like this before.   Crazy, right?  After 15 minutes, they found us a table on the higher section, but we still had a beautiful view of the Lake and the City.   Our server immediately brought bread over, but we asked her to hold off as we wanted to enjoy a cocktail first.  She was very accommodating and I had a Cosmopolitan and my husband had a martini.   Both were perfect.    We both started off with a bowl of the lobster bisque which was presented well.   The soup wasn't very hot and there was very little lobster in it, but it had a good flavor.   I had the cedar plank salmon and my husband had the red snapper.   I asked for a substitute of the potatoes for the lobster risotto.   Meals came piping hot, which I love.   The salmon was very good, the broccoli and carrots were good, but the risotto was awful.   Risotto is supposed to be creamy.   This risotto was crunchy and dry.   Never have had anything like it.   The snapper was plentiful and served with lobster mashed potatoes.  He loved the flavor and probably ate only 1/3 of his meal as it was so big.    Our server was fantastic and the views are spectacular.   They even brought us a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese topping as a birthday dessert.    Overall, started out badly, but got better.   Not perfect, but good."}
{"text":"Get whatever is rich, buttery, and creamy. They somehow make it richer than anywhere else and it's so so good. That said, for a well regarded seafood place I was hoping their fresher options would be better, but they were merely good.   For instance, their lobster bisque was phenomenal, a true 5 star perfectly done bisque. I could have just eaten it as my meal and been happy as a clam. Super creamy, lobstery(?), and perfectly textured and salted. Even the crouton in there was special.   Then the swordfish I got was decent, served over some corn and potatoes that were good, but lacked any wow factor. My friend got the crab cake stuffed shrimp, which were again good, but the real wow factor on her plate was the creamy mashed potatoes, awesomely done.   Last, the creme brulee was awesome with a nice raspberry sauce and blueberries on top to balance the extra rich custard. See the trend? Creamy and rich = truly superb; everything else = not worth the five star price. If you want rich and creamy, this is probably one of your best spots in Cleveland, and the view is spectacular.  I was more looking forward to the seafood itself here, and that's why it only is getting 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to take me out to a fancy dinner for my birthday.  Right away I thought of Pier W.  For months I have heard how fabulous the happy hour was so this was the perfect opportunity.  We arrived around 6:00 PM (Happy Hour ends at 7) and easily got seats at the bar.  I had heard it was difficult to get a seat at the bar during happy hour.  However, it was the NBA Finals and the Cavs were playing later that evening, so that could've been the reason.  The bartender was attentive and polite, he handed us our menus and made us comfortable at the bar.  We decided to order a bunch of appetizers from the happy hour menu which were all about $6.  The calamari, mussels (with lots of bacon pieces, YUM), and Angus Beef Sliders were all delicious.  However the star of our meal was the Lobster Bisque because of the generous pieces of lobster and the decadence of the creamy broth.  You could not find any better and it only cost $5.50.  They also had a great list of $6 wines by the glass in their happy hour menu- A lot of places only have one or two. My only disappointment was that even though I was overly stuffed, that I didn't get to order the beef short rib perogies, crispy pork wings, and the tempura blue cod sandwich!  I'll gladly come back of course.  Overrall, I had a lovely experience.  I think my boyfriend even appreciated the fact that I chose a fancy place, but didn't have to spend fancy money"}
{"text":"Great food, great view of downtown Cleveland, and a unique setting. The ambiance with live piano the day we were there was great too. My husband requested that he play Star Wars music and he played a medley of about 10 songs. It was epic. If you get there and there's a wait, there's seating by the bar where you can order full menu, which is awesome too."}
{"text":"Happy hour at this place is great!! Some friends and I went on a Friday and it was full. I'd recommend getting there early if you want a table around the bar. I made an effort to try a little bit of everything. The lemon drop martini was tasty, the cucumber lemonade was refreshing and strong. I did not care for the basil martini at all. I was under the impression it had a 'hint' of basil but came out tasting like vodka basil puree, which must be an acquired taste. We had the sliders, shrimp tempura (great dipping sauce), short rib pierogies and cod sandwich, all of which were delicious.... BUT the lobster bisque was too rich. Two in my party did not feel well after eating the whole thing. I was fine but only had a few spoonfulls. I will definitely go back. Was a beautiful spot to socialize."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in lakewood. If you're going on a budget, try their happy hour from 4-7. Great deals on some awesome food :)"}
{"text":"There is nothing negative to say about this place, except I wouldn't mind the prices being a little lower :)  Had the filet mignon medallions with whipped mashies--excellent. I go here regularly for happy hour--great wine prices and \"bar food\", which is not typical bar food. We had a great view near the window and watched the sun set and the skyline--tres romantique"}
{"text":"Holy Batman, can you be serious? Could there really be a restaurant hanging off of a cliff overlooking Lake Erie? Entering Pier W does give that eerie feeling, but only at first. After a moment you suddenly come to the realization that you are located in one of the finest settings to be found.   Pier W has an atmosphere all of its own with incredible, unobstructed views of the lake. It would be hard for me to forget my one floor elevator entrance ride down past the salt water fish tank and the sudden realization that I'm in this structure attached to a cliff.   In short, the views are fantastic and to my further astonishment and delight, I found that the wonderful views were matched with wonderful food. I had the oysters Rockefeller which came perfectly prepared, perfectly presented and were some of the finest I've ever had. Then, the lobster pasta, though made from a base of commercially sold pasta, was about as good and tasty as it gets in any commercial restaurant. During my second visit, I had the scallops which came seared to perfection and, as expected, delicious.  I found the wine list extensive and my service was friendly, informative, professional and polite.   Pier W is a great place and though it is gimmicky, hanging off a cliff like that, it has great food, great service and somehow doesn't have a gimmicky feeling or atmosphere about it.   For Cleveland, Ohio, Pier W is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"A very rare combination of delicious dishes and gorgeous view. Would be a great date place. As a general rule, you don't get both, yet this restaurant breaks the trend.  Oysters: although fresh and tasty, they were not washed properly and had lots of shell pieces. Eat carefully if you decide to get them. Alaskan Salmon Special: very well prepared in sweet sauce.  Creme brûlée: excellent  Service was spectacular, comparable to some of the best restaurants in world. I only don't give 5 stars because of the oysters, but would be willing to reconsider after a second visit."}
{"text":"Oh, Pier W. You have wonderful seafood and great views and are a wonderful place to bring out-of-towners who might enjoy dinner amongst the lake.  The food is absolutely delicious-- Pier W probably has the best lobster bisque in Cleveland and the trout and salmon are so beautiful and well-presented. You won't be steered wrong with anything on the menu. Our server didn't come by often, so we tended to ask for everything all at once since we weren't sure when we'd see her again (which was sad, because I could've totally gone for a second glass of wine and another piece of bread for my bisque).  Gosh, I'll probably be the subject of internet trolling after this, but I wish I could give higher marks. When we arrived on a less busy night, we still had to wait 20 minutes for our reserved table. Just be forewarned, even if you make a reservation, you'll probably still have to wait, even if it's not that busy.  But sadly, I also have concerns about accessibility here. On our reservation, we annotated that we had someone with limited mobility and needed a close by table. I also called again that day to ensure it was still possible and mentioned it when we arrived. I couldn't believe it when the hostess started guiding us to the farthest end of the restaurant. I stopped her and reminded her, again, this wouldn't work-- amongst the sea of open tables and the struggling of my guest, she looked at me like I was crazy. We eventually did get re-seated, but it was confusing for staff and frustrating for us and the person in my group with walking aids.  The food is totally five stars, but I feel really strongly about accessibility and service."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland to attend Game 4 of the NBA finals, and support our boy, Lebron. A friend recommended Pier 4 and it did not disappoint. We really loved Pier W. The view is unlike any other in Cleveland, as the restaurant is set on the lake with a view of downtown. Even though Pier W is a seafood restaurant, they offered a gluten-free, vegan option, which was perfect for me. I was really impressed that Pier W managed to have something on the menu for me considering I'm one of those \"I don't eat that\" types. I definitely recommend Pier W for peeps who are visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fancy as all get-out. The kind of fancy that reminds you that you were born in a different social stratum. Went here for Thanksgiving last year. Food was excellent and wine selection was the best I've seen in Cleveland. My friend's parents paid. I highly recommend someone else paying when you go here. Definitely not a first-date spot, unless you just paid down those polo lessons on your American Express card."}
{"text":"Thank you for making me feel so special on my birthday. Every part of the meal was perfect! I would highly recommend the lobster bisque, king crab legs with roasted potatoes and Brussel sprouts, and the vanilla bean creme brulee! So delicious!"}
{"text":"The presentation was great and the taste was even better.  Pier W's Famous Bouillabaisse and the Crab Stuffed Gulf White Shrimp led the evening.  The absolute best seafood experience in Ohio, with the ambiance second to none!  Would repeat in a heartbeat, and plan to often!"}
{"text":"Went here for a special occasion.  We were told we would have customized menus, which we did not receive.  Also, had made reservations and requested a window table.  I was told you cannot request a table, but they would see what they could do.  We were seated in the upper back area unfortunately.  Food was really good.  Service was very bad...  Overall, a good experience. Just wish they had better service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here last night for my birthday dinner and this place was absolutely amazing! I just moved here from Ft. Lauderdale, FL and I've been missing the water. The views were the best and the food was great too!! I loved my Sea Bass! She couldn't have picked a better place!!!"}
{"text":"Had Valentine's Day dinner at Pier W and had a nice meal. Nothing spectacular, by any means. My mother loves this restaurant and I can tell why. It's better suited for an older crowd in my opinion. I appreciate that there's a vegetarian option on the menu, considering this is predominantly a seafood restaurant.   We picked Pier W mainly because my boyfriend loves seafood and I'd heard about the all you can eat chocolate dessert buffet that was available though Valentine's Day. In honor of the holiday, they'd dismantled the buffet and plated up some chocolate treats. For $12 a person (with absolutely no sharing according to our server) I expected some of the best dessert of my life. What I got was a plate full of a hodge podge of chocolately things that I didn't really care for. Oh well.   I'm glad that I can say I've eaten at Pier W, but I don't think I'm in any rush to go back. There are so many other great restaurants around town with more inventive menus and a less stuffy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best view in Cleveland!  Very good shrimp, staff was great  The elevator was not working so it was hard to get down the steps as I had just had knee surgery. I wasn't in a good mood, but the waitress sensed that and really put me at ease.    Once our meal came, I forgot all about my knee pain. Absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"The best dining experience by far in the Cleveland area.  Chris served us great dirty martinis at the bar.  Pianist took requests and played a couple of our favorite tunes.  After being seated for our 9 o'clock dinner reservation at a table with an exquisite view of the lake and skyline we were treated to the best mussels, clam chowder, and lobster that I ever had.  Top notch service from the hostesses to the waitresses, bus staff and bartender.  We'll definitely be coming back for more of this exceptional food and service!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Let me repeat that, wow!!!   First off, I'm not sure why anyone would say this place is too pricey. We had 3 drinks a piece, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 deserts and our total was $150. 2 steak dinners and the same probably would have been comparably priced at Applebee's. Not trying to shell out $150 for a meal frequently but as others have mentioned for special occasions, Pier W is second to none.   Atmosphere: Amazing! Obviously the water view takes the cake, but on top of that I also love the cozy, intimate feeling of it being a small restaurant.   Appetizers: We got the beef short rib pierogies and the crispy pork wings. The pierogies were absolutely out of this world. I don't think I've her had better! The pork wings were equally delicious. The only thing I will say is that they were both pretty lukewarm, but it didn't make them any less delicious. We sat at the bar waiting for a window table, and it was happy hour so they were half priced. Also, the bread they serve while you wait was so delicious.   Drinks: Very reasonably priced. We also were able to partake in a round of happy hour priced ones which was awesome, but even beyond that the prices are on par with say, Ohio City. Would love to see a more extensive craft beer list though.   Entree: Husband had the beef short rib and I had the tenderloin medallions. Both were fantastic. My husband's literally fell apart and could be cut with a butter knife. Mine was great too.   Desert: cookies and cream cheesecake. To die for. Also got the Dublin coffee to split. It was okay, but not our favorite. It went well with the cheesecake though.   Service: it was okay. Our server was polite enough, but didn't pace our dishes apart very well and there were plenty of times if we weren't enjoying ourselves and the view we would have actually stood up to go get her.   Overall a great experience. Like I said, price wise it's great for a special occasion. That being said, we would definitely go back during happy hour for some half priced apps and drinks on a normal day - it honestly wouldn't be any more expensive than going to your average run of the mill dive bar. Pier W is great!!!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here as a surprise dinner for his birthday.  It was our first time here, and definitely won't be the last.  The glass elevator takes you past an aquarium and into their main dining room.  We were promptly sat at a table with an amazing view of Cleveland's skyline.  I was very worried that we wouldn't get a good table, which is why I moved my reservation time up to 5.    We ordered a couple of drinks, which by the way, the wine list is wonderful!  The bread and butter/pesto they serve is definitely a plus...gotta love good bread and butter! For appetizers my boyfriend had 1/2 dozen of Blue Point oysters, which he said were awesome.  I'm a vegetarian and never have liked seafood, so I was a little worried that my food would be mediocre, since they specialize in seafood. This definitely wasn't the case.  I had the Autumn Greens salad, which was nicely dressed and  had just the right ratio of greens, nuts and cheese. For our entrees, my boyfriend had the Blackened Hawaiian Mahi Mahi which was served on top of purple Peruvian mashed potatoes and finished with some avacodo salsa. He really enjoyed it, which I could tell since his entire plate was gone within 6 minutes or so, hah.  I ordered the vegetarian tasting plate, which consisted of thin slices breaded Japanese eggplant, escarole, and lemon and thyme gnocchi, all topped off with marina sauce, parmesan, and basil oil. I LOVED it.  The eggplant was breaded perfectly- not too thick or thin and defnitely not soggy.  The marinara sauce complimented the eggplant and the delicious gnocchi.  The portion was very generous as well, which is always nice to see.  The only critique I have was the temperature... it could've been served a little hotter.  It wasn't cold by any means, but definitely was piping hot. Perhaps it sat in the window before my boyfriend's dish was done?  Either way, it was still wonderful.  For dessert we had the dark chocolate mousse cake, which was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular, but it definitely wasn't horrible.  It went well with our Irish and French coffees. Our server was pleasant and answered any questions we had about the menu.  We definitely enjoyed our meal and the overall ambience and experience Pier W offered.  The skyline kept getting better as the night went on, which was definitely fun to watch.  It almost felt like we were on vacation in someplace like Boston, considering the great view and the water in front of us.  I highly recommend this place for a nice special night out. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This may have the best happy hour this side of Cleve. $5.75 martinis, half off bar snacks (try the pierogies, or the kalamari, or the mussels, or...) and a classy feel to unwind in. The regular menu is ok from what I've tried, but it's the happy hour that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This is a place to dine, not just eat. The food is excellent, view super and food choices outstanding. The service is friendly and impeccable.  This is a place to celebrate a special event-or just spend a delightful evening.  This place offers a choice of a 3oz pour of wine, in addition to the regular pour.  I wish other places offered such a choice. Request a table by a window with a beautiful view of the city."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Brunch last weekend and were not really impressed. We arrived at 11am and they were not very busy as a few tables were still open, but service was slow to get and refill our drinks. They also sat our party of 3 at the most awkward table possible. The buffet of food was decent, but a lot of items that were there were either not refilled or only scraps were left. Not likely to give this another go for brunch - especially for the price - but perhaps going for Happy Hour would provide a better experience."}
{"text":"I am so glad I tried Pier W although my co-workers claimed it to be not worth the money. I arrived just before 4PM Thursday. I was fortunate to make it there just before the crowd and found the perfect booth. The waitress explained all appetizers were half off and all cocktails were $5.75. I decided to go with the hearth baked flatbread & a red delicious cocktail. The red delicious cocktail was coated with cinnamon sugar around the rim which, in itself, was awesome. I believe I nearly chewed the glass to make sure all traces of the cinnamon sugar were gone. The hearth bake flatbread included shrimp scampi and chorizo with alfredo sauce. It was so good. I wanted more but knew I had more places to stop on my last night in Cleveland. My total bill was less than $13 which was well worth the money if you ask me. Delicious food & drinks...winning!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my bday dinner. Fantastic service from the moment I stepped in to the moment I left. The bread plate and butter spreads were phenomenal. My friend ordered the bowl of clam chowder and was very pleased with it. I ordered the tenderloin medallions. They were perfectly cooked , flavorful, and very tender. The serving size of the medallions was more than I expected, which pleasantly surprised me. The medallions were served with garlic mashed potatoes,asparagus, and sherry and crimini mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were delicious and creamy with a perfectly subtle hint of garlic. The asparagus were just two small pieces atop the mashed potatoes and while tasty and edible, I prefer asparagus to be a little under cooked and crisp, as opposed to the limp asparagus that came with my dinner. If you like mushrooms, you will be delighted by the plentiful amount served with this dish. My dining partner ordered the airline Amish chicken breast, which he was very pleased with. It was a large, juicy and flavorful breast, served with a good size portion of very tasty Parmesan creamed spinach. I also ordered a glass of Shiraz and was very pleased by the generous pour I was given.  I wasn't going to order dessert, as I told the waiter I had bday cake waiting for me at home, however he convinced me to try one of their desserts. I was very pleased I listened to him! My dinner mate and I ordered he coconut caramel cake to share. It was perfection!!! Layers of decadent flour less chocolate cake, with a rich caramely coconut filling and a caramel buttercream was sublime. It was accompanied by a delicious coconut sorbet. The serving size was small, but more than adequate for two to share. And the waiter added a special touch when he served it: there was a chocolate birthday greeting on the plate, a very thoughtful touch that shows you the waiter was paying attention and went above and beyond. Our waiter was Amos and he was extraordinary, one of the best waiters I've had ever, anywhere. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and just all around top notch. Overall, I had a great experience at Pier W. Also worth mentioning, the view is amazing. Request a window seat, if possible. I'm looking forward to many return visits here."}
{"text":"The view is great. Bartender was great. Over cooked seafood sucked. The waiter was obviously too busy with his wine drinking table to bother with us. Disappointed to say the least. Noticed a manager with a headset. Tried to get his attention, to no avail. I guess a $250+ tab for two people doesn't matter to this place. Sad."}
{"text":"Wow. If I could end this review here it would some this entire place up. From the valet down to the waiter, everything was perfect. The food we ordered came out perfect. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I couldn't have asked for better our waiter was spot on with his customer service. It seemed like he may have owned shares of the company with how he took care of our table. We will definitely return and I hope to see some of you guys there too. You won't regret. And the views are to die for."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time last night for my parents' 50th anniversary, and was rather underwhelmed. I made the reservation two weeks in advance, and told them we'd be celebrating my parent's 50th anniversary so it'd be great if we could get a table by the window, but they said their seating was first come, first served. Fair enough. I thought maybe they'd be able to make an exception for a 50th anniversary, but I guess not. When we got there, I mentioned it was my parent's anniversary and again asked for a table by the window. They said they'd give us the best table they had, which ended up being a pretty crappy table in the middle of the floor. Wouldn't have been so bad had there not been another empty table right by the window, which remained empty for the first twenty minutes we were there. My parents felt very special.   In fact, the only things the staff did for their 50th anniversary was for the waiter to congratulate my parents, and then give them a tiny bowl of ice cream to share at the end of the meal. I'm not sure what I was expecting them to do for a 50th anniversary, but it was more than this. It was surprising and rather disappointing.   The food was just okay, and it was definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Pier W! Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. I made reservations last night for my husbands birthday, we were greeted with complimentary glasses of champagne and a table looking out over Lake Erie and downtown Cleveland! The ambiance here is unmatched. Their calamari is always perfectly seasoned and tender. The diver scallops are wonderful. And if you're able to save room for dessert, the peanut butter bomb is deliciously perfect. I'm already looking forward to my next meal at Pier W! Truly fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. First went for his birthday years ago, and the seafood is delicious. Now we stop by for their excellent happy hour for some discounted drinks and appetizers. The lobster bisque is to die for! Always great service and one of our favorite date spots."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I went during happy hour to grab some drinks and food a couple of weeks ago. The happy hour area was understandably very busy, which would have been fine, but the manager in charge of seating groups consistently let groups ahead of us go. We waited in line for about 40 minutes while groups totaling up to 15 people were seated before us. The manager made no apologies and we decided to leave in the end.   Wish I had the opportunity to test out the food, but based on the service I received, I will likely not be returning."}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite Seafood restaurant!  When you get Lobster Bisque that has the lobster meat in the bowl by itself, to where the waiter pours the bisque on top of the meat at your table, you knoooow that lobster is not going to be chewy and overcooked.  Gorgeous view of the lake and Downtown Cleveland, quality is always fantastic.  Their Sunday Brunch...THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: If you closed your eyes and ate without benefit of the view and ambiance, you'd want your cash back.  My husband and I are fairly new to Cleveland, and this place had gotten many favorable reviews so we headed there to celebrate a special occasion.  The ambiance is interesting, sort of 70's lounge goes to Ikea, and cozy bordering on cramped.  Throughout the meal staff frequently had to take shelter behind one side of our table or the other due to the narrow and busy aisle, so there was never really a sense of intimacy or privacy.  Staff were very friendly and we received excellent service overall- the waiter hustled to get a wine list to us (without being asked) after apps cleared so that we could place our drink order in time for the entrees, which was a thoughtful touch.  I've seen reviews calling the place very fancy, but I wouldn't go that far.  It's white table cloth sure, but definitely missing the little touches that make for truly \"fine dining.\"  The crowd contributed as well- there was a huge birthday party at the tables next to us and the entire evening was punctuated with flashes going off and cheesy pickup lines from the guys further down the aisle.  For the price point and the 5-star claims, you'd expect that they'd put parties like this in the private dining room down the hall.  Overall a warm, friendly, relaxed vibe that was just a bit too bustling for our tastes.  As far as food goes, we didn't love anything.  We had the appetizer sampler, which was a bust.  The bruschetta was topped with very cold, VERY balsamic-y tomatoes and a cream cheese type spread.  Not the refreshing, light dish you'd expect.  The four \"cajun\" shrimp were small and had little seasoning aside from salt and a buttery sauce which detracted from the freshness of the shrimp.  The crab cakes were average according to DH- I am not a crab cake fan and can't comment.    The short rib pierogies were the biggest disappointment.  They were overstuffed with strangely dry meat- surprising for short ribs, and the dough was very... doughy.    Main courses were grilled salmon and pork shoulder, which was highly recommended by the waiter (he actually steered me away from my original order because he claimed the pork was so much better).  I was really disappointed.  It consisted of really perfectly tender, nicely cooked pork on a bed of liquidy polenta surrounded by a thin broth.  Unfortunately the only two flavors were meat and salt.  The polenta was described as \"jalepeno bacon,\" but had no flavor beyond slight heat and more salt.  I was expecting fruity, spicy pepper and smoky bacon taste.   Way too heavy and not very interesting.  DH had grilled salmon which he thought was perfectly cooked but otherwise bland.  He spent the meal raving about the wilted spinach with garlic- it's a bad sign when that's the star of the show.    Desert- blueberry lemon Napolean and coconut ice cream sundae.  The ice cream was really good but the Napolean was awful.    Despite the unexciting food, we did have a nice evening here. The view is lovely, it's a very cool space, and the staff were quite friendly and professional.  We plan to try brunch, and maybe visit again once the menu has changed. Unfortunately at their price point you expect better, and there are only so many times you can give it another try."}
{"text":"Amazing simply sensational seafood & spectacular view. Have always had great servers full of recommendations and wine advice. Just really well done- a standard."}
{"text":"Ate here on Fourth of July.  Wonderful space. Their renovation makes the room warm and inviting. Very quiet. Great for conversation.  Bread,homemade hummus and wonderful butter. We had short rib pierogies crabcake oysters. Then surf and turf. Steak cooked beautifully lobster tail delish.  Scallops with goat cheese gnocci rich and tender. Had passion fruit/choc tart excellent ending.  Beautiful view.  We even saw Cleveland fireworks."}
{"text":"I mean. COMPLETELY IMPRESSED. The views, the drinks, the good, the service ..... YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO MAKE THIS A PLACE TO VISIT. Happy hour prices were reasonable. The food didn't make you feel like it was dipped in grease. COMPLETE QUALITY. Bartenders were friendly and attentive. Delish, delish, delish. Five stars over any place I have visited in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Sadly, lakefront dining is a rarity in Cleveland. I'm just happy that Pier W is so good. I'll admit that I was sad when the silly nautical kitsch and old-school charm of the old Pier W disappeared, but that nostalgia feels really stupid after a few years. The redesigned space and menu are splendid. The not-so-secret happy hour is a real bargain. The booze and food are excellent values. This new design allows almost everyone in the place - including at the bar - a spectacular view of the lake. The food and service are worthy of the view. It's pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"They have a Sunday happy hour! Half off most of their bar menu and select drinks. The lobster bisque was divine and the salmon burger was good.   The atmosphere is fabulous and with happy hour prices, you feel wonderful. I've been here for dinner too and it was great. Service had always been good and if you can get a seat near the windows to take in the lake view. Can't wait to try their popular brunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Pier W for my birthday dinner. He had made reservations for 9pm and because we had about an hour drive, we got there early (840pm). When we got there we checked in and the two little girls at the desk said \"we see your reservation for 9 but won't be able to seat you until closer to your reservation time. if you'd like to go check in at the bar and we'll come get you when your table is ready\". completely understandable, we went in early to go to the bar anyways, so to the bar we went. Fast forward to 910pm and we're still at the bar so my boyfriend asked the bartender  if he'd be able to check on our table and he comes back and tells us \"they have you down for a 915 reservation so it should only be a few minutes. ... hmmm. Interesting. how did our reservation mysteriously change? Very quickly, both our wine glasses were refilled at no charge and within 5 minutes we were taken to our table. my guess? little girls at the desk effed up and passed us over and management said \"make it right.\" The food was delicious. Lobster bisque was velvet and heaven but a little too salty for my liking, diver scallops were cooked perfectly, they cut like butter, but again, too salty for my liking and the fried agnolotti that was served with them was bland and very tough, asparagus was chewy. My boyfriend got the Bouillabaisse and had nothing but good things to say but he also said it was a little salty. We evidently don't care for salt. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is a combination of the service from the front and just the saltiness of the courses. It was delicious nonetheless. TRY THE LOBSTER BISQUE. next time, I'm ordering the scallops simply prepared."}
{"text":"Good bar service. Trendy decor. Nice to be by the water.  Piano player was excellent.  Gave 3 stars because the atmosphere is not very conducive to mingling...a bit cold."}
{"text":"My fiancé surprised me and took me to this place on my birthday.  When you first walk down to the restaurant the hostess was welcoming with a smile and brought us to our table quickly. My fiancé said that making a reservation was easy and a must.  There was a guy there entertaining al the guests with his piano skills which added to the intimate dining room.  The lights are dimmed and the service is phenomenal!  I ordered the lobster tails which was cooked to perfection!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants fine dining and a beautiful view of the city!"}
{"text":"Without flaw--even excluding the view!  I live in Maryland where the seafood is ultra fresh and I was impressed by the freshness of the oysters, the crab cake (appetizer) and the perfectly-executed and prepared wild salmon (medium rare) with braised spinach and potatoes.  The crab cake can hold its own with most Maryland renditions.  Service was also five-star (from Sam, I believe).  Also, I went here under the impression that it was going to be super-pricey and in my opinion, it was perfectly reasonable/expected for the level of food and service.  Will return when wanting seafood in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"loved this place! the price is pretty reasonable... food is great... the decoration is classy, modern, fantastic!  i asked for a table by the window and got there early for that, it's totally awesome... romantic! would definitely go back again if i am in town again!"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood restaurant with great views of Lake Erie and Cleveland.  Piano player was excellent--eclectic mix of tunes incl. The Piano Man, Little Wing, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Eleanor Rigby.  Great menu and wine list.  Dinner of scallops and boulebasse were delicious--fresh and flavorful, well presented.  Dessert peanut butter bomb was delicious.  Great wood trim and nautical details abound.  Patio excellent for chilling out before and after dinner.  As good as my favorite So Cal seafood restaurants (Like Poseidon's in Del Mar)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our one year anniversary and totally surprised me. We were able to get a table right by the window and the view was absolutely the BEST in Cleveland. It was close to a full moon that night so there was a beautiful reflection over the lake with the city in the background. I had never been to Pier W before and I assumed with such a beautiful view that the food would not be so good but it was outstanding! I had the scallops and they were cooked perfectly! I loved my experience here and cannot wait for another special occasion to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday, had reservations at 7. Very nice atmosphere, a bar area with a piano player and then a two layered dining rooms overlooking Lake Erie and Cleveland. Great view. Teri was our waitress, she was friendly, fun and helpful. We shared the Pierogies, they were awesome. Wish you got more then 3 because they aren't very big but great all the same. I got the filet, I always have them butterfly it and cook it medium well plus. It was spot on, full of flavor. My husband got the scallops, he said those were amazing too. Prices are pretty equal to other upscale restaurants. Will definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Ellen was knowledgeable and kind. Gently swaying me towards the scallops because they are absolutely one of a kind!    A creamy delicious bowl of lobster bisque and a fresh crisp chopped salad opened up the celebration lunch. My wife had the juicy and savory filet.   We had the Conundrum from their extensive wine selections. It was well balanced and exactly what my wife loves.   The server assistant, Timmy, was prompt with the water pitcher and swift with the plate removal.   The price is up there, but you are definitely getting a premier experience.  Outside of this specific experience we frequent their happy hour everyday from 4-7. Get their early to get seating because the prices are set for a serious gorging."}
{"text":"This review is for the weekend brunch and it was as amazing as the view (wow!), even for the pretty steep price. This is certainly a brunch restaurant you visit for the food instead of the booze. My wife and I visited Feb. 2017. Brunch is $40/person and comes with coffee and a complimentary glass of champagne or mimosa with the buffet. Ambiance is upscale and modern. Servers and staff are professional and what you would expect for a fine dining establishment. Atmosphere is complemented with a pianist playing near the buffet.  The food selections span the classics and some very nice additions to both breakfast and lunch options. I wish I could list everything! Such a selection!! Some of my favorites are the smoked salmon, sushi rolls, bouillabaisse, and roast beef. The classics are tasty and prepared well (except maybe the potatoes). Eggs/omelettes (made to order)/sausage/bacon potatoes Chicken and waffles are delicious and waffles are made on site next to the roast beef slicing station. A wide selection of seafood is beautifully presented and doesn't disappoint.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Scallop appetizer = Best I've ever had Duck entree= Excellent Peppermint cheesecake = pretty good Staff = Great Price = Acceptable (drinks expensive)"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area and not necessarily because of the food. They do have some of the best seafood anywhere but it is the service and ambiance that make this the #1 date spot in Norther Ohio. And well priced for fine dinning! Now if you go and expect Red Lobster prices... you will be surprised. Compared to the other fine dinning juggernauts the prices are pretty good!  In my book: The View #1 The Atmosphere #1 The Service #1 The food #3 The deserts #3 The Happy hour #1"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL restaurant in Lakewood overlooking Lake Erie. Come here for happy hour to get awesome deals on cocktails, wine/beer, and food! Happy hour starts at 5pm when they open for dinner, and when I got here by ~5:15, the bar area was already moderately packed so I would come early.   Atmosphere was lovely, especially at dusk when you can see the sun setting over the lake. I love the nautical decor inside the restaurant too. Service at the bar was great and very attentive.   As for the happy hour specials, I tried: - Calamari ($6.50) - very tender and crispy yet not too bread-y. It comes with both a sriracha aioli (which I loved) and a sweet spicy tamarind dip (a little too sweet for me).  - Mussels ($6) - mussels in a white wine broth with pieces of bacon. The mussels were pretty small but there were about 15-20 of them and the broth was delicious, so good deal for $6.  - Pomegranate martini - all the cocktails are $6 during happy hour. Pretty strong but still tasted great!  If I lived in Cleveland, I would definitely come here for happy hour all the time! Would love to try out their dinner menu for a special occasion too :)"}
{"text":"Really great ambience. Best calamari ever. Really really good. Surf and turf was good. You get a lobster tail with it and the options are that--options. Menu was a bit confusing on that. Service was good. The restaurant was about hard to find at night. It is behind the apartments and in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me for my birthday and they had menus that said 'happy birthday' which is a nice little touch. I had the trio of lamb which was out of this world and my boyfriend had the short ribs. We had cheesecake for dessert which might have been the best I ever had. The view is just so beautiful! Love it"}
{"text":"OVERALL: Come for the surf, stay and watch the turf. (at sunset)  Went here for an anniversary dinner with my sweety. We decided to go off the beaten path and order the chef's special which was a tour du cheese from the United States. It consisted of four courses and was very flavor full. The only taste of fish I had was from the entree. A glazed salmon of sorts with rhubarb and a blue cheese filled tomato. Very interesting. The entire dish was excellent.  Service wasn't what I expected. The server couldn't seem to time the dishes correctly, so we were left waiting for awkward amounts of time. Wine glasses were not taken away after we did not choose to have any. Silverware was FORGOTTEN for the beginning dish and not replaced for each dish. For $48 per person I expected a little more.  I hear they have a great happy hour and would like to check that out as well as brunch.  Dress was business casual.  The views of the city are breathtaking.  Total Bill minus tip was $103"}
{"text":"Pier W is by far one of the best Restaurants in the Cleveland area.  The view alone makes this place worth a visit, you really cant beat a location that hangs off a cliff.  The simple decor and piano really add to the atmosphere.  The food is fantastic, the dinner entrees are portioned perfectly, present nicely and taste fantastic, I really have never had anything at Pier W I didn't like.  The brunch is awesome just be sure to starve yourself prior to going so you have enough room to try everything.  The staff has always been kind and professional, I have had to modify my reservations several times and they have always been cooperative.  I really have nothing negative to say about Pier W at all anyone who is ever in a 100 mile radius of this place needs to try it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for FOREVER and finally had the chance when my manfriend's birthday came up last week. I made reservations via opentable for 6. I highly recommend making a reservation, whether it's by open table or calling it in.  Only downside is even if you make a reservation, window seats are first come first serve; however, it's kind hard to get a bad seat no matter where you are. The view is amazing.  I can only imagine how awesome it was during Hurricane Sandy, to which our server told us the waves were reaching up and hitting the windows.  Going back to the reservation thing though--so we ended up showing up at 5:30 because I really wanted a good seat.  The bar area was very busy, as people were there for happy hour and happy hour is only in the bar.  There were a lot of empty tables, maybe only 1 window seat left. The hostess said she had to ask if it was ok to seat us...I thought this was very strange, it's not like we were two hours early and the place was packed, but she ended up seating us right away.  She made a comment that a lot of people were stuck in traffic on the shoreway, so they were late for their reservations.  Initially I liked our waiter, but by the end of the dinner I thought he could have been WAY more personable.  He seemed somewhat annoyed and was hard to joke around with. He asked if we were there for a special occasion, we told him for a birthday, so at the end we did end up getting two chocolate chip cookies with a piece of white chocolate that said \"happy birthday.\"  They were good.  I ordered the airplane amish chicken.  It was good. Not to die for, but good. When I got a piece of chicken with the spinach and tomato on it, it was even better. My date ordered the tuna, which we were told was flown in from Hawaii the day before.  Sounds impressive? Yes. He said it was good (I didn't even bother trying it because I STRONGLY dislike seafood), but needed salt and pepper on it before it was seared.  Him being a chef, I trust his opinion.  We also ordered a cheese board which was relatively good as well-they didn't hit anything out of the ballpark, but definitely no complaints.  They had a piano player there which just added such a nice element to the atmosphere. He was very appreciative for the tip we gave him which was nice too.  You can also go valet there, which is $4. They give you a ticket and you give it to your waiter and they just add it to your bill.  I need to mention that they had a single (real) flower in a vase on every table which was simple enough to add a lot of elegance.  This is a REALLY nice and fancy place, but with the price tag on the food, it's somewhere I can go only on special occasions."}
{"text":"My self and family just returned home after Sunday brunch, we were a party of five. I travel extensively with my job and have the opportunity to dine at some very nice establishments. As far as the actual brunch goes I would give it between three to four stars. The selection itself was nice however some items were lacking in taste . I would say it was your standard brunch quality, nothing really stood out. The wait staff was a bit lacking as well.....very slow at clearing the table as well as attention to the patrons after being seated. I think one of the problems was the lack of space. Perhaps omitting one or two tables and rearranging the floor would lend to a better traffic flow for both the diners as well as the wait staff.      About the space itself......beautiful location. A really great place to enjoy a nice meal with a really nice view. Perhaps the dinner is what makes this place and it's reputation to visit. I'd  say at forty dollars for brunch......your really paying for the location and view......the actual brunch......meh.....it's  ok."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. I highly recommend stopping in for their happy hour during the week. They have all sorts of delicious food specials plus a wide array of drink deals, \"The Pier W\" being my favorite. As far as the food goes do not leave without trying their lobster bisque, it is incredibly rich and filling in itself. For dinner you must try the  Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna, always cooked to perfection and so dense and juicy much like a fine cut of filet. Service is always exceptional especially with how busy they get. And on the weekend they even have a live pianist, who is always willing to take a request. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pier W and am only reviewing the brunch. Let's start with the fact that it was the best brunch I've ever had. Reserved a table for 10 about a week in advance, large party meant later dining time. Our waitress and all assisting staff were very attentive, took our dirty dishes quickly and replaced silverware between each trip to the buffet. Very large selection of breakfast and lunch foods and enormous dessert section. All of the foods I had were very good and the whole buffet setup was clean and looked fab. You get one glass of champagne or a mimosa included in the cost of the brunch. Do I think the cost is pricey, yes...BUT, you definitely get your money's worth and the location over lovely Lake Erie can't be topped.  Would definitely go there again, but for a nice dinner in the summer with my husband."}
{"text":"I've been here several times: restaurant week, dinner, lunch, and happy hour. Each time I go I appreciate it more. The food is always outstanding, drinks are delicious, and the service is excellent. Make sure to make a reservation if you want a window seat. The view of the city is stellar."}
{"text":"Pier W is exquisite and my go-to recommendation for a 5-star all-around dining experience in Cleveland.    My former job required giving dinner presentations, and after trying several upscale restaurants in the metro Cleveland area, I decided that Pier W was my go-to restaurant to ensure a great dining experience for all.    For starters, you cannot beat the view, as other reviewers have stated.  The location is perfect for enjoying views of the Cleveland skyline and of Lake Erie.  When I think about the things I enjoyed about living in the CLE before, its both the lake and the view of the city from the west side, particularly Pier W, that I think of.    Service is impeccable.  I dined here both as a host for presentations and as a \"normal\" person, and the staff never missed a beat either time.  When I hosted presentations, no detail was left unattended to, from ensuring I had the media setup I needed, to refilling the guests' drinks and clearing plates as they finished their meals.  I later brought some friends here when they visited and was impressed with both the warmth and professionalism of the waitstaff.  My friends still talk about our dinner at Pier W and have stated how they hope I move back so they can visit me and go to Pier W again!    Most importantly, the food is out of this world.  It's always fresh, prepared to perfection, and presented like a work of art.  I used to feel bad about taking my first bite of anything here because it ruined the masterpiece on my plate.  Still, take my advice and throw restraint to the wind, because the food tastes even better than it looks!    If you're looking for the best of steak and seafood in the Cleveland area with an ambience that is par excellence, look no further than Pier W!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday and my husband stopped at the front desk to make sure they knew despite making the reservation with the note that it was a birthday, and they assured us our waitress knew and it was taken care of. However, the waitress never did anything special. We watched as the table next to us received plates with the words happy birthday written on it and a cupcake while my birthday was completely overlooked. The service overall was not what I would expect from this nice of a restaurant. She was not attentive stopping by to see if we needed anything or if everything was as we liked. She was not friendly either. The water girl came more often. She never came by to see if we needed more drinks in the middle of the meal. The butter was cold because the candle had a low flame but I was unable to get her attention because she was never around. The hostess was unfriendly and had an attitude. There was no valet. I had the two lobster tail special and my husband has the Cajun pasta with seafood. He thought the pasta was good and my lobster tails were cooked nicely. So overall we were satisfied with the food but the service and overall friendliness of the staff was poor. We would try another place for a special occasion next time."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing experience my wife and I had at Pier W. I brought my wife here for her birthday this past weekend, and the staff and management went above and beyond to make this an unforgettable night for us. I made a reservation about 4 days prior, and requested a window seat (however, the window seating is not guaranteed, but first-come first-serve basis). When we arrived, we got a regular booth, but as soon as we sat down, the manager came over to our table to told us that a window table just opened up and that we were welcome to change, so of course we did! What a great table we got too, with a fantastic backdrop of Lake Erie and the downtown Cleveland cityscape.  The food was fantastic as well. My wife ordered Calamari fritti appetizer and the Shrimp Stuffed Crab (or something similar) and I ordered the Black Trumpet Mushroom Puff Pastry and the Vegetarian Taster plate. We also had a bottle of Etoile Rose sparkling wine.  The location, decor, food, and staff were all amazing. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to celebrate our first fancy night out since our wedding. Arrived....didn't have our reservation and said they were having system issues. We ordered their restaurant week menu, and oysters. No oysters ever arrived at our table. They messed up our bill, and took them 30 minutes to fix and give back to us. Then we asked to take our name out of the system and the manager didn't even ask why we wanted that when we left. They clearly don't care about their customers or their experience. Never going back."}
{"text":"Finally, a nice place I can take my vegetarian gf that doesn't charge $22 for a bowl of vegetables.  Pier W actually has their own vegetarian menu! I myself eat fish but she really enjoyed the pumpkin gnocchi and veggie burger too.   and Probably the best scallops I've ever had.  great ambiance and view of downtown, excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"I am not one to write a bad review, however this experience is worth the rant. Last nights dinner was disappointment to say the least! We went on a Tuesday night (Halloween) so it was not overly crowded.  Our waiter (Daniel) immediately asked us about drinks, I was on the fence and when I finally decided not to get a drink it was clear he was disappointed. I got the lobster bisque which was watery (not a good thick bisque like I was expecting). My boyfriend ordered the calamari and a drink (which were both excellent). Once our entrees were order it took 50 minutes to get our food. Our waiter (Daniel) was clearly paying more attention to his tables that were ordering multiple drinks. I found this incredibly rude; he was absent for most of our meal, and we had dirty plates just sitting on our table between courses. For a $150+ dollar meal I would say it wasn't worth it. I would have expects quality service for the price. I would not recommend wasting your time here, the quality of service is sub-par."}
{"text":"Best view in town. Nothing impressive in the menu. Service is great. This place makes me feel like I'm some other place than Cleveland"}
{"text":"**Happy hour review**  This is easily one of the best happy hours in Cleveland, so why did I just recently discover it?!? We ducked in around four and by 4:45 the bar was packed, so the secret is out about this place. The atmosphere at the bar seems more modern than the rest of the restaurant and the views are just great. Wines are on average $2 off, but you are really coming here for the happy hour food specials.   We started with the gulf shrimp tempura, it comes with three large shrimp and tempura asparagus and was a great starter, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The lobster bisque was the star here, and the presentation is great. I loved my Atlantic cod sandwich while my boyfriend said his salmon burger was way better, I disagree but we will rehash that another time.   Good news, because of this happy hour, Pier W isn't just for special occasions anymore!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal and a great time at this lovely seafood oriented place.  Views are fabulous, right over Lake Erie, and food is varied and interesting and tasty.  Decent wine list.  My only gripe is that our young college-age waiter was completely clueless about wine and couldn't make even a half-hearted recommendation, nor did he offer to find someone on the staff who could."}
{"text":"Okay this is the second time that /i have ben here in the last 60 days and I must say that this a great Happy hour and food. Bartender and staff very attentive and the people were very friendly. Had the Jumbo Shrimp Tempura and a Ceaser Salad very good."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Cleveland. Deals include: $5.75 wine and specialty drinks, 20% off liquor and half-priced food items from the bar menu. The night I went the bar was full; however, the hostess allowed us to sit an overflow seating (the rest of the restaurant) as long as we left by 7 because table reservations began at that time. This provided us with a better view of the lake than what would normally be see from the bar. The drinks were good and the food was excellent. The bar menu provided an acceptable variety of options to choose from. Overall a must try spot for happy hour."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'd never been here before. Love the nautical decor and gorgeous aquarium when you come in. There are a lot of nice restaurants in Cleveland where you'll pay these kind of prices. But there is no where else where you'll get what Pier W offers. From views, to ambiance, to service, to beautiful selection of perfectly cooked entrees. We started with oysters, then I had bouillabaisse which was served in a cast iron bowl and stayed warm throughout the meal, it was seasoned with saffron and I would get it again but there are so many other items I want to try (like the pistachio crusted trout). Wife had the shrimp and scallop linguine which came with a light Cajun sauce. It was flavorful but not heavy handed. It was her birthday and they brought chocolate covered strawberries. Nice touch."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going here to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, or just a great dinner.   The food is always delicious.  We love to get the Short Rib Pierogies as an appetizer and always a steak for dinner.  The Lobster Tail is always fresh and tastes delicious. Would highly recommend this place over and over again."}
{"text":"Beautiful, Classy place with decent prices for such glamourous surroundings and views. Food and drinks were delicious! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Family Celebration, best brunch and awesome service and views!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pier W twice, and ordered the same meal because the first time I ate it it was the absolute best salmon I've ever eaten in my life. I was NOT disappointed!  Location: Beautiful. The view of the pier is breathtaking, excellent for romantic dining.   Service: Fantastic! I ate at the bar the second time, and the service was friendly, quick, and informative. There was a disparity on my bill and the menu, and the server escalated the issue to the manager quickly. He apologized and adjusted without question.   Food: As I said, the ABSOLUTE BEST salmon I've ever eaten in my life. I order fish often. Pier W uses Sushi-grade salmon, which allows you to order it in the same way you would a steak. I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon, cooked Medium Rare. It was delicate, buttery, and absolutely delicious.   Conclusion: I make sure that on every trip to Cleveland I will make a stop at this place. It's an all around fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Simply and truly phenomenal restaurant specializing in seafood. I had the Hawaiian grill big eye tuna and my wife had a special almond crusted mahi-mahi. Both were some of the best dishes we ever had. As good as diner was, and it was great, the clam chowder may have stolen the show. Simply, it was the best clam chowder I ever had. I wish I lived close to the place or perhaps I am glad I don't.... in a good way."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Cleveland area!!!! Amazing view and food! Ask for Amos for you waiter, he is excellent, very friendly, knows what to pick from the menu and is very professional. Lobster bisque is highly recommended as well as oysters, calamari, surf and turf and any desserts. This place is my favorite place to go to. You have to make a reservation and ask to have a window table. Defiantly a 5 star restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time recently and it didn't disappoint. It's upscale for sure, white linen tablecloths and all, but there's no snobby feel at all. Everyone was super nice, waitress was right there when we needed her without being overbearing. From the beautiful view- we didn't get a window table but even from one table over the huge windows provide a great view- to the awesome food, I'm really at a loss to find anything bad to say about Pier W. Yes it's a bit pricey, but for a special occasion I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at this restaurant several times and have enjoyed everything about the meal every time. The service is always top notch, which we expect at all restaurants. Our water is always full and they readily take away dirty dishes. I had the clam chowder tonight and I have to say this was the best I have ever had. The soup was not too creamy or thick. Also, it had a good amount of clams and not too many potatoes. Then for the main course I had the Pier W bouillabaisse. This was an amazing dish! It had tuna, clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops, and various vegetables in a vegetable broth. Once again, this dish was very generous with all of the seafood provided and had really good flavor overall.  Lastly, for dessert I had the peanut butter bombe. The chocolate shell provided a great tasting crunch to contrast the creaminess of the peanut butter mousse. This is always an enjoyable experience as the restaurant has a great interior, an awesome view overlooking downtown Cleveland across Lake Erie, and a great meal! A must try in Cleveland, Ohio."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. I was so excited because I've always heard great things from my friends in Lakewood who frequent this restaurant.  Lets just say I do not think I could have been more pleased. This was the best birthday dinner I've had in years!  Our table was ready when we arrived and it was completely packed. Our waitress was very helpful in selecting our bottle of wine.   We started with some fresh oysters which were delish! For my entree, I had the bay sea scallops with the potato gnocchi, talk about absolutely amazing!! Boyfriend ordered the Atlantic salmon and absolutely loved that as well.    I will absolutely return in hopes of eating those scallops with gnocchi again! My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the great reviews. I was there with a party of 4 for Sunday brunch. Made the reservations 7 weeks in advance. And wait an extra 15 minutes just to get the worst table in the restaurant.   For the price of $40 the selection was average. Very little in the way of salads or vegetables. The only meat other than breakfast food was Thai chicken and \"prime rib\" that needed a steak knife to cut.   The service was subpar too. Had to request additional coffee or drinks.   Unless you live on the west side, just go to the Blue Canyon for their brunch."}
{"text":"Pier W is an incredible dinner place. Never have I had a bad experience when going there after five. However, today, we decided to go for a nice easy birthday lunch and it was a completely different story.   The lunch menu is nice and simple, not overpriced and provides a lot of options in terms of seafood (what they're known for). I got something I usually get at dinner too: the clam chowder. Pier W is the BEST place for clam chowder in all of Cleveland.   However, for my entree, I got the swordfish special and received what looked like an ounce of fish and a ton of greasy, fried green beans. A little bit disappointing.   The waitress was the worst part of the meal. She took forever to get to our table. I ordered a lemonade and asked for a refill. At the end, when looking over the check, I asked her if someone else ordered a lemonade because we were charged twice. She said no, that refills cost extra and she told me when I asked. She never told me and lied to my face, which was really not okay.   This restaurant is overall incredible. It's a great, slightly old school atmosphere with pretty good food. I won't stop going based on one bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is a stalwart in Lakewood and if you haven't been there since the re-decorating, you need to check it out; this is not your grandparents Pier W. While the menu is still consistent with the best seafood found in Cleveland, it also offers a simple selection of seafood broiled or seared in olive oil. I had the crab stuffed shrimp with bok choy and Yukon gold mashed. We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir for the table on the recommendation of our server, Amos, and it did not disappoint, the same is true with the desserts he recommended. While drinks are pricey-a round for 4 was nearly $50 with tip-the atmosphere, quality, and service, not to mention the phenom always skyline view of downtown, are worth it!"}
{"text":"Very small portions... Very limited choice...Totally disappointing.. And then guess what! It was my husbands birthday and I told them about it. Waitress said she will make sure she will do some thing special!! She brought the dessert menu and I chose peanut cake... Guess what she had for him!!! An \"edible Happy Birthday plaque\" on top of the peanut cake I had ordered.  And I thought to my self, well, may be its their policy not to do any thing... But when she brought the check.. OMG.. Reallyy?!?! The last item on check was: \"B-day plate .. 0.00$\" And the waitress said its for the edible plaque!! I was wordless!!"}
{"text":"The view is great. The restaurant is built over a cliff that lets you see Lake Erie and downtown Cleveland. The food is delicious. Look to spend about 30 per person for a meal. A little pricey but I'd say it's worth the money. You won't find another place with great view AND great food in any other place in Cleveland.  Great place for special occasions.  From what I've tried,  Appetizers: the lobster bisque and beef short rib pierogies were excellent.  Entrees: their seafood dishes are good"}
{"text":"Just went to Pier W for first time to celebrate anniversary. Wonderful experience that I highly recommend for special occasions. I figure if you're gonna splurge, splurge! so I got the surf and turf. Filet mignon perfectly prepared and delicious, lobster tail, excellent twice-baked potato. No complaints at all. My wife got the seared Georges Bank Diver scallops (Jamaican-themed) and loved them. Only regret is that we didn't get to try the bouillabaisse--guess I'll have to go back! Only thing I'd change about our order is I wouldn't get the crab cakes appetizer again. They were delicious, but you only get two very small ones for $13. I know I'm contradicting myself about splurging and we don't regret trying them, just giving a heads-up. Oh, the service was perfect, décor inviting, and a view that's hard to top in NE Ohio. Can't really go wrong here if you're ready to spend more than one typically does when dining out (which we should all do from time to time). Only thing that topped the restaurant was my dining partner--happy 19 years!"}
{"text":"This review is for the happy hour only. So that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. I'm basically obsessed with this happy and try to go any chance I get to get out of work at an early enough time. By far my favorite happy hour in the city. The food deals are even better than the drink specials! My favorite menu option has got to be the calamari. Trust me, one order won't be enough. The salmon burger is really good as well. The bun is excellent, but I generally skip it so I don't have to waste space on it! The menu is that good! The only thing I have tried that I didn't care for were the pirogies. As far as drinks, the basil martini is a must. Enjoy! The happy hour starts at 4 so get there early to get a good spot. The only negative about this happy hour is that basically all of the seating faces away from the gorgeous lake view! But if you come for dinner, the main dining area offers an excellent view of the lake and the city in the distance."}
{"text":"Treated the in-laws and wife to Pier-W for on a recent evening and we very much enjoyed ourselves.  We all ordered white fish and Swiss chard, which seemed to be the special of the evening.  This night's weather was stormy, which is a stark contrast to the sunny visits I've had in the past.  The stormy weather and choppy waters of Lake Erie were still beautiful in their own way.  The restaurant was packed!    I asked the maître d' if he would take my father-in-law and I into their reputable wine cellar and he cordially agreed.  He showed us some of their most expensive bottles from France and California - $4,500 each!  They are on Wine Spectator's list of preferred restaurants too.  I do not remember the wine we drank, but it was delicious and paired well with our meals.  My father in-law ordered a 30-year-old port wine at the end of the meal, which I thought tasted dull.  I knew it was going to be a pricey meal, but how often do we get to enjoy a fine meal at a fine restaurant with family?  Not often enough.  It was a great night and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Cedar plank salmon was good.  The side of swiss chard seemed to be gritty, and paired with new potatoes which were also bland. Caipirinha was great. Service was ok, just not as inviting as I'd like. View is great! If you want to sit at the bar, arrive at 4 or 5 because the happy hour specials draw a crowd which will keep you waiting for a seat. Gluten free friendly."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, five stars for the view.  We went here during restaurant week a few weeks ago, and I was blown away by the view. What? There's a restaurant with a great view here? It's nice- strangely, it's right by an apartment complex in Lakewood, and you go down these stairs, past an aquarium, and into a nice open area, with big windows overlooking the lake and downtown. Quite a nice date place to go to, in the evening.  It's a typical seafood/nicer food place to go to. Not the most amazing seafood, but we're in the midwest, so it was pretty good.   For appetizers, we got the autumn greens salad (eh, alright- just salad), and the short rib pierogies. Mmmm. Those pierogies were good!  For entrees, I ordered the Cobia- kind of a more fattier fish, which I thought it was great. I simply kind of ordered it for the sake of its name- but hey, nonetheless, it was good. He ordered the pork shoulder...which I thought was kind of salty. The polenta around it was good.  For dessert, we got the sorbet, which was good as well.  I think I just like the view of this place more....more than the restaurant itself. :P Afterwards, we went on the outdoor...deck? and overlooked the lake and the city...  So it's a great date place if you're trying to impress her with your solid food choices and a great view of the city!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has its advantage for its location - right on a beach and you will be able to see the cleveland skyline and the lake - reminds me of Salty's in seattle.  We went there for lunch because it's cheaper and less busy - and the food was very mediocre. I ordered walleye and it was nothing special. There's no complexity to its flavor and tasted rather fishy - they didn't cover the fishy smell well. It was appropriately cooked tho - not overdone or undercooked. It was just rather plain. For the amount of money that i paid, I expected something better than just a simple dish. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice and classy. Waitress was nice. I heard better things at night tho, so I might go there again to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"What a perfect dining experience. I went here for my birthday and couldn't begin to muster a complaint if you paid me.   The view is impeccable. My boyfriend and I sat facing the lake and were able to watch the sun set. Once it's dark, you can see the lights from the city. Quite lovely.  I can't vouch for the entire menu but the Amish Chicken Breast, NY Strip Steak, Crab Stuffed Gulf White Shrimp, and Seared Crab Cakes we're delicious. As was the Peanut Butter Bombe dessert. Highly recommend!  The bar also has a great vibe so we look forward to returning soon to try more delicious eats and take in the great view."}
{"text":"Sorry for the delay. This review of Pier W is from a Sunday Brunch on Jan.15th 2017. I have not been before so it was a special Sunday Brunch for us as it was my wife's birthday. I have made reservations (absolutely necessary) a month in advance for a party of 5. The location is easy to get to and the location by the Lake Erie is wonderful. Our particular day in January was overcast and cold but we did get some great pictures of the Cleveland sky line. On entering there is a flight of stairs, but an elevator is available for those who need it. I also don't find the place wheel chair accessible as the seating has levels and the buffet tables are high. On our arrival we checked in and were seated relatively soon. The wait with a reservation was roughly 15 minutes, however, they seated us right by the rear most windows of the restaurant and the view was awesome! I didn't request this beautiful window seat, so it was a real gift to get this seating. We loved the view. The buffet has a wonderful array of choices. Breads, cheese's, meats, fish, pastas, salads, fruit, sweets and countless other options. Drinks are extra, but they do provide a one time only Mimosa. The food is what you would expect from such a nice place. It was great. Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of the buffet, now I wish I did. It was not cheap, but I have spent that kind of money on buffet's at casino's and they are nothing like this. We will be back. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"We went to check out Pier W's happy hour on a Tuesday, and weren't disappointed!  We split the clam chowder, salmon blt, and the mahi mahi tacos.  The clam chowder was great, but the salmon blt was amazing!  Nice grilled salmon with bacon and a mayo sauce on a challah bun.  Yum!  The only disappointment was the taco dish.  Was there fish?    For drinks I ordered the cucumber lemonade vodka, which was refreshingly cucumbery, and my dining companion ordered The Pier W, which was a little underwhelming.  Overall: Cleveland's best date restaurant on the lake.  Expertly prepared seafood in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic seafood restaurant with a fabulous view overlooking Lake Erie. Each dish was succulent and well worth price. Will definitely come back when in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Awesome perogies appetizer! The view is also amazing- if you can manage to get a table near the window. Just don't go during peak dining hours!Drinks are expensive but the food is so good it's worth the money. I'll pay anything for a really good filet. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had  a delightful birthday dinner for my dad here. The food was pretty fab as was the service. However, we came too late in the day and the sun set on the day and the view. And there are only certain tables you can see the city from. But pretty delightful overall!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best happy hour I've been to. They have such great deals! The price is great and the portion is perfect. Wines that have a star next to them are $6, the bar menu is half off, except for the tacos, and the cocktails are $6 as well. The atmosphere, minus the off green light, was really cool. The bar area is quite spacious so no worries about not finding a space for happy hour. The crowd was mostly early 40 and up.   My boyfriend and I tried a handful of dishes since the price was great. The clam chowder was a huge huge huge disappointment. It had a stinky fishy taste. When you think of chowder you think CHOWDA. I mean thick soup. This \"chowder\" was thin. the potatoes looked oddly grey. As if they came out of a can. The clam was sub par. It was quite chewy. I would NEVER order this again. I'd stick to panera bread clam chowder.   The caesar salad was good. Nothing special.   The calamari was really fresh but extremely oily. The greasiness almost made me gag. The dipping sauces were just ok. It came with sriracha aioli and this tamarind sauce. The calamari was really tender, which I appreciated.   Their tempura cod sandwich was awesome. Probably the best cod sandwich I've had. It had a huge piece of fish with a tasty slaw and thick texas toast. It was hard to eat but still really good. I wish the chips that came with the dish was salt and vinegar flavored. It would have went well with the dish.   My boyfriend got the salmon burger which was good. I thought the burger was a little under cooked. It still had some raw portions. Overall flavor was good. I would go back again since the happy hour deal is so awesome.   We had their red delicious cocktail, cosmopolitan, and a riesling. They do not skimp on the alcohol. The cocktails were strong and delicious."}
{"text":"A delightful evening on 1/6/17.  We had the best real estate in the building, right on the eastern end, overlooking downtown.   Sam, our waiter, treated us exceptionally well, offering attention to every detail, right down to the dirty martini with bleu cheese olives, poured table side.   Not only was the service fabulous, each of our meals were wonderful too! Grouper, swordfish, scallops and of course the lobster bisque and clam chowder were all well received by our table of happy diners.  The location, Sam and fine food made it an evening to remember! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pier W is a lovely spot for happy hour, girls night or date night. Why do I keep coming here on dreadfully cold days?  The restaurant offers such a spectacular view and patio and I woefully never take advantage of it! Thankfully, I plan to be back.  Happy Hour is a great value. Excellent, expansive menu to choose from and the selections are filling and priced reasonably. When you can get exceptionally high-quality food affordably--- that's the American dream, isn't it? It's not? Whatever.  My friend and I shared a Caesar salad, Angus Reserve Sliders, Beef Short Rib Pierogies, and a Margherita Pizza. It was plenty of food, nearly half priced and delicious. I especially loved the sliders. The beef was juicy and melty and flavorful.  I've never been particularly impressed with the service at Pier W and that's a little disappointing. I've never had a poor experience, but with an establishment as well-run as Pier W I truly have come to expect OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Pier W.  You know how to do it right!  First time here and the reviews were good (thanks fellow yelpers), so took my better half out for birthday dinner. Good sign to start with was a full parking and fortunately we got the last spot. Interesting entrance with a glass elevator with aquarium to view on back side. There is also a terrace up top for drinks over looking Lake Erie and the Cleveland cityscape.   We were welcomed once off the elevator and taken to our seats. Nice bar area with piano player that can be heard throughout the restaurant. He was pretty good. We had a nice view overlooking the lower dinning area and out the large windows. Great view.   Terri was our waitress and was very good. She took good care of us and made suggestions for dinner options. We ordered drinks then an appetizer the short rib pirogi. This was good but only get 3. My bride got one of the specialty cocktails and I the IPA from Columbus Brewery, IPA always one of my favorites.   Time for dinner and my wife chose the 7oz Filet. It was cooked to perfection at medium well plus. Amazing some places have no idea when you say the \"plus\" how to cook it. She was able to swap out the standard side too for the carrot broccoli medley. I went with one of Terri's suggestions, the scallops. These had Jamaican seasoning, pineapple salsa, plantain and sweet potatoes wedges. This has a slight spice and was very good. We were both completely satisfied with our meals.   Dessert we chose the peach cake with peach ice cream to split. Was pretty good. Terri also brought my wife a birthday cup cake of red velvet cake also good.   If you can't tell, overall we were very pleased with our dining experience and would recommend. The price for what we got, 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees and 1 dessert with great service and awesome views, I though was right in line."}
{"text":"Just finished a Sunday brunch and I have to say - so good! The view was spectacular and the food was some of the best I've had in Cleveland.  The food fell more on the side of lunch than on breakfast, with carving stations, the most delicious fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of eating, cajun shrimp, and mac & cheese.  For the breakfast lovers there was creme brulee french toast, omelets, eggs benedict and waffles.  You get complimentary champagne or a mimosa with your buffet order and the dessert menu was a.maz.ing. Really.  If I could eat that bread pudding every day, my life would be complete.  It's a fancy brunch - with a piano player and a bunch of older folks in their Sunday best, so if you're looking for hip and trendy - it's not here on Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"Is it perfect?  It's pretty darn close to perfect.  Sure, but is it perfect?  I mean, it's like really, really close.   The restaurant is upscale and modern.  It's not stuffy.  You don't have to worry about feeling out of place.  The bar is large, and seemingly always filled.  This visit, Pier W had a piano player to set the ambience.  The view is what everything knows about, and it doesn't disappoint.  However, not all of the tables give you a view of downtown CLE, so request this ahead of time or wait longer if you really want to impress.   The menu has all of the appetizers, seafood, and meats you could want.  Obviously, seafood is their specialty and it shows.  Mussels, best I've had, for a good price.  Oysters are fresh and prepared with a side of cocktail sauce, which could use a bit more horseradish.   The group went with 1) Big Eye Tuna, 2) pistachio encrusted trout, 3) tempura walleye, and 4) the simply prepared pan seared walleye.  Of the 4, the tempura walleye was the most disappointing, yet still delicious.  Tempura batter overpowered the fish, but the side of soy brought some flavor out.  The other 3 were outstanding, with the pistachio encrusted trout being the best, and the tuna would have been up there if not for the half portion of fish.  Still, all very good and what you would expect.  So was it perfect? No, but it's still the best seafood spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"When I was young, my family would come to Pier W and Swingos for brunch when there were important goings on. I have not been to Pier W in quite some time. I usually go to Pier Z (Lake House Cafe) as it is more budget friendly with the same view. Pier W is definitely more of a special occasion type of place. I would not say a first date place because if you are honest with yourself, a first date is not worth spending a truck load of money on. At least in my world. Respect needs to be gained. You could be breaking bread one day and a stranger the next. There is an extremely fickle populous on planet Earth. This is the Age of Aquarius and waterside dining does seem appropriate. First dates are best reserved for the Lido. Then you can gauge commitment and if they are truly down to ride or die. The happy hour is one of the best in the city. Seating can be tight so try to arrive early."}
{"text":"As always, Pier W is such a fantastic restaurant! I was in this weekend with a large group, they were very accommodating. We waited in the bar area with drinks to be seated. The bartenders were very good getting us drinks in a timely manner.   After being seated we took in the amazing view of the City lights and Lake from our table. Its the perfect atmosphere for family dining or even better date night.  I had the Pan Roasted Blue Cod w/ Lobster Mash and Lobster Coulis. It was spectacular! Cooked perfectly, and the Lobster Mash should be a controlled substance, no joke!! Everyone in our party (12th total) were very satisfied.  The waiters was very good and quick with everything we needed. Of course I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Love taking visitors to Cleveland here.  The food is fabulous.  Save room for dessert (crime brûlée)."}
{"text":"Loved the happy hour though our server forgot to place our order and it took longer than expected ~ comped us one item without our having to voice our dismay. That seemed appropriately considerate. The bar is rowdy at happy hour and then a pianist arrives so the dBs get pretty intense in the relatively small space.   We'd moved to a dining table before it had gotten too loud and it almost felt like we were on a different planet from the bar! It's a striking contrast migrating from the dark and loud bar area to the well-lit, quiet dining room dressed in white table cloths accented with blue glasses & a yellow mum on each tabletop. The prices change as well as I'm sure you'd be aware.    Don't let that stop you though! The entrees looked wonderful. We began with the \"Seafood Tower\" (only 2 of us) and that's where it ended as well. Between happy hour (lobster bisque, clam chowder & calamari plus cocktails) and the tower ~ we couldn't eat any more! We even took home some of the tower.   Our service was perfect at the table and I'm looking forward to heading back next time for a proper dinner! I'm all set for the Jumbo Georges Bank Diver Scallops. That's if I make it out of happy hour with any room left because I'm also set on another serving of calamari & the Salmon BLT as so many others recommended!   PS - enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"Upscale and modern just as a lot of the reviews say it is! I've gone here twice and have always beeen happy. The last visit being 2 weeks  ago. The prices are not bad considering how \"classy\" the restaurant is. The music (piano played) is a nice touch, the food is great (Salmon Burger is to die for) and the waiters and waitresses are equally helpful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The view was beautiful! & Service was great! Will definitely return..."}
{"text":"I've been for brunch, but never for dinner before so during Cleveland Independent's Restaurant Week I gave dinner a try.   I would definitely try dinner again outside of restaurant week. Sunday through Tuesday there are select bottles of wine at 30% off. There is also a section of the menu with about half a dozen fish that are \"simply prepared:\" lemon infused olive oil, rosemary potatoes, Brussels sprouts and butternut squash.   The Restaurant Week menu seemed to contain items not on the regular menu. I ordered a calamari appetizer which I was drawn to because the calamari were sautéed and not fried, which is a bit of a hard thing to find I think. The broth the calamari were in was mild, but good.   For dinner I got a Scallop/Crab Duo. I was slightly disappointed in my entrée. The scallops could have been a bit warmer and the portion was small and not proportion to the size of the entrée my friend got. I had three small scallops with a cold pineapple sauce. The crab was in the form of a cold crab salad. My friend's lamb dish had some delicious fruit sauce over it. The lamb was boneless, almost pulled and came with whipped potatoes.   The dessert was pretty amazing and I would actually get a taste for just that. I ordered Baklava Cake. Baklava Cake turned out to be lighter and less honey drenched than actual Baklava. It had a fig reduction on top and whole figs as well and was really light, not too sweet and of a decent portion.  The lower level of the restaurant was completely full. Our server was busy, but friendly. Though the kitchen seemed to take a long time. Dinner clocked in at just about 2 hours, which isn't unusual, but the pacing felt a bit slow. Regardless, I look forward to another dinner soon and of course brunch."}
{"text":"Well, it was 4th of July (2015) weekend, which was subsequently also my birthday. My husband surprised me with a get-a-way to the Cleveland Zoo (we are from Dayton) and a very nice dinner to Pier W. Coming from California, I expected Pier W to have at least the same quality of service and food as I would typically get at locations such as Mastro's Steakhouse in Los Angeles. However, I was certainly disappointed. Although our waitress always had a smile on her face and was very pleasant to speak with, we hardly ever saw her. The manager and even the buss staff were who we saw predominantly and assisted us in the procurement of beverages and even tracking down our check. Now I understand it was a busy night, and this is also the reason why they didn't get 1 star.   Moving on to the food. As an appetizer we ordered crab cakes, and although it did not have a bad or distasteful flavor it was not of a quality I would have expected from such a high priced restaurant. Too much onion to really even taste the crab.  Salads. I ordered a very basic caesar salad; the dressing was more than on target, lettuce was fresh, but the croutons tasted as if they had been left in open air for a good week. They were chewy, signifying their stale state. Furthermore, they had no flavor so it added nothing to the salad. My husband ordered the beet salad and to be completed honest his watermelon did not seem to be macerated with any recognizable flavor; actually it seemed to taste like it was macerated with a sweetened balsamic vinegar (yuck!).   The entrees were very good, decent sized portions, I ordered the Fresh Lobster Pappardelle while my husband ordered the Tenderloin Medallions. Both entrees were very tasty, fresh, and beautifully presented. In essence the entire experience would have been great if our waitress had taken proper care of our table. I mean I gave her our payment, and I had to track down the manager in order to even get my credit card back. We probably will never go here again."}
{"text":"I liked pretty much everything I had except for my entree. My wife and I shared the calamari and bought a half bottle of red wine. I would advise just buying a large glass of wine or a whole bottle because the half bottle was too small. That was my fault for not doing the math, though.   After the salads, which were good, our entrees came. I had the Bouillabaisse which had clams, mussels, shrimp, and some kind of white fish. I was a little disappointed with the tiny shrimp and tiny mussels. My wife had the haddock which came with lobster mash potatoes. That was very good and I would recommend that.  We finished with the Baked Alaska. I've never had it before so I couldn't compare it to another but it was alright. For those of you who have never had Baked Alaska it's kind of like a piece of ice cream with a layer of seared meringue on top.  Over all a good experience. We had a beautiful view, good service, and plenty of room to get comfortable. I would go again."}
{"text":"WOW!   My girlfriend and I joined her grandmother there for dinner one evening. The view was spectacular.  We each ordered a few drinks, we were seated near the windows. We saw downtown Cleveland from out table.   The food was fantastic. I got the salmon. Get the salmon... You're taste buds will thank you.   The service was exceptional. Although set aside a considerable portion of time, as dinner here is a several hour event.   The inside was themed to represent the inside of a ship, which I thought was a nice touch.   All I can say is that I would eat every meal of the day here if I could. It's the perfect place for a dinner date with your significant other."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Food is excellent and the servers and bartenders are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The view is great. The drink was weak and tonic flat The fish was way too salty The desert was still frozen The waiter was great. The manger was busy giving out free deserts for all the goofs."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, scallops, clam chowder and lobster bisque were great. The cod sandwich and French fries were terrible, dripping in grease. It was suggested that the chef could learn how to cook a fish sandwich and fries at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I really loved this place when I came for happy hour 6 months ago. The lobster bisque was amazing, and all the appetizer dishes were right on the spot. Based on the happy hour, Pier W would get a solid five stars.   Unfortunately, the regular dinner is not as impressive. This time around, the bisque was too salty, and the crab cakes were mushy, without any real crab meat pieces in it. For my entree, I had the seared scallops, and I was disappointed to find that they were very salty. The dish also came with slices of pear on the side, and I was looking forward to the sweetness of the pears complimenting the scallops or at least balancing the saltiness, but this did NOT happen because they've somehow managed to made the pears bitter. Do pears become bitter when grilled?? Then maybe they shouldn't have grilled the pears...  I think the best part of our meal was probably the service and the free bread with sides of lavender honey butter and pesto butter.   Oh and the view. Can't beat the view.   But this just goes to show that restaurant with a view cannot have it all. Oh but I so wanted Pier W to be the exception..."}
{"text":"Up until 7pm, Pier W may be my favorite place in town.  After that, they rather price themselves out of my meager budget.  That's where it is exciting though, for very reasonable prices, the Happy Hour menu is astounding!  Drinks are $5.75 and the bar food is half off.  By bar food, I should say, delicious food!    We had a group and several of the options were sampled.  Pizza was probably at the bottom of the list even though there were no real complaints, just jealousy of the other items ordered.  The burger was huge, the sliders were delicious and my Salmon Bacon Lettuce and Tomato was quite the deal!  For about $5.50 I received a nice cut of salmon, medium topped by hickory smoked bacon.  I was full enough by the end that I started handing out my fries to anyone who passed by.    In regards to the drinks, they were wonderful!  The Basil Vodka was...umm...Vodka.  Strong as strong can be, but well worth the price.  Everyone was happy with the passion fruit and pretty much everything pink.  I completely coveted the cucumber lemonade and will be sure to try it next time.   Overall I was exceedingly pleased with their happy hour.  The view of the lake, the extremely attentive staff and the crisp, clean, nautical decor were all striking.  I vote this as a \"must hit\" happy hour."}
{"text":"For your first visit I'd STRONGLY suggest trying what I'd call their                          \"Happy Hour Appetizer\"            Begin with Happy Hour to sample the fare.          Pick a banquette, a stool, or pull up a chair.          Many options to choose from all at half price,         Dip your toes in lounge waters---that's my advice.           If drinks are your pleasure---specialty or wine,         $5.75 at Happy Hour---normally 7 to 9.         Before diving head-first, try the bar at the Pier,         For dining or drinking, I'd suggest you start here.        ~~~~~ Aside from the positives of this evening---our small group of fellow diners, the always enjoyable conversations, the expansive view of Lake Erie, the scenic Cleveland coastline, the wine choices, and the friendly (but not attentive enough*) service---the dining room menu choices I made (and others, too) were negatives (again).    Before spending $$$, test the waters from the Happy Hour $ menu that currently offers 11 different appetizer, salad, seafood and sandwich options, including at least three that appear on their dining room menu.  Portion sizes are likely on the small side, but worth the savings for a test run.   From 3.25 for the New England Clam Chowder to 6.50 for the Blue Cod Sandwich.         **  Call to confirm Happy Hour times and days  **                            Not shown on their site.  Go to Pier W's page, and click the link for their menus.      It works, but won't when I've entered it on this review.                               Read the comments here that favor the food in the bar, over the dining room.  Why there'd be a difference---since all foods must come from the same kitchen---could be it's freshness, maybe?---with Happy Hour being earlier in the evening?   I never ate in the lounge---only the dining area three times in recent years---and each time was a bad experience.  Nothing ever tasted \"right', and I always left with an upset stomach.   This IS a cool dining venue---the atmosphere and the fantastic view, especially of our beloved city at night---but it doesn't hurt to \"try-the-food-on-for-size\" in the more softly-lit, more romantically-inspiring lounge.  Guys:  Great for a date!  If she's got a good head on her shoulders, she won't think you're cheap---she'll think you're smart.  For the price of a couple of entrees, two of you can share up to 7 or 8 different items in the lounge.  Then walk out to the adjacent \"pier\" for the view...and \"dessert\". . I'm familiar with, and particular about, food preparation, so I know it's not me.   I eat and cook spicy, exotic, homey, hot---all different kinds of foods from a number of nationalities---and love trying new dishes with unusal ingredients.   But I never recall having stomach shock at other restaurants or my own kitchen.  So why the highly-rated and respected Pier W and me have this odd disconnect I'll never know.  Maybe it's just bad luck.  What wasn't so good from the dining room: 1.  BREAD & BUTTER      Dry and strangely-flavored.  The darker rustic one       had an unpleasant earth-like flavor.  The lighter had       too hard a crust, and oddly WET pockets within.      VERY little butter---2 tablespoons---for the generous      amount of not-fresh bread slices.  (2 plates for 8       people)  Table had to request extra butter 3 or 4      times. 2.  LOBSTER BISQUE      Way too intense, sharp.  A tablespoon of lobster as       a garnish, and too much tomato flavor.   No hint of       lobster flavor and w-a-a-y too little cream. Too strong      an alcohol taste---needed more simmering to cook       off.  Not a smooth or pleasant dish---more like an      astringent tomato soup.  Should have asked for       warmed cream to cut the acid myself---at the table---      but didn't.  3.  their \"FAMOUS BOUILLABAISSE\"       Bone-dry, over-steamed mussels in the shell.   No       hint of any herb, broth or wine additions.  Just tomato.        The three medium shrimp were okay, but the few       bite-size fish pieces were mushy and fishy.  Of all the       ingredients, 75% of this dish was comprised of a       thick, chunky tomato stew---sharp and strong.   I left       nearly 80% of it in the bowl.   4.  PACIFIC ROCKFISH (simply prepared option:        pan-seared)       White---as if poached---not pan-seared.  Too mild---       needed additions. Potatoes okay---needed additions.         Braised Spinach---nothing special, but the best thing        on the plate. ."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for Sunday brunch. I love it here! It's my new favorite place in Lakewood. The food was fresh and delicious! The staff was beyond friendly. The view was breathtaking. I am already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place has the best brunch buffet in Cleveland. A bit pricy but the quality of food is much higher than buffet level. It's great quality food and specially seafood. You should check out the architectural design of this place. It's very cool and hanging above a cliff. Very nice view of the lake. Bring your appetite. Great dessert too! If you want the best view ask them if you can reserve one of the tables right next to the windows. I recommend reserving a table if you are going for brunch. It's very unlikely to get a table if you walk in on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The server we had at happy hour was awesome! Recommended the salmon burger and it was delicious!!!!their food never disappoints."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pier W for our anniversary dinner this year, and it did not disappoint! Our server Jamie was attentive, down to earth, and very helpful with the menu.   We ordered a bottle of pinot noir to start off and it was excellent. For our appetizer we ordered the crab cakes, and they were so delicious! Crisp on the outside, and there was so much fresh crab, and it wasn't bogged down with bread crumbs or fillers. I would definitely order that again!   For our main course, I had the 'Simply Prepared' diver scallops. They were cooked with just olive oil, salt, and pepper, and came with roasted potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. Honestly, those were the most perfect scallops I've ever had, and I've been dreaming about them ever since! I highly recommend trying them of you are a scallop lover. My husband ordered the pistachio crusted trout, which came with asparagus, and mashed potatoes. I thought that was kind of an odd choice for him, but it looked really tasty, and he seemed to really be enjoying it. Once I tried a bite for myself I was amazed at how nice the dish was! It was cooked perfectly, nice and crisp, and had a wonderful texture and flavor. I would love to taste it again, although I don't think I could bring myself to order something besides the scallops, haha! So hopefully he'll share again in the future!   For dessert we had the peanut butter bombe, and they put a cute little (edible) \"Happy Anniversary\" decoration on the plate. The dessert was really good, especially if you're a peanut butter & chocolate lover.   We really had a great time. The staff was very attentive, without being overbearing, and while everything came out quickly, we never felt rushed. We had a fantastic time and a wonderful anniversary dinner here. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The Verdict: Perfect place in Ohio to celebrate any occasion!  The Food: DELICIOUS, MOUTH-WATERING, and FRESH! First off, the bread was warm and crispy (I know, who comments on such a banal detail?) We probably had it refilled at least 4 times. We got a variety of appetizers to share and were staving. The calamari fritti is a MUST!  TLDR: We also got Bruschetta, Cheese Board, Pierogies, and oysters. Another MUST is the lobster bisque. It's the best I've ever tasted!!! Trust me on this!!! Actually my friend ordered it but it was so good that it was so hard to stop stealing from my bread. For the main course, I ordered Gulf Shrimp and Scallop Linguine and split it with another friend who shared Pistachio Crusted Golden Trout. Both were so flavorful! The Linguine was creamy and the shrimps were so large and juicy. The trout was fresh tasting and went very well with the mash potatoes.   The Extras: Pier W is located near apartment complex. Just trust what Google maps says. You can park in the parking lot right next to the restaurant. You'll see a red walkway leading to...no where? Just kidding! The restaurant is actually one floor below. They have stairs and elevator, along with a beautiful large aquarium.  We had a party of 7 celebrating our graduation and a friend leaving. We had a reservation but was late because of rush hour traffic. But no worries! They were very understanding. Our waitress was amazing! She was professional and funny. The service was great, I can tell they really want to give us the best experience."}
{"text":"Last night was D and my anniversary dinner celebration and this place was the perfect choice. The meal was great from beginning to end. That's probably why they have been in business for 50 years.  To start, the atmosphere is beautiful. We got a table second row to the windows. Looking over that scene as it got dark and seeing the CLE skyline light up was so nice. Romantic even. The next more important thing, the service, was spot on which made the whole meal. We started with the crab cakes as an appetizer. They were all top end crab meat, no filler, the sauce that came with them was very complimentary.  Then I had what was arguably my favorite part of the meal. The lobster bisque is exquisite. So smooth and rich. I got the cup not the bowl and I am glad since it's really really rich. So good. I would order this by the gallon if I could.   For dinner I had the sea scallops. I loved that they had a section on the menu that hilighted the seafood, no frou fou sauces or extras, just good seafood. The scallops were perfect. For dinner D had the tuna special and he really enjoyed that too.   Last but by no means least, the dessert. Get the peanut butter bomb and the cookies and cream cheesecake. Just do it. Yum.  Overall, this is totally a special occasion place but the food/ ambiance/ service is so good that the prices are worth it. I will absolutely be back for another special day."}
{"text":"I recently dined here for the first time (as an adult). Where do I begin?? The building itself is unique and has breathtaking views of Lake Erie and the Downtown Cleveland skyline.   This is a restaurant that remembers the importance of a fine dining experience. There's no rush. Your server is attentive and pours your drink for you.   They say you can judge a restaurant on their bread - and the bread here is amazing.   The lobster bisque was arguably the best I've had, and I've had it at some of the finest seafood restaurants in the country. The surf and turf was plentiful and simply perfect.   I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a room and a view - built into a cliff with stunning views overlooking Lake Erie and downtown Cleveland.   This is one of the best places to take an out of towner. Their brunch is outstanding, with a great selection of seafood and the dinner menu, which also spotlights seafood is worthwhile. They also have a private dining room available."}
{"text":"Great place for an occasion or simple dinner. The back part of the restaurant overlooks Lake Erie and the Cleveland skyline. Overall good food but not the best I've ever had with the exception of the lobster bisque. That was incredible. A good selection of oysters in season but a bit pulverized on the shell. Short rib pierogi was very rich and could have used a dollop of Creme fresh to break up the deep flavor of the broth. The filet came out perfectly cooked. However, the lemon jest butter finish ruined the clean taste of a perfectly cooked steak.  They make a great martini and the wine. Selection was generous. Service was adequate. Worth the trip in any event. Dine on my fellow professional eaters!"}
{"text":"Omg I just love this place ! U can't go wrong with the amazing view and the delicious food ! It's just so good ! I've been here like 5 times and it's just keeps getting better, I'm not a crazy fan on the lobster bisque I tryed it since everyone says how awesome it is. But that's just me . I had the grilled salmon and my brother had the crab stuffed shrimp I had a nibble on the shrimp he had omg I was sooooo jealous ! But my salmon was so good it was devoured within minutes ! Crab cake appetizers were great too! Thanks pier w !! U rock !!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pier W.  The food is awesome and their happy hour specials are some of the best in Cleveland!  When we lived in the neighborhood it was perfect to stop in after work for some drinks and apps.  The view of Lake Erie is like none other that you will get from a restaurant along the lake.  This place can be whatever you want it to be, from a stuffy dinner to impress out of town guests or a relaxed dinner in a very unique location."}
