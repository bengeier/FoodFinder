{"text":"Wonderful small restaurant. The owner, Terry, suggested a wonderful wine upon our arrival and the meal to follow did not disappoint, especially the tiramisu and fruit plate for dessert. One of the best restaurant experiences we've ever had."}
{"text":"where do I begin?  Poor service (never asked of we wanted more bread, we asked for salt/pepper - it never came, our dirty plates sat for 20 minutes, 25+ minutes between apps and dinner).  The food was way overpriced, tasteless, and weird (grilled chicken with the chicken parm).  Every single thing we ordered was bad and bland - it was almost amazing how bad it was.  Would never recommend or return here - go across the street to Mia Bella!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there on Saturday night with another couple.

The service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our entrees and the waiter checked up on us only once, and then to tell us how backed up the kitchen was. 

While we were waiting, we saw someone who looked like the Owner go to several tables around us asking how things were - not thrilled that he didn't come to our table to ask us.

When our food finally came, my entree, which was a Special Ravioli, was luke warm, and when I complained I was told that it had not been sitting and the kitchen had just put it out, which I don't believe in a hear beat. The waiter reluctantly took it back to the kitchen and brought it back out a few minutes later - warmer, but still not hot. And, in my opinion, the Ravioli was just OK; it was supposed to have asparagus in it, and came withe a skimpy number of asparagus stalk parts.

The waiter never really apologized for the long wait, and while he did bring a tiramisu at no charge to the table, it really didn't make up for the long delay or luke warm food."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Little Italy. The bartenders, waitresses and other staff are super friendly and attentive. The food was very good as well. My friend was taking shots of Jameson throughout the night and as we were leaving the bartender gave him a free one to top off his meal. 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"Standard Italian fare, but well executed. I enjoyed my Chicken Parmesan was a little too salty, I enjoyed it. My wife liked her fish, and my grandson liked his ravioli. Yes, they do cook the pasta al dente (not soft or mushy), but that's the way most Italians like it. We were seated immediately at an outdoor table on a busy Friday night. Our waiter was excellent. I'd gladly go back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Pizza was cold and undercooked.  First loaf of bread was hot and wonderful,  second was cold! Fruit flys everywhere. Never, is to soon  to come back to this place !"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place.  I don't know if people raving about their gelato have had \"real\" gelato because this stuff is just made from \"pre-gel\" (google it for more info).  You can tell by the flavours they have on display and the BRIGHT colours of flavours like \"bubble gum\".  I decided to give it a chance anyway despite the crazy high price as I was in the mood for something cool on a warm day.  It was typical \"pre-gel\" taste but the price isn't justified especially since there is a huge raised centre in the cup that removes like a 1/3 of the cup from being filled with gelato."}
{"text":"This place was such a huge disappointment. The food was mediocre at best and the service was worse. Actually only half of our food was edible. The server actually yelled across another table to ask if we wanted anything else. With a bill of $150 for two people you have certain expectations about the quality of both the food and service. This came up short on both."}
{"text":"OK, I've been here a number of times with pretty much all of those being pretty good experiences.  When I come here I'm not looking for top of the line Italian, rather I'm expect a nice meal in a cute space.  The last time we (I brought my girlfriend) ate here via a Groupon deal and we left pretty disappointed.  The drinks were fine, the service was just OK - they need to hire more servers as it took a long time to pay - but the food was just bland.  Not bad, just lacking much flavor.
I think in the future we will just come here to sit at the bar or outside with a drink & enjoy the scenery of Little Italy."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the owner is terrible. His abrasive rude behavior toward his staff and patrons keeps me from coming to his restaurant. It's a shame because the food is good and so close to my home. The owner just makes you feel too uncomfortable to even enjoy your food when he's working."}
{"text":"Our 5th choice for dinner on the Tuesday night after the Feast of the Assumption because the prior four choices were closed. We sat outside at a rickety table with plastic patio chairs, and it never got better. Our server was not attentive, the food was subpar and very small portions, and the owner was on a rampage that night. I witnessed him yelling at the hostess who was apparently used to it because she didn't seem rattled. With so many other options on Mayfield, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best location in Little Italy.  The bartender and owner make perfect wine selections throughout the course of the meal!  Eggplant, tomatoes, pizza, pastas (even gluten free delicious)  SO GOOD!   And great atmosphere....love it here"}
{"text":"Have gone a couple times for ladies night. They have a nice bar selection and an extensive wine list but the drinks are definitely over priced. Had the ladies night pesto which was tasty but a fairly small portion - however the staff was rude and didn't pay attention to our table (had to be called over to order and pay the bill).  An okay place to catch up with a friend during the summertime but for a longer dinner I'd explore elsewhere in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Nice environment, but I can get better food for the price in many other Italian restaurants. We've tried parmesan chicken and FETTUCCINE FELLINI, for $22 and $18, chicken is good but nothing special comparing to other parmesan chicken you can get in Cleveland, fettuccine fellini is a plate of spaghetti  with tiny bit of ham and heavy creamy flavor, nothing special either. The main dish doesn't come with anything, no side salad or soup.
In general: Environment is good, food is good but nothing special, parking is hard to find unless you paid for valet, and price is overpriced given the portion and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT meal here last night.
It's a fun place to sit and linger.  We sat outside (it was a perfect summer night) and never once felt rushed or hurried.
We tried some sort of eggplant appetizer that was delicious- very thinly sliced eggplant that was lightly fried, covered with marinara sauce and a dollop of cheese.  
With a friend, I split a salad and a pasta.  We got the caprese salad, which was delicious.  The cheese was creamy and fresh.  The tomatoes, oh, the tomatoes, were at peak perfection of ripeness.
We tried the FETTUCCINE FELLINI.  It was incredible.  Pancetta and gorgonzola in a creamy parmesean sauce?  Yes please.  I practically licked the plate.
Good cappuccino, good wine selection.
Friendly service.  They even split the pasta for us without us having to ask.  I appreciate that kind of thing."}
{"text":"The last time my girlfriend and I ate here we had a nice experience -- the food wasn't great but not bad either, and the staff was kind and even went out of their way to surprise us with a free dessert. Consequently, our next visit to Little Italy we were eager to give it another go. Sadly, we were sorely dissapointed.

To start, no bread was brought to our table. Last time I remember receiving bread with different butters, and the tables around us all had bread... but okay. A little strange for an Italian place, especially one at this price range. My girlfriend's ravioli was good, but my meat pasta tasted like something I would've made at home, and I am not a skilled cook. We waited forever to get our bill, and waited even longer to have it taken back. I'm not even sure who was waiting on us, or if anyone really was at all. We were seated by the hostess and then our orders were taken by a waiter, who after that basically disappeared. The hostess brought us our food. Nobody checked on us, nobody refilled our waters, and nobody asked about dessert, though there were only 3 other tables filled in the entire restaurant. It really bummed us out. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Let me see if I can tell you just how awful my experience was.  The hostess seated us at a table that multiple people had turned down because above it was an air conditioner that was leaking water.  (she could have warned us or asked if it was okay.  Instead she put us here.)
The waiter took forever to come back to tell me they didn't have the wine I requested.  When I ordered a substitute bottle it was from a different year than stated on the menu.  I asked him about it and he was going to talk to the manager.  I never heard back.  He did break the cork opening the wine and I had to wait even longer for a decanter so we could eliminate the residual cork.  

When I ordered my main course (pasta primavera stated to include seasonal vegetables) I asked for it to be made a little spicy.  Well, even though asparagus was part of every special, it wasn't part of the seasonal vegetables in my very bland meal.  

This is a horribly mediocre restaurant and I strongly suggest you avoid going.  You'll save yourself the way I didn't."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasty. The eggplant was the best I've ever had and it's the #bestopesto in the Continental US. I understand it's been there 28years. Deserves another 28!"}
{"text":"Two star is very accurate for this place. food quality never meet a satisfaction that veal got cold and pasta was under cooked. No idea how to run this business. Gift certificate is a right one to pay."}
{"text":"I went to La Dolce Vita the other night for dinner with a few friends. I had been very excited to try it out. I was very impressed as we were seated right away and the hostess was very attentive and brought us water immediately. The waiter came over right away to greet us as well. I ordered the eggplant parmesan which was great and other friends in my party ordered different pasta dishes which they all liked a lot. 

The food was cooked perfectly and the service was great as well. I was very impressed with La Dolce Vita and will definitely be coming back! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Well, I guess I am going to have to give up on Little Italy in Cleveland.  I had my second mediocre meal in a row.  

First, I  ordered wedding soup and a pasta dish, they came out at exactly the same time.  Who does that?  

So besides poor service the soup was likely made in 15 minutes since it had little taste.  The panceta in the pasta sauce was under cooked and while they claimed it had gargonzola cheese I could not taste it.

I  will give them credit for at least cooking the pasta al dente. 

What is sad is that there is no better Italian food in Mentor than Little Italy.  

I used to love coming here, what a shame."}
{"text":"It was my mother's 50th birthday so we decided to go to Little Italy for lunch and ended up at La Dolce Vita. We ordered the calamari for an app and it was very tasty. We all ordered a different pasta dish and each dish was uniquely delicious. What wowed us was the owner came over chatted with us & then brought over 2 huge portions of gnocchi with pesto and then linguini with a wonderful sauce on top of it. On the hous,not even knowing it was my mother's birthday. The owner was so kind to us as was our server. We enjoyed our time there so much. We will definitely be back for some more divine pasta dishes"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at high prices. I would suggest avoiding this place. I ordered a spinach and four cheese pizza, and was horrified to receive a pita crust with frozen spinach and shredded \"mozzarella\" cheese. The pizza was barely warm. 

My husband ordered the monk fish dish. He enjoyed it but it was not impressed for the price. 

We gave the homemade tiramisu a try. We must be gluttons for punishment because we should have left it at the cold, overpriced pizza. The tiramisu was below subpar. It was dry and flavorless. Very disappointing. 

A door knob would have been friendlier than the server. She was not interested in being there or serving us. 

We will not be back to La Dolce Vita and urge you not to waste your time and/or money."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food, overpriced.  We always try new places. Won't be back here except for the wine. It was good. We paid $100 for cold, tough, tasting like its out of a can food!! Very disappointed. The meat was cold, yet overcooked and the pasta was undercooked. The sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee out of a can.."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food, and wonderful service! Owner came to our table multiple times to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and even threw in a free appetizer! Made us feel so personally welcome even though there were plenty other patriots there. First visit and had a fantastic first impression! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!!!  For some odd reason my friends and I just went to it for the first time this year.

They have a pretty good wine selection,  and our server was very knowledgeable and helpful with her recommendations.    We started with the \"upgraded\" Caprese  salad as they called it, which came with prosciutto and roasted red peppers as well.  FABULOUS.  My friends had the gnocci for dinner, and I the Abruzzi Pasta, which were both amazing. 

They gave us fresh strawberries on the house at the end of our meal soaked in some form of alcohol, which was the perfect ending.  

*It can get expensive quickly depending on how much wine you plan on drinking, as with any restaurant in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Been to Little Italy eateries a lot over last year and half but tonight was first trip to LDV. Glad we made it. Terry and staff were great - food was better. Mixed greens and bread to start, seafood pasta for entre. Terry fed us samples of other dishes throughout the night. Atmosphere relaxed but nice. Could not recommend this place highly enough when in Cleveland. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"My family and I had just git into town and were staying in a small place right up the street from Little Italy and we decided to go into Little Italy for dinner. We decided on La Dolce Vita, which was the best choice that we could've made. We walked in and immediately we were greeted by a wonderfully old-fashioned atmosphere. We were seated and the owner came over with a metal mixing bowl with this wonderfully colored dish that he called Faro, and just gave it to us on the house. It was very apparent that everyone there was extremely passionate about the food that they made. We told them to just bring us what they thought we should have and they came out with a meal of at least six courses, all of them absolutely amazing. I ate until I was full and then I ate some more. After we had finished the main meal, they brought out an amazing dessert that they put on the house as well. After that was cleared and we were waiting for the check, the owner came out with a bottle of wine that was an amazing amber color and explained that it was a very nice, and traditional dessert wine in Tuscany and let us sample it for free. We left felling beyond satisfied and happy. If I could I would rate it 10/5. The atmosphere was amazing and the owner came over and actually talked to us about the history of the food, which made it way better than the restaurants that are just out to make a profit."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Cold microwaved bread. Lentil soup was flavorless. Pasta was undercooked and then soupy when brought back a second time. Veggie Pizza tasted like bacon. All kinds of wrong."}
{"text":"This place makes the best gelato in this area by a mile . Very fresh and real fruit ."}
{"text":"Go anywhere else but here in Cleveland's beautiful Little Italy.  A screaming manager yelling instructions; forgotten entree delivered 20 minutes after the other diners' food; and the food - yuck!  How can you screw up chicken parmesan?  Answer: watery pasta and tough, rubbery chicken!  Ravioli had odd meat squares in the sauce alongside the pasta.  Even the Italian wedding soup tasted, according to my tolerant daughter, like water with a few meatballs in it.  

The bread was good, and once you got past reading a wine list scribbled on an extra piece of paper, that was OK too.  

Couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"We were taken to Little Italy for a Cleveland dinner experience while visiting family there last weekend.  We chose this charming restaurant out of all the others mainly due to the sidewalk cafe tables.  Both my cousin and I had been craving Veal Milanese and were thrilled to see they had it on the menu!  Immediate seating outside with the weather beautiful also?  We excitedly said, \"this evening is starting out great!\"

The wine list was adequate (nothing special) but the wine I ordered wasn't available, however the waiter found something not on the list, but similar at about the same price (musta been a left over from a previous wine list change).  Good pull!  

Appetizers consisted of the calamari appetizer and the bruschetta.  The calamari arrived and I was surprised how small the portion was, however the bruschetta rocked with thick toasted bread, crisp on the outside and soft in the center, the tomato/garlic/basil olive oil spread was great.

My gal ordered a baked chicken dish with tomatoes, artichokes etc. with pasta in a light tomato sauce.  My cousin's wife ordered a ravioli dish, but before we ordered the veal, my cousin asked if the veal was thin and crisp, the waiter told us that the veal was indeed thin.  JACKPOT!  We ordered their Veal Milanese.  Then the waiter asked us how we wanted it cooked!   Huh? I thought to myself, never been asked that before for milanese, but figured it was their standard/protocol or something.  Up this point La Dolce Vita would get a 4+ star rating....then the entrees arrived.

 The chicken was bland and the pasta was under cooked (not close to al dente) the sauce was really good and fresh though.  The ravioli was also very good cooked perfectly. Then the veal was placed in from of us.  what we were given was a charbroiled veal chop, on a bed of chopped arugula with chopped tomatoes, the chop was drizzled with balsamic glaze and sprinkled with shaved parmesan cheese!

Both were not cooked as requested (medium) and we were both shocked as to what happened to our order.  The server was summonded and after explaining to us that this is how they made milanese, and us stating our dissadisfaction with the entrees he made an awkward but quick exit.

Shortly thereafter, a big hulking guy (think NJ club bouncer) in a Justin Timberlake hat and vest holding a half bottle of Tuaca liqueur abruptly came to our table and placed both of his hands on the edge and leaned in real close and started verbally assaulting us for complaining to the waiter about the dish.  Get this-he was the manager/owner!  He explained that this is how his chef made the dish and that was that.  No apology, no offer for an exchange, nothing.  Now I have been a chef for nearly 25 years and I am also Italian, and I have NEVER had Milanese served this way, and his menu was misleading.   In stating so, the manager got more brutish and basically insinuated, 'tough shit' and then said he was going to fire his lousy chef and abruptly left us sitting there in shock.

We ate the veal (should have sent it back and refused to pay for it) and then our waiter appeared with dessert menus offering free desserts/cordials.  Nice job on the recovery, but we were set on going broke buying all the cookies from the Italian bakery across the street.  Would have preferred to have the mistakes taken off the the check, but we had some coffee and shared a tiramisu (outstanding) and paid the bill and left.  

Needless to say, avoid the Veal Milanese at La Dolce Vita and don't piss off the owner!"}
{"text":"A gallon jar of minced garlic does not an Italian restaurant make. How this shithole survives on the best corner in Little Italy must be credited to a name that ends with a vowel. I'm a Cleveland Italian. This place can fuck itself."}
{"text":"The food was great!!! The wine selection was just as good. I will definitely be back. the Scampi Risotto was awesome and the Veal Chop was to die for. Our server Jose was very helpful. He was more like a friend than our server. I just made a reservation for 15. This place is great for big party's lots of space."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the staff was very helpful and provided recommendations that were spot on! Pasta is great as well as their pizza. The owner personally comes out and chats with patrons which adds to an authentic Italian eatery ambiance."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with this place!  The salmon risotto was extremely good - both the salmon and risotto were perfectly cooked.  The italian peppers stuffed with veal were absolutely gorgeous and  just as delicious.  

The other couple with us ordered a pizza, which did not touch the greatness of our dishes.  We did not order pasta, but judging from the appearance of the pastas of other diners, it looked good but not special.  

If you go here, don't order pizza and pasta (you'll be disappointed) order the special entrees.  And, if you do, be sure to ask the price and don't assume they will be priced similiarly to other items on the menu. (our salmon risotto was 28.00, but big enough for two, really yummy and well worth it)"}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland and this restaurant was recommended, located in little Italy. Everything was fantastic!  The food was absolutely delicious. The service was awesome and the band performed all the classics!  The owner brought us a sample of another dish while we were eating and they brought us out a fruit plate with wonderful whipped cream to finish off the meal. If I'm ever in Cleveland again, I will be sure to go back."}
{"text":"Food was incredible! You could tell it was fresh! Service was a little slow, they were crowded it was live opera nite. But food made up for it."}
{"text":"Great patio and outdoor ambiance, we were there on a night with live piano music.  As far as the food, it was mediocre in my opinion, especially considering the prices charged.  The menu is also a little limited and somewhat difficult to find something acceptable if you're trying to avoid veal.

Tomatoes in the salad were excellent and the gnocci in a tomato cream sauce were both good, but the rest was only passable in my opinion.  

Again, not a bad place to enjoy a nice night out, but definitely not what I would consider impressively good food."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, the owner warmly welcomed our family of five. We had stopped at 3 other restaurants with long waits and decided to go restaurant to restaurant until we could find a place that would take us right away.  The owner, and his snappy personality seated us instantly and gave us fresh polenta with roasted zucchini that included two homemade sauces, on the house. The waiter then gave us fresh homemade bread. I highly recommend their lightly breaded eggplant appetizer with ricotta cheese on top. I usually ask for my salad dressing on the side, luckily I didn't and experienced the best Italian salad dressing I have ever had, it has a hint of lemon in it. The very moist polo dinner is fantastic. La Dolce Vita was a very nice surprise,  considering we just stumbled upon it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is alright but does not warrant that kind of price. The wait staff was often rude and took a long time for many requests. After a few visits here, I've realized that between the waiters that take your order and the runners that bring your food, the runners are by far more helpful. So much so that my friends and I cut the tip short so we can tip the runner in cash. 

The interior itself is not impressive. Some of the chairs are shaky and the decor is not very well thought out. The dim lighting helps to lessen the mediocrity. Would not come here if trying to impress."}
{"text":"For authentic and friendly service and food Terry Tarantino does it like no one else. He catered to our family personally late in the evening and in celebration of my daughter in laws 21st birthday. As an Italian she described the food in remembrance of eating with her grandmother. He served up family style pesto, angel hair marinara, meatballs, French salad with sheep milk feta, barley and fresh vegetables with Tara misu. The wine flowed, the conversation never ended, Terry became as much a part of our family and party that evening as any other. If you're looking for great food in the European experience go to La Dolce Vita."}
{"text":"Great Gelato, Great Service. Lots of flavors , must try the Nutella and Pistachio,  nice outside area to sit and enjoy the gelato"}
{"text":"We had purchased a Groupon for this restaurant without ever eating there and I'm glad we did!

My wife and I went up on a Sunday afternoon and were greated by a friendly hostess who sat us promptly (we did make reservations - through opentable.com - but they were not busy at the time we went - 3pm.) We sat at a table that was in the bar area with a view of the neighborhood.

The waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs. While we waited for our salads the owner stopped by our table and thanked us for coming in (very genuine.) A few moments later he came back with some eggplant appetizers for us to try, which we thought was very nice.

Our food came out in a timely manner and was quite good. Again, we had a Groupon so our bill ended up only being a couple bucks. Overall, as with all the restaurants in Little Italy, it's a bit pricey, but remember you are going for the entire experience which made it all worth it!!

We'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"this place was ok.

i had the alfredo fettucini with pancetta. it was very heavy (oily) compared to other alfredo sauces. i dont think my heart liked it very much and my mouth was rather coated in oil after each bite, i did add lots of red pepper which enhanced the plainness of the pasta. we also had the guacamole bruchetta which i would not recommend, but was recommended by the waiter. it was like guacamole and bread with some tomato, i would say more mexican than italian. 

the bread the served was really salty. and the busser/waiter refilled our waters once after we got our check. our initial check was 10 over (added incorrectly). and the restaurant was really dark. like a few candles brighter than a movie theatre dark. and they did have some movie playing up on the wall. i think it was too dark to be romantic or to feel safe, since i like to see what i eat. owner stopped by to say hi at our table.

for the quality and quantity of food i would look elsewhere next time i am in the area. this was the only place open on sunday night (9pm)."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed with this place, unfortunately. 

Perhaps I was too excited to finally be able to try it and when I wasn't thrilled with it, my rating got knocked even further; nonetheless, I stand by my 2 stars, which are mostly for our server.

When we got there, I gave the hostess my name since I'd had a reservation. We had the option of the very first table, which was crammed up against the hostess \"box\" and we would have inevitably been bumped endlessly and gotten huge gusts of wind and rain every time someone came or left. We were also given the option of the \"quiet\" room, which is the extension of the initial bar and dining area. Of course I chose the quiet area, even though it seemed unusually secluded and didn't really fit well with the rest of the ambiance, but it was better than door number one. When we got to the other side, we immediately froze--it was almost colder than outside! My cute outfit was moot because I had to keep all of my layers on just to be comfortable!

Our server (Peter, I think) was pretty awesome and on his game. He kept my water glass full, which was nice because I was absolutely parched that evening. He didn't bother us too much and showed just enough interest to make me feel like he actually cared. 

On to the food--the real problem. This food is certainly not worth what they ask for, first of all. Second of all, the menu seems really unorganized and unclear to me, which is bothersome. And finally, it wasn't that good at all! I had the abruzze, which seemed like it should be flavorful, but I've made boxed spaghetti with canned sauce that had more pizazz. Most of my noodles were unevenly cooked--some were al dente, some were completely mushy. I have no idea how this happens, but it did. The ravioli, which my boyfriend had, were full of flavor but cooked poorly. The edges were varying between completely rock hard and crunchy to al dente to mush. The filling and sauce were delicious, but they were difficult to eat because the pasta was so poor. When someone--not even our server, which was weird and it didn't help that this guy was a bit rude; he didn't HAVE to come by our table, our server seemed to have things covered--came by to take our plates, he asked why there was so much leftover and if everything was ok. We explained to him and he sliced through one with a fork and acted like we were the dumbest people he'd ever encountered and explained \"al dente\" to us. Sigh. We tried. 

Overall, I wish this place was better just because we had such good service (from our waiter, of course, not the random other guy that made us feel inferior and like we didn't have any business there). The bar still looks enticing to me, but the atmosphere wasn't great otherwise--the \"quiet\" room seems unfinished and the other side seems more like a lounge. I'm just really not sure about all of it..."}
{"text":"Best gelato and espresso I've had. Staff was very friendly. Worst part was trying to decide from all of the flavors!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Just tried the eggplant Saturday evening and it was super good, with a generous dollop of mascarpone on top and just the right amount of sauce and noodle underneath (I think they made it into a meal for me as it was not on the dinner menu, so it wasn't overwhelming amount of pasta for which I am happy.)  I like that the calamari app is not breaded, rather sauteed, but I prefer it less soupy/brothy, more flash fried, perhaps dredged but whatever.  Tried my husband's pesto pasta and it was great. Tried friend's gnocci and thought it was too pasty/mushy BUT I usually find that to be the case with gnocci. The icing on the cake when you visit this great, Cleveland mainstay is the owner. Walking around with his big pot of that creamy, peppery, bowtie pasta for everyone with an empty plate in front of them to enjoy while they anticipate their dinners. And Terry seems seriously concerned that everyone is ok, happy. He actually has a genuine look of concern on his face! And more often than not does everyone also usually get an extra treat for dessert-fruit with a drizzle of chocolate sauce or mascarpone, etc.. Terry is a top notch restaurant owner. The number of years he's been open is a clear testament to what Cleveland thinks of this place."}
{"text":"Returned  to La dolce vita.... it gets better every time we go. This time we had Cacio e Pepe. I've been all over Rome and the U.S. this is the best I've had. Great service.... ask for Terri!"}
{"text":"Super yummy place! Seems very authentic and good flavor!  I ordered the scallop special they were cooked perfectly.  The owner brought over specials from the kitchen and a large fruit and ricotta plate!   Very good and priced right!    They are going to start serving creamy panna cotta soon!!"}
{"text":"La Dolce Vita is nice Italian restaurant tucked away in the Little Italy district of Cleveland which touts it's Pizzas and Pastas. We went there on a Friday night to get taste of what was meant to be good Italian food, and came away both disappointed and satisfied at the same point!

First off, let's talk service:
The one and only thing that prevents this place from being a 4 star, maybe even a 5 star restaurant is it's service, or occasionally lack thereof. We were seated outside when we arrived, and after 10 minutes of being solidly ignored (i looked a waiter in the eye as I tried to flag him down, and he just continued to ignore me) we decided to move in where I hoped to get better service. 
Inside the restaurant, the service was much better, although not great. It took a decent amount of time to get our servers to order our main course, and service was overall slow - not a bad thing unless it changes the temperature of your food!

The Food:
We started out with the soups - I ordered the lentil, and my girlfriend the Italian wedding soup. They were both delicous; however the lentil soup was lukewarm at the best! Undeterred, I carried on hoping that this was a one time incident. Sadly, that  was not to be. 
Calamari - great sauce! Cool calamari (like they had forgotten to heat it or cook it in the sauce properly).
Pizza - some of the best sauce I have had one a pizze! Get the meddeteraneo pizza here!
We also ordered a pasta off their daily specials, and it was the same story - amazing pasta but it was pretty cool/cold! We were already full by then, so decided to just get it wrapped. 

Overall, I would go back to this place as long as they promised to actually heat my food properly prior to serving it!!"}
{"text":"The host was extremely welcoming and nice! The food was excellent and the atmosphere was very cool! Highlight of our visit to Cleveland so far!"}
{"text":"I think they have seen better performances.  Full disclosure, they did have a reception for 120 on their outdoor patio while our party of 16 took up an entire room.

Our service team of two worked hard to please and they were both super personalities.

Problem was, each item and course was late and the kitchen overcooked most items.  Main courses were pedestrian at best.

But we had a good time!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for multiple reasons.  First of all, when we got there they did not have air conditioning and it was hot out.  Then we waited for a very long time before they took our order and then the food took a long time to come out. They did come by and gave us some pasta as we waited.  After we ate, I asked for a box, Tiramisu, and check.  I saw the waiter pass us to give water and food for the table behind us several times and he did not bring the box.  He finally brought the box, Tiramisu, and check after 25 minutes after we asked for it.  The Tiramisu has chocolate syrup on it and the cream was so tarty that it tasted like lemon cream.  The pasta itself, when it did come out, was ok, but I would not come back to this place.  They need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and the food is just fine, nothing crazy good.  But if you're looking for a night in Little Italy, you could probably do worse.  The seafood pasta was pretty good, the creamy parmesean pasta with pancetta could have been better.  It was pretty thick.

I agree with the other reviews that this place is overpriced for what you get.  I've had better Italian."}
{"text":"Low-Quality, Overpriced Food in a Dirty Establishment
Ah, La Dolce Vita ~The Sweet Life~ 
We were initially told to wait 40 minutes for a table, which we accepted with vigor, until 40 minutes passed and we were then greeted by a drunk man in orange pants who, I believe, was managing the establishment.  He carried a cajoling demeanor, as he started joking with us, most of which we could not understand due to the extremely loud live Jazz music playing.  Once we made it past the door crowd and the clamorous, drunk, orange pants man, we were finally seated 15 minutes later.  The three of us were seated at a table set up for seating about 8 people, accented with full glasses of water that were put on the table way before we were seated - ice melted, condensation building up outside the glass. Note: there was no air conditioning inside this restaurant, so it was about 80 degrees inside.  We thought, well, I guess this water is for us, and took a sip.  Nope, about 5 minutes after we sat down, about three staff started clearing the five extra plates at our table without a greeting or exchange of any words, took the water from under our noses and replaced it with fresh glasses of water.  A sign that let us know we were potentially drinking \"used\" glasses of water.  As we glared at  all of the Hawaiian, dollar store tiki decorations accenting the restaurant, we unwillingly faced the live jazz situation - an extremely drunk (perhaps something else?), sweaty, middle aged man laid his glazed over eyes on our table, calling us \"the young people\", and stumbled to us singing a jazzed out rendition of Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay by Otis Redding. 
Shortly after, we ordered a $14 pizza to split and a $17 plate of pasta.  I recognized the pasta noodles, as they were the bow tie noodles that a Giant Eagle or Aldi's stocks on their shelves. Barely any sauce was in the dish, and it was just that - sauce and bow ties, nothing else.  No tomatoes. No fresh pepper. We also had to ask for cheese, which we received via a plastic grater.  The pizza we ordered was slightly larger than a saucer dish.
The only plus side was that we didn't have to pay extra for ordering another bread basket because we were still so hungry, but although I saw an entire tray of glass olive oil bottles by the bar, we weren't offered any olive oil for our bread or food.  Macaroni Grill blows this place out of the Sea.
The bathroom was extremely unclean.  It appeared as if after eating La Dolce Vita, someone decided to crop dust the toilet with a storm of loose pubes.  There was no toilet paper in the women's bathroom either, and my shoes wanted to stick to the floor.
I've concluded that Little Italy is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and a scam that leeches on the wallets Cleveland suburbanites.  I'm sure there's probably someone in the back counting fat stacks of cash and investing it in anything but this restaurant.  It's a blessing that Fellini passed away in the 90's, because he would definitely not be proud."}
{"text":"After two try's I finally made a reservation to La Dolce Vita. I have to admit I wasnt sure what to expect because I read some of the reviews and most of them weren't that flattering. So last Friday night my daughter, husband and I finally  got to see for ourselves if it was good or bad. Well I have to say that I thought it was excellent and it was unanimous. My husband and daughter both ordered a Spanish wine that was on special and absolutely loved it. We then followed up with a caprese salad and pesto gnocchi which we shared. The sauce was clean and fresh and the gnocchi was done to perfection. The caprese salad was spot on and fresh as well. My husband got a pizza and really enjoyed the ultra thin crust, but would of like it to be a bit larger since it was a large. I followed up with a nice capachinno and as usual the nice fruit tray. The one thing that made the night even better was our waiter. He was attentive and knowledgeable and was super friendly. We really appreciated that. Loved the atmosphere and could see going back again."}
{"text":"Judging by the location I thought this restaurant should of been a great place to dine, what a mistake. In short this restaurant is over priced, the quality of the food is highly suspect, and the service is merely adequate. I got the feeling that the owner is just trying to make a fast buck and could care less about providing customers with a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised to see some of the negative reviews.  We went here on a Wednesday night and sat outside on the back patio.  My boyfriend ordered the Abruzze (corkscrew pasta with veal meat sauce) and I ordered the special which was a 4-cheese ravioli with sundried tomatoes.  His meat sauce pasta was delicious, and probably the best we've found on Mayfield Rd.  My ravioli was okay--it needed more salt and less olive oil.  Very good service.  We've since been back and this past time I ordered the Gnocchi with Marinara sauce.  Hands down their marinara sauce is the best one on Mayfield Rd!"}
{"text":"A very bad night for this restaurant.  Apparently issues with personnel in the kitchen but service staff did not compensate.  30 minutes before anyone spoke to us and 90 minutes before apps showed up. 

Owner, management tried to make up for it but too little too late. Took 20 bucks off 300 dollar bill. Promised to bring dessert on the house but did not happen. This was fine since we were ready to go.

Food hit miss. Calamari very good but bruschetta was somehow cold tho we waited forever. Chicken parmigian was bland"}
{"text":"The decor, plants, and lighting create a lovely atmosphere. Really appreciated that the basketball game was projected on a wall, and on a TV, instead of loudly blaring from a rack of boob-tubes.

Our pastas were excellent and tasted very fresh. The portions are large enough so you can take the rest home for tomorrow's lunch. The white cream sauce is amazing and the bread is perfect!

We were pleasantly surprised by a waiter deftly singing an opera selection to another table. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it's a nice place to go for a relaxed dinner and great conversation, but don't go in a hurry.  The service has been excruciatingly slow both times, and the second time we were almost the only ones left later in the evening.  We ordered a sampling of mostly appetizers, and our frequently AWOL server forgot one, which came out 15 minutes later completely cold.  Yay competent waitstaff.  Luckily we were seated outside for great people watching, and had some good friends for conversation.  

The food was good but not amazing, and I'll agree that it was overpriced.  We used a Restaurant.com gift certificate, which was about what I was willing to pay.   It's been a while since I was there and no dish stuck out in my mind in either a good or bad way, but I'd go back again (gift certificate in hand) for some good Little Italy people watching."}
{"text":"Visited LDV last night for the first time with two good friends and my wife and I. Greeted at the door by owner Terry Tarantino, who welcomed us with open arms.

Terry is a true restauranteur, he helped us get settled and then came to the table and gave us a sampling of a delicious pasta dish, and he did that to every customer at every table, It felt like being at home.  Throughout the night he came by several times, again not just to us but to everyone, he really knows how to run a restaurant.

He sat and visited with us, suggested a delicious wine and walked us through the menu. 

The service was great, the food was awesome, really quaint inside and I too give 5 stars to LDV."}
{"text":"Dined here last night at the suggestion of a friend, so there were three of us. Fun location in Little Italy, with sidewalk seating available so that you can people watch while you eat, and the weather was great, especially for July.

We were seated, and given menus and waters, and it was a few minutes before the waiter checked back, which was good, because we needed some time to consider the menu. He asked if we wanted drinks, and we ordered a bottle of the house Chianti, and then asked him to tell us about the specials for that night. About 3 minutes later, he stopped by and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We looked at each other, and him, and said \"Just that bottle of Chianti\". He apologized and said that it had just slipped his mind. (No big deal - it happens.)

We got our wine, and put in our order for a Mastroianni salad, Fettuccine Fellini with Shrimp, Ravioli Di Summer with Marinara sauce (which the waiter suggested), and Vitelo di Verona.

A bread plate was dropped off, and an older gentleman stopped by the table with a big bowl of Cacio e Pepe, and offered samples. We enjoyed that part of the evening, although I see that that particular dish gets less enthusiastic reviews from other Yelpers. The same gentleman (apparently the owner) stopped by a second time while we were waiting for our meal and offered another sample. We tried to engage him in conversation, complimenting the pasta, but he didn't seem particularly friendly.

Our waiter forgot to bring the salad, which our friend didn't even mention, and instead brought our main courses after about 20-30 minutes.

Our friend enjoyed the fettucini with shrimp, and said the pasta was excellent. My husband, who ordered the Ravioli with marinara, thoroughly enjoyed his dish as well. I tasted the ravioli, and I have to say that the marinara sauce was excellent. I had the veal, which wasn't great. I found it to be on the tough side, and really bland. 

When the bill arrived, not only were we charged for the non-existent salad, but the total was increased by $10 in addition. Fortunately, our friend looked over the bill carefully, and got it corrected. 

It was a pleasant evening, but I don't see any of us looking to go back again in the near future, as there are plenty of other places in Little Italy to try that may offer better food and service."}
{"text":"Stop in for an excellent experience.  The menu is terrific.  There is a doting wait staff that has been trained by one of the best in the business Terry T.  They are open to feedback.  Let them know if you need anything or if you are just having a terrific time.  Wait staff is very knowledgeable.  They have an 'Opera' night.  I am curious what that is like.  
Our daughter is attending college in the area.  We will be back many times over her remaining time there."}
{"text":"Food tastes like the pasta came out of a box and and sauce came out of a jar. What was worse than the food was the service. Our waiter would leave our table with out asking if we needed anything or had any questions. When we did ask a question he continued to walk away while answering while his back was to us-very rude.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting Cleveland from Columbus, and as we were talking to the hostess about what kind of food they serve, the owner, a fellow Buckeye, came by and talked to us. He proceeded to seat us on the outside patio, and throughout our dining experience there he was kind and cordial. He brought us different salads and pastas to try before we ordered our food, while talking about his time abroad in Rome. The aforementioned appetizers, which were on the house, were absolutely delicious. 

The main course (I ordered the gnocchi in a creamy, tomato-y sauce) was as good if not better. I paired with a nice Italian Pinot Grigio. The service from our waitress was excellent as well. Our waitress, other staff, and the owner himself were all very kind and attentive. I loved this place and will definitely be visiting the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Gelato is very good.  That being said, it does seem a bit overpriced for what you get.  

More importantly,service needs work...server refused to start scooping my kids gelato until I had paid, even though customer in front of me was taking forever to order from cashier.   She didn't seem to get that it was creating a huge bottleneck.   Starting other people's orders would be a lot more efficient vs. twiddling her thumbs....faster service equals happy customers and more revenue!  

That being said - gelato is definitely worth coming for."}
{"text":"We had a beautiful night in Little Italy. We stopped at several businesses and had a great time. After dinner we heard a trio playing at  La Dolce Vita. We told them we just wanted to have a drink and they pointed at a couple of different places we could sit. We sat down and then it went downhill. Water glasses filled on our table which we drank from and then after about 5 minutes, the waitress came over and took them away from us, and told us they were not supposed to be there. Then the bus boy immediately came back over with new glasses and gave us water. This was very bizarre. After a lengthy period of time a waitress came to our table and told her name was Karina and she would be our waitress. She was aloof and disinterested Again, after way too long she took our order and brought our drinks. The music was great the other staff members were friendly but she was so disinterested with us. If this restaurant doesn't want to seat non dinner eating patrons, just tell them so. We didn't tip her because she was rude and ungracious."}
{"text":"Went to this place just to try it out, but casa del gelato (a block down the street) is way better, the gelato here tasted watered down and not nearly as good. Also, we were suspicious about the container sizes, so we brought the kids cup and the small home and measured. They hold an identical amount... Not cool."}
{"text":"I was actually really pleased with this place- best gnocchi and tomato cream cause I have had in all of little Italy! Wine bottle prices were reasonable.  We also had the eggplant appetizer which was perfectly breaded and I thought the red sauce was not too sweet and seasoned well.

We were able to make a reservation on open table which was very convenient and actually how we originally decided on this place!

We were also served some fruit with o believe ricotta cheese/cream if some sort- so good and refreshing

We ate outside but not many tables out there. I did not really go into restaurant so can't comment on any of that!"}
{"text":"Omgsh! Seriously, the best Italian food I have ever had!!! Totally just drowning in flavor. Shout out to Terry, Alex and Laura! Amazing service and beautiful people!!!"}
{"text":"Hunting for a dessert place on a warm day in Oakville and I ended up here! In the heart of downtown Oakville....Great options including a full espresso bar with beans that are ground fresh for your drink and an array of desserts including gelato (regular & vegan), pastries. Lots of outdoor seating available which is a MUST for an ice cream place. The servers were also very friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here. The food is excellent and the wine selection is just right. The owner Terry is a true gentlemen and demonstrates how an owner should act. He took the time to stop by our table and say hello. Terry even brought a new pasta dish by our table for us to try. They even accommodated our friend who was gluten free. I only wish the service was faster. However when I was in Italy, it was typical for service to be slower allowing everyone to not be rushed to truly enjoy the experience. If that is the goal here, then it's perfect. This is still one of my favorite places to enjoy Italian food. Give it a try and go back more than once! You will fall in love just as I did."}
{"text":"The owner, Terry, is so friendly and generous.  He came around with a bowl of pasta and gave everyone a scoop.  This is what Italy must be like.  Charming!!!"}
{"text":"We grabbed a great outside table right on the corner.  Service was top notch.  I had the gnocchi which were average but the meat sauce was delicious.  My husband had the veal pavarotti which he really enjoyed.  Our two friends both had the fettuccine fellini which they raved about.  At the end of the meal they brought a plate of grapes and strawberries which were deliciously sweet.  The owner came around and chatted with us for a bit.  We really enjoyed our time and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The front windows were wide open and the space has high ceilings creating a nice breeze that made it feel like you could have been sitting seaside.  Random projector playing an old movie on the wall next to my head and the overdramatic and constant opera was a bit much but once the food came I forgot all about it.  

Very friendly staff.  

Food was very heavy on the garlic in the calamari but had a good sauce to dip the fresh bread in.  I got the mediterraino pizza - smoked mozz, zucchini, tomato...unfort the website is no longer so I cant confirm what else but I would get it again.  It was one of the best pizza's (that style) I've ever had."}
{"text":"I came for coffee and a bite to eat. The pizza slice was OK. Quite plain but fine for a quick bite. The latte tasted fine. Somewhat nutty which I liked but not robust. 50 cents extra for soy milk. Not much seating. I ate outside on the patio and shooed away a wasp. 

The gelato selection looked amazing but I wasn't hankering for cold and sweet."}
{"text":"I don't know about the food here but the service was TERRIBLE.  

We were sat right away but waited at least 15 mins for anyone to say anything to us.  An unapologetic waiter then came and took our appetizer order, only to disappear for another 20 mins.  We politely told the waiter that we were not going to have dinner there and just to go ahead and bring the check for the appetizer.  Again without any kind of apology, he walked off and this time just did not come back!  Not knowing whether we had a check to pay or not, we asked for a manager and even he would not come out!  

Everyone was about as rude and unprofessional as they could be, except the busser, who was on top of refilling our water.  I've been to Little Italy several times and always had pretty decent service so this was disappointing.  We may have gotten a bum hostess, waiter and manager, but with all the other places to eat on the street I would see no reason to go with this one.  

We walked across the street to Mia Bella, which has the same atmosphere, but the people there were 10x more professional and the food was good."}
{"text":"Since this place is kind of pricey compared to the rest of Little Italy, I've usually just stuck to their Ladies Night on Tuesdays. The deal is pretty good. Buy a drink and tip your waiter $2, and your meal is free. You still get bread and butter starting off as well. 

The portions are small during then, but what can you expect? Besides, after the bread, the portion was the perfect size to fill me up without making me feel like I was going to explode. Makes me wonder what the normal-sized portions of the dishes look like! I've had their pesto pasta, and it's delicious. Definitely the best pesto I have had by far. Maybe had a little too much oil, but that's usually how pestos are.

The ambiance is pretty romantic. For dinners they light the table candles and dim the room. They also have french movies playing on the wall at times, which is a pretty cool and unique touch."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The specials were amazing. We got the chicken saltimbocca and the salmon. Terrific"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for my birthday. I was VERY disappointed with the food, prices, and service. The reviews I read on line were mixed, but we decided to give it a try. My food was overcooked, and very plain. The server was missing most of the night. I also did not appreciate having a 18% gratuity added on to my party of 2. The wine prices were fair, but the beer prices were very high. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We haven't gone to LDV for 3 years because the last time was beyond horrible, well they have topped that, the owner is on some substance. The staff is angry, and the food crap"}
{"text":"I have visited Cleveland for the past 6 months and this was the best restaurant I visited.  Great Food! The service was exceptional and the wine was outstanding!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant several times because we love the location (Little Italy), and the food is pretty good. Last night I had the ravioli special which was delicious, creatively prepared and flavorful. My spouse's chicken dish, however, was overly salted, especially the spinach that was served on the side. The wait staff were excellent, friendly, knowledgeable. My biggest complaint about this place is that they've placed two large TV screens in the main room, one near the bar and one in the dining section. These huge screens just ruin the otherwise vibrant ambiance. The TV's create a really distracting, déclassé feel -- like a sports bar. If the management insists that people need a TV set to feel entertained at meals, couldn't they just keep the one near the bar and eliminate the other??"}
{"text":"If you can't go to Italy, go to Little Italy.

My love is Italian, and for his birthday celebration this year I decided to treat him to some Italian food.  Now, I'm not a huge Italian diner and so he is gracious with me and rarely demands I go get Italian food with him.  So upon this special occasion we entreated to La Dolce Vita.  

Stepping in the front door I immediately felt transported to another world.  I felt like I was on vacation in a quaint little Italian town.  Posters of opera and opera singers along with a random mixture of art litter the walls.  

Our server was very astute and answered all of our questions.  He even overheard me wishing my man a Happy Day and upon the completion of our meal brought out a mini-tiramisu for him.

Oh the wine list, it was magnifico. Do go and get a bottle...or two...or three and sit, laugh, love and talk the night away.

The veal was the pick of my partner, and oh it melted in your mouth.  I had a standard pasta dish, not thrilling in any way, but a nice dish all the same.

La Dolce Vita is great for night out.  Sit, relax, and enjoy your surroundings and a little bit of Italy."}
{"text":"Very romantic and enjoyable atmosphere. They usually have gift certificates on restaurant.com for those that want to try it out but are worried about spending a pretty penny. Although I can only afford to eat here on special occasions, I must highly recommend the \"Veal Pavarotti\". My favorite restaurant in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went last night, my wife ordered the eggplant parmesan and she couldn't cut it with a knife.  The breading was way to heavy, my chicken parm was just OK, at best."}
{"text":"The hazelnut and pistachio gelato here is amazing! Had it two days in a row...that's how good the two flavours are. Since it's gelato, it is a bit pricey for a small (2 scoops)."}
{"text":"Visited recently.  Ordered a bottle of Chianti.  The server poured me a small sip and I said it is ok.  It was hurried and I was busy talking with friends.  Later I felt the wine is not right - this was after he had poured a glass.  I must add I had ordered a wine from their menu.  This guy comes back and says we have replaced that bottle with this bottle (a completely different wine).  Rather than getting me the menu he has already chosen a wine.  Anyway this wine tasted really funny.  So I told him \"this wine is not good\".  He replied \"what... not good\" and laughed at me  and completely ignored me and went to do his business.  I was pissed and when he came back I had to remind him that the wine is not good.  At this time he said then why did you drink the first glass.  After a little argument he took the wine back and by that time I was done... so I ddint' order another bottle.  At the end as I went to restroom he was sitting at bar drinking that bottle and tells me what's wrong with the wine.  It is a great wine.  This is not how it is done.  You can't return the bottle.  Overall I felt unnecessary humiliated.  I have been drinking wine for 16 years and have never returned a bottle in the past.  Rather than drinking this bottle himself and humiliating me again, the waiter could have simply send the bottle back to the distributor.  Our total bill was 119 dollars on Sep 3 evening for a party of seven including the already included gratuity."}
{"text":"Like Fong, I actually enjoyed this restaurant.  Calamari, Stuffed peppers, Vitello (in bone, rare), Chianti Classico Da Vinci, and a salmon Risotto were our orders and though service was a tad slow, the flavourful servings were just about right in terms of sodium content.  Risotto was cooked well with just a tad of stiffness left.

I suspect that, like Fong, I haven't been eating in a little Italy, and my standards might be too low.  On the other hand, I enjoyed this place thoroughly, despite the relatively high pricepoint.

By the way, the wine selection is thoroughly Italian.  Even the californian wines have an italian twist.  The proprietor, Il Signore Tarantino, does indeed love the homeland.  

Ciao!"}
{"text":"Best Italian I've ever had in any city! Group of 4 so we sampled multiple menu items & specials. Every dish so delicious!! Owner & staff attentive and contributed to fantastic dining experience! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. The decor is very strange African masks on the wall random pictures very due for an updated. Based on food and ambience this place is very overpriced. In need a serious makeover! Other places like Nido's and Anthony's actually have nicer decor. I wouldn't waste your time or money on this place. Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"The food here is real good.  Not knock you over in your chair good, but most things are great.  It may be a bit exploitive, as other reviewers have mentioned, but really, almost the entirety of Cleveland's Little Italy is like that now, with shops selling posters of The Godfather and The Sopranos on the street.  

I also don't have a problem with them playing the movie for which they're named, although it might be nice to see some other Fellini movies, or maybe a John Belushi spoof of same.  That would crack me up.

The problem is the noise level.  Not too bad if there are just two of you, but we went with a group of nine, and you could only talk to the person beside you and no one else.  The trademark movie was not even playing, but the music was set to seven or so."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, on my top list of Cleveland, eggplants and fruit salad are super good, 

Word limit Word limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limit"}
{"text":"I had the greatest saturday late lunch here. Me and the bf went and sat by the open door to let a breeze in on a hot summer day and split a bottle of chilled white wine. The calamari is delic with the slighty zesty spicey sauce it comes in. The bread is good too. Then we had a pizza that didn't look that amazing but was really perfect. I suggest trying it out! And the ambiance was wonderful. Almost nobody else in there."}
{"text":"Groupon strikes again!  I usually stick to the old stand-bys in Little Italy (Mama Santi's, Trattoria) but thanks to Groupon, I was forced to try something new.  Now, I can't entirely say that I'm happy I did but I'd be willing to give La Dolce Vita another try when I'm not in a hurry.  My husband and I split a salad (arugula, goat cheese, tomatoes, roasted red pepper, black olives, served on a bed of lettuce) and a pizza (Mediterraneo -  tomato sauce, eggplant, zucchini, roasted red peppers, smoked mozzarella cheese) as well as the lemon sorbet and the tiramisu which was PHENOMENAL.  Definitely large enough for two people to share and pretty complex for tiramisu.  The salad and pizza were good but the crust isn't anything to write home about.   It seems like they haven't quite figured out how to get the recipe right.  

One plus about this place is their outdoor patio. It's large and bright and comfortable.  If I'd had the time I would have ordered a bottle of wine and lazily sat outside all day, eating bread and olive oil to my heart's content.  Oh well.  Guess it will have to wait until next time."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a happy hour drink and were treated to the best, most friendly servers ever!  The bow tie pasta appeared at our table as a special surprise and we were delighted with the flavors and creaminess of the sauce. As we paid our bill, we were treated to fresh peaches and Italian cream.  It was a delightful experience and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Really expensive! A little caprese sandwich with maybe 1 and 1/2 balls of mozzarella costs $10! Also the gojichino is really bad. Their stuff is good I guess but really overpriced and their portions are small. You can tell they're really trying to save money."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my family about 8 years ago, then again about 4 years ago and again tonight. Everytime it has been perfection!
This evening we were greeted warmly by the hostess who answered several questions for us. Our waiter suggested a fabulous wine and was super friendly. The owner came to our table to bring us salad and bread, at which time my sister and I inquired about the antique bar. He was kind enough to tell us the story of how he aquired it.
Then the food came and it was amazing. The halibut was wild caught and delicious. The pasta with creamy gorgonzola sauce was fantastic. 
I can not say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I rarely write negative reviews, but my experience at La Dolce Vita calls for it.

On a fall Saturday night, my boyfriend and I got dressed up and wanted a nice, romantic dinner in Little Italy with some quality Italian food. So we tried La Dolce Vita. What we got instead was an absent waiter who was extremely rude whenever he appeared, very expensive prices, crappy food, and an empty restaurant on a weekend night at 8pm. The only good thing about the experience was the bottle of wine.

What a waste of money. I was very tempted not to tip the waiter, as he was probably the worst part of the experience. I recall having him before at La Strada on East 4th street downtown when that was still open - and he was the same way then, so I know it wasn't just a one-time thing.

As other Yelpers have said, go anywhere else on the street if you're looking for a good Italian meal."}
{"text":"Terrible service, from the hostess to the servers, and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Had a great night at LDV. Went to hear some nice piano music by Neal Todten and sat inside, right near their old-fashioned Italian-looking bar. The owner Terry and server Abdul gave us great service, and Terry ensured the party was having a good time. The first-course pasta sample that Terry brought around was excellent -- a cheesy, scrumptious flavor that I can still taste 24 hours later (and it makes my mouth water). The other pasta dish we shared in a delicious marinara. Antipasto for the table was outstanding. My Italian -Anerican friend Gary suggested this place and we're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"One star for the location in Little Italy and one for the owner/manager. Nothing else seems to be working for this place.

We decided to get some grub in Little Italy (kind of last minute). Our go to Mia Bella had a one hour wait so we thought of giving La Dolce Vita (LDV) a try. Ok, we enter in and there is no host/hostess. Waited 10 minutes and finally had to go ask someone if we could be seated. Bartenders have eyes, they can call someone or help us (at least greet us).. but no, not in this establishment. They all seemed extremely busy talking to each other (and trust me there is no shortage of servers/bartenders/staff).

Ok finally the owner comes up and seats us next to a big table and from then our experience went downhill. Our server, a guy with glasses and a weird beard shows up after another 10 minutes of us being seated to ask us for our drink order. There wasn't a slight hint of politeness in his tone. Maybe he was too focused on the big table (big tip).

We order our food but we forget to order a sauce for our ravioli (and our server could care less). We sat there while other tables got better service (big table and other tables with different servers). Finally the owner comes over and gives us a sample of some pasta which he prepares for each table, and engages in some light conversation while scolding our server for not bringing any bread. 

Cut to the chase, our food comes. It's ok.. I ordered the fettuccine and it was clunky. While flavorful, I was already turned off by the service. Had to made an effort to ask for some more bread and some salt and pepper to decorate our food. Portion sizes are good and the food is ok.

I would never return to LDV even if this was the last restaurant standing in Little Italy. The owner is great and I wish him the best of luck but service is a major part of the restaurant industry. This is one instance where I would leave no tip, but I did with a big note (see attached picture). 

For all those visiting LDV in the future, if you get the same server (glasses and beard), find another table, restaurant or make sure you demand better service!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place on the corner with really cold beer and a laid back atmosphere. The menu for the feast is really good and priced the same as everyone else but I did not eat. I suspect it is delicious as are most places here in little Italy. It is also great to see some old friends!  Ciao"}
{"text":"I was really impressed when the owner brought around a bowl of sample pasta and sauce to each of the tables! And it was really good! But unfortunately it was better than the pasta I actually ordered. I ordered the Seafood Pasta, but the sauce tasted kind of metallic, and the seafood did not taste fresh. Luckily I had pretty much filled up on the Tomato Basil Bruschetta we ordered first, and that was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Hahahha let me start off by saying that me and my friends did not realize how pricey this place is until we sat down and looked at the menu (and I guess the environment around us). We ordered a couple of pizzas, the food was good but I expected it to be better in accordance with the price. Owners are friendly and really want you to like the food and care about your opinion. Waitresses were drinking and celebrating which I found a tad strange. Service could have been better considering the lack of business they had that night."}
{"text":"Came in here for a nightcap after dinner near by. They didn't have any of the ports listed on their menus. The ones listed weren't noteworthy in any event. 

Lucky the bartender who didn't seem like he had much knowledge of the options got a manager who gave us several options for desert wines."}
{"text":"One of the best gelato and coffees. I am waiting for them to open a store in Sarasota Florida. Best place to hang out with friends and enjoy a cup of nice coffee or scope of gelato."}
{"text":"On a picturesque summer visit to the University Circle area, my friend and I had a hankering for a tasteful dinner and a nice atmosphere. Walking under a train track, we came across a the sweet sounds and the clear air of Little Italy. This district was bustling and alive (in contrast to most of the rest of Ohio).  It was an enclave of life. The question was, where would we eat?

We came across this centrally located restaurant perched on a corner. The patio was oh, so inviting, with spirited opera recordings of Andrea Bocelli. We decided to scrap our college student value instinct and pay the price to sit in the tranquility of the patio. The service was prompt. Our water was constantly refilled. Warm, fresh bread was brought to our table with the nice touch of a creamy, rich butter. We decided to get some of the pasta dinners. For 17 bucks, I ordered the Abruzze which featured pasta with a red plumb tomato sauce and ground veal/beef. The meat tasted relatively high in quality. The tomato sauce was the forte. The tomatos tasted fresh and appetizing. They were full of Dolce Vita. 

But why only 4 star?  The issue was that I felt that the food was not quite worth the steep price. The pasta I could tell came right out of a box. Also, it would be nice if the dinner came with a side dish or something. My friend ordered the Fettucini Fellini only to describe it as good not great. So the food is not quite innovative or authentic. But if you are looking for a tasty enough Italian meal in a beautiful atmosphere where prompt service runs gracefully, La Dolce Vita fits the bill."}
{"text":"Okay...I've started out at three stars...not sure if it will hang in there.

If it DOES hang in there, then it's because the waiter, hostess and busser were all lovely people and were helpful. The food was what was a bit off. Which...hey...this IS an eatery. 

So, the magical Magic and I were together again, on a mission to get a replacement set of keys for my car, the current ones being 3-4 feet underground beneath my freshly-transplanted rosebush.

The mission was an utter failure. We needed pizza.

Driving toward Little Italy, I had it in my mind that we'd go to Mama Santa's, but the gigantic windows and breezy-ness of La Dolce Vita called from across the street. Who am I to turn down trying a new joint?

We jaywalked over to the hostess, a lovely lass who said it'd be fine to eat outside. They were just starting to set up, as it was a bit early...but they were glad to have us and made us comfy.

The waiter let us know about a couple wine specials, but we didn't take the bait. Magic was in the mood for something a bit more summery, and without a stutter he recommended a white wine with a slight pear flavor. He brought out sample tastes, and it hit the spot. Score for him and us.

The pizzas came out. I got pepperoni and mushroom, she got the four-cheese pizza.

Mine was...eh. It wasn't bad. But nowhere near the pizza that our favorite dark and dank place across the street fires up. 

Magic's four-cheese pizza made me yearn for my days in the Bronx, where I'd head to NY's true Little Italy (hint: Mulberry Street in Manhattan ain't it) and enjoy Giovannis four-cheese pizza, where the Gorgonzola bombs they'd strategically place would have you thinking about your last slice for a month. Fondly.

The food was disappointing. I feel bad...and I generally am a generous grader. But, being disappointed that you went there, on such an otherwise awesome evening, isn't a good thing.

So, La Dolce Vita. Keep the crew you got, keep the UNBELIEVABLE wine selection (tons of bottles, really)...but switch up the pizza recipe.

Their other food might be awesome. I hope it is.

But their pizza ain't."}
{"text":"Went here with friends on a weekend for a late lunch. My first observation was that this place was fairly empty for being situated in the middle of little italy; there were one or two other seated tables apart from ours. I had the venezia pizza, and tasted the marinara pasta, both of which I thought were bland and could have been easily/effortlessly recreated in my own kitchen for far cheaper. Several things about this restaurant disappointed me. The first was the inconsistent service, which was annoying because there were not very many people in the restaurant to justify this. Secondly, we were waiting over 40 mins. for our food...which certainly is way too long to be waiting for dishes like a small, thin crust pizza, a simple pasta, and polenta. Lastly, this place was certainly expensive, especially for the simpleness of the dishes we ordered and the small portion sizes."}
{"text":"Good but not great. There are better restaurants in Little Italy. For example: Battuto."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out after hours. The food is a OK. Keep your eyes open for the La Dolce Vita's wine night to say goodbye to Summer in style ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family as we were jonesing Italian food.

To share, we ordered:
- Two pizzas (the American w pepperoni & mushrooms and the Greek w artichoke, spinach, & feta cheese)
- Seafood pasta 

The food was a-ok, nothing to write home about. Considering the three star rating food, prices were quite high."}
{"text":"The vibe here is perfect!  Scene setting music, live plants everywhere, and the hostess (I didn't get her name) and the owner, Terry, make you feel more than welcome.  And then, the food!  The eggplant parm app, hot pepper special, and pasta were delicious!  CLE till I die."}
{"text":"We went here because it was the only place without a wait, but then we kind of figured out why. Overall, no one in our party was impressed. I feel a little bad leaving a bad review because the owner/manager seemed really nice. They forgot to give us bread to start, not that we really cared all that much, but when they did it was cold. One person in the party enjoyed the wedding soup but that was about it. I got the Chicken Parmesan and it just wasn't that great. Also, the pasta that came with it didn't have all that much sauce. They gave us a free fruit and whipped cream desert at the end (we assume for the bread incident, even though we didn't complain or anything). The desert might have been the best part, I really enjoyed the whipped cream. This was only my second trip to little Italy in recent years and I definitely try somewhere else next time 

P.S. In case they read these reviews, you really should consider updating some of your decor. Everything seemed old and worn out. Also, I didn't really understand the, what appears to be, African tribal masks behind the bar."}
{"text":"Had dinner their on Black Friday. I was skeptical because we showed up with a party of 6 and were seated immediately upon arrival with no reservations. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Immediately upon being seated we were greeted with a small sampling of delicious pasta. The bread arrived shortly there after. The appetizers were delicious as was the bread. The mussel appetizer wasn't overly garlicky or buttered which was a pleasant surprise. The main dishes arrived timely and each person finished their dishes, a tribute to how good it was. They also brought desserts which were not ordered for the table to share. This was due to it being my wife's birthday. All and all an excellent experience. The environment is the only thing preventing this from being a 5 star. The place itself could stand a bit of repair."}
{"text":"This was the first place I visited in Little Italy way back when I was in college at Case. Since then, It seems that the quality and service has gone down (explains the Groupons & Restaurant.com deals they keep having). If i gave this place a review then, it would have easily been a 4 star. 

This place offers typical italian foods like pasta and pizza, but nothing on their menu is unique or worth stopping in for. There are definitely better places in Little Italy that offers better quality food for the same price. Not to mention, they have a projector playing the 1960s movie (of the same name) on a loop, which I find to be distracting. Their downfall is perhaps due to the new restaurants that recently opened in the area that offers a better take on Italian food."}
{"text":"Great gelato. Really friendly service. The prices were a bit high for the portion sizes, but it was a special treat while traveling. The americano was good."}
{"text":"Went here because they were the only place without a wait.  I am giving them the 3 stars for the service which was great.  Even though Pizza was not on the menu they made one for my son. Sadly though the food was just ok & the menu wasn't all that exciting. Pasta was fresh, but the pesto & marinara sauces were very bland. I feel like they were over priced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Really, just terrible. Bad service, awful food, expensive. We took some westside family members to see Little Italy, and they insisted on eating at a place with outdoor tables -- the one bright spot, we had lovely weather. This was a Saturday afternoon, about 1:30PM. The place was mostly empty but even so, we had appalling service. Waited to get water, waited for our orders to be taken...waited FOREVER for our food and then longer for our check. I'd guess it took about 2 to 2.5 hours for 4 adults and one child to eat lunch! This was not \"leisurely\" but annoying. We had an antsy kid with us! The wait made us miss some of the things we wanted to see that afternoon.

Had the food been delicious, this might have been partly forgiveable, but it was just awful. I've had far better meals at Olive Garden. This was NOT authentic Italian food. I had an artichoke pizza -- a huge cracker-type crust topped with gobs of ricotta, CANNED artichokes (cold) and lots of canned spinach. My husband had \"eggplant de giorno\", which was two tiny thin slices of eggplant topped with giant globs of ricotta ($9). One guest had chicken parm, which was baked chicken with MORE RICOTTA and some pasta, and the other had fettucini with spring vegetables -- those were $22 and $24 EACH, with no salads. The fettucini which I tasted was gummy noodles, all clumped up, in what tasted like watered down Campbell's tomato soup. Seriously. Oh -- two people had lentil soup, which came lukewarm and mostly some kind of grain (barley?) and hardly any lentils. One person didn't even finish it! ($5 for a small bowl).

Bread was good, and the one nice touch was they brought us a complimentary bowl of fresh blueberries at the end -- maybe out of embarrassment at making wait such ridiculous times for such terrible food.

Probably the worst meal I have ever had in Little Italy. On top, when we went inside to use the bathroom, the restaurant is grimey and rundown, totally lacking in either charm or cleanliness. Staff is apathetic. AVOID! AVOID!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for an espresso last night. And sorry to say it was horrible, it was cold, extremely bitter and acidic. And an almond croissant, which was extremely stale. I usually don't write negative reviews, but I had been looking forward to that espresso all day .  We've had great flavourful espresso at Valentino's in West Hamilton, which is much closer to us.  Oh well you live and learn."}
{"text":"The food was just so-so. I would say this restaurant is definitely not worth the price. Atmosphere in the main restaurant area is nice, but there is additional seating on the side of the restaurant that is not as pleasing. The waiter seemed more like he was hustling tourists than trying to provide a quality Italian meal."}
{"text":"We felt like we walked into an old time, family-owned Italian restaurant when we stepped through the door. The owner greeted us as he passed, sat down with us and shared stories, then later fished out some complimentary Romano bow-tie noodles from the pot as he passed. The server was personable, knowledgeable and spent plenty of time with us explaining the best of the menu (everything).

The food was authentic, obviously fresh, with just the right amount of fresh spice. I highly recommend the Italian wedding soup and the chicken parm (tender chicken with just the right amount of crispness). My daughter was a huge fan of the fresh gnocchi.

The service was excellent, the food was generous and tasted great.

I wish there were fewer chains in the world and more restaurants like this. Thank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant 2014 and had the caprese salad.  The tomatoes were disappointing,  it was the middle of summer and I expected them to be more fresh. I decided to give the restaurant another try recently. I met some friends there and order the lentil soup as an appetizer. The lentil soup was vegan and absolutely delicious.  The server brought out some bread and it was very lackluster. The bread was your typical white bread, nothing special about it at all, not worth the calories. I ordered the seasonal grilled vegetable platter. I was excited about it as I really love grilled vegetables in the summertime.  The best part of our meal was the owner coming out with a pan in his hand with some kind of creamy pasta in it. He came to our table and spooned some pasta on each of our plates.  I do not eat cheese so I had to pass but everyone at my table loved it and I really liked the personalized touch.  It pains me not to taste the owner's creation to this day... But I digress.  I was instantly disappointed when they brought my entrée out, it was pretty much just a bunch of eggplant. I'm not a huge fan of a plan, I guess I should've asked what the veggies were but being that it was July I was expecting awesome kebab like veggies (peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc.  80% of the dish was eggplant with a little tiny bit of zucchini, canned artichokes and a garnish of diced tomatoes.  The zucchini was oily and the texture was chewy, it was almost an inedible.  For $19 I was extremely disappointed. Everyone else the table seem to enjoy their meal and everything looked good, especially the pesto. I have to say the service was also subpar.  On a positive note it's a great place to people watch on a beautiful summer day."}
{"text":"We loved sitting outdoors and enjoying authentic Italian cuisine. More than the food and ambiance, the servers were EXCEPTIONAL!! Valan and Abdul especially made this dinner worth it. They learned we were breaking our fast, and made sure we were well fed. We were treated like royalty, given a special house appetizer and dessert to break our fast. The recommendations were perfect. We chatted with our server throughout the evening. The service was quick, efficient, friendly, and the main reason I would go back (the food is awesome too!). Valan and the team, especially those who worked so hard even while fasting, were so memorable. After leaving, we all noted that their service alone made this one of the most memorable dining experiences we have ever had."}
{"text":"Great place to eat - the owner came right up to our table. He introduced him self and gave us a spoon fu ll of black bean pasta to try. Love the personal service!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times.  Great Gelato with many choices for options.  A bit pricey compared to others but not too bad.   They are quite clean and there's free parking out back."}
{"text":"Not good italian food, not very good food overall,  and way too expensive for what you get.  

Only go because of the outdoor seating (and ignore that the food isn't that great).  It's very enjoyable to sit in little italy and enjoy the music.  

The best thing about La Dolce Vida is the bread, and I'm rather sure they get it from Presti's."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance! The eggplant appetizer was delicious as was the pasta, wine and the tiramisu was amazing! Overall a great experience in Little Italy. Will Definitely visit again."}
{"text":"i do NOT love la dolce vita. 
but i don't hate it either.
it's just another mediocre restaurant that doesn't stand out positively or negatively, and compared to other italian restaurants, i know there are better ones.

the service is good though.
the inside is also really dark and kind of an older, dingy building that MIGHT be able to feel cleaner if someone did something, but who knows.

i've had the pizza here and tried the pasta... i'd say the food is \"fair.\" i was actually kind of disappointed with the pizza, which actually didn't seem freshly made and just kind of sub-par in general.

however, i haven't tried this, but i hear that tuesday night is \"ladies night.\" so if you show up and say you want to do \"ladies night,\" the entree is on the house if you order a drink."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant....Truly. My first experience wasn't that great,  so here I was a second time in hope for a better outcome...unfortunately that wasn't the case. 

In a line: the service is TERRIBLE! You would probablyl get better service at a self serve joint.Yes, it was that bad!

Upon entering the restaurant, which wasn't too busy for a Saturday night, our party of 4 was left standing at the entryway for over 10 minutes(yep..10) before I had to walk over,f lag down a server and ask if we should seat ourselves or would the MIA host/hostess miraculously appear at seat us. At least that managed to secure us a table however we were again left sitting, twiddling our thumbs even before we got water for the table! 

Our assigned server, Tony, had other bigger party (10 people) to serve and he spent all his time hovering over that table, catering to all their needs. Now, while I understand that a bigger table means more tip revenue, the server seemed to have forgotten that all customers are equal and can end up being potential bigger groups and repeated revenue generators if they have a good experience. 

The owner/manager was the only person holding fort to this place, filled with roaming servers but no service. He himself tried flagging down Tony several times before he got us some bread, took our order, got us some drinks. He also tried to keep us engaged while waiting for our server to show by trying to converse with us, bring us some complimentary pasta. 

Unfortunately the dining experience was so bad that I don't think anyone at our table, judged the food unbiased. We tried the calamari, fettucine, primavera, ravioli all that were good...but nothing to write home about. 

My previous experience at La Dolce Vita was similar. It seems the only way to get decent  service here, is to go in a big group, else expect to wait forever before getting any service. All that the servers here seem to care about is the tip and they don't care about being obvious about it. I think this restaurant's management should invest more time/effort in getting/grooming servers to be better at their job if this restaurant intends to be close to or at par to Mia Bella which is across the street.  

Overall: I think anyone looking for a decent dining experience should give this place a pass...not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Fantastic! This is old school Italian Hospitality at it's best. The Sinatra playing in the background with the owner Terry seating you and then tossing a table side Alfredo for a small plate for our table of eight. Jose was our attentive waiter offering great suggestions for apps, all were fresh and plentiful. I recommend the Veal bone in chop with a mountain of arugula salad. To die for. All pasta dishes were shared and enjoyed by all of us! We will be back. Thank you for a great New Years Eve!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant in Little Italy.  Food is more imaginative than the standard Italian American fare.  Service is wonderful - the owner makes sure everyone is taken care of.  We've come with our kids and have been welcomed generously.  (No kids menu but there is some flexibility in the menu)"}
{"text":"Finally made my first trip to Little Italy, and after driving down that strip of Mayfield many times, I somehow knew that La Dolce Vita would be the site of my first Little Italy dining experience.

I mostly have good things to say: prime location for people-watching, great ambiance (complete with Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" playing on the wall), decent wine list, good core menu with some tasty-sounding specials. A friend and I split a Calamari \"ceviche\" special (very citrusy and unusual, but good). He ordered Chicken Parmesan (traditional, though not overly heavy) and I ordered, appropriately enough, the Fettuccine Fellini - tomatoes, pancetta, gorgonzola, and a parmesan sauce. Very good, though from previous posts, you'll know that anything with bacon is a winner in my book.

Truth be told, my only complaints were minor: the whole of the front room gets a huge gust of cold air when the door is opened, and the bread wasn't super exciting. Aside from that, an excellent experience - I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok so when it comes to authentic Gelato in Oakville this is the place! They pride themselves on having staff that has studied Gelato in Italy, yes you read right, it's a full out 3 year course in Italy! It's an art there. 

They have amazing coffee and also pizza. One rough thing is there is no where to sit except a small amount of seating inside and some outside seating. In the summer its next to impossible to get a spot. 

Our whole fam really enjoyed the gelato here and they even had sugar free ice cream for my dad, who's diabetic. 

The owners wife was there when we went and she was the sweetest lady. I really liked the cups they used for cappuccinos and she offered to find the cost for me and possibly get me a set! How nice of her! 

Family run, authentic, you cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Pasta felt as though it was not fully cooked. Ravioli's were delicious though! We only went here because Mia Bella had a long wait. We came here and got seated right away.

Wine was delicious but, its from a bottle... so how could it be bad?

Sitting in the back up by the piano was nice as we could people watch and really see the entire room. If you dont mind being a little cramped, ask to sit up there."}
{"text":"Product is great, don't mind paying the premium price, even though portions are a bit small, however it disappoints to see it served in a cup that can only be described, as designed to rip off your customers. I don't think anyone appreciated that!"}
{"text":"Had a large group, 30+. Great pesto. Bad acoustics. Very accommodating for allergies in the group."}
{"text":"We took our Daughter and her dorm mates there for a Saturday night dinner. Everything was fresh and delicious. It was crowded but the service and the atmosphere was excellent. 
You can always count on Terry to bring of a taste of something special and make you feel at home."}
{"text":"One of the many Little Italy eateries.  A great place to go when you can sit outside, as the inside dining room is a bit cozy.  Really good appetizers and desserts, but entrees are not quite as good.  If the owner comes to your table, it adds to experience.  If he fawns over another table, not so much.  Nice wine list.  It is a great place to sit, people watch, chill, and enjoy some good Italian food and wine."}
{"text":"This is overpriced food. We got a pasta dish and all it was some sort of oil and few pieces of vegetable for like 17+ bucks. The chicken Pomodoro was completely average. The specials were 30+ dollars and what I saw come out of the kitchen was not that impressive. The pasta that came with the chicken was very good. I was also surprised we had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar with the bread. The bottom line high prices and very mediocre food. Hard to get a glass of water. The ambiance is pretty cool. There are better places in the burbs for Italian/American food."}
{"text":"Food was good, but did not reflect the prices.  Found a few things odd, like I wanted to change to Linguini for the Chicken Parm, but it was a $12 up charge because \"it comes pre packaged\"?? Someone else at our table added chicken to her Gnocchi and that was $9?  Lastly they rounded up the sales tax on the entire meal to an even number?  I don't get that one.  Never heard of a business \"rounding' up the sales tax.  Gee, who benefits on the overage there?

For what its worth, the food was decent.  Nothing spectacular for the prices, but for the prices on the menu I would have expected a lot more.  Service was 4 out of 10.  We had to ask for anything extra like bread, or parmesan cheese, but they did keep the water's full! And it wasn't busy, we were the only table on the bar side.

Probably will not be back. There is better choices in Little Italy."}
{"text":"So let's start by saying this place isn't the friendliest place on earth.  My friend and I went on ladies night, but we didn't realize that didn't start till 7.  The waitor was a bit short with us when we didn't order right away since we came in around 615, and didn't seem to be all that thrilled we were there.  The restaurant was empty with maybe 2-3 other tables there so it wasn't like he was even busy and we were taking up space. I got a summer shandy which was 5 dollars and my friend got a simple mixed drink that came out to be 8, kind of pricey I feel like for this establishment.  So I can't complain too much, with ladies night with the purchase of a drink, you get a free mini entree from a list.  When we got our meals I thought the noodles were a bit undercooked and still a bit hard for my taste, though the sauce was spot on (I had a meat sauce).  Overall a pretty disappointing night but maybe worth your time if you want a small meal and a drink.  I remember visiting this place over the summer and business was booming.  The staff was amazing and the food was pretty spot on so maybe it was just an off day.  Hopefully I visit again and my review goes up."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with friends on a Sunday night and the place was nearly deserted.  Wine was excellent, food was good, and the comp desert was to die for!  Pasta side dish for my chicken parm was not quite cooked to al dente, but the cream sauce and marinara were incredible.  I also agree with previous posters...the bread was very fresh & definitely delicious.  Will certainly give La Dolce Vita another try!"}
{"text":"Little Italy has quickly become one of my favorite areas to eat in Cleveland because of places like La Dolce Vita.  The ambience here is very welcoming, exactly how you'd expect from a family owned Italian restaurant.  The owner, Terry, came up to our table and made sure everything was up to par.  He also made sure we got a complimentary dessert for one of our birthdays.  

The appetizers we ordered, Baked Meatballs and Caprese, were DELICIOUS.  Everything was obviously fresh and made on the spot.  For dinner, I ordered the lentil soup while the rest of the table ordered pizzas.  The soup was great, but the pizza was even better.  Perfectly sized, a perfect cheese to sauce ratio, and a delicious crust made the pizza amazing.  The dessert, a tiramisu with mascarpone cheese and strawberry and chocolate drizzle, was the perfect ending to our meal.

La Dolce Vita has everything you look for in a family owned Italian restaurant: friendly atmosphere, great service, and delicious food.  I will definitely take another trip here when I'm in Little Italy.

This place has everything you"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. 

We sat down and literally waited at the table for 10 minutes while every server and bar tender just walked right passed us.

We got up and left after 13 minutes. 

We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Our first time in Cleveland and to this gem of a restaurant.  The owner, Terry, was welcoming and the staff was knowledgable and friendly.  The food was great - the pasta to a perfect al dente and the chop was delicious. If I lived here, this would be my go-to spot."}
{"text":"Good bread: chewy with a hard crust and nice flavor. Didn't expect it though. We ordered a pizza with veal sausage. Small for the price, only eight inches and that's the large size.  Very thin crust on the pizza. Sausage is good. Presentation not bad on an orange plate."}
{"text":"My current favorite in Little Italy. Tasty and the owner treats everyone like an old friend."}
{"text":"I recently went here for gelato with my friend and was pretty disappointed. The flavours tasted like their descriptions but the consistency felt like I was eating Bryers ice cream; it was not dense enough for a gelato. I'm also not a fan of the high prices and the raised centre within the cups. It's really unfortunate that Casa del Gelato closed down on Kerr St. because they were amazing! Now I don't know where to go for gelato!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for Christmas Eve dinner. We had outstanding Italian food! We were fortunate that they were open. Great food, great people and great service. I think we are going to make this a tradition. I'll say it again. What a great place. 

While we were waiting for our food. The owner came by with a sample of pasta with a pepper sauce. Also outstanding. !"}
{"text":"Overpriced and subpar food for the neighborhood. We had the calamari (fairly good), pizza (awful and not even freshly made dough, more of a pita and tiny),  and the Veal Parmesan (which we didn't realize was a $38 special, pasta was cold, and it tasted okay). $70 for a subpar meal without alcohol is too much. There is way to many other good places to eat in the neighborhood. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Among my top 3 in Litte Italy. Food is delicious here ans service is very good. It's true some prices are a little bit higher than around but you should absolutely try their Risotto del Giorno with the grilled scampi, which is one of the best things you can have in Little Italy. Only objection to the 5 stars is the fact that there's no AC during summer. When it's nice outside, it's nice outside but on really really hot summer days it's almost impossible to seat inside (even waiters struggle)."}
{"text":"Way too pricey for what you get.  $$$$$$$

The owner comes off as very suave and cool but you can make that choice for yourself."}
{"text":"Came down to La Dolce Vita for a quaint night of Operatic singing! They provided us a full-course meal for  $45/per and enjoyed a few glasses of vino. Terry is an exceptional host/owner for these cool events and it's worth coming out on a Monday. Anyways, what better way to top off a Monday than with food, vino, and delightful singing?"}
{"text":"As someone who lived in Italy, I know authentic food when I taste it. This place was amazing. The food was light and authentic. This is as motherland as it gets. I have looked for a restaurant like this in Los Angeles and have failed to find anything like it. . Prices are high but the food is worth it. I would fly from LA to Cleveland just to eat here :) Try it!!! I ate here twice in the course of 4 days :D"}
{"text":"I was quite unimpressed with this restaurant in Little Italy. We initially came to try Mia Bella across the street, but came as they were temporarily closed between lunch and dinner service, so we decided to try La Dolce as they were right across the street and still opened. I'm disappointed we did so. 

We were in a bit of a rush as we needed to get to the airport so we quickly placed our order of the Venizia pizza and the Abruzze pasta with the server who was attentive and kind. A second server quickly did bring out the bread and butter as is pictured below, so we were off to a fairly good start. 

However, when the food arrived, I was already quite displeased. For the price points of this establishment, this was nowhere near the quality I was expecting. The pizza was on uninspired dough with something I might compare with a lunchable. The pasta was in a relatively flavorless sauce with meager amounts of protein included in what I have to imagine is low quality boxed pasta. 

If not for the friendly service, I would likely give this place 1 star for the food. If this place was priced more appropriately and set my expectations easier, I wouldn't have been this hard on them, but for the location and with so many other italian restuarants nearby, the friendly service alone is not enough to make up for the incredibly overpriced elementary school cafeteria food."}
{"text":"I love coming here each time I'm in Cleveland! The atmosphere is so authentic and the food is amazing! My favorite by far being the gnocchi. The service has always been spot on and most meals they will bring around free samples. Last night we received the a fruit dessert on the house, delicious. Great place for a romantic date or just a great catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I've been to the big heavyweight joints of Little Italy before. This is one of the middleweights in size, but it's pure Rocky for championship cuisine and heart. The dining room is very old school charming, that famiglia business personal love over a generation oozing from every element. As we were looking at the menu the owner, topped with his pork pie hat, drifts up with a steel mixing bowl with a bit of farfalle caccio e pepe, a simple salt and pepper and cheese pasta, that's \"a little extra.\" Leave \"amuse bouche\" to the French and the faux. 

Our Caesar salad with pink peppercorns was amazing. Loved the accent those brought out of a shopworn standard without the easy fat and distractions of a bacon. 

When in a traditional joint, embrace the traditions. The ravioli was the best I've ever had, perfectly cooked and such a nice creamy indulgence in perfect marinara. 

The gnocchi were also house made beauty, and I loved that their meat sauce was more big crumbled and chunks of plum tomatoes so you got some textural relief from a dish that can be heavy and repetitive for mouth feel.

The service was excellent, charming, and my waitress even ran my jacket across the street and found me in Presti's Bakery to get it back to me! Where does THAT ever happen in SoFLA, my culinary center?

This place has great food and BIG HEART. A true champion, worth destination status when in C-town."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining at La Dolce Vita on a Monday evening at the dinner did not disappoint. The owner Terry is very passionate about food, service, culture and wine.

We started off the meal with an off menu dish of Farro which is a food composed of grains and wheat species. In Italian cuisine, Farro is sometimes, but not always distinguished as faro grande, farro medio and faro piccolo. The dish had a beautiful bouquet of garlic that came from the ramps. This is a North American species of wild onions. Just fantastic!

The seafood with risotto and the veal dishes were just delicious and spot on. We enjoyed a beautiful bottle of Cesari 2010 Amarone della Valpolicella. My suggestion was to decant it because it is just a fantastic and complex wine. 

The meal and the and owner taking pride in his food and service made the evening memorable. I look forward to my next visit to La Dolce Vita! Carry on!"}
{"text":"The espresso is strong, the way I like it. The gelato is obviously a favorite treat for the locals because their is a never-ending rotation of people coming in for it. They make the gelato daily and have a rotation of amazing flavors. (I especially loved the cinnamon flavor.) This was my favorite place to study and people watch for a bit on my visit to Oakville. They open at noon or else I would've been getting my morning coffee from here as well!"}
{"text":"Have you been to Italy and are craving that traditional pasta meal in Ohio?  If so, visit La Dolce Vita!  The pasta melts in your mouth and the freshness of the tomato sauce is bursting with flavor.  

The servers are attentive and the menu provides plenty of options.  At the end of your meal you receive a complimentary plate of fresh fruit and whipped cream which is the perfect end to a great experience.  Even better, you won't be in shock when you get the bill as it won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Seriously, an Italian restaurant that serves pita pizza? You've got to be kidding me, right?

Other notes: Sangrias cost $12 each. Service was slow. Italian wedding soup has no pasta. Yup, that 2 stars up top about sums it up."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for grandpas birthday. I ordered the gnocchi, it was good but not as great as Mia Bella's gnocchi. Atmosphere was nice and the servers and owner were very nice and you could tell they love what they do."}
{"text":"3/24/18 Cesar salad was great, especially with anchovies. Pesto Omar Chicken good, but sauce could be thicker. Chicken parm had nice crispy breading. Could use more cheese. Long Island not good. Classsico Cianti G good wine. By far best part of evening was the owner. Service was slow, so he brought out bow tie pasta, wine, grapes with cannoli filling on top and caramel tiramisu! Earned a fourth star and another visit just due to the awesome treatment."}
{"text":"I was told to write a review because if I did, my friend would not have been forced into a similar experience.  This place is overpriced and the food is sub par.  If you eat here, ask for prices so you are not surprise when ordering drinks, and make sure you order the house sauces on their pasta dishes.  Personally, I have yet to hear someone say something good about la dolce vita outside of the fact that it looks like a cool little restaurant.  If you want pricey food that is worth the price, leave mayfield road and walk west a little more or go to Mia Bella two doors down.  If you want good and affordable Italian food, stay on the opposite side of the street, to mama Santa or a slightly higher price point, the trattoria."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good and authentic.  There's a reason this restaurant has been around for 25 years...."}
{"text":"So many different flavours you can't go wrong! They have at least 20 different flavours that you can ask to sample. This time, I got the red velvet, the coffee, and salted caramel - all amazing! Reasonable price too but I don't remember the exact price since I was busy devouring my dessert - just go!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I might be a little biased since we had this amazingly awesome waiter who actually sang us an opera song (he had such a beautiful voice).  Now I know you all are wondering why was this guy singing opera at my table, well, it's because I was talking to him and in Philly we have these italian restaurants that have people singing opera throughout your meal and i like casually mentioned it to him.  Then he told me he was an opera singer and i believe next week they are having an opera night there where him and some of his fellow singers will be putting on a little show during a dinner.  Pretty neat right!

As for the food, i had the risotto de giorno and it is a veggie risotto with grilled prawns, seriously good.  My dude got the pasta bolognese and was disappointed with the type of pasta that they chose to go with it (the right kind of pasta makes or breaks a dish.

The wine was incredible we had the brunello that was on sale and it was magnificent.  The food came out a little too quickly for my taste.  I hadn't finished my salad before the food came and I hate the plate tradeoff that happens then.  Although my dad and my dude were already done and their plates were already cleared, I just eat slow.

Overall, I like this place, the food isn't knock your socks off, but I am biased being from an italian family and coming from a majorly amazing place for italian food like philly, but i do dig it for sure."}
{"text":"The complaints about service seem a bit harsh. This place was swamped, had several large parties, and our table of four was still finished within and hour and 15. Our waitress disappeared a few times, but that wasn't unexpected given how busy it was. The food was awesome. We had ravioli, pollo pomodoro, fettuccini fellini, and pesto pasta with a bottle of Chianti, and everything was warm, well presented, and tasty. A very filling meal before the orchestra."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars. Most people were sitting outside, and there were only about 2 groups inside. Our server was incredibly busy for some reason though. Like there weren't enough other servers, or the other servers were pranking him making him do all of their work too. We asked for more bread, never got it. He probably walked by us 10 times as we sat there with our menu's piled together to show we were ready to order. Asked for more bread, never got it. Finished our meals, waited 20-25 minutes for our food to be cleared in front of us, mind you, not busy at all. 2 tables of people on the whole inside of the restaurant. He probably walked by 20 times without eye contact. Randomly plopped a tray of fruit down on the table without explaining why, or what it was for and ran away busily. He wasn't slacking, just not communicative. 

Food, so so depending on what you got. Chicken parm was good, and the pesto pasta dish was decent. Although 2 people ordered it and one plate had way less on it. Ravioli probably tasted the best. It was really good. 

The worst was the pollo pomondore (spelling?), the chicken came out kind of cold and soggy. The marinara was watery and had no substance. The dish was akin to going to a local fried chicken joint, putting a piece of cold breast on a plate, and adding some noodles and a tablespoon of red sauce. I didn't taste the wine it was sautéed in, nor were there any cherry plum tomatoes on top.  Just order the chicken parm."}
{"text":"This was an incredible meal with even better service!  Right when we talked in we were greater and sat by, Terry, the owner.  Terry gave us a choice location and started the evening off great.  Upon being sat, Chris greater us at the table and provided some incredible recommendations along with an overview of the Cleveland area.  5-stars all around and we look forward to returning when we visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"If u have to write a book for a review like Haleigh, u will reveal your lack of good taste. We had the Abruzze and Venezzia pastas, perfect. Both flatbreads were delicious. Loved the ambiance and will be back again for more. See how easy it is! Don't waste ur time reading pulp fiction. There is a good reason Italian food is the most popular!"}
{"text":"La dolce vita? Well, I didn't really feel like I was living the sweet life when I ate here, more like La costosa vita (the expensive life).  Food was good, sure, but not the best I've had for the price we paid.  Plus, we were seated at what is probably the smallest table ever for 2 people.  Dishes were precariously balanced and sticking out of the edges of it, at any moment ready to fall over for it was one of those really tiny circular cafe tables that are actually probably only meant for one person.  

After we got our orders placed, our waiter then drifted off, nowhere to be seen until the very end when we needed our check.  Our meal itself consisted of a pasta dish and a seafood risotto.  Both tasted ok, but I felt like there was something missing in them that needed to be added for extra oomph."}
{"text":"We went to La Dolce Vita to celebrate my birthday. Everything was amazing - from the food to the service. The owner even came around to check on us several times. It was a very special dinner! Thank you for making my birthday so special."}
{"text":"Very good authentic italion food.  Very nice atmosphere with good service. Recommendations by the owner were spot on."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why La Dolce Vita has gotten such poor reviews. I went here on Saturday evening in January and immediately grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered a house cab and my man ordered an Elliot Ness. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari. It was amazing! I never had calamari that was not fried, and it is now my new favorite! The main course was even better. I had the special of sundried tomato mozzarella ravioli. It was so refreshing to have a type of pasta that was not in a cream or marinara sauce. My boyfriend had the abruzze. It was just the right mix of beef and veal. The best part is we both have left overs!! We had great service sitting at the bar. I loved how you can tell it is a family owned restaurant by all the family pictures lining the back of the bar; it felt so old world. I will absolutely be going back to La Dolce Vita again!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Restaurant! Awesome atmosphere and a wonderful staff. Also great to see Terry the owner! Food was absolutely wonderful. Authentic Italian food and really a pleasure to dine there!!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and I think the average rating is about right.  Food is slightly overpriced for what you would expect, no WOW factor.  I do like their antipasto platter, Italian wedding soup, pizza is better then average.  

I recently brought 6 people to La Dolce Vita and 4 out of 6 of us really enjoyed our meals.  The other 2 kept saying how bland it was.  I tried each dish, cause sometimes I don't think my friend's palates are working right, and I did agree.  Skimped a little on the fresh herbs and spices.  So for food its hit or miss, just don't be afraid to ask your server what their favorite is.

Now Vita's location is awesome.  The restaurant is rustic looking and just fun.  Small to medium sized bar and really knowledgeable bartenders / servers.  Its cool for a night to hang with buddies or even date night.  I would highly suggest that if you have a bunch of friends and plan on hanging out in Little Italy, then hit a couple places where each of you guys take turns buying a couple appetizers.  

FYI - La Dolce Vita is my preferred place to go in Little Italy, just hope the food jumps a couple levels so it can be THE ONLY place to go."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to eat here but I have had drinks here on several occasions. What makes this place stand out is the owner Terry. He was very welcoming and made my group feel right at home. He even gave us some wine grapes to sample. This place will be my new go to whenever in little Italy simply because of the hospitality."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I was visiting Cleveland... The service was great, food (especially the chicken) was amazing and I loved how fresh the bread was... I hope to go back next time I am in the area.... I think it's definitely worth the cost, you don't find great Italian places everyday, and this one has definitely ranked on the top 5 of my list. Check it out."}
{"text":"I took my wife to LA Dolce Vita for Valentine's day. While we expected a wait being a busy day, our service was less than desirable.  We were seated quickly, only to wait 20 minutes for a server to bring water and bread. Another period of time went by before we ordered. We were told it would be 30 minutes for our food to come. We set a timer and 62 minutes later we had our food.  Never once did the server come over to refill beverages or to update us on our order.  The owner sat at 2 tables near us to talk with customers and was just clogging the walkways for the servers. He never spoke to us or asked about or order.  Unfortunately this will be another place I will not be returning to any time soon."}
{"text":"My wife and 2 of our friends ate here prior to attending the CMA Summer Solstice Party in June.  The restaurant was mildly busy.  Service was terrible, a party seated after us received their food before us, it took forever to order a bottle of wine and most importantly my wife's food came out cold.  We will not return."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Little Italy atmosphere. Reading other reviews I wonder what I'm missing. The food is simple, but the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. My palate may not be highly refined, but I'll try anything and if it's nasty I won't be shy. I've never had a service problem either. Maybe my expectations are a little lowered due to the atmosphere. If you're in Italy your service would be much worse! I spent some time overseas and in most of Europe they eat like it's an event and are never in a hurry. Now I usually do go here on Sunday afternoon/evenings so the crowd is more likely to be families and couples that live near by. 

I made a reservation through OpenTable since I had a Groupon and it stated clearly that reservations were required. Of course when we arrived the place was only half full so it was no problem being seated immediately. Within a minute we had water, then a moment later we were greeted by Jengus (spelling may be atrocious here) who was very friendly. I had a reasonably priced glass of Pinot Noir that was about average. There was a more expensive glass that I was tempted to try, but will do so on my next visit.

The wedding soup was a little pedestrian...I had to add salt. The mixed green salad was simple, but quite flavorful with the tangy balsamic and feta. We shared a small quattro-formaggi spinach pizza that was amazing. The fresh spinach, 4 different cheeses all adding a little something and the crust was perfectly thin and crisp. The pesto Omar was also perfect. I know it's a simple dish, but I believe it was done so well. The pasta just slightly al dente and oh the pesto sauce...I probably moaned a little too loud and got a look from a diner nearby. Eh, I don't care...I'd do it again! I do love a good pesto.

We received the complimentary fruit plate with our check (could have done without the sugar water on it, but it refreshed) which was a nice touch. After the 40 dollar Groupon (I bought for $20) the check was at $7.00. Now that's a deal to me  I'll be back!

Maybe try a Sunday lunch/dinner here as I just love it. I'm not Italian, but maybe in a past life. I love the big Sunday dinner and then home for a big Sunday nap."}
{"text":"Love the old world feel of this restaurant! The owner is always so accommodating no matter how many customers he has.  The last four times we've been here we've been given free samplers of fettuccini and free shared dessert at the end of our meals. The food is very good, though the wait may be half an hour or so on the weekends. Reservations recommended. Quaint ambiance, ageless clientele, and a warm family welcoming; all that you'd ask for in a restaurant in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Great food! Good wine! Decent building, decent staff. Decent Prices. Seafood pasta and the daily special roasted red pepper raviolis were spectacular. Had a \"super tuscan\" wine, Le Volte, which was delicious. Capped the meal with free fruit and it was a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Spent a lovely afternoon here with my fiancee. We sat at the bar and were very well attended by the bartender. He was always there asking if we needed anything else and refilling our water glasses. After munching on a few appetizers he even brought us a plate of fruit for \"dessert\". 
It was nice to sit and watch the foot traffic go by on Mayfield. A wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

I've had the food here and have always been pleased, except on Ladies Night (Tuesdays I believe). Ugh. Worst pasta I've ever had on a Tuesday. I guess that's what I get though. I'm sure the stuff is made in bulk around 4 pm and kept warm all night. Ick. 

That being said, have always been pleased with my meals on other days. Not amazing, but always good people watching and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Found this place on Sunday morning quest pizza. The cafe vibe struck my interest,  even though it's definitly a full service restaurant. The menu is a smaller but offers soups, salads, pizza, and large dish entres. 

We went 2 large pizzas, which sounds like a lot for 2 people but it was really the perfect amount. They're flat bread pizzas, and a large is only 8 inches. The spinach and artichoke pizza was okay, the pepperoni was definitely better. They were filling without the dough - belly shame.

While the food was alright, the company was spectacular. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. Even more so, the owner was amazing. He stopped by multiple times during our lunch just for good conversation. If the food won't bring you back, he will, especially when he mentions plans to start serving brunch. I'll definitely stop on by again for that."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland so I could run the Rock n' Roll half marathon. I needed to find somewhere to carb load. What better place than Little Italy. We walked up one side of Mayfield and down the other looking at menus. We chose LA Dolce Vita. We were seated promptly. It did take a few minutes to get waited on but once the waiter took our order the service improved tremendously.  They give you warm bread to start. It was warm & delicious - a wonderful mixture of salt and sour. It was a yummy treat for my hungry tummy.  We ordered Mediterrano pizza - a smokey mozzarella cheese, eggplant, squash, and red pepper. The red pepper was wonderfully sweet paired with the smokey cheese. It hit the spot! I chose the seafood pasta with mussels, shrimp, and calamari with linguini in a wine sauce. It was s little spicy but certainly tasty! The hubby chose the pesto pasta creation and it was perfection. All in all it was a great choice and the atmosphere was great too!"}
{"text":"I will admit off the bat that I am a returning customer. Often you will find my motorcycle parked out front after a long day of riding, cooling off with some gelato.

It is a small locale with some indoor seating and a bit of outdoor seating. The outdoor tables are great to watch the cars and bikes go by.  

They have a vast selection of different gelato flavours that are so intense with flavour, they will make your mouth go bonkers! Personally I don't like very sweet gelato, so I stay away from the chocolates and bananas (and surprisingly the coconut!) and instead opt for something a bit more sour - my die hard favorites are the lime-mint and the blood orange. If you haven't had these, I strongly suggest you try them! And try them you can! The staff will gladly allow you to sample a few flavours for those who are indecisive like me. 

There are a selection of other food items and beverages, none of which I can recite as I can't help but to order gelato every time.

The line system is a bit weird and confusing, as they want you to pay at the cash first and then move towards the right where the gelato is (you will often see people entering the line the other way).

The only reason I give this place a 4-star instead of 5* is due to the prices which are on the higher side. Then again, it is downtown Oakville!"}
{"text":"Gracious hospitality makes it feel like you are living the sweet life! You know you've found a winner when you can spot the owner walking around the dining room serving up pasta on a Friday night. Great spot located in Cleveland's Little Italy."}
{"text":"\"Ubriaco Depravazione\" stop 3.

After stepping back out onto neon and fall leaves spattered Mayfield road, we all marched into La Dolce Vita( which is Italian for \"the suite life of Zack and Cody\"). It was empty and i assume the kitchen was closed. Although....the most gorgeous woman i've ever seen in Little Italy was nursing a plate of something at the end of the bar. Myself and yelper #@!! were awestruck by this Mediterranean marvel. Vorrei punzonare tutti qui al viso, qualora lo desiderasse, mia bella melanzana fiorire. That's Italian for \"i would punch everyone in here in the face, if you so wished, my beautiful eggplant blossom.\" Sorry, i've been hooked on the Italian translator website ever since. 

Anyhow, i only had a Bass ale, others kept downing the vino, and some sobered up with shirley temples. The view of Mayfield is incredible at night from their bar. Very metro and hip, as was the SATC-esque music they were bumping. I think i might have eaten here like five years ago, but can't be sure. I give it four stars(or stirs if you will, hehe) just as a cool place for a drink."}
{"text":"Love it every time! Food is great, outdoor people watching is a treat and valet parking makes this fantastic restaurant even better! 

Cannot wait to come for Opera night on Mondays!"}
{"text":"One of my fav Little Italy spots! They always treat you like family! The sangria is divine and all of the pastas and pizzas are to die for!! Always fun to sit outside in the summer! Love it here"}
{"text":"We are visiting Cleveland for a trip to the Cleveland Clinic and wanted to get away from the hospital and hotel. We found this place unexpectedly and had a wonderful dinner, the owner even came by to share a taste of a roman pasta dish with us. Very authentic Cleveland italian restaurant with a good atmosphere and good food.  The bruschetta was great too."}
{"text":"You need to eat out on La Dolce Vita's sidewalk patio.  Not only is the food excellent and the wine reasonably price but the people watching is superb!  Plus there are occasional strolling operatic singers and the quite mumbles of Frank Sinatra being played from speakers throughout the street that all really get you in the mood for a great date-night.

We ordered the Italian Wedding soup which...maybe it's regional?  It tasted a bit bland and had egg in it...so it was different that what we were expecting, but still good.  

For entrees, we got the Gnocci with Felini Sauce and the Chicken Parmesan.  Both were great!  I especially want to recommend the Felini Sauce, it's a creamy tomato sauce with pancetta.  It's heavy but delicious!  The food was fresh, well flavored and very filling.  

The prices are a little high, but they are throughout little Italy so you can't really blame Dolce Vita for that.  

I'd probably give them a 4.5 star if that was available, but hey...it's my favorite stop in Little Italy for a reason, so 5 it is!"}
{"text":"We struck out at Mama Santa's and decided to return to Little Italy hoping for a better experience.  Though we had a wonderful server, the food really fell flat.  One person ordered chicken parmesan and it tasted like boiled chicken with melted cheese.  Another ordered pizza that was fairly decent.  The rest of us ordered pasta dishes and agreed that they reminded us of the store bought pasta and pasta sauces from Trader Joe's... but with prices in the range of $15 to $20.  My advice is to either find a better restaurant or buy some decent pizza and pasta at Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"Nope.  Not again. Long wait for food, bland calamari, REALLY salty pesto, badly cooked risotto, and the bread...what a disappointment!  .  I would elaborate more, but the place really isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Such fantastic gelato, but my favorite thing at La Dolce Vita is the cannolis - soooooooo good! I go get them everytime we go to La Dolce Vita and just gobble them up! I love this place!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special. Typical overpriced Italian food. I actually didn't get pasta- got lamb and it was decent. It was off the specials menu. Nice atmosphere though and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Local and family owned Italian restaurant in Cleveland near the Cleveland Museum of Art. We had an amazing family dinner there after s long day at the museum. Get there for dinner early lest you wait an hour for a seat--or make reservations. The owner was very friendly, visiting every table at least once during your dinner to come chat and say hello. Love love love! Don't forget to ask him how he's doing after he asks you;)"}
{"text":"From Kim/Brunswick- Stopped in for a late lunch today and enjoyed the Pesto Omar and a glass of wine. Both were delicious and I loved the simple atmosphere of this restaurant. Velan at the bar (I apologize if I spelled your name wrong) was so wonderful to talk with. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant and they also have an Opera night coming up on April 23rd."}
{"text":"food here was amazing--haven't had italian food this good in a while.  the stuff here in SF north beach is either boring, or too california-ized.  This place had some great traditional dishes that were very tasty.

they gave us bruschetta on the house, and we ordered a pasta dish (their special) that had these little chunks of handmade pasta in it--kinda like orzo except way more chewy. it was mixed with the occasional bit of corn, and some mushrooms, and other finely chopped fresh ingredients, and topped with some perfectly pan fried chicken and some parmesan cheese.  amazing.  I wish I could remember the name of the pasta at least.

we also got a calamari sauteed with white wine, a simple salad of some sort, and a small pizza.  Everything was great. 

The owner served us some things himself, and checked up on us several times during the meal.  one of our group was a muslim, and he assured us that there was no pork in the kitchen--three of his chefs were muslim, and they have plenty of muslim and jewish clientele..

Seriously, I did not have a single complaint, and the food was awesome.  Wish they were in california."}
