{"text":"Good beer selection, especially a lot of yeasty brews that help with the spices.  I feel this suffers from the same disease that many SE Asian restaurants in America possess--spice is seen as a substitute for flavor, instead of a complement.  Non-spicy stuff like spring rolls were generally bland and even staples like the tofu and sticky rice were a let down."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, an extra star for the service.  First, the service: We brought a family group of 13 at 8:45, just 15 minutes before closing. Yes, we're terrible. Still, they set up a nice table for us and were friendlier than they had to be. We had an 18% gratuity factored into the check, FYI.  Second, the food. It was good, but I think they played it safe. A couple good curries, especially the one featuring mango/pineapple, but the tofu stir-fry (with peppers) was pretty underwhelming, in my opinion. Safe vegetables, muted seasoning, safe, safe, safe."}
{"text":"Considering the original location, I don't know what is up with this restaurant, but they need to step it up.  My partner and I eat here more than we should due to convenience, but the Willy st. Lao Laan Xang is far superior.  Atwood does barely enough to get by, although every once in a while, I swear the food has a funky smell and the vegetables don't taste fresh or of high quality.. the spring roll sauce tastes like peanut butter and the egg rolls even taste \"off\".   The place always seems busy so I just don't get it..  and there's really no excuse anyway.  Having eating at the Willy St. location a few times recently (after a period of eating at the Atwood restaurant often), I've realized what a waste of time and money this location is... If you can make the trip down to the original restaurant at 1146 Williamson Street, do it!!    Skip the Atwood location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Like many others I'm a creature of habit here. Every Sunday we order 2 #28 the mango curry careful spice, 1 with tofu 1 with chicken. We've been doing this for a year and still aren't sick of their food. The 3 mushrooms dish is also good, very tasty sauce. Large portions."}
{"text":"So good. I am a vegetarian and there are so many things offered here without meat. Often times, restaurants throw something on the menu that is veggie and it tastes blah. The flavors in these foods are complex and delicious. My father eats meat and loved it too. The star was the tofu egg rolls. We both loved them!"}
{"text":"I tried the Thum Som listed under the house specialties - Pounded in a mortar, fresh garlic, chillies, shrimp paste, tamarind, lime, cherry tomatoes, thai eggplant, fish sauce and unripe papaya served with sticky rice and grilled chicken.  I ordered it Lao Native hot or 4 stars.  This had a decent heat level, though more like 2 stars to me, with the juice at the bottom at about 2.5 stars.  Overall a good dish, though the chicken seemed a little dry.  This was easily remedied by mixing the meat with the papaya medley.  I would go back to try the other dishes.    The glass which came with my Coke seemed to have the dried residue of the previous contents, it looked like it had some other spots too.  I just drank from the can.  The couple that sat next to me seemed to get some old wine which had they had replaced.  Apparently according to the server, they don't get many wine drinkers."}
{"text":"After some discussion, we decided we wanted to have our rehearsal dinner at a restaurant we always enjoy eating at - Lao Laan-Xang. Sone was very helpful in getting everything sorted out for our Friday afternoon luncheon for nearly 30 people. We had more than enough food - spring rolls, kang gai, four different entrees - plus crab rangoon and mango sticky rice from the house. The pace of the food was great and we wrapped up exactly when expected to head for the venue for the ceremony rehearsal. Compared to any other places we considered for the rehearsal, Lao Laan-Xang was fantastically reasonable. I would happily have them cater an event for me in the future - or just go for dinner (which I did just this past weekend)!"}
{"text":"A friend was having her birthday dinner here and I was the first to arrive from our reservation. Thankfully the table was ready a bit early, unfortunately I was left alone without so much as water until someone else arrived 10 minutes after me.   We started with spring rolls, which were a disappointment. No discernible meat in them at all.   I ordered the Moak Pa, which is supposed to be a specialty. I asked for it to be \"timid\" and was stunned when the vegetables had no flavor and the fish (I had ordered chicken, by the way) was so spicy it burned my lips and I couldn't tell what I was eating (my husband pointed out that it was fish).   The real killer was the service though. Our waitress was cold and unfriendly. When one couple decided to share an entree because the portions are large she rolled her eyes and snarled \"they taste good as leftovers too\". After our drink orders she asked for appetizers and walked away before we could answer. When we called her back she again rolled her eyes at us for making her come back to get our appetizer orders.   When the check came she did not ask if we wanted it split (despite that we were sitting in distinct couplings). When we took it upon ourselves to mark which each group would be paying for she became increasingly agitated and finally demanded one of our party come with her to calculate the totals (we wrote 1,2 or 3  next to our selections - it's not like we were using Morris code). Once that fiasco was over she slopped our food into take out dishes at our table and then walked away after saying we could divide up the leftover rice ourselves. And the next day I checked my bank account and she must have run my card twice because it showed I was double charged.   Between the either incredibly bland or super spicy food and the dismal service this place will not be getting my business again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the Pho and curried squash.  Multiple spice levels available.  Native Lao level is really strong, just like I like it!  My wife can't handle any spiciness and when she says level zero, they honor it and she likes eating here.  Nice place in a fun neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing here, and I'm never disappointed -- Squash Curry with tofu at two stars for spiciness. The people that work here make for a very pleasant dining experience, although I'm not averse to takeout from here if life demands for it. I wish they offered brown rice, but that's my only criticism."}
{"text":"I have to say I am pretty disappointed with the service I got from Lao Laan Xang this evening. I ordered delivery, as I don't own a car and I don't much feel like leaving my house on this cold night.   The main reason I am giving this 2 stars is because of the horrible experience I had with the delivery driver. It was bad enough I don't know that I care to order from them again, or necessarily even go to dine in. I had said over the phone I wanted to pay cash, as I usually try to do with delivery. I realized when the driver got here I was short money for the tip, so I informed of this and asked if I could call the restaurant and pay with my card so I could then tip him in cash. He was extremely rude to me, and told me that was not possible  and I HAVE to sign a slip (which is not true, I am authorizing the payment I don't care about a credit slip and the slip doesn't have to be signed in a worst case scenario situation. I told him I didn't need a slip. I have worked in restaurants for years and have had slips not signed and it is still ok to put the charge through).   He then told me in a very sarcastic rude tone of voice maybe I should just make sure I have enough cash when I order and there wasn't anything else I could do about it. Again,  there was things that could have been done that he pretty much refused to do and treated a customer like trash. I apologized multiple times, and I offered to run across the street to get more cash out of the atm. Regardless, he was horrible to me and left a very bad taste in my mouth. I realize it was my fault, but it was a mistake and he had no right to treat me the way he did. I called the store right away and complained, and whoever answered was very apologetic and told me that I could have called with my card number after all (as I knew I could) and she told me she would talk to him. I hope he is talked to, because I will no longer be a customer of lao laan xang.   I have been a server for a long time and would never treat someone that way. Now, feeling bad I started to eat my dinner. I got chicken satay and mango curry. The chicken satay was pretty much ice cold (which I somewhat expect with delivery, but not that cold) and was not cooked all the way through and made me sick after I took a bite. The mango curry was ok, but I have had it better other places and other times I have ordered from lao laan xang. All in all, I will just choose somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"The Food was great! No complaints! I had curry, very tasty. The service is not so good though... got the job done but pretty moody. I dont care if your having a bad day, put on a fake smile."}
{"text":"I have to say I have always been a big fan of this place. The first couple of times I went I really liked it. I was torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars, just because I went there today and was disappointed. A lot of the curry dishes taste so similar it is hard to tell them apart sometimes. Also I wonder if the curry dishes are made to order or pre made and then scooped out when you order them?Also there were way too many pototoes in the curry dish. I think there should be a good mix of vegetables in it, more green beans, more carrots, more squash..not just an overload of potatoes. That makes me think they are cutting corners because potatoes are cheaper then some of the other vegetables."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We had tickets to a show at the barrymore next door, and had heard good things.  2 of the 3of us arrived first, and were seated right away..there were only a couple other tables.   We ordered drinks, which took at least 10 minutes to arrive. (and in the meantime,a second waitress tried to take a drink order again. We mentioned the delay to the 2nd waitress, who came back and said our waitress was talking, and she didn't want to interrupt her (!?)  When our drinks finally arrived, the original waitress thanked us for our patience.  Our third party arrived, and we ordered 2 appetizers.  The spring rolls arrived in just a few minutes, but the satay took 10.  It was warm (not hot), but was ok.  Multiple appetizers for one table should really come out together.  We each ordered dishes covering the varied spice levels, but on receipt, my companion who ordered the \"cautious\" level found it nearly too hot to eat, while the \"adventurous\" level I requested was so bland as to not have any apparent spice at all.  (and for a dish listed to be \"in a peanut sauce\", it should be noted that a small amount of sauce was simply poured over the dish, rather than actually part of the dish itself). Our third asked for \"timid\", and was happy with the level for her dish.  We  brought the spice error to our waitress' attention, only to be told that 2 different people made the entrees, and she offered to bring more spice for my dish, but made no offer to redo my companion's too-hot dish.  Since we were on a time restraint, I thanked her, but passed -she brought it anyway.  We asked for boxes, which arrived almost immediately and were the one item to arrive at our table the fastest.  The check arrived, with the full price charged for the incorrect dishes, not even an offer to take off even a token amount, nor even the standard \"come see us again\".  It's a shame, since I'd heard such good things, but I won't be back anytime soon.  Perhaps things are better at the Willy St location."}
{"text":"I've had a really mixed experience with Lao Laan Xang.   First, they took over my favorite place of all time: Savory Times (holla!)  But then I was seduced by the crab rangoon and shrimp toasties. It was incredible. They were puffy. My optimism was dashed when they refused to put me on the list, only to seat another couple who had just come in. We went into a deep spiral when I waited more than twenty minutes for the waiter to take my order. And still deeper when the waiter used my table to hold dishes he was giving to someone else. ???? That's bad....  Every time, I go back for the great curries and those rangoons, but most of the time I regret it.  I'm not really a fan of turbulent relationships, so I'll have to put this place off to the side. Sorry Lao Lan Xang, your service really has to kick it up."}
{"text":"The honeyed chicken with cashews and fried rice are my favorites - and the delivery is nice. Very flavorful, and my wife loves the curry squash.  The reason for the 3 stars? They get my order wrong nearly every time. Recently, I got a fried rice that was 3 stars rather than 2. Need new phones? It burned my mouth off.  The last time we dined-in, we had two out of town guests that we thought would rally like Lao Laan-Xang. We sat outside, and to our dismay got no attention at all to our table in 20 minutes. We went across the street."}
{"text":"I really like the catfish in yellow curry and order it almost every time. Pretty much anything in the coconut curry sauce has been enjoyable. A couple of dishes are really spicy, but lack flavor.   My big complaint is they always seem to be out of random things when we go, and that can be frustrating. One time it was tea. Another it was a particular soft drink. Another it was catfish. C'mon! Get your act together and properly stock your restaurant."}
{"text":"Just moved to Madison a few months ago and while I've accepted that we're not going to find the same caliber food here as in Philadelphia, I was still quite underwhelmed by Lao Laan Xang. We tried for take out one Saturday afternoon a couple weeks ago and not only was our food not all that great but the customer services was terrible.   My partner placed the order while I waited outside with our dog. We were told the food would be ready in 15 minutes so we took a long walk with the dog down Atwood Ave, stopped by Bad Dog Frida, etc. 20 minutes later we come back and the food is no where near ready. Not only that but my partner tried for over five minutes to get the attention of any of the servers/hostesses to check on our food order. He said they acted like he was bothering them and wasting their time.  Another 10 minutes went by and our food still wasn't ready. Finally a good 45 minutes after we ordered we got our take out. Now mind you the restaurant was somewhat busy at the time but please don't tell us 15 minutes and then take 45 minutes. Give us an honest estimate and we'll come back at the appropriate time and not keep checking to see if our food is ready every 10 minutes.  Once we got the food home we were less than impressed. Partner's rice-based chicken dish was almost too bland and also too peppery (black pepper not vegetables) at the same time. Also the vegetable mix was most certainly frozen (I have the same mixed veggie blend in my freezer).  My order of what I think was called Honey Chicken was better but less than stellar. The sauce was overly sweet in a cloying way. I ended up draining half of the sauce from my dish before eating the rest. The veggies and chicken however weren't all that bad.  Overall, we won't be going back. And seeing as how we also didn't love Sala Thai, unless Ha Long Bay comes through for us, I might be giving up on Laotian/Thai food while we live in Madison..."}
{"text":"Our group of four ordered the Basil Fried Rice, the Green Papaya Salad with Fried Chicken and sticky rice, Drunken Noodle with Beef, and Curry Squash, 4 egg rolls, three beers for a total of $79 with tip.  The egg rolls appeared to be your standard, Chinese take-out yellow-wrapper egg roll,but the filing were anything but, came with shitake mushrooms, vermicelli noodles and shredded cabbages and carrots. The fried rice was well done with a large portion of rice and evenly hints of basil. The Papaya Salad and Fried chicken dish was a perfect balance of sweet and salty unripened green papayas with the crisp, bone in, juicy chicken. The sticky rice was enjoyed by all. The Drunken Noodle fell short, arrived with over cooked, soggy noodles, which drowned what was suppose to be a stir fry noodle dish into a stewop; somewhere between a stew and soup. The upside of this dish was it did arrive with a variety of vegetables, more so than your typical Drunken Noodles at other restaurants. The Curry Squash was another let down, ordered with a level 3 heat which was missing, was watery, no curry-like consistency. The squash could have been a little more tender. The chicken that accompanied the dish was bland and tough, almost as if it was blanched then added to the curry after the fact.  Our server was fantastic, even though we stayed 15 minutes past their 10 pm closing time. No one glared at us or rushed dinner service.  Our friends believe the curries and noodle dishes are more *Americanized* than other entrees on the menu. If we return, I'll definitely stick to the House Specialties or Entrees side of the menu."}
{"text":"Five stars because it's in a fun neighborhood, the food is outstanding, and they are very vegan-friendly. My absolute favorite dish is the tofu in peanut sauce (either #33 or #34... the other of the two is my second favorite). The spring rolls are a marvelous start to a tasty meal, and can be made vegan upon request.   Spiciness is really an individual thing... I usually ask for 1 1/2 to 2 stars because I like a little heat but not overpowering. I find that 3 stars can make you sweat, but then again some people don't think that's enough!"}
{"text":"Great curry, lovely service. We are from out of town and tried the squash curry as Madison specialty...it did not disappoint! I can't wait for my next trip to the Midwest to come back and try all of the awesome sounding things on the menu I ended up not ordering this time !"}
{"text":"forget Thai food on willy street this will blow your mind get mango curry and a beer.  In addition the spice level of 2.5 is perfect"}
{"text":"The squash curry with chicken is delicious. I love squash. I love curry. This dish makes me happy. I had to be out of town for a couple months for work and while gone I got a craving for their squash curry. I tried other places while I was away, but nothing is as yummy in my book. My first weekend back home I had to head over here for lunch and give into my craving. Lunch prices are very reasonable at under $10 during the week and a bit more on the weekend.   Of course, I'm not an expert on Laotian food and I don't like things too spicy hot because I'm a wimp, so I can't comment on how authentic it is."}
{"text":"I love the location! The street view of Atwood makes for a nice people watching spot. Plus, it's a Pokemon hotspot.  The vibrant red, gold, and orange decor pops against the overflowing plants. We went during peak lunch hours on a Saturday and found a table right away.   We shared two pork egg rolls and chicken satay as apps. The egg rolls are so unassuming! I didn't expect the soft vermicelli noodles to add so much to the bit. The chicken satay was tender, but we would have liked the cucumber salad to been a little sweeter.   I ordered the pork wonton soup, which was so fresh! The wontons quickly fell apart though, but over wise the flavor and texture combo was superb.   The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is firstly because the spice levels are too conservative in comparison to similar places in Madison. But it throws you off by saying the hottest spice level is \"Native Laotian.\" MY mom was timid to order anything above the \"adventurous\" level, so she ordered \"careful\" with her pineapple curry. It was extremely mild, and the coconut overpowered any semblance of spice. We thought the curry was just kind of bland in general, but luckily the pineapple thrown in added a flavor element.   At the end of our meal, we were informed that the credit card machine was broken. I wish we knew this at the beginning but we luckily scraped enough cash together. Otherwise, service was fast."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out and was told to pick it up in 30 minutes. I arrived 35 minutes later and was told it would be ready in just a minute. It was busy and crowded inside, leaving me no other option but to stand awkwardly behind people who were eating at the bar. I asked about every 10 minutes about my order, and was told each time they were boxing it up. The kind folks eating at the bar, seeing how long I'd been waiting, began inquiring for me as well. After standing there for 40 minutes (now 1 hr, 15 min after ordering) I began to walk out and a staff person shouted that my food was ready. As I reached out to pay, a stranger eating at the bar said to the staff person, \"How much are you taking off for her wait?\" The response was, \"I can't do that, I'm not the manager.\" So no apology or discount for the wait, and the food was cold. How long had it been ready while I stood there? Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Try the ginger chicken. Tasty with ample portions. All the curry dishes are good. Great casual atmosphere at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We regularly order take-out from here and are always pleased. Tip: they are often uber busy, especially on weekend evenings, so plan for ample time! Also, we have found on occasion that we can't even get through on the phone in which case we just have to truck down there and order in person. Plenty of vegetarian options as they'll make almost anything with tofu. Portions are generous and every dish I've tried has been good. If you like Thai food, you'll find this quite similar. The vegetarian egg rolls are also delicious and sizable.  Outdoor seating here is enjoyable in the summer, winter seating is hit or miss in this place as I feel like cold air from the door sweeps through the restaurant. You know what's a win-win in the winter?!  Carry-out!"}
{"text":"I've read and heard several times that routine and monotony are precursors to a slow death in a relationship. \"Keep things fresh!\" \"Don't settle for routine!\" \"Be spontaneous!\" Notions such as these might be applicable in all other scenarios, but my relationship with Lao Laan-Xang has only been strengthened since my wife and I discovered this neighborhood gem over a year ago and have been slaves to routine ever since.  Sunday nights roll around; we try and pretend we can rise above comfort, to step outside what we know and order something new. We can't. \"Crab rangoon... two #13s, chicken, 3-star spiciness...\" rolls hazily through my mind. I open up my \"Favorites\" on my iPhone, and there it is -- Lao Laan-Xang. A speedy thirty minutes later, my dog is barking and my mouth is watering. It's here.  Honestly, though -- we moved into our First House a little over a year ago and hosted some friends to sit on the floor, drink beer, and watch the Badgers. A friend suggested ordering delivery from a nearby Laotian place, and we've been hooked ever since.   This is kind of a terrible review, in a sense, because I've literally only ever ordered one dish from this restaurant (the Khua Mee, #13). I won't dare admit to you how many times that one dish has been consumed 'round these parts.  Takeaways:  1. Routine isn't always a bad thing. 1a. Especially when that routine involves delicious Laotian food, shared with one's spouse."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai/Laotian places. Whenever I get back to Madison, I try to make a stop here for their curry squash and crab rangoon. I don't think I've ever had anything bad here at all. Also, service is always outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with a friend of mine. The restaurant is really full, and we could see that it was severely understaffed. A couple in front of us who were waiting to be seated left because no one came to serve them after 15 mins of waiting. We waited for about 10 mins longer after that, and finally someone came to seat us. We sat on our table for about 20 mins and nobody came to take our order, even though we could see that the two servers looked at our table and knew that we were ready to order. What the actual fuck. The servers pretended that they didn't see us, and we could see people leaving their seats because nobody served them either. I just don't understand. It was almost like a conscious decision for them to just let people in and out without even saying that they might be busy. Not gonna recommend. Terrible service. Don't come there if you are hungry. Truly awful."}
{"text":"I started eating Thai food at Lao Loan Xing in the mid-90's. It was literally a transformative experience. The subtle flavors, the \"pop\" of the spices and new textures and flavors were amazing. I was hooked.  I moved to within a block of the Atwood restaurant about 10 years ago, I was excited to be so close by but I hardly ever eat there anymore. With each passing year the food becomes less interesting and for me the nuance of flavors is just about gone. Over and over again I have been served dry chicken, whether it is on a skewer or fried as an accompaniment to the papaya salad. The curry and the soup is bland and thin. I still enjoy their eggrolls but that just is not enough to keep me coming back.  I cannot understand why the menu never changes, there are no daily specials and the décor is shabby and neglected. I know the restaurant does well so maybe there is no impetus to go the extra mile. I am sad that this fine eating establishment makes no effort to improve, diversify or at least show a little flair.  My neighborhood offers a plethora of choices. Ha Long Bay and Monsoon Siam are excellent. Even Bahn Thai has stepped up its game and has been repainted and carpeted in the last decade. I also think their food is considerably more flavorful.  I realize that many of the reviews are glowing. Maybe it is just me but as BB King would say, \"The Thrill is Gone\"."}
{"text":"A little disappointing but not unexpected. Ordered papaya salad extra spicy and sweet and sour (ended up only sour); I figured what can go wrong with spring rolls (very different with eggs added---but the sauce! The most disgusting sauce I've ever had in my life!); and seafood salad, was okay but a bit salty. Didn't help it was still warm making it difficult to swallow---it should be a cold dish. Overall, took a few bite of each and ended up not able continue. I really want to like you but I am not impressed."}
{"text":"First things first:  Amaryllis.  Just kidding....  First things first: Squash curry. I get it every time and often because it is shamefully, obscenely good. I have a biological clock for it that ticks away and if I haven't had any of the curry after a certain about of time, I black out and send my fiance a text message saying we're ordering Lao Laan Xang in tonight, no buts.  So...if you don't like crippling addictions to food products you should steer clear. But if you LIKE CURRY YOU MUST GO HERE NOW."}
{"text":"This places serves up some excellent Lao grub and is consequently always bustling with Madisonians hungry for good ethnic food.  I hear that there is a Willy St location as well, but I haven't had a chance to compare."}
{"text":"Please bear in mind I have been eating either here or the first one that opened on Williamson St. for a bunch of years.  And I concur with most folks about the food (though mine was weirdly salty last night) but if you like to drink beer with your spicy Lao / Thai food this place will not work for you any more.  First they stopped carrying Singha and just had a Laotian beer.  OK fine.  Now they have stopped carrying the Laotian beer.  OK fine.  But the last few times I have gone the beer that I ordered from the remaining ones available was not cold.  Like warm beer that had been put in the fridge for 20 minutes?  Not OK.  Not fine.  I may need to go back to the Williamson St. location or Ha Long Bay."}
{"text":"The food is excellent at Lao Laan Xaan.  I really like the Mango Curry and the Lao Laan Xaan Fried Rice.   Unfortunately,  the customer service is non existent.   The staff is often rude and not very concerned about the customer experience.   Very disappointing!    Makes it difficult for me to want to return no matter how much I love the food!"}
{"text":"We love Lao Laan-Xang at their Williamson Street location, so I was excited to try their Atwood location. I'm happy to report the food was just as good! I'm not sure if there were differences in the menus themselves, but they seemed quite similar.  Everything we ate was fresh with lots of complimentary flavors and textures. We enjoyed the pork egg-rolls and spicy sausage. The beef salad was spicy and amazing. The larp was outstanding. Like most southeast Asian food, the flavors were a mix of sweet, salty, sour, spicy, and everything was fresh. For either location, the food at Lao Laan-Xang seems to be spot-on.  The main difference was in the atmosphere and the service. While the Williamson location has a quirky, I'm eating at my Lao neighbor's house feel, the Atwood location has a professional restaurant feel. It also has a more complete bar w/specialty cocktails. It's more formal and a place you would feel comfortable taking business associates while the Williamson Street location I would save for friends and family. The service also varies in that at the Williamson Location we have been served by both a waitress and the cook. It feels more informal. At the Atwood location the wait staff felt more experienced and more of a typical restaurant visit rather than visiting someone at their home.  Either way, Lao Laan-Xang is a winner in my book an definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"It's OK.  The food is pretty good, but not great by any means.  The prices are expensive, too.  $13 for some veggies, LOTS of sauce and a few tiny pieces of chicken?  Not so much."}
{"text":"This is a good lunch place on Atwood by the Olbrich Gardens and not too far from campus.  I have eaten here often and really enjoy the curry dishes.  The squash curry is excellent, but I also really like the peanut curries.  The portions are generous, and the price is amenable.  While the food is good, it doesn't blow me away, the curry flavor could be more pronounced, the vegetables can get a little overcooked, and the dish ingredients can get a bit muddled.  Overall, the one on Willy street is better tasting and more consistent, but for a convenient, tasty sit-down lunch, little is left to be desired here."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for the weekend and craving Pad Thai, and decided to give this place a try after reading a few Yelp reviews. They don't exactly have Pad Thai, but their own Laos version. I was a little apprehensive because some reviewers mentioned getting greasy Pad Thai takeout but I did not find this to be the case. It was a really generous serving for the cost, and definitely didn't skimp on the protein. I also got crab rangoons and those were delicious as well, with a great amount of filling and awesome dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I am honestly baffled as to what makes this place Laotian.  The menu seems pretty solidly Americanized Thai, and the flavors follow suit.  Maybe the cook or the owner is Lao?  Or maybe they just Americanize the menu for the lunch specials, and lunch is when I went.  Their spice guide is listed from 1-4: timid-Native Lao.  I ordered 3 for my catfish/Thai eggplant curry.  It was nothing.  A hint of heat, perhaps.  Order your food at a 4 if you're used to timidly and apprehensively ordering medium in authentic Thai restaurants.  Look, the food was not bad by any means.  The fish was tender and boneless, the Thai eggplants were cooked to a soft, skin-peeling pulp, and the potatoes still had a bite to them.  The bamboo shoots were, surprisingly, the most flavorful part of the curry, retaining that sour tang that most lose when they're put in a can.  It's just that it was all pretty unmemorable, mostly due to the curry - a nondescript coconutty slurry.  And the cucumber salad that came with it literally tasted like plain cucumbers.  I was satisfied when I walked out: my stomach was full of healthy, nutritious food.  I just wished it had been shaken up a little, too."}
{"text":"FINALLY (Thank you Yelp!) I was able to locate this restaurant after numerous tries.  The original location was closed so we ended up here for lunch on a Monday.  I had a lot of anticipation after hearing such GREAT AND WONDERFUL things about Lao Laan Xang and I was very satisfied with the end result.  I do love my curry and ordered the pineapple chicken and catfish curry.  As I am Asian Pacific Islander, I opted for the \"Native\" spicy level while my lunch date tried 'adventurous.'  I didn't detect a difference in the levels of spiciness however.  Curry was perfect in texture and taste.  Good lunch prices.  I'm now looking forward to take-out on those busy school nights and definitely bringing family and friends here from out of town to enjoy as well!"}
{"text":"We went here after reading many stellar reviews and hearing from friends that it was the best food in town.  First things, first the waitresses and hostesses were not very pleasant.  They hardly welcomed us in at 6:30 on a Sunday.  It was about 85 degrees out and the building doesn't appear to have AC which was clearly ticking them off, but as people who are trying to help them make money for the evening I was put out by their attitudes.  We decided to dine outside where our smile-less waitress continued to bus the table next to us.  Rather than taking the previous diners full glasses of water back to the kitchen she chose to hurl the water into the street while we were eating.  Now I know this isn't a fancy restaurant but along with the sour puss she wore the whole time we were there I found this to be rude.  The food was decent, but one of the entrees was over cooked.  When we didn't ask to box it she asked if there was something wrong and I told her the beef was really really tough.  She said she would take it off the bill and did, thankfully.  When I went in later to drop off the check she did finally come out with a little personality and say that she tried our dish and it was awful and that she was sorry.  All in all there wasn't anything that would encourage me to come back."}
{"text":"My personal favorite place at Madison. Never fails. Their Laotian sausage and sticky rice is wonderful."}
{"text":"I always get the squash curry because I love squash and it's not easy to find at restaurants. This has consistently been my favorite Asian restaurant in Madison all the years we have lived here.  We hosted a Thai exchange student a few years ago and took her to all the Thai, Laotian and any other southeast Asian restaurants that were in Madison during the 10 months she was here. This was by far her favorite restaurant as well. She really missed the traditional spicy salad she would eat in Thailand and really liked their version of this dish.  Their crab rangoon is THE BEST you will eat anywhere. Hands down. Yes, I know that rangs did not originate in Asia (I've heard they were originally introduced at the St. Louis World's Fair), but I love Lao's version of them."}
{"text":"This place is nasty! I'm Asian, I know what good Thai/Laos food is! No offense, but the food here seems like it wasn't made from a Thai/Laotian chef. The chicken satay was cold and my supposedly \"Pad thai\" was NOT good. Didn't taste anything like pad thai at all! Won't ever go there again!!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM and great prices. I would definitely recommend the mango pineapple curry."}
{"text":"This restaurant in only a few blocks from where I live and I'm pretty addicted to all varieties of curry, so I go here often.  The service seems to be getting better and better.  I have had bad waitresses at this location, but that was months ago and my most recent experiences were all positive.  One thing I absolutely love about Lao Laan Xang is that any substitution seems to be fine with them.  If I want potatoes instead of tofu or meat, they can make it happen.  I appreciate that.  As a fan of very spicy foods, I have to say that even their \"Native Lao\" isn't as spicy as I'd like it, but the waitresses have never had any problem getting me some extra spice from the kitchen.  In conclusion, their curry is great, the staff is helpful (and seems to be getting more so all the time), and their location will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"When they are good, they are very, very good.  But when they are bad....   We used to eat here a lot, like once a week.  Then in the last couple of years we have had some just barely, OK meals.  Watery sauces, wrong meats in take out dishes (and who is going to drive back) and rice that was a solid hunk of goo.  But when they're \"on\" it is excellent food.  The intermittent reinforcement keeps us trying.  Last episode Friday night was not so hot.  They were very busy, but our order was screwed up and rice was so sticky I thought they had given us sticky rice!"}
{"text":"The best egg rolls I've ever had. The rest of the food is very good too. Healthy version of sweet and sour shrimp (no breading on shrimp) was great. Service is great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Really good Laotian pad Thai, I forget the local name but the flavor mix was spot on! My wife had chicken and I had tofu - tofu felt oddly form, but tofu always varies a bit. All in all, great experience, will try again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a trip up from Chicago, so this was a first visit and probably a rare one. After reading so many lukewarm reviews here, I had pretty low expectations, and indeed, the place was fairly empty on a Saturday afternoon. I was worried. Needlessly, it turned out. I ordered mango curry with tofu, and it was delicious--rich, silky, complex. And the highest spice level wasn't really all that hot--either my taste buds are half dead from the homegrown habaneros I've been eating, or they're dumbing it down for their farm-fed clientele. My co-diner ordered, in addition to a curry that he really liked, a Bell's Two-Hearted India Pale Ale that I fell in love with,. Our waitress was nice enough to tell us, when I asked, exactly where in town we could procure our own supply. Other than I thought it was a bit expensive, especially for a simple storefront restaurant, I was pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Lao Laan-Xang, and have never had a bad experience here. It is super authentic, super tasty, and the staff is extremely friendly at the Atwood location at least :)  I regularly have to take food home as the portion sizes are large and I have a small problem with my eyes being larger than my stomach.  The egg rolls and spring rolls are fabulous - The #15 and #16 are my go to dishes and I like em ****native lao SPICY!"}
{"text":"Nice place with good food.  I had lunch with my daughter - she the squash curry, myself the catfish curry.  Don't pass on the squash curry - very good.  The catfish curry tasted slightly metallic - no sure if that was from the coconut milk or what, but it was just a little off.  Still good - but ....  Also, they definitely under seasoned when it comes to heat - I ordered the hot (but not native hot) and it was mild.  Barely would of qualified as medium.  It was good, but I wanted more heat.  Good service, nice decor, good location.  They have a good selection of drinks, I definitely would try this out for dinner or a group of friends after work.  Good for lunch also - lunch is $8 ish, comes with salad, spring or egg roll - good value and you can get in and out quickly.  Nice enough to take a business colleague, or go on a date.  Also has free wi-fi.  For just food, 3 stars.  Add great prices, good service, free wi-fi, nice atmosphere - 4 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great portions, and friendly staff.  Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"We went to the location on Willy Street first but that location was tiny and they couldn't accommodate our party of 3 without a long wait. It was Saturday around 6:30 though and they were holding a reservation for a party of 8. We learned there's a location just a few minutes away on Atwood, so we headed over there. We were seated immediately, although it eventually was a full house and people were waiting nearly out the door to be seated. I had the curry squash with tofu and chose two spicy stars; probably could've handled four spicy stats as I barely tasted any spice. Still, it was the most flavorful curry squash I've had in a long time - perfectly tender pieces of squash and lots of tofu and more veggies to round it out. Husband finished his pineapple curry pretty quickly and even my very tiny friend polished off her pad Thai. I could have had leftovers, but since we were visiting Madison and leaving the next day, I just ate the entire generous portion.  Service was a little leisurely yet kind. Since we were there to have a long dinner to catch up with an old friend, this was not a problem, and the older couple who seated us and served us were very sweet. Just keep this in mind if you're in a hurry though."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lao Laan! So good. Seriously. Go there now. I've never had anything bad, or even mediocre on the menu. Also, the staff are always friendly and prompt.   Recommendations:  -The grilled beef salad is delicious. The lemongrass and citrus dressing combined with the spicy flavor is so refreshing. Seriously. Get it. Not your average salad. I ordered mine 3 star spicy and it was quite hot. Next time I'll order 2 stars.  -Mango curry is out of this world. I ordered 3 star spicy and it was PERFECT. The combination of flavors in this dish is so good!  -Spring Rolls. Fresh. Delicious. Yum."}
{"text":"Great food! Service is just a bit slow, but well worth it, the food rocks! The Mango Curry is great as well as the Spring Rolls. *Adventurous is the recommended spicy for those who like it hot but not overpowered."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.   I want to tell a cautionary tale for those of you that might want to venture outside of their great curries and soup.  Crab rangoon (delicious and huge), vegetable spring roll (well balanced flavor, served with peanut sauce), and tofu kang gai soup (my favorite tom kha-esque soup in the city), mock duck red curry, and thai iced tea were all on point, per usual.  I decided to venture out from my usual pineapple (or sometimes squash) curry and order Khua Sa Eiu (my server said it is basically pad see ew with more vegetables).   I love the thick rice noodles that are traditionally served with pad see ew, as well as the thick dark soy sauce, egg, and dense flavors imparted to the dish from the wok. The dish I received failed to fulfill my hopes. It was overly salty (and not in a delicious way), the noodles were thin and limp, and it tasted more like scrambled eggs with soy sauce than pad see ew. However, the vegetables on the dish were crisp and fresh. I ended up taking the dish home and saving it with some hoisin for the lunch the next day.   Lesson learned. If you want pad see ew, Ha Long Bay is where it's at in Madison, for great curries, soup, thai tea, and interesting spring rolls--go to Lao.  Service here is always great and very prompt. Patio in the summertime, and we always choose this location over Willy street because it is more spacious (and you can sit outside)!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this restaurant a million times and tonight I finally stepped foot into it. I'm really glad that I did.  Greeted and sat right away seeing as we came after the dinner rush, we started our night with their crab rangoons, our favorite appetizer, which were very generous in size compared to most I've had before, stuffed with filling. My partner then ordered the Honey Cashew Chicken, and I the Pineapple Curry with chicken. Both were very satisfying to the taste buds, and portioned appropriately. The Pineapple Curry was sweet and savory; lots of flavor, nice and warm. Somewhat addicting, I boxed up what I thought would be lunch tomorrow, but finished it as soon as I arrived home. It was that good. My partner enjoyed his plate as well, and so did I from the bites I snagged from him."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars. An ok place in a pinch, but I've had better.   First, if you're going to make a big deal about heat level from peppers on the menu (4 levels, including \"native Laotian\") then you should deliver. A dedicated chili lover, I asked for native level, and all I got was a whisper of cayenne. No visible chilis in my curry. Had to ask for a saucer of sriracha on the side. So #fail there.   The fruited curries (pineapple or mango) seem to be where they shine. Noodles were unremarkable, and a selection of appetizers were hit or miss (great rolls, thick doughy dumplings).   Somewhat friendly to vegetarians - though I think vegans will probably be hesitant on whether they do or don't use fish sauce."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The first thing I ever got here was the mango curry and honestly, I haven't been able to bring myself to try much else. This dish is amazing every time. The crab rangoons are among the best in town as well.  Service is spotty, sometimes amazing, sometimes just okay. Delivery is great but I always forget to ask for extra rice... too much curry for the amount of rice that they include."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Flaming mango curry is off the hook   Homie got special tenderloin!! Flaming good!"}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS.   We got spring rolls, which were just okay. I may be biased since I grew up eating fresh spring rolls at home, but for a restaurant, they were alright. Probably wouldn't order again.  For dinner, we got the garlic ginger tofu stir fry, the mango curry, the baked salmon special, and the 4 mushroom stir fry. They were all delicious! The stir fries tasted FRESH, which is amazing. The dishes were packed with veggies, and they all still had their crunch, which is a refreshing change from normal stirfries. It tasted like it also wasn't drenched in oil. My favorite was definitely the mango curry though, so I would definitely recommend that. Portions were huge. We ended up taking home enough food to feed 2 more people :P  And then for dessert, we got the mango coconut sticky rice. This one has much more of a brown sugar/molasses taste than other sticky rices we've had in the past, but the tartness of the mango balanced out the sweetness perfectly. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for the perfect Pad Thai in Madison and this was it so far. It is called something else but is Pad Thai. I made the mistake of ordering it with a mix of meat,beef, chicken, pork and shrimp. The beef was extremely tough and the other means were ok but the pieces were way too big for this dish.Order it with just shrimp or chicken would be my advice. The main thing it was not so sweet like most of the other restaurants and the flavor was very good. The spring rolls were equally  good. It's hard to find a fresh spring roll, most places fry them which is just an egg roll to me. Good wait staff and for once no long wait to get in."}
{"text":"My first, and so far only, trip to Lao Laan Xang was during the dreadfully cold Wisconsin winter. It was disappointing to find that the inside the restaurant was almost as cold as it was outside. Getting some hot tea and yummy food helped!  There's a delicious, albeit somewhat weak, jasmine tea that I would recommend. One entree was a noodle dish with chicken, broccoli, carrots...etc. The second was an amazing coconut curry, also with chicken. Both were full of flavor and had an intense afterburn! I love spicy food but this was at the higher end of my tolerance limit (I'm a bit of a wuss, though). White rice comes with your entree and is unlimited.  It took a little work to flag the only waitress down, but she did a good job of attending to everyone and getting food to us quickly. I'd definitely consider visiting again, but maybe when the weather is better!"}
{"text":"Great Laotian food with great service! I have been coming for a few years and by far my favorite things are the sweet sticky rice & Khua Curry (#36) which has a bland looking but  CRAZY good ginger sauce."}
{"text":"So bland. Madison has loads of great food, but very little even passably good Asian food. I have no idea what people are comparing this to saying it's flavorful. After numerous bad experiences, I read the reviews here, hear Madison people rave about this place, I think I must be overly judgmental or had one bad dish or something but no. So disappointing.   Got a delivery order, spring rolls & a \"mock duck\" ( aka seitan) dish, cucumber salad. Every item was bland. With a heat level of supposedly 3/4 it was mildly spicy, not so hot, but that's not my complaint - the sauce was both 1 note and texturally watery. The veg were cut really unevenly too, which resulted in some overcooking. Would it kill you to use some fish sauce? It tasted unfinished and dull. The salad looked nice - generous amount of ground peanuts and shredded carrot, bits of pepper, but again it tasted watery - no vinegar notes, no heat, no salt, nothing - moistened raw veg. The spring rolls were not cut, I have never seen anywhere else serve them uncut, they look less finished and are harder to eat that way. (But whatever, at least the wrappers were done right) The shrimp tasted decent, but the rolls had too much rice noodles, which are bland, and no fresh herbs - good ones have a bunch of fresh herbs in there. Without the herbs it doesn't seem like a spring roll, it tastes unfinished. So very dull.   I don't know what everyone else on here is eating that this food seems flavorful to you - mayo on white bread sandwiches? Get some spice and veggies in your life, try some Asian food in a different city or get a friend to cook for you. The atmosphere in the restaurant is usually nice, is that maybe fooling you, Madison? I wish it was half as good as people seem to think."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and delivery was pretty fast.  The person who took the order was very helpful"}
{"text":"So AMAZING!  We loved the squash curry and kanap pa...grilled catfish stuffed with dill, ginger and lemon grass. Simply wonderful!"}
{"text":"Ehh.  The only reason to go to this location of Lao Laan Xang is if you have a party of four or more.  The only advantage it has over the Willy Street location is size.    Our waitress was so completely unfriendly that I was turned off of the whole restaurant.  We arrived and had to wait for two other people to show up.  During the 10 minute wait for our friends, we were asked if we wanted to order at least twice.  As soon as our friends sat down, the waitress was back to ask if we could order yet.  Uh...no?  Could they look at the menu first?  Jeez louise, lady.  Nothing was ever said with a smile, and it was apparent that she couldn't wait for us to get the f-outta' her restaurant.  I'd like to add that they were hardly busy.  The food was delicious, just as it is at the other location.  The food almost makes me want to give it 3 stars.  But you know what?  I did not walk away feeling \"A-OK\" about the experience.  All I wanted to do was to pinch the waitress' cheek and say, \"Heyyyyy!  Buck up, sunshine!  It's called \"customer service!\"  Or, you know, lay her tip out on the table and revoke bills as her service got worse."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations numerous times, and although this location is bigger and has more staff, I have found that the smaller location is run with more care and better customer service.  The employees seem discombobulated and unprofessional at times, and the management isn't one for putting the customer first.  On most evenings you will more than likely get your meal within a reasonable amount of time, but if you don't, your meal won't be discounted in any way.   When all goes well, the food is delicious and plentiful though!  Try the number 4 as an appetizer if you like satay, and I am always up for a lil' number 34B with chicken!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place based upon the reviews of a coworker.  It was quite good. If you are in the mood for Asian cuisine, I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"First off, the food was very good.   What is a restaurant worth if they can't make good food?    We stopped by here for lunch after hearing good things about this place.  My sweetheart really enjoyed her dish which always makes me happy and she's a tough judge.  The prices were very affordable. The atmosphere of the place is ok.   A little small if there were a lot of people but only a few people there when we stopped by.   Two love birds were off necking in a booth which sometimes bugs me but I really liked this because they were so damn nuts about each other that it was really heartwarming and they were so cute together. We ordered medium spice which was quite a bit hotter than I expected.  We like heat so that was ok but someone else might be a little overpowered.    All the ingredients were fresh, of good proportion and had a very good aroma.   Everything was very hot as in cooked through and needed to cool off for a bit before we could eat, which is how we prefer our food served. The music was a contemporary station, yuck.   Some people won't care or maybe like but I would rather not listen to the song \"I Can Only Imagine\" while I eat Laotian food.   Improve the atmosphere and the music and this place moves closer to 5 stars but the food was terrific and we will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first Thai Madison find...and I LOVE this place! And I adore the historic brick and mortar of the Atwood location! This is always a hoppin' place, both walk-in and online ordering. The big windows are great and either table or booth is fab. It always feels happy and cozy here! ANYTHING CURRY is delish!! I don't stray from the curry too often...every dish I've had has been stupendous. Parking can be tricky...I try to arrive around 5:30-6 (any day of the week) for parking at the little Schnek's Corners 1/2 circle parking lot...no coins, just time!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I chose this restaurant because we couldn't find parking where we wanted to go. Being the first time there, we needed some time to review the menu, which did not irritate the hostess.  She was very patient, when we did order and I told her I wanted my dinner Native Lao hot she said that was very hot to which I said yes I know  she gave me a  smile then took my husband's order.   I ordered the Spring Rolls with Lao Sausage #3, they were good but I forgot to ask for fish sauce as I am not a fan of peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was more like peanut grit in flavored water.  The rolls were cut in half which allowed sharing this was nice but there was very little sausage and egg, an excessive amount of noodles and none of the other ingredients.  Entree was the House Special Moak (mok) Pa #29 asked for Native Lao (very spicy) it came Timid no heat at all this was a disappointment. Also it was very wet like it had been submerged in water as opposed to steamed as it should be.  The steamed veggies a combo of green beans, broccoli and carrots were crisp tender but bland,  not the veggies I though would be served at a Laotian place. My drink was Thai Tea which was very weak. Over all the meal had very little flavor, not something I would order again if we returned.  Definitely not worth the $15.99 for the entree.  Husband ordered Pork Eggroll #1 I only took a bite as there was only the 1 what stood out was a hint of Sesame Oil which made the flavor pop. He said it was better than any other eggroll he has had but could have had more pork in it.  Entree was Khua Phet Khee Noo with Beef #15 he ordered his Careful (a little spicy) his too came with no spice, however the basil in his dish did give it a nice flavor.  He enjoyed his dinner, but again not worth the $11.95."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great! Every bite was simply a flavor experience!  I came here with my parents and grandparents who were in town for the day. We went on a Sunday at lunch time because this was on my bookmarks for a while now, and they wanted to try something new with me. My mom had Laotian food only one other time, and my only Laotian food experience was Ha Long Bay's nem khao tod. LLX seemed like a great place to experience new food.  The menu wasn't too big, but we were still so unfamiliar with the cuisine and needed help ordering. Luckily, our server was a huge help, and she basically told us what to order to eat family style for 5 people and get a nice, well-rounded experience with traditional Laotian cuisine. We ended up ordering 3) fresh spring rolls with sausage, 15) khua phet khee noo with beef and broccoli (she suggested adding broccoli which was off-menu), 24) kang phet with beef and noodles, 29) cat fish moak pa, and 31) beef larp. We chose the spicy level of \"adventurous,\" which is the third of the four spiciness levels to choose from. It ended up being pretty spicy, so be careful if you don't have a good tolerance!  The appetizer spring rolls came out pretty quick. I found these spring roll wrappers to be lighter than what I'm used to from the Vietnamese variety, and this made for a light texture overall. The peanut sauce also had a  light texture and was pretty sweet. She also brought us a spicy lemon grass fish sauce that would normally go with the moak pa. This lighter texture, use of sausage and egg, and different sauces was a pleasant change of pace from the more common Vietnamese spring rolls that I'm used to.  The khua phet khee noo was a stir fry dish that showcased a variety of mushrooms that made for a nice contrasting texture to the beef. The sauce was a little thick with a good amount of basil flavor and went well with the rice.  The kang phet was a coconut milk curry with a nice mix of potatoes and vegetables (including Thai eggplant, the best vegetable to put in your curry). I didn't find this to be as fragrant as Ha Long Bay's Thai curries, but I did find it to be exceptionally velvety. Maybe they use more coconut milk? It was really fun to eat this with noodles. They use the same noodles that they put in spring rolls, so they were cool and refreshing and served as the only respite to the bold spiciness that the curry provided.  The moak pa was my favorite thing that we ordered. This was like a catfish meat loaf baked in banana leaf. This dish had a lot of flavor from ginger, lemon grass, and chili peppers, but the use of dill (which I wasn't expecting) was a real x-factor that made this dish a new flavor experience for me. This came with some mixed vegetables and a spicy sweet and sour sauce. I thought this went really well with sticky rice, but that's probably just something in my head because I'm used to seeing sticky rice in banana leaves like the moak pa.  The beef larp seems to be their most popular dish, and I can see why. The rich and fatty minced beef takes in the fresh herbiness and acidity from the onslaught of flavorful ingredients in the recipe. The bean sprouts, lettuce, and cucumbers provide a nice fresh crunch without fighting against the bold flavors from the other ingredients.  I highly recommend going here, especially on a Sunday (since my server, who was incredibly helpful and might even be the best server I've ever had in my life, only works on Sundays). If you like bold flavor, you can't afford to miss out on this place.  Next time, I'm going to get 30) thum som (papaya salad) with Laotian fried chicken at the \"Native Lao\" degree of spiciness."}
{"text":"There are 2 Lao LAan-Xang restaurants in Madison. Personally, for the the atmosphere and overall food experience, I like the one on Williamson Street the best - not this one on Atwood.   However, this restaurant has mixed drinks where as its sister restaurant does not... including one called the Laotini! If you like lychee and haven't had a Laotini, this is the place to try one! Most excellent.  The food here is also not as spicy as the one on Williamson Street, so if you've heard of the spicy Laotin food dishes from Lan Laan-Xang, go to the one on Williamson Street!   I still come here often, but only because it's not as crowded as the one on Williamson Street. So it's usually my backup restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence on this one.   The first time I was there, I had a fish entree with(waaaaayyyy too much)lemongrass. Not so good.   The last time we went, I had the dumpling soup which was really flavorful, and my entree(a noodle dish) was nothing short of yum. My boyfriend always gets something that looks like your average chicken and vegetable mix...and he seems pleased(but if you screw THAT up...we have problems).  The dining area is very open--and very loud. I wish it was a bit more mellow."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is always amazing and the staff is very friendly. I always order the same thing (Ba Mee Ga Tik) which is only on the lunch menu. It's such a flavorful dish that I can't order anything else."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.  Pros: Lots of veggies in their curry Cheap extra rice  Cons: Veggies are practically mush Tofu is chewy Curry is bland Crab rangoon is pure cream cheese with very little flavor Crab rangoon sauce is very bland Staff was rude on phone and while picking up order  I'm not going to throw away my meal, but I'd never choose this place over Ha Long Bay or Sa-Bai Thong. It is better than Curry in the Box. So I guess there's that."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Atwood location once.  Considering the place was packed, and we had a table of 8 people service was adequate.  One meal took a little longer than the others to come out, and they did apologize for it.  This is one of the few places in WI, where I can ask for something hot (spicy), and it actually comes hot.  I have yet to try anything here I don't like.  If I'm in the Madison, or know of someone passing through.  I usually have them bring something back for me.  I enjoy it that much.  If this location is too busy or your looking for something more intimate, check out the williamson location.  I'm actually waiting for a delivery as I type!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in Madison (at least for vegetarians), hands down. Quality ingredients and generous portions at reasonable prices. My absolute favorite is curry squash with tofu (#26) but the soups are excellent (and huge for the price) and the veggie fried rice is far more delicious & interesting than you would expect for fried rice."}
{"text":"Both dishes we ordered were bland, no flavor except salt. The 4 star Lao Hot was not hot. If you are looking for fresh flavors with exotic spices, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Yum yum! My second time ordering takeout (delivery) from Lao Laan-Xang. I love curries, and I especially like their mango curry (3 stars). And they have super delicious wonton soup! Since it was delivery and I needed to reach the $20 minimum I also ordered the Khao Khua Phet, a fried rice dish. It was very tasty, but the rice was not crispy and was instead mushy. I'd like to try this one again when I eat at the restaurant. I wondered if it was just not as good delivered. But I also want to try their version of Pad Thai.  Delivery was faster than I expected. I'll definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Both locations have consistently amazing food in a comfortable, intimate setting. And best of all, they deliver.   For anyone who has only tried their food at a summer festival food cart and thought it was meh, you really need to go into the restaurant and get the full experience. Their mass produced curry squash is a bit disappointing and lacking in actual curry, but the full restaurant dish is one of our favorites. The chicken satay and crab rangoons are solid even at the festivals.   Also on our long list of favorites:  spring rolls w/ tofu - fresh and minty with a nice peanut sauce Kang gai w/ tofu - soup w/ coconut milk base, lemongrass, mushrooms Khao khua phet - the best fried rice I have ever had in my life. Has lots of fresh basil throughout. Garlic ginger chicken - meat + lots of stir fried but still crisp veggies in a light sauce packed with garlic gingery flavor."}
{"text":"The tom sum (papaya salad and chicken) really stands out, but seafood dishes were average at best. They make great sticky rice, but wait time was quite long. Would give 3.5 stars if possible. 3 too low, 4 too high."}
{"text":"Great time at Lao Laan Xang tonight.  Really scored big by checking out the recommendations made by my fellow yelpers.  Mango curry might just be my new favorite thing to put into my face.  If it's not the curry, then it's going to have to be the crab rangoons.    One star lost for bringing out all four entrees with the \"timid spice\" when three different \"heat levels\" were ordered.    Our little boy was a huge fan of the carved elephant trim running around the bar.  Me too really.  Yay for Lao Laan Xang!"}
{"text":"I visited Lao Laan -Xang on Atwood 3 times in 4 weeks. That is how good the food is! Fresh, authentic, flavorful ingredients with a menu that is fit to pleased even the toughest dinner. The Squash Curry with chicken is easily my favorite. The texture is more like a thick soup base with chunky butternut squash. It almost tasted like you were eating a potato. Very rich flavor that works well with the white jasmine rice. The crab ragoon are amazing! They easily serve the best ragoon I've tried in Wisconsin as with their shrimp spring roll.   Fantastic food. Great service. Can't beat prices! This is my new favorite restaurant.   I would recommend making RSVP if you're a party of 4+ considering there are about 12-14 tables. The place is tight and cozy. If you dine before the lunch/dinner rush, you should be fine."}
{"text":"Lao Laan Xang was a bit of a let down. Maybe I need to stop reading reviews on Yelp before dining at a place. It's like ruining the surprise of a movie by reading its review first. And disappointment is always worse when your expectations fall short of the actual experience.  My sister and I had snuck away from a dinner party with my parent's friends to eat out. The restaurant was moderately busy which afforded a leisurely paced dinner. I have memories of this location when it used to be a decent mexican place called Pasqual's. LLX did a good job creating a cozy, warm interior, working hard to mute out the previously festive colors. I just wish they had saved a few of the festive flavors too.  We started with the best part of the meal, Kang Gai soup. It was savory and rich, with a lush coconut flavor and mild spice. The tofu in the soup was firm and complimented the soup. I kept wolfing it down as my sister told me about her recent trip to India.   But the rest of the meal wasn't so tasty. The appetizer combo was a bland combination of fried this and that. I could barely tell the taste of the fried shrimp from the spring roll. They should throw a chicken skewer or fresh veggie into the mix.  For our mains we mistakenly ordered the Moak Pa, catfish stuffed with dill and steamed in banana leaves. The bland but catfishy flavor was overwhelming and was served with bland broccoli and steamed veggies. Note to self, from now on, only order fried cat fish... but wait, didn't I already have some as an appetizer??  The other dish should have been an easy winner - curry squash. Again flavor was sorely absent and substituting tofu again for chicken didn't help the sauce. Perhaps when we asked for \"timid\" spiciness they took that to mean timid FLAVOR.  2.75 * stars"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I lived in Madison.  We were visiting recently and decided to stop for a quick dinner.  My husband decided there was nothing he could eat (he wasn't feeling well) so we decided to just get food to go for me.  I ordered chicken satay appetizer (chicken on a stick) and a beef salad.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food.   And when I got up to go to the bar and ask a question, they waiter just walked away and didn't come back to see what I wanted.    Then, the really bad news.  I ordered the salad at a level 1 or \"mild\" spice.  It was so spicy I could barely eat it--and I am not a tame eater normally.   And calling this a \"salad\" is a loose term.  I wanted raw veggies with some meat.  What I got was a huge pile of tough, stringy beef, a couple of fully intact (large) lettuce leaves, a fragment/wisp of a carrot shred, same for the onion and 3 tiny grape tomatoes.  That was it!  It was gross and almost inedible.  And it cost $15!  Ridiculous.  I will never eat there again.  Poor service and worse food."}
{"text":"Crab Rangoon was fantastic, eggrolls were OK.   Got the fried chicken entree'. Rice was dry and very chewy. Chicken was dryer and chewier. My wife and I both felt sick after eating. It may have just been a fluke, looks like a lot of people have enjoyed the food.  One bright spot was the Thai tea was delish! But I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Madison, for sure! Their portions were fairly large, so be prepared to take some home or split a dish. For the price, it's well worth it.   I tried their chicken basil fried rice, which exceeded my expectations! The food came fairly quickly, as well. However, the service was a bit slow to get a table and get a drink, the check, etc. This place is not very big, so I believe it gets crowded during peak hours, especially on the weekends.   I highly recommend checking this place out for Laotian/northern Thai food!"}
{"text":"My friends chose this place when we were on the way to Dells. We were looking for some Thai food but ended up with this nice Lao restaurant.  We liked it.  I ordered the fish curry in native Lao's spicy. It came with the white curry sauce which i was expecting something in red curry if it would be spicy. Surprisingly It was tasty with right amount of spiciness for me. My mom got the garlic shrimp which just looked and tasted like a typical Chinese garlic shrimp with plenty fresh vegetables. She said that was exactly what she wanted. Nice! Kids loved the fried rice. It was really all great on the food except they put potato in the fish curry. Is that a tradition?  Our waitress was great. She was really busy but circled back enough times to make sure we were OK. She apologized a few times for taking the order late.    The decor was a bit old. I felt like I stepped in an old restaurant in Asia somewhere which has a warm, ancient, and relaxing atmosphere. If I had the time, I imagine I could order some tea and spend the whole afternoon there. Well, next time...."}
{"text":"Flavorful food,  appealing atmosphere, good service, reasonable prices, funky neighborhood.  At the right time of day, there is some good people-watching to be had.  Best Crab Rangoon in town."}
{"text":"Ok, ok. I've been there twice this month, both solid experiences, and so it only makes sense to bump these folks up a star. I guess a lot of it depends on the server and mine the past two times was awesome. Solid recommendations for new dishes, prompt service... The unfortunate experiences I had previously were mostly during lunch, so maybe evening is the time to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for date night. We got here at the perfect time because 5 minutes after we arrived, there was literally a line out the door to get in.  The atmosphere is really nice. It's dimly lit and decorated with what I assume is authentic Laotian pieces.   As for the waiter, he was super nice and on top of everything. He made sure we had everything we needed, but didn't come up to our table every 5 seconds.   The food is amazing! They have huge portions and a great selection. I had their take on pad Thai. It was delicious and tasted super fresh. We also got the appetizer platter and it also was huge and offered a lot of options. Try the Thai iced tea too.  For an app, two entrees, a drink, and 2 beers, our check was around $40ish. Not bad.   This was a great experience for the both of us!"}
{"text":"Omg... The mango curry is a MUST try!!  I have eaten amazing curry around the world and theirs is by far the best I've ever had!  John was an absolutely amazing waiter and we will be sure to request him in the future.   Btw...  The only reason for the deduction in stars is that there was a minor lack of attentiveness when we first entered,  but honestly very worth it.  We WILL be back.  :)"}
{"text":"I treat Madison like a nice weekend retreat. The Hamptons on Chicago, if you will...anyway, one of the great draws of Madison are the wonderful Lao restaurants -- the food is fresh, fruit-laden, and spicy, but in ways that are distinct from what you would find in neighboring Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Excellent experience and true to what you find in a nice restaurant in Vientiane.   Literally everything on the menu is great and it's shameful that we have nothing comparable in Chicago. Notch one up for Mad Town."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and beautifully served. The Laarb was fun to eat with the refreshing flavor of the various greens herbs and spices. We left very happy."}
{"text":"I moved to Madison yesterday and have always wanted to try Lao Laan Xang since I contemplated moving here.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  I ordered a grilled catfish in banana leaf, sticky rice and steamed veggies-my food arrived cold and when I flagged down a waitress, she wasn't very apologetic.  When the waiter returned with it, the rest of my table was almost done eating. The waiter quickly said \"sorry about that\" and rushed off.  The sauce that came with my steamed veggies was strange and not warm either.  All in all, it was a very odd meal combination.  My husband was very satisfied with his imitation duck curry (which was very good!).  The two others at our table were disappointed-they said their meals were like a bland Chinese stir fry.    I was expecting a lot of fresh and exciting flavors....it was meh instead.  I have to say I don't think I would come back, but I might try the other location."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried rice with 4 kinds of mushrooms and another stir fry dish the #15. The food was good but seemed to be less refined than other Thai places. The portion sizes were huge, and the prices reasonable. One entree without any sides could feed 2 people. The service as very good also."}
{"text":"You know those places that you visit, usually when you go see your relatives living someplace far away, and they have a restaurant or shop that you can't find back home?   Then when you are away, you dream about going back there some day....This is that kind of place for me, and that is why it's one of my first visits when I go to Madison.   Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of great Asian restaurants back in Houston, in fact, it has one of the largest Asian communities outside of the west coast so we got tons of awesome places that I can go to.  The unique quality of Lao Laan-Xang is that it has that subtle flavor profile that is indicative of food from Laos and Myramar (Burma) that it is kind of halfway between Asian and Indian food; so you can have the curries and some of the flavor profiles from India-Thailand, but if you are looking for the more traditional Asian-Chinese type of food, you can find this kind of dishes here too.   Including these dishes is essential to appeal to the All-American pallet in an 'ethnic joint' in a small city,  but if you want to see where these guys shine with really unique stuff, stick to the original traditional dishes!  You will be back again, and again."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, per se, but with a location immediately across from Monsoon Siam I would choose the latter 10 times out of 10. The service here is slow and the food always seems a bit on the bland side. That being said, if you're still working on building up your spice/seasoning tolerance, this might be good entry-level southeast Asian (fusion) cuisine."}
{"text":"My go-to place for squash curry - THE GOD OF ALL FOODS. The portions are large enough to split, but don't. Keep them as left-overs to experience the magic the next day.  Also good for: just about anything.   Other favorites: spring rolls with shrimp (they have the most delightful peanut sauce), mango curry with chicken or tofu (curry with large pieces of mango and pineapple), mango sticky rice!  Avoid: kang gai, a coconut-based soup with chicken and mushrooms. It's often strangely and disconcertingly oily. Delivery also takes a bit longer than they claim."}
{"text":"Waitress was fantastic. Reminded me of an old friend of mine - real sweet and helpful. I got here 5 min before close, so was only one other group here.  Pretty small place maybe 15 tables+bar, but 12+ ft ceilings in a neat old building was spacious feeling and  it looks like they have tables for the sidewalk when the weather is nice. It is a bit run down asbestos tiles & old plaster, but sort of adds to the character. The bar is trimmed all the way around with carved wood elephants (neat).  I had decided I would try the Laos rice beer, which I hadn't had before,  but they don't have it any more -bummer.  I got laab (one of my standby favorites + good baseline reference for comparison...), and the mango curry (which i don't recall ever having) with some added veggies per request. Both were great. The laab was very fresh and full of all the right flavors. It was served with plenty of fresh lettuce to eat as wraps, and also came with some excellent steamed sweet rice (yum) which was served in a bamboo steamer.  The mango in the curry was excellent (plan to make this at home in the near future now). The curry was not Panang, not green, not sure what, but was more similar to the former and it had decent flavor.  While I was there eating my meal, no less than 3 different groups came in. The last seriously regretting that he was too late to be able to order... Like him,  I am sure I will be back... But will make sure I get there on time!!"}
{"text":"I liked everything here.  It's like Thai food but the menu is simpler than Sa Bai Thong's.  Everything was very fresh too especially the veggies.  The peanut sauce is awesome and so was the curry dish we had.  #19 and #24 were the way to go.  The only knock I had was the service was a little slow.  Next to the Barrymore, so it's a perfect location before or after a show."}
{"text":"Probably one the better Asian restaurants I have been to . The waitress was very accommodating and got all of our customized orders correct, the food was absolutely delicious light and fresh. waitress got my dish exactly as I wanted it with no complaints. No regrets or stomach indigestion after ,  fair prices too. 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Hello hello Yelp, it's been a while! and I miss you! Okay, this morning is for Lao Laan Xang on Atwood.  That was actually my second time coming to this restaurant. Having a good experience, we decided to come back. This time was only for the dessert. Hesitantly, we asked our server if it was okay to order only appetizer and dessert, because we were not in the mood to have some main dishes. She didn't mind at all and treated us very well. She was fabulous!  So, we decided to have a quite handful of appetizers and desserts: Fresh spring roll with shrimp, grilled chicken satay (Their chicken satay is served without any toast, which I really appreciate! It's just weird to have some satay with some toast together),and mango sticky rice.  All are excellent! The food is great! the server is fabulous! Come here if you need a quick fix of some Lao food. This place is less crowded compared to other Thai restaurants, but don't get it wrong: they serve good food too!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here last weekend and it was very tasty.  I had the honey chicken and my dining partner had the mango curry with tofu.  We also split a giant appetizer platter with shrimp, egg roll, spring roll, crab rangoons, and shrimp toast.  That could have been a meal in itself, so we took huge portions of our entrees home.  We both ordered our food 2 stars, which on the menu says careful.  I did not detect much heat in mine, so I would definitely bump it up to 3 on the next visit.  The flavor was delicious though!  We were both very satisfied with our lunch.  Note:  There is no lunch menu on the weekend, so you do pay dinner prices, but we had wanted to try this place, so that was fine.  The waitress working that day was so friendly and accommodating, not to mention she was the only waitress working!  This place is solid, hope to go back soon."}
