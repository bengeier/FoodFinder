{"text":"Got back from Israel a few months ago and had been tired of middle eastern food.  Today was my first venture back into it.  I had a Shawarma with Israeli Salad, Tachini and a little humus.  While you can't say it was \"just like home\" it comes pretty close.  If you want a more realistic sandwich ask for it with lighter sauce, they drenched mine (which still tasted delicious but authentic middle eastern food tends to be drier)  The owner told me on Mondays they have a falafel and soda for $5 which is a GREAT deal.  I spent $10 on a single shawarma!  Seriously, stop in here and have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I only gave Jerusalem Grill one star because zero was not an option.  This may very well be the worst restaurant that I have ever been to.  The staff was apathetic at best and the food completely mediocre.  The health conditions were appalling.  If I wanted to eat reheated chicken nuggets and frozen burgers, I would have just stayed at home.  I'm praying that I don't wake up in the middle of the night with food poisoning!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come up from Akron for this wonderful food! It is so worth the trip. On our last visit, yesterday, we had the falafel special. We've had it before and it was delicious this time. At 4.99, it is the best deal ever. The service was prompt and courteous. We will make this trip time and time again."}
{"text":"We had a hankering for Chinese and there is no other kosher chinese in the city. Now, normal, non-kosher chinese is nearly always decent (at least the places I go to) and even the kosher place we get carry-out from, Tien Le Chow, is pretty tasty. This had to be the most un-tasty chinese I have ever eaten in my life. I don't care that the guy who makes the chinese food had his own restaurant for 30 years! It was awful and flavorless, completely missing the orgasmic deliciousness that I associate with excellent chinese food. Perhaps it was missing MSG? Whatever. Next time, I get a shawarma or something like that. And WTF? No ice for the water? I just love drinking a glass of tepid water on a hot day (yes, it was in the cooler but it wasn't cool)"}
{"text":"Good humus, better techina - Israeli style,  and not the salty / watered down Lebanese kind that you get at Taza or Aladdins."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. But when they get it right the food is delicious!  They have a falafel Monday special not worth it... Definitely not authentic middle eastern tasting. Wish they put more effort into their food. And service is very mediocre."}
{"text":"The menu is very nice, and I had a hard time not ordering more!! The best no frills deli in town. Great atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight for the first time and the food was pretty good. Despite being good, there are some things that could be better. I ordered the shawarma which was good however it had very little meat and a ton of veggies in it. At most places I've ordered a shawarma from it was always more meat. This one was disappointing from the meat standpoint. I also ordered the large falafel and they were good. I wasn't happy paying $1 for a side of jalape√±o hot sauce that was about a spoon full. All in all, it was good. Id go back but would probably try something else where I would get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything I have had here has been excellent. The falafel is the best I have ever had as well as the hummus. The pita is light, fluffy, and fresh and delicious. The owner is extremely friendly and genuine and welcoming. He is a huge reason why this place is such a gem and I hope that more and more people realize how incredible this spot is here in Cleveland. The freshness and healthiness of the food keeps bringing me back and it is always consistently prepared. This is Middle Eastern food at it's finest and way better than anything any other Middle Eastern restaurant in Cleveland has to offer. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Overall it's very good, the dining room was colder than hell and somewhat dismal but the food was great and everybody was cool. I was given a free cookie which was pleasing. Hummus was good as was my falafel- it's easy to pass this place up but for the price you shouldn't.beats the hell out of Aladdins or any of that other bullshit- just do it"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful. Food was hot and delicious and beautifully presented. My husband had the The NewYorker which he said was GREAT. Corned beef and pastrami was tender and flavorful. Coleslaw was crispy and fresh, and the Russian dressing gave it a tasty zip. I had the Sharwma platter. It was soooooo good. I could not have been more satisfied. The waiter was incredibly nice and gave us a few homemade pita crisps and some pareve choc chips cookies to go which we're incredible. Best cookies I've had in a long time. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This may be the dirtiest place I have ever eaten at. And I watched the old man who cooks the Chinese food wipe his nose with a rag and then wipe the counter where they prepare food with the same rag!!! I thought this was a kosher restaurant. Where is the health inspector when you need them?"}
{"text":"The winner here is the Falafel pita. Wow, that is good. The falafel itself is delicious, and all the mixed veggies and slaw they put it in really lend great flavor. I thought the hummus was kinda bland, sad to say, even with the spices and olive oil added. If you don't want to smell like the place, get carryout. The owner was kind enough to offer me the Monday special on a Tuesday (he must have known this was my first time visiting).  Falafel pita and beverage for $4.99. That is a steal.  I am a big fan of Taza but I have a soft spot in my heart for small businesses like this with kind owners. I will put this place in as frequent rotation as my current pants size will allow."}
{"text":"Great place for fast falafel.  Not the BEST but pretty darn good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Rude unprofessional girl behind the cash register and on the phone, thin rock-hard hamburger patty that had the consistency as if it was taken directly from the freezer and thrown on the grill, cramped dining area barely even big enough for two families, bland greasy food that even the worst cook in your family could outshine at home. This is the kosher version of Burger King--DON'T GO. If you want a kosher burger and falafel, visit Kantina at Case Western."}
{"text":"The hummus and pitas are really really good, that alone gets 5 stars. I agree to D.M.W.'s review. We also ordered Shwarma Pita sandwich and it was huge looking yummy, although, it had small portion of meat and majority was salad. Wet and runny. Im sure they can make it better with a little bit of change.  After discovering their hummus and pitas, I can no longer enjoy the ones from Aladdin's Eatery. I am eating hunmus and pita from Aladdin's at this moment just because they are close to my house but oh so oweful. I miss Jerusalem Grill's!!  This place carries kosher/Islaeli food and Chinese food. There is a Chinese guy/chef working there so the food can be authentic but I really do not get this combination.  To be honest, they should change their decor and clean the place.  As soon as I walked in, I decided to order it to go. This place can be a real big success if they know how to improve a little bit of there, little bit of that. For example, they put plenty of hummus in a white plastic box (which doesn't really seal well) so it was already runnig out of the box when we got it and went bad within a day. If they've use a stronger clear plastic container which does seal, that would have been great.  But again, Jerusalem Grill makes very good pitas. I really recommend you to stop by to pick up their pitas for $3.5 per pack."}
{"text":"Very friendly., bought food for Shabbat and ordered to sit and eat. New Yorker sandwich highly recommended."}
{"text":"Serene dine-in experience. Food is delivered fresh and quickly, perfect for a quick lunch. I had the falafel laffa wrap, the falafel is seasoned wonderfully and comes to you piping hot!"}
{"text":"Great baba! I've heard good things about the falafel and the Monday special : ) good for lunch and a casual meet up for dinner"}
{"text":"I came in here on a whim last night, figuring that I had passed it so many times but never actually tried it out. My instincts were on point apparently because I was happy to find they have a Monday night falafel special! I picked up one of those and a shawarma, as well as a potato bureka to go. Everything was great! They were super fast, super friendly, and delicious.   In short, this is the closest I've found to a slice of home, Israel, in Cleveland and it's great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So! Overall a great and clean kosher eatery! Everything is fresh and homemade, the owner is a great person and our server Gabby was always smiling and very pleasant! If you love Mediterranean food, especially if you keep kosher, this place won't disappoint you! Thanks Beni!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely outstanding middle eastern food. I eat this kind of food often, and Jerusalem Grill is by far the best in Cleveland, if not in the Midwest.  Delicious, authentic baba (no parallel anywhere), excellent hummus, super tasty cucumber and tomato salad, airy and chewy pita, and savory eggplant are just a few of the delights. It's super easy for take-out. Can't wait to eat Jerusalem grill again!"}
{"text":"Take-out/eat-in place that has some of the best Kosher/Middle Eastern food I've ever had. The falafel is so good it makes me want to cry just thinking of it. Do yourself a favor and order the Israeli Meatballs platter."}
{"text":"I'm having a terrible day. I'm Jewish. Comfort food is falafel. Happiness is fresh delicious falafel with a string harissa and fresh veggies. These gentlemen nailed it. As I sit in my car (because it smelled so good that I couldn't wait until I got home) and enjoy this delicious pita my day is suddenly not so bad. Thank you guys for your humor your service and your delicious food. I will be back, most definitely on a Monday for your $4.99 special, and probably most other days of the week as well."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and all of the vegetables were so fresh. The staff is very friendly and the owners even came by to make sure we were enjoying our food. Definitely recommend the falafel, shawarma, spicy fries, and hummus."}
{"text":"I highly recommend getting the falafel at this place, it is one of the tastiest i have ever had."}
{"text":"This is a great community environment with a kind staff and delicious food. I come in on Mondays for the falafel lunch special - it's the best $5 I spend all week!"}
{"text":"Here is what you need to do- come on over to Jerusalem Grill, order falafel in some form (my husband prefers in a pita, my kid and I get the platter), add a side of hummus, don't skip the fries, and prepare for an amazing and authentic Israeli culinary experience! Do you prefer baba ghannouj? They do that quite well, too.  Jerusalem Grill has had problems with consistency over the years, but since I've given it another shot (over the last six months or so), their kitchen has put out excellent food regularly and the staff has been friendly upon every visit. So happy they managed to turn this place around!"}
