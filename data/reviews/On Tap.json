{"text":"Poor customer service. Every time I want to try this place again I am always disappointed, I would feel differently if the service was better. Most of the food on the menu is fried and very 'bar like'. I will agree with other reviews, the beer selection is ok, and its a cold drink when there aren't many other options."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday Night. Waitress took 20 min to get a refill. Two other waitress were using the back booth by the kitchen as their hang out spot. Oh and by the way... they were lesbians. So I have my kid asking me why two girls keep kissing each other. That was the last thing I want to explain to my three year old at the dinner table. I have nothing against lesbians , but please don't make out when your suppose to be working, and especially in front of my kid! The food was soggy and greasy! Stay away from this restaurant! I wouldn't go there even if they paid me!"}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. The restaurant seems very dated. The decor and tables, the seating all looked like it was from the 90's. Even the TV's in the room I was in were all old school tube TV's. My waiter seemed as though he couldn't be bothered to check in on me most of the time. I ordered a Dr. Pepper I think and it was ok. I ordered a burger and fries and it was passable, I guess. It was just a very boring meal in a very boring dining room with an inattentive waiter. It's unlikely that I will return. I give two stars because at least the price matched what I received."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast. Probably not this location's forte. We ordered French toast, sausage gravy, and wheat toast, among other things. While the food was good, we had to ask for a biscuit for the gravy, and ask for syrup for the French toast. There was no jelly or jam on the table for the wheat toast. The waitress was scarce.  We will stick to lunch or dinner at On Tap."}
{"text":"One of TV needs the closed captioned ON 24/7 because I am deaf myself and I asked one of waitresses to turn on for closed captioned on TV but they don't understand what I am talking about. Thank you"}
{"text":"I came with my daughter and grand daughter today for breakfast.    We were seated promptly and our server came pretty quickly. We ordered 2 coffees and a soft drink with waters.  The server brought our 2 cups of coffee pre-poured. My cup had what looked like dried ketchup all over the outside of  it, and my daughters was dirty as well. Don't have a clue as to how this wasn't seen while the coffee was carried out, but the server said the rack was near the syrup.  Great knowing. She brought back 2 more coffees, again pre-poured. When we asked for refills, she took our cups with her and came back with pre-poured coffee, only this time, she said she wasn't sure whose cup was whose.... okay....Later, a carafe was used.  I ordered eggs over easy, home fries, sausage patties and wheat toast. My eggs were runny and cold. The toast was pre-moistened, but I'm not sure with what. It wasn't real butter. The potatoes were under cooked with no seasoning at all. My daughter ordered steak and eggs. The steak was literally 3 inches long and maybe 1 1/2 inches wide. Not a steak.  We joked that it looked like a steak tender. Her steak was tough. We would have complained, only our server was swamped. She had practically the entire room to take care of by herself. She was trying her hardest and she had a pleasant attitude.  On Tap should stick to serving wings and beer only and only open for lunch and dinner. This breakfast experience was a disaster as far as being a customer.  If you're going to offer breakfast, learn to cook it. Learn to serve it. Learn to staff it on busy Sunday mornings.  Definitely not coming back to this again."}
{"text":"Well I ordered an ice tea now this is not a good way to start this off. But either they use the same machine to make their coffee and their tea or some how they managed to burn ice tea while making it.  Ordered the sunrise special scrambled eggs have something in and on them so clearly they don't know how to keep an egg grill clean.  Potatoes where good nothing special.  I heard this place was good for breakfast but I am sorry to say I just don't see it"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been long time On Tap patrons. We have been going to On Tap for over 15 years now, early on at the one in Falls, but when the Stow location opened we have been going there to support a Stow business being we live in Stow. There were things we liked about this location but it has really gone down hill over the past 2 years. The service there has always been really bad, but the food was decent mostly so we lived with the bad service. Now the food is equally as bad as the service. Last week is the last time our family will ever eat there. As usual the service was terrible, but all the food was overcooked, even the fries!!! The wings were inedible and cold. The chips with the buffalo chicked dip were burnt as well. We've given this location several opportunities to get better and it is apparent that will never happen. So we will be taking our business to other Stow restaurants and back to the Falls location where service and food are still excellent."}
{"text":"I am incredibly disappointed by my most recent visit. I used to go to the one in Cuyahoga Falls when I was growing up and always loved it. The food has severely gone downhill. I am not sure if it is because there are multiple locations now but it makes me sad.  One of my friends ordered the appetizer combo platter and half of the items weren't even cooked all the way (which is hard to believe since they are all deep fried). The mozzarella sticks did not have a crunchy outside and the cheese was not gooey by any means. I cut into a jalapeno popper to find unmelted shredded cheddar cheese! The chicken fingers were the tiniest pieces of chicken that I actually asked \"What are these?\". I ordered my usual (that I grew up ordering) the Greek Chicken. The chicken tasted like it came directly from a freezer. It still has the grilled look but did not taste that way at all. The other downfall my 22 oz Southern Tier XMas Ale was $7.75! Yikes! Good thing I switched to Miller Lite after that."}
{"text":"Bar food, good prices. Draft selection is excellent. The original wing sauce is awesome"}
{"text":"Quite good! I got the Beam Me Up Scotty chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was good. Service was fantastic. We were there for a casual book club meeting and we all ended up laughing and having such a great time. I think they staff wasn't sure how to take us!"}
{"text":"I was torn between giving this place one star or two stars.  It's not so horrible that I'd never step foot in the door again, so I gave it two.  Its only saving grace are the drinks.  I should note that I wasn't expecting much for a chain restaurant in Stow, OH.  But it doesn't take that much skill to work a deep fryer, so I assumed it would be passable.  Ha.  You know what they say about assuming.  I met a group of friends here on a Friday night for drinks.  Of course, drinking leads to eating, so it wasn't long before we were ordering food.  Being a vegetarian, I had about 3 options on the menu.  I chose the cheese quesadilla and french fries (healthy, I know).  The quesadilla was ridiculously bland: cheddar cheese metled between flour tortillas with a jalapeno slice or two.  Boring.  But that wasn't even the worst part of this plate.  The sour cream was.  They put PESTO in the sour cream.  Yes, you read that right.  Pesto in the sour cream.  I nearly gagged on it.  You'd think they would at least warn people that they do this.  Who wants pesto sour cream on a quesadilla?  I could see maybe putting pesto sour cream on a baked potato, but come on.  Seriously?  I had to ask for some plain sour cream, but even that couldn't save the quesadilla.  And the fries?  Mushy and flavorless.    None of my companions complained about their meals, but none of my companions are foodies by any means.  They're all quite content with the subpar restaurants that inhabit the town of Kent.  So hey, if you have no tastebuds, you might like this place too.  Luckily, they do serve very large, strong, fairly cheap drinks.  I ordered some sort of raspberry concoction they list on their drink menu and it was served in a goblet.  Hence the two stars instead of one.  Two of those babies plus two shots, and I didn't even mind the people bellowing karaoke off-tune.  Unless your soul goal for the evening is to get trashed and sing karaoke, pass this place by."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has a wonderful Greek salad, amazing wings and yummy burgers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday.  I ordered a grilled chicken wrap.  (8.99). It came with a choice of sides; I chose coleslaw. The wrap came after a reasonable wait.  Generous size.  But it was bordering on cold.  Too much rice and heavy on onions, and light on the grilled chicken.  It was supposed to have ranch dressing on it but I didn't taste it.  I had coffee with my meal.  It was luke warm.  I had to ask for a refill again Luke warm.  I would have given this restaurant one star, but the service was a little better than OK.    This average bar food.  The restaurant has a bar/lounge separated from the dining room.  Many TV sets."}
{"text":"Always wondered why this place is a ghost town at lunch.  Seems like a restaurant that can't quite nail it's identity.  It looks like a bar, but they're playing Sinatra and Dean Martin, and the youngest diner appeared to be 65 on a recent visit.  The service was great, but the food, meh, I've experienced better.  What was really clueless on the part of the kitchen was lopping fries on top of pickles.  Not just two pickles, but a half dozen.  Uhhhhh, hello, the fries taste like nasty pickles now.  Gross.  It was either a cruel joke, or someone in the heart of the house just doesn't get it.  I had a Pepsi, I peer into the glass and there's two fuzzballs.  It's either build up from dust from non use, or they're so crazy busy they have no time to wash them.  Come on, as TV's Scott Taylor says, \"CLEAN UP!!!\"  No wonder it's always empty.  I understand they do a lot better business come happy hour.  Good luck then."}
{"text":"Questionable breakfast cook. GREAT COFFEE! Okay, I have tried this place for breakfast 2 times. Both times the coffee was great but thats all. First time I came on a Sunday and was received well by the staff. I order a sausage scramble, I expected eggs with sausage, peppers, and onions with cheese on top of homefries. What i got was a scramble alright. It was a mess of everything mixed together with mushy slices of potatoes topped with some sort of nacho cheese style sauce. The sausage and veggies where good, the eggs where overcooked and looked dirty. Clearly they dont clean their grill well. Who wants mystery black bits in their eggs. So I went for my 2nd visit because I loved the coffee, lol. I ordered a simple meal.  2eggs scrammbled with hashbrowns and toast. Again the eggs where overcooked with mystery black bits and worse soft mushy hashbrowns with toast drowned in butter. I asked the server for some crispy hashbrowns, she was understanding and brought out another order of hashbrowns. Again soft zero crisp. I dont know who is cooking breakfast therw but they need to watch some youtube video on cooking breakfast or something. If I wanted softer potatoes I would have order homefries. Hashbrowns are simple, put them on the grill and let them be flip them once. The clown behind the grill is tossing and turning them like stir fry. Unfortunately for me this place is only good for coffee and water.  ***wake up cook, take pride and clean your grill, treat the food as if you are making it for yourself***"}
{"text":"Service was decent, but the food was horrible. I used to go to the one in the falls and I loved their food. This one is awful. Nice place though."}
{"text":"I will not return.  The service was absolutely horrible and the food is average.  We have tried several time and this is it."}
{"text":"Not your average bar and grille. This place has a lounge & dining area. Large and spacious. I'm a big fan of Doogan's Bar & Grilled in Aurora but this place comes real close to surpassing them. An extensive menu of breakfast served all day everyday, sandwiches, salads, panini's, lunch and dinner. My first time here and I'm very impressed. Would become a regular on my list."}
{"text":"I am disappointed! This place was understaffed, over priced, and of poor quality. We sat for 20 minutes before receiving our drinks. The food was barely warm and some of the food tasted old or stale. Our bill was over $80 for 5 of us but we had terrible service and barely could eat our food. Don't go here people unless you want to not eat or drink and then feel robbed when the bill comes."}
{"text":"Food portions and quality have gone down hill ! Young waitresses that act like they do not wanna be there and are very inattentive. Kids meals are the only good value for the $"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years, but I was hungry for some popcorn so took a chance. I had half a garden salad and the pretzel stick appetizer. The pretzels were very good but the nacho sauce was too spicy for me. The garden salad was kind of sad, but the main reason for this review is the italian dressing. I can't identify the spice that dominated it, but it was just dreadful. I don't think paint thinner would have been much worse. And the price for these two items and a Pepsi--$18 plus tip. Pretty steep! The server, Lauren, is a cutie pie. Unless I'm hungry for popcorn and pretzels again, it'll be years before I go back again."}
{"text":"This place is gross.  I should have gone by what the reviews said before coming in here.  Service is bad and food is worse.  Not to mention it was expensive for the crap food you got.  Flies were free of charge."}
{"text":"On Tap is a very nice spot for lunch and dinner- perhaps not top of the pack considering all the great sports pubs in Kent - but very nice.  I really like their salads, especially the Greek, which are generously portioned and come with soft pita bread. (YUM!) The blackened chicken is really tasty - well seasoned and nicely grilled so I generally add that when I'm getting a salad that doesn't have a protein. Their burgers are also quite good as well as their wings. Last time we were there, they mentioned an all you can eat wing buffet on Mondays which seems like a great deal!  Sit in the bar area for better vibes.  The dining room area seems a little more starched and fussy that doesn't quite match the atmosphere of the food/bar. Free popcorn, nice service and a good selection of beers.  Plus, check out the great patio when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"How's this they have a huge frigin sign that states BREAKFAST EVERY DAYE AT 8am....noose no breakfast. Idiots."}
{"text":"I've been going to the original in Cuyahoga Falls for years...there is no comparison! Every time I go here the food is terrible!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars - I guess the key is low expectations and luck!? I've avoided On Tap for probably 10 years after having some bad experiences in the past. Well, I ended up with a $20 gift card, and it was collecting dust. Even though they get 2 Stars on Yelp, I figured it would be better to go there and get a 2 Star meal than eat a PBJ or ramen noodles, what the heck, right?   And then..... we had a pretty good experience.   Our server was Emma. She was bubbly, personable, always there when we needed her. My wife ordered sweet potato fries and she brought her a caramel dipping sauce that was her personal favorite and it was incredible with the fries. Nice touch. 5 Stars on the service.  The food actually wasn't too bad either. I got the 1/2 pound burger ordered medium and it came out medium. Not bad for $9.99. My wife liked her buffalo chicken wrap too. It was quite spicy.  The decor in the dining area looks like your great aunt Betty picked the floral design in the booths.  Gentleman: If you're looking to impress, I don't recommend it for a first date, or even a 3rd date. The ambiance isn't exactly there, unless your date only likes restaurants that give free popcorn?   Drink wise, I'd probably order something other than a free water. It tasted like it, well, came from a tap. Maybe that's where the name of the restaurant comes from? But it's free, can't complain.   With all that said, I'd actually go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is even still open.  Everything was gross. The tea which I was told was fresh brewed tea tasted like it was from a machine or old. Tried to order a side salad (which was on the menu)  and was told they no longer do side salads?  I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't do side salads! Server said oh the menu needs updated.  Why would you put out a menu that's incorrect?  The tator tot appetizers wasn't even warm enough to melt the shredded cheese, the sour cream tasted weird. All of our food was bland including the kids meals which my kids even said was disgusting. Poor service, dropped our food off and never returned till we are completely finished as she stood in the back talking never checked to see how everything was or to get any refills.   The restaurant was filthy,  bathrooms were dirty toilet paper and waste all over the floor wall paper peeling off the walls, sink was broken so when my daughter turned it on to wash her hands it sprayed all over her and the floor.   And very over priced. Will never step foot back in here again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for great food and great karaoke. We came here after all these years I've never trying it, so we thought we'd go ahead and give it a shot. What was awesome is that they had popcorn so you can have something to munch on while you wait on your food .   I ended up getting a pint of the pumpkin Shandy as well as the On Tap gyro with mushrooms topped with fries and it was amazing. Subtle flavor, mouth-watering tender meat and a very tasty cucumber sauce.  Friendly service and a great karaoke staff puts this at a five star for me. This place has a really good singers for karaoke."}
{"text":"Their food has dramatically improved. Had the ultimate tater tot appetizer and jumping jack burger. The burger was pretty good, the tots were amazing.  However, the service leaves MUCH to be desired, and of course there were plenty of screaming kids with parents who were too interested in their i-phones to be bothered with parenting."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting and my chicken was under cooked, our waitresses was clueless and took forever!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a good price. A lot of menu choices, which was borderline overwhelming. The meal was large enough to split or take home."}
