{"text":"Hands down the best Turkish food on the Danforth. This family run business really goes above and beyond. The dine-in meals are no joke. They don't skimp you on portions and everything is tasty. Our favorite meal is the lamb shish. They cook it so tender and juicy. With an order of cacik you're in heaven. Worth the price that you pay."}
{"text":"Great food, taste and price. Meats are tender and juicy, everything well seasoned. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because a couple of friends of mine really liked the food they ordered. I don't recall ever trying Turkish before so I was pretty excited to try something new. It's a bit newer, nice big space but they never seem to have many customers if any. The good thing about this place is that they rent out the restaurant for special occasions and such.

I got take out a few times here now but i've only tried the meatballs here. It comes with rice, bread and a salad. I initially gave this place 5 stars when I first tried them out. The staff was so pleasant and the portion was worth the amount you pay. It's a bit on the pricier end. The meals average $15 to $20 depending on what you get. The photo I took from my first visit, man I was stuffed and super content! As time has gone on, my coworkers have ordered from there every now and then, and we have found the portions becoming incredibly inconsistent. The last visit was quite disappointing. They spread the rice along the bottom of the container and it barely covers it. The piece of bread was a tiny end piece. The meatballs are delicious and throwing some hot sauce on top? Oooooh Yeah! It's making me crave it as I write out this review. I wish there was a crazy drool emoji. It would be so appropriate right now!

I initially gave this place 5 stars but changed it to 4 stars for the inconsistency in their portions. Paying almost $20 for a single meal, I'd hope to get a decent portion every time. My experience with the staff is always pleasant and the food is always delicious. Still a nice little spot to go to along the danforth."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great food! The meat is tender and flavourful, the rice is fluffy, the veggies are excellently charred. A gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Went to Efes on Sunday afternoon for the first time. The atmosphere is clean, bright and quiet, servicer is polite, food is fresh. Spacious with fire place. 

It was not busy at the time of my visit. Good location for small or group gathering, Turkish cuisine. I ordered cheese and spinach pide to share with my friend, light lunch with good quality time."}
{"text":"From the outside you not know what a cool Turkish restaurant awaits you inside.  Very friendly service an authentic Turkish food awaits you inside.  We came for lunch and had Falafel, donor chicken salad, lamb meatballs and beef shish and tea.  Tip the roasted peppers are the real deal spicy."}
{"text":"It was an amazing experience.  We felt like we came to a family for a dinner. Everyone was so friendly and polite. All the dishes they recommend were absolutely amazing. The chicken and beef doner was fantastic. Full of flavour. Beef shish was also amazing. The levrek fish was one of the best I've ever tried. So tender. Falafel plate was delicious. All their salads were fresh and crispy. Humus was excellent. Restaurant was clean. Great and relaxing atmosphere. They even had a jazz band playing. Very happy with everything."}
{"text":"Looks better than it tastes. It was very dry and lacked flavour for my liking. It didn't help that the waitress was friendly. When people come into your restaurant, you should smile and greet them and not stare at the customer blankly because you are too busy gossiping. I should have walked out then but I really wanted to see what the rating was about. Anyway the service didn't improve onwards and the food is dry. Won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Went to Efes last night for the first time. Went with wife and daughter. All 3 of us enjoyed (and shared) our entrees. We had the Adana Kabob, chicken shish and meatball platter.

Having been to Istanbul 4 times, I can honestly say the food here is authentically Turkish.  In my experience, that's easier said than done. 

I believe this place is family run. Nice people.

Wine selection was limited.  Raki was available. A true Turkish drink!!!

Very good experience overall!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best gyros in town. Seriously. 

As a native Turkish, I can say that this place offers authentic delicious food that won't make you miss the real thing. I tried the beef doner over rice, comes with a generous portion of fresh veggies, absolutely delicious. Iskender kebab was pretty good although it lacks a bit of a kick, maybe tiny bit too bland. Sish chicken was okay, again it could use some more spices. The soup is a good option for a light vegan choice. Adana kebab and kofte (meatballs) are both pretty good. Last but not least, baklava is a boost of pistachios that will make you want to have more. Don't forget your Turkish tea/coffee with it! 

The service could be better but l still want to round my 4,5stars to five in order to support this new business. Kudos for the cleanliness. Good for families, easy access for stroller & lots of room for babies, high chair. Live instrumental music on Fridays and Saturdays. Requires reservation on weekend."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. The food is phenomenally good. While it can get super annoying inside on a Sat/Sun with all the kids screaming, but the caliber of food is so worth it. I had the Ocak Ba?? Mix ($26), which gave me a taste of all the main meat dishes on the menu. All the meats were properly marinated, which gave them a nice flavour. The lamb chops and meat kebab were super juicy and tender. It's hard to find an affordable place in Toronto that serves lamb and beef kebab this good. Their meatballs and Adana kebab were also ridiculously good. I'm usually not a fan of minced meat in patties, but let me tell you, this was finger-lickin' good.

Read other reviews. Even native Turkish people concur that this place offers authentic delicious food.

Efes, you've really impressed me today! I cannot wait to back for some more. It's a shame I don't live nearby, but I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Atrociously bad! Visited this place during Taste of Danforth. They had lots of empty tables while other restaurants were packed...now I understand why. I ordered the falafel as appetizer which was essentially 4-5 dry toonie-sized falafels on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce. I was pretty disappointed but took the L and moved on. For entr√©e I chose lahmacun which is a flatbread smeared with ground meat. When I received the dish it looked really sad. It was a stack of dry bread on a bed of shredded lettuce and chunks of onions. Definitely not the most appetizing plate of food. When I took a whiff of the lahmacun letdown escalated to nausea quickly. The mystery meat was very musky. I scarfed down the thing with deep displeasure turning to the iceberg lettuce to mask the musk of the meat."}
{"text":"This restaurant has just opened and we are so happy it has! The food is delicious and authentic tasting and the atmosphere is great! They serve alcohol unlike many other Turkish restaurants in the city. It is a definite must place to come!"}
