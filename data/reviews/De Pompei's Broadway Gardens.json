{"text":"I love this place. Great wings. Cold beer. Friendly service. I will actually go out of my way to revisit this place and I live 30 minutes away in Chagrin Falls where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bar. Highly recommend Pompei's. Timeless just like a neighborhood bar should be."}
{"text":"Its a delightfully fantastic watering hole that I enjoy coming to quite often and I will continue coming to this bar foreverrrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"I think this place was fun and welcoming.  Great bar food and very nice people. We are going to go back on wing night to try out the different favors.  On Saturday nights they only have hot and barbecue. Nice change  up to Paninis or the Lizard."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat down, waited 20 minutes for the waitress to walk over but she never came. Other patrons were leaving their table to go to the bar for beverages, so tired of waiting and thirsty, my wife and I went to the bar for our drinks. The bartender was friendly and quick,  however,  the bar was out of half the beer they had on their list. Anyways,  when we finally got the attention of the waitress after 40 minutes of sitting there, we were told that we had to wait to order because \"there were 3 other tables that didn't put in an order yet.\" OK. After waiting another 10 minutes,  I put in an order for 18 wings.  We waited an hour and 35 minutes for them to come out. We continued to go to the bar to get drinks while we waited because the one time we asked for drinks we received a hard eye roll, like we were inconvienecing her or something. After being at depompeis for 2 hours with no food, I got the attention of the waitress again and asked if our food was ready. I told her that if it wasn't done,  we just wanted to cancel the order. She walks in the back and comes out with the food just a moment later. I had 6 lemon pepper wings which were too salty to eat,  6 hot garlic parmasean wings that smelled of puke (didn't taste like garlic parmasean), and 6 Baja ranch that were actually pretty good. Asking for the check was another 15 minute wait. Having worked in the service industry before, I leave 20-30% for a tip,  but you can guess what I didn't leave the waitress. We tipped the bartender well, however. Not sure why this place has such good reviews. Maybe they are old and the service used to be better, or maybe I just had a bad experience. Im not sure, but that was my first and last time ever visiting this establishment. As someone who grew up around the area, I will be sure to share my poor experience with friends & family."}
{"text":"De Pompei's is a great place to go for a few drinks or for a nice lunch/dinner.   De Pompei's has a big bar area as well as a nice dining area. This is GREAT place to come and watch the Cavs, Indians, or Browns games, as they have several big screen TVs and one HUGE TV to watch all the games.   De Pompei's is a family owned place and often you will see the owners around at the bar or serving the food. It is a very welcoming place and full of friendly people.   They have a good selection of beer and liquors for mixed drinks. They have really good happy hour deals too.   They have a really nice food menu, ranging from hearty sandwiches, to loaded burgers, to wings and larger entrees. They are pretty famous for their wings and have a \"wing night\" on Wednesdays that tends to attract a good crowd. I am a vegetarian and have had many options to choose from and the cook has also prepared special meals for me with he ingredients has from other en tress.   I have never been disappointed with the food, drinks, or service here. I highly recommend spending some time at De Pompei's!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood pub. Nothing fancy, nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I enjoy coming here, it's cheap beer, tasty food!"}
{"text":"Wing review only, they are DELICIOUS WINGS. They could open up a wing place on its own and be very successful. I have tried many of their sauces and always walked away satisfied. I believe it is wing weds for them, so stop by on that day to try all the flavors.  It is a bar as well, has a enough space and doesn't get too crowded for those that want to come to drink."}
{"text":"If there ever was a local watering hole I could call home, my home away from home, a cozy family owned bar that is as comforting as it is charming, DePompei's in downtown Bedford would be it.   DePompei's is a 3rd generation family owned business. I've been patronizing \"DePomp's\" as long as I was old enough to know about it. It's the type of bar that every town should have, but not all do. It's the type of bar that movie scripts are written about. The type of bar that folk lore and ancient stories always begin. A place to celebrate occasions or quite simply just making it through another tough day.   Blaise DePompei, as recently seen in a Ghoulardi tee is the acting owner. He's there everyday except Sunday (closed on Sundays). Him and his family live in a room above the bar. He's been doing this as long as he can remember. This is his life. His father left him the bar when he passed. Before that, his grandfather started the venture over 75 years ago. Blaise confessed to me that he can't see it being able to survive a 4th generation. It's a different world today. The government has their hand in the pockets of every small business owner more so now than ever, liabilities and overhead also account for a bigger portion of his budget. Then there's the economy. People are cutting back. The influx of new people in the area are unsure of the unfamiliar brick facade of DePompei's ancient building. They'd rather go somewhere with a familiar name as advertised on TV or in print media. Charming it's not on the outside, but come on in for a beer or snack and I assure you, you'll feel right at home.    Everyone that entered DePompei's on my recent visit were greeted by name. They had the same menu, same cheap beer prices and same bartenders as I remember some 10 years previous. There aren't as many regulars as they once had though. Business seems to have slowed down over the recent years. Family's have moved out of Bedford and priorities have changed for some.    Blaise isn't looking to become rich and famous. He's a simple man. He just wants to survive another year. Myself and other familiar patrons would love to see this bar survive another generation. A pint of draft Pabst is only $1. A cold Bud Light is $1.50. A fancier import such as a Newcastle? $2 something. And those aren't Happy Hour prices either. Those are everyday prices. For food, try the Steak, Egg & Cheese sandwich. They've been doing it the same for a half a century; grilled steak sizzler meat, fried egg, melted cheese with lettuce, tomato and onion sandwiched in between two thick slices of freshly cut white bread. I get it every single time I go to DePomps.   If you're in the area and need a place to stop for a quick bite, stay a while to drink away your sorrows, or on the opposite end of the spectrum, celebrate a joyous occasion with your friends, I can't think of a better neighborhood bar than DePompei's. They have everything a proper bar should have; an adequate juke-box, pinball machine, popcorn machine, dart boards, wood paneling, a couple HD TV's, ancient Cleveland nostalgia on the walls, cheep beer, good eats and servers that will become like family by the time you leave.   And as Clarence, the angel from Bedford Falls (starkly similar to downtown Bedford, OH) once said in \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends.\" At DePompei's everyone is your friend. No man is a failure here."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS IN CLEVELAND!! I have never had such fresh bar food in my life. The entire place is eat off the floor clean, and the staff is top notch. Bravo guys, you're doing it right."}
{"text":"I have not had the wings yet, but mark my words, I will come back and dominate those 55 cent wings Wednesday.  Speaking of 55 cents wings, that's the only thing that's changed in his place in 55 years.  And that's a good thing.  The crowd was relatively sparse but friendly, the bartender was great, the fried appetizers we crushed were better than Paninis, and they have beer...isn't that what you want out of neighborhood dive bar?  They also had a hot dog special on Saturday night.  There were a couple TVs in the main bar area which allowed us to watch the game.  Also scoped out a couple dart boards in the back.  So if you are looking for a hip, modern bar with DRINK sign on the wall and a wall that opens up to the huge patio, you probably want to look elsewhere.  If you want a great little neighborhood bar, you found it."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I've lived in and around Bedford for 27years. I had never... gone into this bar. Perhaps the few windowed-cult breeding appearance scared me away. Alas a long time friend dragged me in one evening for a pleasant and wonderful surprise. If you enjoy a \"cheers\" style know your name, family friendly pub on the southeast side... This is it.  In a few words;  Passionate owners, relaxing and unpretentious restaurant area, with your horseshoe \"meet someone new\" bar up front. Good food, amazing prices.   These types of places warp me in time to remember what my grandparents enjoyed as a local watering hole. Where news, conversation, and laughter broke the daily grind.  Don't miss out on the enjoyment of a local, central place to share life with new and old folks."}
