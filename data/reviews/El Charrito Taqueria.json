{"text":"Truly a hole in the wall. But sometimes those are the best places!  I don't understand how I've missed this place and what's with the deal with all the good eats on Edmonton trail?  Seriously with in 2 blocks of each other there's at least 5 yummy spots to hit up.  This place is a walk up and order type place. The decor is nothing to write home about, very stark but clean and has adequate seating.   So look up at the menu board, give your order to the nice gentlemen at the front, you in turn get a number and grab a seat.  You wait and salivate while watching other orders go by.   I tried the tacos, 2 chicken, 1 pork, and 1 shredded beef.  All were good but if I had to rate it from most favourite to least, it would be pork, chicken, then beef.  I liked the pork because it had a hint of sweetness to it and the flavours blended very well.  Overall a really good experience, I did leave with tears in my eyes though.  Not because I was so overwhelmed with joy that I found a good authentic Mexican place, but because I ordered all my tacos spicy, next time will go with mild ;)"}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews, while visiting Calgary, and completely regret it! How on earth does this place have an overall 4 stars?! The lady and the guy who took our orders and made them were nice, but the food was absolutely horrible. First of all, the \"salsa\" had no tomatoes and was 95% onion. The rest was lettuce and water. The onions and lettuce were just floating around in the water. Worst salsa EVER. The nachos were good though.   I don't recall the name of what I ordered, but it was basically meat with bread. The bread was SO soggy, unbelievably soggy that it was falling apart. The meat was nothing special, but I hate soggy bread. My mom ordered a quesadilla, and didn't want the meat. She got a pile of lettuce and cilantro, a pile of onion, and some cheese. The onion was overwhelming that she couldn't eat it without taking out half the filling. She also thought it had no taste, I mean some lettuce and onions? Really? So, she ordered rice and beans. The beans were okay, but the rice was inedible.   Its ironic because we didn't want to spend much that day on dinner, and wanted good food, so we came here. We ended up spending more than what we would have spend at other places plus forcing ourselves to finish the food. Never again."}
{"text":"I can't believe how liquidy everything is. The \"salsa\" looks more like soup. For that matter, so did the guac. It was unrecognizable, and at the price we paid, quite ludicrous!   That doesn't even get to the food. Which was also liquidy. My burrito was lightly warm at best, with cheese that hadn't even bothered to melt. My friend's quesadilla looked like they dropped a small salad inside and hoped for the best. Not to mention that it was dripping and had little to no cheese  I cannot understand why the reviews here are so positive. The meat is awful, the cheese is questionable, the sauces are completely disturbing.   Please... don't do it!"}
{"text":"This place is like the typical hole-in-the-wall taqueria you'd find in many western US cities (except 3x the price, because Canada).  I love the pozole, a pork soup with hominy which they only serve on weekends."}
{"text":"What a great little hideaway!  Love their soft tacos, for only $2.50 a piece they're a great snack, or get a few and call it a meal.  The flavours are amazing, with fresh cilantro, several types of meats to choose from and a little kick if you like it spicy (or you can order mild).  I also ordered the chicken enchilada meal - very yummy!  Lots of cheese layered on top, a moist pulled chicken filling, and sides of refried beans and Spanish rice.  I would order this again, although next time I think I will be ordering all tacos as I want to try all five meat fillings I think it will need to be soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today and it was GREAT.  Before you go here, understand, this isn't high dining.  It's a quick and easy semi fast food joint.  If you're expecting Julio's Barios, you won't like this place.  Julio's is tex-mex which is fine, but this place is authentic Mexican.  The food is the best Mexican food I've had since I was in Merida eating el pastor at a neighbourhood restaurant.  The family that runs the place are super nice too.  I can eat A LOT.  I ordered 4 tacos al pastor and I was satisfied.  I wasn't stuffed so full I couldn't move, but I was content.  I will totally be returning and trying out their other stuff.  I would definitely recommend the place to friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from California and has had a really hard time finding Mexican food as good as he had in California (especially his friend's Mom's Mexican home cooking) and this place completely filled the void.  The Lengua tacos were his fave and I loved the Barbacoa tacos.  Their hot sauce is amazing as well.  We're back in Calgary in August and will definitely be stopping in here!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Mexican food in Calgary. No Tex-Mex here, this is truly authentic Mexican food. Staff is very charming and friendly. Oh, and awesome guacamole!"}
{"text":"Amazing personable service, excellent food, excellent value. One of my favorite spots to eat at when I am not sure what I want!"}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos.  No fillers.  We ordered 57 assorted tacos for our office and they were very accommodating.  Prices are also great.  I will for sure be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place isn't crazy busy all the time. Especially since it's open so late on weekends. (1 a.m. If I'm not mistaken.) Seriously, how people can choose CPU over El Charrito at the end of a long night is beyond me. The staff are friendly and the food always hits the spot.  Anyway, this is proper Mexican street food. Is it fancy? No. Is it supposed to be? No. It's reasonably priced and super tasty. The barbacoa tacos are my favourite for sure, my partner likes the super spicy burritos.   If you're looking for Taco Tuesday though - be warned, that's the only day of the week they're closed."}
{"text":"Everything from my previous review stands, but they get bumped up to 4 stars for the substantial, tasty and reasonably priced pozole available weekends only.  Soup as a meal! A good amount of salt, rustic large-yet-fall-apart pieces of meat that are balanced off nicely with the crunch of the greens and the toothsome gargantuan grits. It's served with lime and a side dish of chili sauce, so you can make it as sour and spicy as you like."}
{"text":"They get full points for authenticity and being cool. After spending years eating proper tacos I promise these are the real deal. They lose a couple points for having soggier than normal tortillas and uninspiring meat flavor. That said, definitely worth the time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Super reasonable prices and the food is so good.  The burrito, tacos, and horchada were all awesome.  And finally a hot salsa that's actually hot - try the green sauce if you can handle it.  I'm a new regular."}
{"text":"I was hungry just looking for a good place around the block. Good food Reasonable price and delicious. A good experience."}
{"text":"Great if you want to grab some street style tacos like the ones you find in LA."}
{"text":"Today for lunch had the taco Asada and side of rice and beans delicious. Authentic Mexican taqueria. Definitely will be back, got a lot of other things to try. Love that they have lengua didn't see that till after the fact, next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Authentic Mexican street style tacos and open late most nights. Perfect."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in hopes that something may click in regards to quality.... Unfortunately I cant get past the salsa that drowns everything. It makes the tacos and tortillas super soggy. I usually get as far as one bite and everything just falls apart. I feel like breaking out a scuba mask and snorkel whenever Im swimming in this salsa. I understand upholding traditional recipes and maintaining certain elements of authenticity, but in this modern foodie era you are allowed to incorporate higher quality ingredients into this traditional mexican fare. I really really want to walk a few blocks away and grab some decent mexican food from El Charrito but inevitably I drive way out to Crossroads and Kingsland Farmers markets to get my Mexican because the market fresh quality is impossible to beat..... And the tacos and tortillas stay intact until the last bite."}
{"text":"Agree that the people are friendly and the food is cheap, but the food was way too salty - couldn't taste anything other than the salt. I couldn't eat anything (we tried 3 things off the menu and all the same).We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and chose it because of the 4 star rating....I have no idea why it has such a high rating. The only thing I can figure is that it must have been from a while ago.   Needless to say my experience wasn't so great. I ordered the tacos and chips. Tacos were just soggy, doughy taco shells with a tiny bit of steak and lots of onion as filler. It had next to no flavour and I ordered them medium hot. The chips tasted greasy and really old. Yuck! I won't go back."}
{"text":"A couple of takeout visits and another eat-in supper later and El Charitto is landing squarely in the 'meh' column for me.   Cheese filled tamale was great and a solid deal when bought as a single ($3.75) rather than the 2pc meal ($13.50). Chile relleno was tasty, though the single, soggy, medium-sized chile on the $13.50 platter left me wanting more. $2.25 tacos continue to be priced great, but are sadly, mostly bland. Earlier criticisms still stand: Watery steam tray al pastor featured some nice sweet chunks of pineapple but no discernible acid or achiote kick; chorizo is decent, but not outstanding; and strangely the overall mildness of the shredded chicken isn't necessarily a bad thing, becoming a decent backdrop for cilantro, onion and green salsa.  Guacamole is soupy and tasted mostly of underripe avocados. I've ordered it a few times now with the same results. I wouldn't order it again.   So, where do we stand with El Charrito? You could do much worse if you're in the neighborhood, but I absolutely wouldn't make a special trip to come here."}
{"text":"This is some delicious authentic mexican food! The tacos are small and served on 2 corn tortillias. I recommend the birria (shredded beef) as the meat is sweet and tender. Just thinking about it is making me drool. haha  The ambience reminds me of places I've been to in Miami with spanish music playing and it seeming like a hidden hole in the wall. In Miami, it's either hole in the wall or fancy.   Definitely going back to try some different things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fast-food style atmoshpere, serves delicious tacos. They are not too filling though, so order more than you think you might eat. El Charrito also has a little grocery section where you can buy real cinnamon and other Mexican delights. :)"}
{"text":"best authentic Mexican tacos I've had in Calgary. I always get chicken tacos medium spice."}
{"text":"Great little taco place. The best thing on the menu by far is the barbacoa tacos. I ask for everything to be spicy."}
{"text":"This is real Mexican food served just the way this hombre likes it. I started with three tacos which are each served on two soft corn tortillas. Two were pork and one chicken. You're asked if you want them mild, medium or hot. Medium seemed a logical starting point. The simplicity of these beauties is what is so appealing. Shredded meat, some white onion and a little cilantro. Too good. I highly recommend this place. the decor is minimal and the food is maximal!"}
{"text":"My bf and I travel to California every year and I always look forward too eating Mexican food while were down there. And every time we come back to Calgary, we always find ourselves craving the authentic Mexican dishes. Weve tried a lot of the restaurants here in Calgary and nothing has come close to what we had in Cali. This restaurant is by far the closest to Cali Mexican food I've tasted. Especially their horchata. I absolutely love their spicy chorizo burrito and enchilada dish. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The mild chicken tacos I had were affordably priced and tasted fine but they were not strong on flavour. These are not the great tacos I was hoping for. They service was friendly. They decor was pleasant, casual and there were plenty of places to sit. If I lived in the neighbourhood, I can imagine trying them again. Perhaps they might grow on me. They have many other menu items to try and they are open late. I decided to try El Charrito Taqueria based on other higher reviews but my experience rates at about 2 1/2 stars. If one was looking for a cheap quick bite then this place might be a fit."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican cuisine. Real Mexican Coca Cola. Great Tacos."}
{"text":"Gotta help get this place noticed. Proper Mexican... double rolled corn tortillas for the tacos, flavorful meats and ingredients, fresh and spicy salsas, and cheap. I got a steak burrito and shredded beef taco for $8.50. It was so good we're going again tomorrow. The folks who run it are super nice too. Check it out."}
{"text":"I Love this place! It's consistently great food :) You've gotta eat here! The tacos are amazing and the real deal. We've been here many times; today we tried the enchiladas which were SO flavorful and the Pozole which I've been wanting to try for a while and was meaty, light, flavorful and super filling.  The owner is super friendly and the atmosphere is simple and quiet with great old photos and the T.V plays a Spanish channel so you get a really awesome chance to just sit & chill and pretend you're in Mexico :)"}
{"text":"Gave it one star because it was the lowest rating I could give it. In my pursuit to find some authentic Mexican this is yet another Fail. Best I can say is Bitter sauces, lots of grease, inedible rice, gross overall. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Awesome enchiladas! Beans were well seasoned and tasty. A great place to go for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Can I just say how grateful I am that these good folks are open until 1am???!! Just about to head out on the road after working 6 hours at a market and I am STARVING!   This is an absolute haven for the gluten-averse and intolerant. Tacos galore and so reasonable. This is the real deal. Lengua, asada, al pastor...have one of each...or two...They also have barbacoa tacos that are grilled until crispy on the outside. Love!  I have been here several times and they definitely have a loyal customer in me. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for my next favorite, unknown food establishment... and this one was added to my list as soon as I got to their counter.  The menu is very clear-cut, down to the point, this is what we have, and how we serve it.  Out of the two of us, we tried all the different Taco fillings, and I tell you, they all were amazing.  We loved the ambiance, and the little store in the back, and now it is on our regular stops list."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmh.  Nice to have the option of a taqueria in Kensington. But I guess wanting a GOOD taco joint was too much to ask for.  Grrr. The lack of good Mexican in this city is SO frustrating.  Anyway, the tacos are decently priced. And they are decent. Ordered a nice selection and they were fine. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to give to the dog either. The guacamole though.... Woah. Watery, liquidy, acidic. Not sure what happened there. Great chips though!   On a brighter note.. after my bland El Charrito experience, I resigned to just deciding to have taco night at home the following night. That led to discovering that my husband makes the best damn salsa on the face of the earth. THE BEST. Miguel Fernando El Pablo Taco-dor... your days are done."}
{"text":"If sex were a food it would be in the form of the Barbacoa Tacos.  Crispy is the one you want.  I've had Mexican food everywhere and this is the second best one in North America."}
{"text":"First day in Calgary - Friend took me to this place and I was blown away!! Had the tacos and the pork stew - Both very tasty except the stew felt a little bland or undersalted.   Can't say enough for the tacos though! Tons of meat, onions, chilis, for 3 bucks! I'm a fan. My favorite was the Barbacoa.... cant go wrong ordering tender, super flavorful, slow cooked beef! Definitely get one of those out of the MANY you should order.  I got conned by the coke made in mexico though but that might just be me... i couldnt tell the difference. Closed my eyes, rinsed out my mouth with water first.... Nope. Paid 3 bucks for a bottle of coke that tasted the same as coke here, oops."}
{"text":"Can a taco be sexy? These were, yum! We had heard about this place and went out of our way to try it. Not a date night place, just a hole in the wall really, but we found it to be quite authentic. We love Mexican food! Seats around 30 people MAX! The man behind the counter, Jose couldn't have been nicer or more humble. His sister, the owner, preps all the food and then Jesus happened to be behind Jose putting the plates and take out orders together. And there were a lot of take out orders! The place is open at least on weekends until 1am. Lots of time for you to get your taco on after a night out! We ordered 6 tacos - 4 different types to try. OK, I did not try the beef tongue one but someone else I know did!  :) The chicken taco was good, the steak was good as was the pulled beef. Next time I am going to order a burrito and a pork taco (cubed pork, not pulled).  It does not take long for the food to be made and the value was great. ($2.25 a taco) The tacos come with a nice sauce to moisten the meat which is needed IMO and so very tasty. They were out of the habanero salsa I wanted to try tonight, the hottest one. I think the tacos should have some pico de gallo that comes with them. And maybe a wee bit sour cream. MMM Overall, I really loved these little corn tortilla doubled tacos and we will be back! This place is right beside Tandoori hut north of Diner Deluxe. We would never have found it if we were not looking for it! Street parking out front. I hope they do very well here!"}
{"text":"So far so good!  Tacos...5 stars.  The most authentic taco-truck/street style tacos I've had in Calgary.  The fillings and condiments are spot on!  Choose any meat and you won't be disappointed.  It would've been nice to have a sautéed chicken option but it's all good...shredded chicken lacks the flavor punch.  My only gripe is I wished they would toast the outer tortilla on the grill for a few seconds to give it a bit of texture and flavor....will have to request that next time.  Mexican rice...4 stars.  Better than most. They use the proper grain but the rice is a bit on the soggy side.  If they can control the moisture, this dish/side would be exactly the way it's served in the lower 50 States.  Refried beans...3 stars.  A little too mushy...not enough chunks of beans and very little bacon flavor.  But in its defense, it seems to be served this way in most Calgarian Mexican restaurants.  Chicken enchilada...4 stars. An above-average dish.  As long as you have the right tortilla, sauce, and cheese, you can't go wrong.  What would make this a 5 star offering is to season the chicken a bit more...shredded chicken, enough said.  The dish could also use a bit more cheese but not a deal breaker.  Nevertheless, I'm certain the other meat fillings will easily get this dish a 5 star rating (as they're the same proteins offered in the tacos).  Barbacoa...5 stars.  This is by far my favorite Mexican protein for tacos...I'm surprised it's not offered here in the taco section!?!  Regardless, having the meat wrapped up in a crispy shell is just as good.  The Barbacoa here is as good as any I've had...it reminds me of a nice tender short rib.  Next time I'll have to ask it they can use the softer taco tortillas."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Calgary. Since coming home from California I have been looking for a place to compare to the Mexican food there. This place definitely does that!"}
{"text":"This is where you need to go when you're lazy to cook but don't want to eat garbage. Everything tastes so home made and the owners are lovely. Tip: be brave and try the tripe soup. The Pozole on weekends is a definite DO. And whatever you do drink some horchata!!"}
{"text":"This is a Taqueria. Don't expect the ambiance of a 5* restaurant.  It's a hole in the wall. no lie, but the prices are good, service prompt.  What you WILL find is friendly folks, and fantastic tacos. We loooooove the Tacos de Lengua. After eating those, the rest are bland. Try it. C'mon, it's not what you think it'll taste like. Just have ONE.  They use corn tortillas, and I haven't had any cross-contamination issues so far.  Posole soup - only on Saturdays you say? Well, I think that's the day. They make it once a week. Maybe call ahead if that's what you want.  There's also torta - sandwiches, but not gluten-free. The other half had one, and said it was good.  Parking... a little tight. Street in the neighbourhood, but, if you're on a scooter, that won't matter."}
{"text":"The idea of having a dinner party with no one cooking or bringing anything is a weird idea. In fact if you're just going to someone's house, cheek-to-cheek greeting in fancy fashion, then driving over to a taco joint to pick up food, then it isn't a dinner party, it's JUST HANGING OUT.  Alright so I maaayyybe exaggerated, my friend did make an amazing black bean dessert and I made spiked horchata that made everyone all warm and gooey.  Anyways kudos to Steph W who recommended this place to me. I'm getting more and more impressed with Calgary's taco scene, with places El Charrito that pop up in the city.  Their menu is interesting, they offer your traditional street tacos, but also other mexican dishes (which I'm hoping to try at a later visit) like menudo, torta, and releno.  I settled with four tacos, two beef tongue and two chorizo. Wham bam thank you mam. The beef tongue was done well and I could have downed another two. But then again beef tongue isn't that intimidating at all to sell, it just takes a lot of time to cook but def worth drawing taco aficionados. The chorizo was also just as amazing. Well season chorizo is also tricky but often because people can't leave that shit alone. Let the spices and the meat speak for itself for crying out loud!  Sometimes I'm lucky to have my tank-like frame because it means I can EAT MORE. Yes, there was room. So I ordered their chicken and beef tamales. Equally amazing, the fillings were subtle in seasoning and I could tell good masa was used in the wrapping.  Lastly, I find the place quite charming. It's not a fancy restaurant but more so a quick-on-the-go eatery with various mexican goods to pick up on the side.  Oh edmonton trail, stop being awesome, you already have my fav brunch spots, why you gotta host a taqueira like that? WHY!? Jerkface."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentleman, Kensington has a Taqueria! If you're looking for good food fast and inexpensive, El Charrito is one of your best options around.   No shredded cheddar and sour cream and this taco joint - you'll only find authentic Mexican street style tacos. We're talkin' onions, cilantro, salsa and your choice of meat piled up on two small corn tortillas with a squeeze of lime juice for under $3. Freakin' wonderful! What choices of meat? Oh you've got some choices. Shredded beef, chicken, steak, pork, and even beef tongue if you want to step out of your normal northern North America comfort zone.  I'm a pretty huge fan of the Al Pastor or pork taco. They come with little bits of pineapple mixed in with the pork and it's oh so good. Kind of like a mini Mexican Hawaiian pizza... except not a pizza at all... and 100% a taco.   For something a little different, check out the barbacoa tacos. they're fired or grilled so the tortilla is nice and crispy. This might be where the crunchy US and Canadian taco originated. It's a little more like that... except not at all. Crispy fried shell loaded with shredded beef for under $4. They're a nice switch up.  You get to take your pick of medium or hot sauce. This is possibly the only place where I really truly like them both. I'll order a couple medium, which is good and tangy but shouldn't be too terrifying for the spicy-challenged and the hot has some really good kick to it! If you like your spice, no, it won't be the spiciest thing you've ever had. They're not trying to make a macho statement with it, but it sure is tasty and should keep your heat receptors happy.  Take your tacos to go and you'll be in and out in 5 minutes. Or, if you're not in a rush there are some tables for you to chill out at and watch some super dramatic passionate Mexican soaps on the TV.  I'm so glad to have an El Charrito in Kensington. I'll see y'all soon!"}
{"text":"This place is bad. The tacos weren't very flavorful and the burrito was pretty small and bland. Definetly a hole in the wall place with decent value but would not go back. I didn't find the menu very extensive as thru didn't offer tortilla soup or fish tacos as options."}
{"text":"I adore the Chorizo Tacos! The friendly staff are helping me with my Espanol and every friend I've brought in says they'll be back. The place is often quite busy and they're open late. Give it a whirl, it's great."}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos! Not the greatest decor and no alcohol, but they are the real deal with the Mexican food. The people are friendly and it is a family run and owned place. If you want to eat real homemade Mexican food without the high prices and a friendly atmosphere, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Wow and wow! You know how you read how good a place is and then you think it is one of those tiny places you drive by and never notice and it is awesome, well this is it!  The restaurant isn't big, the staff is amazing and fun and the food, so good!  The barbacoa tacos (not even close to how to spell them) is my new fav, and will be yours too!  We ate our food so fast we forgot to take pics! Lol"}
{"text":"too expensive for the quality of product.  At least when you get it from a street vendor in mexico, they make it fresh for you.  Here the meat was prepared days in advance and everything is frozen.   The tacos are so tiny for 4$ a pop, 10 are a light snack.  I'd say its better from a street vendor in mexico."}
{"text":"If you are Mexican/Mexican foodie - 2/5 Everyone else - 4/5  --------------  Ambience: 5/5 - Feels like you walked into a taco joint in Mexico. Price: 5/5 - Think fast food Mexican prices. This is value for your money! Service: 5/5 - Every time I have been here they have been amazing! Doesn't matter if its evening rush or Saturday midnight.  Food: This is where things get .... difficult.  IF you are NOT a Mexican foodie then you may very well enjoy this restaurant. If you want to enjoy food without too much spice and/or more mild flavors then this is a great pick - 4/5  BUT IF you are a Mexican foodie, you will lament the lack of spices and flavor, because there is close to none. The salsa is spicy and you can add some flavor that way but in the end... it is simply not up to standard. - 2/5   Hope this helps! Enjoy.  ================  What did I eat?

My Mexican friends dislike the food here and some of my non-Mexican friends come here to get their taco fix because pepper is too spicy... 0.0"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food, what a find. Landed into town, and had to have lunch before starting. Found this place. The owners are from Jalisco,Mexico and they serve some very authentic Mexican fare.   I had the Chorizo Burritto and it was very fat and tasty. I added 2 Beef Tacos and I was set for the afternoon."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican, friendly mom & pop shop. I will definitely be back for those fantastic steak tacos. Warning - Hot means hot!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed here. Fantastic and authentic. Best burrito I've honestly ever had. Even better than the ones I ate in Mexico. Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a decent burrito that my son could enjoy here in Calgary for years, and finally EL Charrito served up one that he enjoyed like the ones he was used to in SoCal, and almost at the SoCal price too ($6.25). For me they had horchata to drink and some great tacos) and chili re-llanos ($12.50). El Charrito offers some very friendly service and some excellent Mexican food just like the Taquerias in SoCal with similar prices too. Definitely recommend this place to anyone that enjoys eating some simple Mexican dishes. Their menudo is served on Saturdays and Sundays!"}
{"text":"Barbacoa was sooo good, and the horchata and hibiscus drinks are both so refreshing. Very friendly service at good prices"}
{"text":"We had a pozole and Chile Relleno with two tacos. Pozole had a big chunk of meat and tasted very good. Tasted good Mexican foods. My wife says it taste like home made Mexican dish. I agree. it doesn't look like very fancy restaurant. However prices is not that reasonable. Our total came to somehow around \"nice dinner\" price. If I had to pay this much I'd prefer to go to other nice mexican restaurants which takes care of their service and dishes a bit better."}
{"text":"Really good. Open until pretty late and great food and service. The owner is super nice!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at its finest! I was totally craving tacos and since I was heading to Thrifty Princess and the MEOW garage sale next door, I planned ahead and went on my errands with an empty stomach. The funny owner was helpful with ordering and I selected the quesadilla cuz I was feelin cheesy. This is the strangest quesadilla I've ever had, but boy was it gooooood! The soft white Mexican melts cheese acted as a cozy bed for the flavourful shredded chicken, and the strange addition of lettuce and sweet raw onions coupled with the thin salsa inside turned out to be the cherry on top! The lettuce added a crunch, the onions added a sweetness, and the medium salsa added a bit of kick and a ton of flavour.  I ate the whole thing, and I don't feel bad about it in the slightest. My lime Jarrito soda topped it all off. I already want to go back and I only finished eating a few hours ago."}
{"text":"It's not very often I get a few minutes to grab a lunch that I want where I don't have to worry about little people not liking what we are eating.  Finding myself kid free I made today all about me and stopped into El Charrito Taqueria to grab a bite to eat on the way home.  I don't have a large appetite but did order 3 tacos (2 chicken, 1 pork) and a delicious grape Sangria Senorial beverage.  They asked if I wanted my tacos medium or hot and for the first time I thought I would stick with medium since I didn't know what their heat scale was like.  Next time I will order hot :).  They were delicious, fresh, authentic and very well priced (under $10 lunch).  A great find hidden away on Edmonton Trail...I can see why John Gilchrist gave it an 8.5/10."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for our craving tacos.  They are tasty and authentic. They are extremely cheap as well.  This spot opens late. We usually get the chicken tacos or the barbecoa.  Try it extra spicy if you like spice."}
{"text":"The owners are the most genuine people and it shows In the food! The tacos are my favorite!! Authentic Mexican!!"}
{"text":"We  El Charrito! It's the most authentic, scrumptious, and welcoming Mexican restaurant in Calgary. Try the tacos or the homemade pozole!"}
{"text":"Food is good and inexpensive though portion is also not large. Tried a few different tacos, fairly tasty."}
{"text":"I'll take a combo #5... wait, this isn't TB. It sure isn't! It's quick and dirty... it's not really dirty. Let's go with quick and tasty instead. Tacos sold by the taco, not by the combo. The real deal, corn tortillas, plenty of filling. $2.25 each and made to order. Guess what? No tube meat either! And not covered in sour cream, refried beans and cheap tomatoes? OMG! What is this world coming to?   If you're like me, 2 tacos and a side of guacamole and chips should do you just fine. If you've got a hungry friend in tow, double the amount of tacos. Mine were chicken. They were the best late Friday lunch a girl could hope for on the go.  Seriously. Fast. Cheap. Delicious. Go directly to El Charrito. Do not pass TB. Do not think about fries supreme. This is better. Promise!"}
{"text":"Not a single vegetarian option, and the food that we did get just wasn't all that good -- it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. Also, I am pretty sure I got food poisoning from the asada as I was sick all the next day."}
{"text":"This one of the best places to eat real Mexican food for a fair price and good taste. I randomly came here when I went with my family to do some legal stuff.  The guys are very friendly and kind.  We had a nice chat with them and tried different kind of tacos.  My recommendation is try the chorizo and tongue tacos... They are amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was here well over a month ago and I can't remember the name of the tacos I ate, but it was some sort of BBQ'd crispy situation.  Although I enjoyed the crunchiness, there wasn't much beef and some of the ingredients were rather runny.  I ordered two tacos and learned that one was more than enough considering I was trying other menu items.  My spouse ate the refried beans, which were almost the consistency of soup and reportedly rather bland.  They didn't look appetizing so I didn't bother to taste them myself.  The best items I ate were the chips and salsa.  As far as I'm concerned, that was the only item really worth ordering.    The venue is very low key and I'd be okay with showing up wearing my grubbiest clothes.  I can't say I'd purposefully make an effort to return."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE- How it has a 4 star rating is beyond me??? Clearly the reviewers have not had the amazing authentic Mexican food around Calgary?  This place was awful and service worse. I walked in and ordered my food, I  had a joke with the owner about his being happy I wanted it spicy, tipped him and then I got my food.  The food was awful, but the treatment I received when making a complaint that my quesadilla was soggy as it was in a pool of soupy water and I couldn't even pick it up nor cut it, there was no cheese, the chicken and bread were stale and the lettuce wilted, he not only refused to give me money back or offer a different plate, he and his coworker (wife possibly) proceeded to insult me. They said I was rude since\" I walked in the door\"?? I explained how that was not true and I only wanted a refund and reminded them of our jovial conversation when I walked in the door.  I cannot urge you enough to stay away from this establishment not only for the stale runny food, but for the downright false accusations and poor service. I have been to many Mexican establishments in Calgary as it's my all time favourite food and have been very pleased with authentic Mexican restaurants (this is NOT authentic and puts other establishments that DO serve authentic the wrong impression), but this was not only awful food but it was incredibly disheartening the treatment I received when making a valid complaint.  http://www12.albertahealthservices.ca/health-inspections/SearchServlet?direct=search&letter=&name=el+charrito&address=calgary&municipality=&community="}
{"text":"Ok. I happened to drag my family here so that I didn't have to suffer an Earls moment.  Regrettable.   I was so stoked for real Mexican food. I ordered a chile relleno, DH ordered 3 hard beef tacos, kids split a chicken burrito.   Burrito went down ok, looked plain but edible. DH said the tacos weren't spicy as he as ordered them however, the last one had a kick.   I was served a pepper run over by a truck, un-stuffed, topped with what I think was cheese, served with thin bean diarrhea and old, dry orange, flavourless rice.   I asked for hot sauce - which was AWESOME - but this couldn't help the rest of my meal....I ate none of the sides and 3/4's of the other thing.   The kids said the burrito wasn't so good but they were hungry.   I don't care about the atmosphere, it was actually very authentically Mexican street corner which I liked.....but never again."}
{"text":"1:30 am, on the way home from The Stampede with a few friends, the corn dogs from earlier have long since been digested and the growlies have taken hold....what to do?  Well, if you're passing the best taqueria in Calgary you park, go inside and order a few as a tasty nightcap.    If you haven't been to El Charrito and you're a fan of Mexican food you've been missing out.  While not fancy inside it serves the tastiest, freshest Mexican street food in Calgary.   Not a huge menu but enough that you never get tired of ordering the same thing.    muy bueno!!!"}
{"text":"Ok this is a review only of their tacos. If you want really great, authentic Mexican tacos (which are only two corn tortillas, delicious meat, cilantro, and onions) then you will LOVE this place. The other items on the menu looked ok, but we were specifically looking for authentic Mexican street-style tacos.   This is a good size space (with about 10 tables) but it's not really a sit-down restaurant. It's a very casual little place with yummy, yummy tacos. I don't think I would recommend this for a 'dinner' but rather a great place to stop to buy tacos, some corn tortillas, and assorted sauces. The tongue, sausage, beef, and chicken tacos are about $3 while the barbacoa is about $4. This is a little steep for tacos, but that seems to be par for the course around here. The barbacoa is a little more expensive due to the fact that the tortillas fried and the meat is a little more involved. However, the cheaper tacos are delicious as well.   To me, this really seems like the sort of place that you stick to the menu items that are the most recommended. Like I said, I cannot vouch for the rice/beans/tamales/quesadillas, but they didn't seem that appetizing to me.  Honestly, the next time we go we will probably still only get the tacos, but we would definitely drive across town just for the tacos."}
{"text":"I never really understood what was mexican until recent years.  In Montreal, there really wasn't any authentic places at all, or even a Taco Bell for that matter, so all I was exposed to was the Taco kits you could find at a supermarket.  Heck, even after moving to Calgary, I can arguably say I still wasn't particularly mexican food stimulated whatsoever as all there was was the Salt and Peppers, Taco Time, Taco Bell and Julio Barrio's in Kensington for the longest time.  Needless to say, while they taste fine, I knew there had to be more to the complexity of flavours than tacos and enchiladas (especially since one of the winners of Top Chef Masters,Rick Bayless, won the whole darn thing with a mole that's supposed to be out of this world).  So when John Gilchrist reviewed this little unknown place on Edmonton Trail, I was curious.  Add that a friend of mine wanted to try some mexican places as well, and it seemed to be a match made in guacamole.  First things first, don't expect anything fancy about the decor. No sombreros decorating the ceiling or mexican flags waving all over the place.  It's functionaly, kinda empty almost with some minimalist pics here and there.    Next, it's basically run more like an order desk with no table service.  You order at the cash, and wait for your number to be called when your food is ready.  The menu is pretty straight-forward, but several items are not available except only on weekends like pozole.  It's also pretty darn cheap, with a soft taco around $2.50 each, so you can have a few for quite an inexpensive meal.  The meats (beef and chicken) were tender, well seasoned, and complemented the simple veggie toppings with a simple sauce.  They were excellently done.  Now as for why my review is not 4 or 5 stars, well... the rice and beans.  Everything else was actually quite good, especially the freshly made nachos and salsa (it makes a hell of a difference), but the rice and beans were just ... well... horrible.  Both overcooked to the nth degree, they were both lifeless, tasteless and devoid of salt, pepper or any perceivable spice.  Honestly, it was like it was a porridge than a tangible food item.  It was a sour enough note to kinda ruin the whole experience.  Still, it's a good enough place to try and try again.  Avoid the rice and beans (which sadly is such a staple of mexican cuisine so to have it done so poorly was a shock), and try the rest of the food.  #39 of Yelp's 30-Day Review Challenge"}
{"text":"El Charrito Taqueria is a pretty good value.  That being said, their food is fresh, service great and location is very central.  They are open late so if you're fishing for a late night snack or missed dinner then it is a viable option.  It is certainly not a place to bring someone on your first date or someone you need to impress.  The food is simple and straightforward, fresh ingredients, but nothing spectacular here.  If only they served fish tacos (I know they aren't traditional)... but they would do so well selling them.  I'll definitely return..."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by admitting I have eaten some great tacos in my life. I've eaten great tacos in Texas and in New York City and in Mexico.  This is a shame but I feel Calgary gets really excited about mediocre food sometimes. Perhaps this place had some great times last year or maybe the year before and hence the glowing reviews? Maybe I went at the wrong time. I don't know. All I can do is document my own experience here.   I had heard good things from other people so when the question of where to go for something good to eat came up I thought my girlfriend and I should try this place Friday night. I tried ordering tamales but they were all out. I tried ordering Horchata but none left. I love Chile Riano but I didn't see it on the menu.  I'm not a fan of beef tongue so I would never order that.  I ate three tacos. The doubled corn tortilla is always a treat. I asked for spicy. There was some spice to it. Nothing exciting. Very unnecessarily soggy for some reason? I take small bites and I finished one taco in three bites, it was tiny. It wasn't bad but this is nothing to get excited about. In fact, for what I ordered in addition to the ambience and service I would say it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I never thought it would be so convenient living around the block from a Mexican restaurant, but when you get the craving it's amazing. Firstly, the location and signage might cause you to miss it completely so you have to open your eyes and look for this hidden treasure.   I ordered the enchiladas which were served with refried beans and rice. They were very tasty and packed with flavour especially when you add their house hot sauce (salsa verde?).   For some of their items like the tacos, burritos, and enchiladas, you can pick your meat (beef, chicken, pork, chorizo, or lengua(tongue)). So many good choices, but I find the chorizo and lengua are my favourites. Another awesome choice is the tomales, which are pork/chicken suffed masa wrapped and prepared in the corn husk. Bursting with corn flavour they are one of my go-tos.   They do a great job with the menu that they have. My only negative is that the menu is smaller and sometimes I just want Mexican seafood (which they don't have)."}
{"text":"Worst tacos I have ever had, meat was dry and no flavour at all, sauces had no flavour and tacos taste like dry tortilla. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The mole sauce is NOT GLUTEN FREE!    We were driving home after Russel Peters looking for a Vietnamese place as I was craving noodles. Anyway we spotted this place headed north on Edmonton Trail. It was 1130 pm and was super surprised to find they are open until 1 am Friday and Saturday. They had a very authentic menu. They serve Menudo beef tripe stew and a protein you have the option of chicken, steak, pork chorizo & Lengua (google it).  we decided to have the enchiladas and got one pork, chicken and steak. The chicken was the best out of the 3.  The beans were very tastey but the rice was a lil dry and sticky. I have had better Mexican food but this would be great if I'm craving Mexican late night. would try it again."}
{"text":"I went here because the reviews leaned positive. The chorizo and pork tacos were good.  The chicken tacos were really bland, and the guacamole was really soupy and brown.  It wasn't the worst and it wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Good street tacos. Good flavours. Most authentic I have had in Calgary. Wish the meat had a bit of a sear on it but that was my only thought that could improve."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm . . . . . .  Where to start. . . . Not really sure how this place got such good reviews? Must depend on how late it is and how drunk you are.   Service was poor, not really very friendly at all from the get go. Food was kind of bland, and not what i would refer to as authentic Mexican. Prices are relatively low, but quantity is small. .  . .  I make more flavorful tacos and I'm Irish :)  .   We've had some great mexican food in Calgary, but this wasn't it.   Best advice, don't eat here.   Try Native Tongues or even Blue Star just down the hill,  better tacos and much better service."}
{"text":"Simple décor.. But a very strong Mexican fair.  I visited the place for lunch.  Restaurant is on a busy street so parking has to be on the side streets.  The menu is good and varied.  I went for a bistec enchilada.  I thought it was good and flavourful   the service is ok as I had to come and pick the fish from the counter.  He should improve providing sauces as I had to ask for it after I stated eating.  Also I was not offered water or beverages.  I asked for them.  The restaurant is not very expensive ànd it is worth the visit but you should not expect a full service.  Restaurant is very clean including bathrooms.. You should give it a try and come by."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Calgary, and it's not even close. If you don't agree, let's meet at the bike racks and settle this.  I lived in California for 3 years, and used to frequent a little Mexican grocery store with a taqueria booth at the front. The kind of place where the real Mexicans go and you order in Spanish. I've never felt as white as when I ordered there, but dios mío, were those tacos ever good. I still have dreams about them. Succulent, mouth watering, juicy, wet.... dreams.   I tried for years to find authentic Mexican in Calgary. It was all terrible. Especially the one named after table condiments. It was all so bland and awful, no spice, no flavour. Reading some of these others reviews made actually made me angry. People complaining about the tacos being runny and small? That's how tacos are supposed to be! Fresh lime squeezed on top, juices running down your chin. These are the best you'll find in Calgary. They take me back to California.  El Charrito is run by a super friendly brother and sister combo who moved here from Mexico. I always wondered why it was so quiet at lunch, but the owners told me that Mexican people eat later in the afternoon. I tried coming for a late lunch to verify this for myself, and sure enough, the restaurant was filled with people speaking Spanish. This is how you know it's good.  I always order the tacos, and I usually get 5 of them, but I have a huge appetite. The best ones are the al pastor (pork) and the chorizo (spicy pork sausage) in my opinion. The carne asada (steak) and pollo (chicken) don't quite live up, though my wife disagrees and swears by the carne asada. I also like the deep fried barbacoa taco. I always get them hot, which is spicy enough to leave your mouth on fire. I've also had the little pieces of habenero chile cut up on top when they offer it, which really takes the spiciness up to the feel-it-the-next-day level.  This isn't a fancy place, it's made to order quickly and efficiently. But it's authentic. A great place for a lunch or quick dinner. The food is amazing. Try it."}
