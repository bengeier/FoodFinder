{"text":"Just had the pleasure of eating at My Little Dumplings. One word: delicious! Most memorable food I have tasted in very long time. Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"With Bashir you get what you see! Happiness and joy in every bite.  His energy and creativity is awesome and makes you relish his food.  His dumplings are a mix of asian dumplings with an array of ingredients you normally do not find.  They are mixed, chopped and prepared with love and affection, like his little dumplings.  He caters, he cooks and he will become your best friend.  Menu changes regularly and items come and go based on success or failure, but I have never seen an item leave for good.  Try it once and you will be begging for mercy to have more."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, and on both occasions the food was absolutely delicious!  The owner is super friendly and while the food is not immediately ready, the wait is completely reasonable for this quality.  I am lucky enough to live mere steps away, and see that I will have to add a \"dumplings\" category to my monthly budget :)"}
{"text":"Popped in on a hot afternoon.  Owner was very friendly and offered some the items he was preparing for a catering affair. Had chicken dumplings with shiitake mushrooms,cabbage and green onion in a delicious  light but flavourful broth.  Great, quick lunch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Afternoon sun is shining through the West corner window, the owner Bashir has already shook my hand while Stevie Wonder soothes my tired heart, and I almost don't care if the dumplings are any good. I'm contented - and then the dumplings I get are very good. Gnocchi with delicious tomato sauce and a cooling green topping that challenges the tomatoes.   A great addition to the nabe, right across from the Greenwood 504 streetcar and the 503 bus stop."}
{"text":"My husband and I have heard about My Little Dumplings from various media, and were very interested to try them out. We finally did tonight :)  We dropped by for take out at 7:30pm tonight and Bashir the owner was super friendly and nice. He recommended a secret menu item to us (Momos with refried beans and shrimp). We went with his suggestion and weren't we glad! It was super tasty and juicy, and the sauce that came with it complemented it perfectly.   This is their soft opening, so the hours are from Tuesday to Saturday (the image I posted is incorrect), and their grand opening is May 1st.  My husband and I will definitely be back to try out other items!"}
