{"text":"Food quality and portion is reasonable for its price. 
I like the wide variety of sauces that can added onto the dishes."}
{"text":"so I work in the area and I have went to this place before management switched over. Previous owners Joe and his wife were very pleasant always personable and made you feel like family. The new managers are just straight up cheap. My company gives this man a 25% discount for our services. First encounter with this establishment he tells me \"I'll upgrade your pop to an ice tea\" aw thanks the Asian tax on Nestea....
Recently had to interact with the owner of K WOW again and K WOW was it even worse this time. He told me he would wave the taxes on my meal. Really leaves a bad taste in my mouth considering the discount he gets."}
{"text":"This little Korean lunch counter serves the yummiest kimchi rice burgers in the downtown core. I purchase them frequently for lunch (yes, I even have one of those frequent buyer cards that gets stamped with every rice burger bought).

Admittedly, I hadn't gotten around to writing a review for this place, which was always charming and endearing.

Today, I went to grab a kimchi rice burger, and the man behind the counter said that there weren't any pre-made ones left in the warmer. 

\"That's cool, can I order one to be freshly made?\"

\"No. We've actually stopped carrying kimchi.\"

Wow. K Food? You must be the ONLY Korean restaurant in the world that does not carry kimchi, perhaps the greatest staple food in all of Korean cuisine, and beyond that, Korea's official \"national dish\". 

Maybe if I go back tomorrow, they'll say that they've stopped carrying rice too?"}
{"text":"An acceptable eating choice when one is on a budget and downtown. Recommend the pork bone soup and pancakes...skip the black noodle and fried chicken. Quick and easy cheap eats."}
{"text":"I had the chicken cutlet today. It came out fairly quick and tasted pretty good. I come here once in awhile when i have a craving for korean food. Overall food here is good i think. Especially now its under new management the food looks more clean and tastes better than the previous owners.."}
{"text":"this place is mediocre. the only reason i would eat here sometimes is because it's the closest place for korean food around my school (i rly don't wanna go out to like actual restaurants)

i actually quite like their spicy beef soup. they could be more generous with the beef though otherwise just call it spicy soup if you're just gonna put in like 3 pebble-sized beef meat 

their pork bone soup is apparently really good according to my mom

their dumpling soup is absolutely DISGUSTING OH GOD MAN THOSE AINT DUMPLINGS!!! THEY WONTONS !!! LEFT A FOUL  AFTERTASTE !!!!!!!!! 

next is the soon tofu .. not bad ; more flavour would be good; lots of tofu

finally their bibimbaps are just nope. no meat whatsoever it's just lettuce like legit. i decided to try it because i wanted to fill myself up with rice before going to the big bang concert !! portion was hecka small and so was my stomach after eating it so yeah and it was also flavourless. definitely not worth for how much they charge you. 

ill stick with my beef soup if i rly crave for korean food other than that nah their stuff ain't for me 

**their food is even pricier now ; like an extra $1"}
{"text":"I don't remember when or how I got here and decided to check this place out but anyway, I did so here's my review.

I always have a craving for korean food and it's hard to find a cheap and good jajangmyeon. So I decided to give place a shot. It was edible but horribly small portion and I'm not even a big eater but I could eat like 2 bowls and ordinary people might need at least 3 bowls. The noodle was good (smooth and all that jazz) but the sauce was quite salty -  as if they used instant jajangmyeon I bought from convenient store. Will I give it a second shot? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Since the owners have changed food is great and better than any other food option! I had the traditional cold noodle (nengmyun) and it was great! I just went there and tried the bulgogi poutine! Great idea and the portions are huge!!! Plus you get a drink with every meal! You can't get that anywhere for $7!"}
{"text":"Won't be your best bibimbap, but will be some pretty good bibimbap when you have a craving, and have $7.90 to spare (drink included). You have some beef, some egg, some carrots, some zukes, some bean sprouts, spinach- my only complaint on the value scale is that maybe they could throw a few more mushrooms in there. Throw your sauce on before you close your container, and the lady at the counter helps you bag up your take out. Pretty happy with this lunch."}
{"text":"They seem to have Friday specials. They had one for pork cutlet (donkatsu) combo for $6.
I was getting tired of shawarmas so decided to try it. I shouldn't have..
I realized that I made a mistake when my order came out within 3 minutes.
Donkatsu is fried pork, schnitzel. If you can fry a pork cutlet within 3 minutes, it's either too small or it was already fried (cold). Well, it turned out it was both! It was small and paper thin plus already fried and sitting in the cooling rack for some time because it was cold when I bit into it. And by thin I mean it was cardboard box thin.
I just don't get why these places dig their hole deeper and deeper by screwing customers.
It's not like they're gonna close shop in 3 months. Do they think people will come back after eating that crap?"}
