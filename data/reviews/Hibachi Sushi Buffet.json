{"text":"I also think the price is too high. It should be on a sign somewhere saying what the price is. The food was just OK.  We all felt that we could have gotten better food for our money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sashimi, sushi included in the buffet - you'd think it'd be low quality but it's actually good and the staff was really friendly.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"New addition to the Lake Norman area!!  First visit and i will be back.  4 stars for the food 5 stars for the service people are nice and friendly when i need help.  i was here for the dinner tonight with my gf. Foods are excellent but can be better. They got Chinese and Japanese food.   Heres are some of the highlights of this awesome new place.  Seaweed salads are one of my favorite. Iceberg lettuce with ginger dressing....yummm  Baked Salmon are unforgettable love the sauce and the fresh taste of salmon.  Havent try any of the crab legs cuz i was too lazy lol...gonna save that for next visit.  Sushi!! they got good variety of sushi and SASHIMI...white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, etc and the sushi chef make special spider roll for my gf. (special rolls are upon request)  Hibachi They have fresh salmon fillet, steak, chicken, jumpo shrimps, and plenty of veggies to choice from.  Dessert They have Hershey's ice cream cups! love the Vanilla and Chocolate flavor!  They also serve lunch and open 7 days a week! Definetly worth of trying it out and make this place stay!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why people think this is overpriced- they must not be getting sushi or crab legs. The sushi is fresh and tasty! Totally worth it. And fabulous sashimi.   There are a couple low priced Chinese buffets in this area that the people complaining about price should visit....the food and service is just terrible. I will gladly pay the extra $7 for this dinner buffet over any other LKN buffet- its totally worth it.   Also people, lunch is only $8.99, so if you're worried about price (as everyone seems to be) hit lunch on a Saturday before you splurge on dinner.  I was bummed they don't have hot tea though, maybe because they're still in the opening phases.   Either way, if you like sushi or crab legs, this place is it. I haven't had the build-your-own-stir fry yet but they seem to have all the standard options available. And of course the Chinese food was on par with other establishments, but the big ticket items are sashimi, fun sushi rolls, and crab legs. Alllllll unlimited. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"Hey all, wow!  I am assuming David is the owner or manager.  I am also assuming that John T. is rating Hibachi Sushi Buffet on the price alone.  I WILL ADDRESS THE PRICE AFTER MY REVIEW.  I gave them a 4 star because of service.  The place is friendly and go the extra mile to please you.  The place is also very clean, as in spotless.    The food is 3 or maybe 3.5 star.    There are four parts to this buffet.  1. Sushi 2. Chinese buffet 3. Hibachi 4. Dessert  The Sushi is a solid 3.5 or 4.  The Maki rolls were decent.  Typical basic rolls.  Nothing really custom or special.  Generous portions of fish.   I would have liked to ask the sushi chef to prepare me a custom roll, but I just did not have time.  Plus, no clue if they make special requests.....The Sashimi was to die for, 5 star all the way.  Fresh and tasty.  White fish, yellow tail, salmon, etc.  Just excellent!  I wish they had more Unagi out, eat more Unagi, mmmmmm!!!!  hint hint  The traditional Chinese buffet is your standard buffet.  The crab legs are okay, I tried them was not that impressed.  But I want to state that the raw oysters rocked both my wife and me.  I was shocked!!!  The oysters were some of the biggest I have ever had!  They easily compare with Rusty Rudder or Vinnies at the Lake.  Tasty good.  The soups were very good.  The lobster shrimp were outstanding!   They had a great salad bar with some very cool and interesting dishes, like KimChi and Calamari Veg mixed....  Salad bar was all fresh veggies with a good assortment of dressings.  The Hibachi was pretty darn good with all the meat looking very fresh.  Standard stuff.    Dessert bar had ice cream, cakes and fruit.  The fruit was all fresh and tasty.  Okay PRICE.  David it is over priced.  Period.  End of story.  My wife and I dropped $50 on dinner for two.  Now, the true Connoisseur of sushi will opt to go to the four other sushi joints on Catawba Ave.  For $50 you can get a better sushi meal, not as much sushi or not a buffet, but higher quality sushi.  I get that Hibachi Sushi Buffet is in the Lake Norman area and can get a higher price, but for the average buffet guest, the price is more in the $9.95 -$12.95 range.   I agree that the price should be with or without crab legs, because not everyone likes crab legs or the effort it takes to eat them.  Furthermore, there is no way that a family of four or five can afford to eat there.    I see that Hibachi Sushi Buffet is doing all the right things to attract cusotmers.... Mailer coupons, yelp coupon, good deal!  I truly hope that this buffet stays around, it is so close to our house.  But I am willing to sacrifice my time and gas money to drive the distance into Charlotte, Pineville, even Concord to visit buffet that are not as expensive, especially when I am taking my 10, 12, 13 year old children."}
{"text":"a very decent all you can eat sushi and hibachi (similar to mongolian bbq) joint in Cornelius! their lunch prices are awesome. located towards the back of a plaza, there's tons of parking and the restaurant itself is rather large.  look out for periodic coupons sent in the mail.  in terms of food, they have a good variety of japanese, chinese and american foods. don't forget about the free ice cream too!  service was nice as the manager seemed to have checked in with everyone while i was there~"}
{"text":"Over the top good. The peal and eat shrimp were some of the largest I have ever had in any restaurant. The extremely large selection of sushi and sashimi blew away any of the competition on in this area. I loved that the ice creme selections were individual serving sizes and not just big buckets that all the kids, and adults put their hands in. The deserts were great esp. the apple pie. although it was impossible to try all the en-trays the ones we had were hot and delicious! My true opinion is if you stay away from this place you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Place is closed with sign on the door saying sub landlord has taken possession of property for non payment of rent!  Stinks too as I was looking forward to going after a report from my son who went for dinner a few weeks back. Now, even if they get it together, it would make me nervous about going if they reopen. If they're skimping on the rent, are they skimping on other things too?"}
