{"text":"Don't bother going. Super Sweet Home Bar and Grill (that's a mouthful) is a recently opened restaurant where the former Green Eggplant stood. You can tell that it used to be Green Eggplant because they did not change their decor, their exterior, their staff (mostly), or their Menu (kind of). The differences though, are enough to make you not want to go again. The Menu is almost an exact replica of the former Green Eggplant's, however the portions are smaller, the prices are higher, bizarre changes are made (what are \"o'brian potatoes\"??) and it seems that the kitchen can't make any order correctly. Looked like the servers were running back to the kitchen with at least one plate from every table- the one beside me, I saw, had completely raw chicken on their plate, and did not get his new lunch for about 40 minutes. This could also be because there only seem to be 2 staff working at any given time, and what seems to be the manager standing at the bar, but not participating in service. It also sounds like former Green  Eggplant servers are being fired left right and center. Looks like there I will not be returning to super sweet home any time soon, and I suggest no one else does either- it's probably jut worth the trip to go allllll the way to the Beaches for the original Green Eggplant."}
{"text":"Being a fan and regular customer of The Green Eggplant that was there previously, I was a bit disconcerted to see that the owners would be changing.  Sadly, my worries were right.  I went here a couple of times after the owners changed, but the last time I was there was worse than my lowest expectations.  I went there at seven pm on a Wednesday, a time which would usually have been crowded if it had still been The Eggplant.  However, it was absolutely empty.  Including my table, there were two tables there.  And yet, the service was slow, the waiter rarely checked on us, and the food came all at different times.    Our fist impression was not good, our table was dirty, and when we asked the waiter to please wipe it down, he brought over a damp cloth which did not help clean it at all.  If anything, it made it worse.  It didn't even make it less sticky.  It was also a really hot day, and the air conditioning was not on, so we were sweating the entire time.  When the food arrived, it was not up to par.  I ordered a California burger with sweet potato fries; the burger was absolutely bland and burned.  My dining partner ordered the chicken schnitzel with grilled vegetables, and the vegetables were not grilled, but heated up and covered in oil.  She could not eat them.  I went with two children, one who ordered fettuccine with clumpy, tasteless, and clearly out-of-a-can Alfredo sauce, and the other one who ordered burned chicken breast with burned fries.  I'm not a picky eater, but I could barely finish my food.  I might as well mention the fact that the oil they used to cook was bad and stuck in my throat for a couple hours after.    Despite the fact that the menu is almost the same as The Eggplant's, I cannot see myself going there again.  If these owners don't step up their game, I cannot see them lasting much longer, especially in a competitive area like Eglinton West."}
{"text":"After realizing this location formerly called The Green Eggplant, changed owners, i was happy to find the menu to be pretty much identical. Having only been to the Green Eggplant at the beaches i cannot compare this restaurant to is former self, however, i did find that it was less impressive than my experience at the beaches. The complimentary dips and bread are an excellent touch that this restaurant upholds...they are delicious. I ordered the chicken shish kebab dinner $16.99. It came with a house salad to start (the dressing lacked flavour), 2 skewers of chicken (decently sized but certainly not as generously portioned as the beaches). The chicken was seasoned quite well but was slightly dry as it was white meat, luckily it came with some babaganoush on the side. There was also a choice of side and i opted for the mashed potatoes which was also quite good.  Was here with 2 DC's and they ordered a large Greek salad, and the Garlic lemon salmon dinner. The Greek salad  $10.99, was certainly large, but again lacked any sort of zest or flavour, the veg was salad bar material as well.  The salmon $18.99 looked like a nice small but thick cut and was served on a sizzling plate. It was accompanied by a house salad to start and steamed veg on the side. The salmon was a good quality cut but unfortunately the lemon overpowered the overly subtle garlic. The side veg was underwhelming in size, variety and flavour.  Overall it was an enjoyable meal, but given the relatively low ambiance of the restaurant, and the borderline price point ($$.5) I expected a little more from this joint.   *they have a sign outside advertising a new menu soon to come with old favourites and some new dishes. i would be willing to return and try them out again soon, since i live in the area."}
