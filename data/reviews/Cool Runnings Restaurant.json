{"text":"One of our favourite places to order from when we are feeling lazy. We usually get the jerk chicken and the roti because they are so good!! Not only is the food delicious, the delivery is always quick and courteous."}
{"text":"We are still loving Cool Runnings! We got together with neighbours and ordered chicken roti, rice and peas and jerk chicken from several area restaurants. We did a taste test and Cool Runnings was the winner. It got extra points for proximity...but so delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered curry chicken dinner with rice and peas around 5pm on a Sunday and wasn't impressed. RICE The rice was very soggy not because of the gravy just the way it was cooked, and hardly any peas. Curry Chicken The curry chicken was bland and didn't have much taste. It would be nice if it had small pieces of potatoes in the curry chicken. I won't be going back there"}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant. Not much seating on the inside but that's okay because the food makes up for that. I ordered the chicken roti which I never usually do and it was really good. Nice attractive presentation and just plain good! I will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was nicely slow-cooked and well seasoned. The black rice looked nice, was a little lacking in flavour.  I enjoyed the goat roti, but wished that there was more meat than potatoes/bones.  The restaurant itself was small, but had a cool vibe. Service was prompt and pleasant.   Definitely a good place for some jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"I love Cool Runnings! My favourites are the jerk chicken and the chicken roti!  I've only done take-away from there but the food has always been ready when it's supposed to be, and it's always great eats!  The serving sizes are very generous - so much so that you could share a dinner; but the food is so good that you don't want to share!  On another occasion I've tried the oxtail before and it was just okay. But I swear by the jerk chicken!  One time the coleslaw seemed a bit off but there is so much food that I just tossed the cole slaw away.  When I've done takeaway, my only pet peeve is that they don't provide you with plastic cutlery or napkins. It's fine if you're heading home, but just remember if you're not and may need forks and knives etc."}
{"text":"My wife and I had food delivered from Cool Runnings tonight. The food was delivered quickly and hot. We had the jerk chicken dinner and the curried goat dinner. The chicken was excellent, moist and full of jerky goodness. The goat was tasty, tender and the curry was flavourful with just the right amount of spice. The rice and beans were also very good. Coleslaw was fine, not the best coleslaw we've have had by any stretch. I would definitely recommend the jerk chicken and curried goat to anyone, as good as I have ever had in the city."}
{"text":"Drove passed this place a couple times and finally decided to give it a try. We were glad we did! A meal for two with two non-alcoholic drinks will cost you around $38 (before tip).   It had a very nice atmosphere with music playing. Very mellow and soothing like at the beach. The server was friendly and tried her best to take care of the patrons in the restaurants as well as the constant flow of walk-ins picking up their orders AND also tending to the phone orders. She seemed very patient and with everything going on she still managed to smile at each customer coming into the restaurant. Kudos to her!  Now onto the food...We had the oxtail/jerk chicken combo and the jerk pork. Both came with coleslaw and rice & peas. The jerk chicken was by far the best we've had in Toronto! It was packed with flavour. Overall, the food was great and good portions too. We wanted to try their patties but unfortunately they were all sold out :( Hope for better luck next time..."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken was ok, it didn't stand out compared to other jerk chicken dishes I've had. The ox-tail was amazing, but this is the first time I've had it.  Curry goat roti - had high expectations, but it disappointed. Strong gamey flavour, I've had much better curry goat dishes."}
{"text":"Great Chicken roti made to order. Really nice sauces and very attentive service!"}
{"text":"Great food with good prices! Love the roti here, I always get the chicken or potato roti and save half for tomorrow's lunch!   In my experience the food has always come quickly and been ready for me too take home. I have never eaten in at Cool Runnings but thy do have a few tables for customers to sit and eat at.  Staff are always friendly but take a while to get orders rung up.  Overall a great place for easy, tasty dinners, love coming and I am always looking for an excuse to order food from there!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good. The rice was deliciously doused in gravy, the jerk chicken was juicy and flavourful, the ox tail was fall off the bone tender. Friendly staff, but don't expect a cheap meal! Caribbean food is seldom cheap because of the time involved in preparing it I guess. Felt full for the rest of the night. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love. I've only ordered takeout, but the service has always been fast and friendly. The roti, chicken curry and jerk chicken meals are awesome. It's my new favourite place in the area, and the prices and portions are great."}
{"text":"I walked in to a cloud of perfume, facing this lady sitting at one of the tables. Feeling welcome was not what I was feeling but we were in between appointments, and needed food. I felt like I walk into a cloud of perfume and was interrupting her, she seemed more interested in her laptop and phone than welcoming us as customers.  I ordered Ox tail, it came out 2 minutes later, I think from being heated in a microwave, my food did not taste fresh. Then the lady kept staring and asking us if we were done. Also chatting on her phone like she was sitting on her sofa and we were in her kitchen.   Overall not a good experience, not even when your hungry.  Perhaps shouldn't be dealing with customers."}
{"text":"Awesome and to die for.  Love the curried goat, rogues and chicken dumplings soup.  Interesting soft drinks."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food in the east end  I stopped by one time and got the jerk chicken warp and it was the most delicious warp"}
{"text":"Great food. Quick friendly service. I had the jerk chicken which was tender and flavourful."}
{"text":"Really bad delivery service  I was a frequent customer of Cool Runnings up until they started using Skipthedishes  online order and delivery service. The restaurant used to have their own online delivery service which worked ok - but maybe it was too hard to run. Anyway -I called the restaurant and was told that I had to use Skipthedishes  to order. While ordering I noticed that my shrimp Roti was priced at $1 - when it should have been $10. Fine I still wanted it and so I ordered it. I expected to get a call from the restaurant - which I did - and I said that I wanted my full order. I was told that they couldn't do that - that the Roti was not $1 - and I agreed that it wasn't and was happy to pay whatever was owed.  The courier was already on their way to pick up my order and this issue was not resolved - so they showed up with just my salad, no Roti.  So I sent it back. Why would I pay $17 for a salad that is $6.50?  This service sucks and expected more from Cool Runnings. It isn't the customer's fault if the website you order from has the wrong prices on it. Fix it - but I want my food. Now I'm hungry and pissed off."}
{"text":"I've never liked carribian food (made here) too starchy and stew like for all dishes.  Why do carib restaurants ignore presentation completely?  Aside from a chicken leg, why does it have to be mush?   But this joint really changed my experience. Wings, calamari and chicken roti were all excellent.  The roti has too much potatoes for me (no suprise) but when I work around them - delicious.  Warning calamari and chicken wings are pretty hot!  And I'm the kinda guy that doesn't mind hot."}
{"text":"I've frequented Cool Runnings for 10 years.  It's my favourite local restaurant. The shrimp roti is my 'go to' but I'm in love with their dumplings with oxtail gravy, jerk chicken!!! Their soup is legendary and so flavourful and stimulating on a cold winters day. I discovered callilou there and it is the best I've ever had. There's another Jamaican restaurant that opened a location in this neighbourhood not too long ago and compared to Cool Runnings...there is no comparison."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Very friendly staff and most importantly, delicious food! A must try if you like carribbean."}
{"text":"I did dig like the fluffy rice and peas and crisp cool coleslaw.  However the star of the attraction, the jerk chicken, was a tad bit overpowering of black pepper than I'd prefer. I'd also hoped the chicken skin had some crisp to it, but alas this is no outdoor charcoal grill.   Service was friendly though and prices fair.   PS. I've eaten jerk chicken/pork/shrimp in Jamaica at many local spots as a comparison."}
{"text":"Best goat roti EVER!!! You're missing out if you're fussing over the fact that they aren't boneless."}
{"text":"Food is very good here. Have had roti, wraps and soup. Heartily recommend.  At lunchtime, the jesbus channel was on the big-screen TV with sound, and when the lady who took our order had time to sit down, she would watch an angry fire-and-brimstone preacher on her iPhone with the volume turned way up and filling up the entire (small) room. Err...we've decided we'd like our meals takeout, please!  By all means come at early lunchtime for a free God-fearing religious experience. If that's not your scene, come at dinnertime or get take-out. The food really is very good."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Cool Runnings for the first time this Wednesday.  Awesome food!  The place is a bit small for sit-in dinning.  Only 6 tables.  Wife and I sat in to eat.  However, it seems like they do a lot of take-out orders.  There was a steady stream of people coming in and getting their orders.  I had the jerk chicken, rice/peas, coleslaw.  Wife had the stir-fry chicken, rice/peas.  Jerk chicken was excellent!  Spiced just right.  Rice/peas were tasty.  Good coleslaw.  Stir-fry very good.  Friendly staff. Decent value for the money.  Will definitely go back again.  Want to try the curry goat next."}
{"text":"Great place.  Nice people.    Their Chicken Roti is what I always have, even if I'm picking up for take out.  Love the Caribbean drinks as well."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best jerk chicken place you can go to on the East side of the city. Their jerk sauce is just so damn tasty, and the chicken is cooked perfectly, nice and moist. And at a fair price for jerk chicken."}
{"text":"This place is great! Really good food at a really good price. It's basically a take out restaurant but there are a couple tables and they'll do table service for you if you eat in. Just don't come expecting a table bc they can easily fill up quick.  I've had the chicken roti the first time I came and jerk chicken the second. Both times I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day (I'm a woman. A big man could prob eat the whole thing and be very satisfied). Everything so far has been delicious. They sell bottled beer too if you want a beer with your food.  Everyone has been genuinely nice and friendly when I've gone in, which makes it comfortable and relaxing place to grab takeout or eat in. You should go."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials for cheap from 11-3 mon - Fri. Great food, quick service, friendly people.  Oxtail are nice big juicy pieces with deep flavorful gravy, highly recommend. The chicken curry roti of really filling and rich in flavor.  Jerk chicken is fall off the bone delicious. Be prepared to pay big bucks after 3pm for anything.  Fried chicken is also highly recommend there as well.  Great food."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the third time last night. The first two times were fantastic, and Cool Runnings quickly became a favourite. But last night, out of four orders, the three of us who ordered the chicken roti were sick with intestinal issues the next day (one of us had chick pea roti and was fine). I contacted the restaurant and they responded fairly quickly, expressing concern and committing to investigating right away. While I feel some responsibility to disclose my negative experience, it wont necessarily stop me from ordering from there again in the future...as I'm confident that management is taking this seriously."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is not bad. It's not great and it's most definitely not the best, but it will do. The reason my rating is so low is due to the service I received here. We came to get our order for takeout 8/31/14. I asked for okra added to my steamed fish and I was assured that this can and would happen, so I ordered. When my husband and I went to get the order, low and behold, no okra at all on the fish. None. I questioned the server/cashier behind the counter, who was so busy on her cell phone, she didn't seem to care at all about what I was saying. Her response to me about a promise they made to put okra on my fish was \"we don't usually do that anyways.\" Her face was buried in her cell phone the whole time she spoke to me. I asked her 4 times about the missing okra and her response each time was \"we don't usually do that.\" I understanding what she was saying, but the point is, I would have never ordered the fish if she told me that when I placed my order and she assured me they would add okra. She went to the back to talk to the chef and came to say \"oh, he said check the jerk chicken you ordered.\" What does jerk chicken have to do with an order of steamed fish??? My husband checked and sure enough in his steamed veggies were two measly okras. I was quite upset and she continued to make her same statement. I had to eventually demand that she tell me what exactly was needed from me in order to get what I ordered. She said \"well, he can make you some more but you'll have to wait.\" Yeah, that's why I placed the order over the phone when you assured me the fish would have okra added to it. I will never go here again due to the service and lack of a desire to meet the customer needs. This cashier/server demonstrated the poorest social skills and why you cannot have a cell phone and appropriately help others.  Terrible job cashier. No phones up front when talking to customers."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cool Runnings, but I have a couple of reservations.    As a preface, I have to say, I on'y ever eat roti, and maybe some beans and rice there.  I love the roti so much I have never even thought about ordering anything else.    So, my reservations.  First, the rotis are actually too big, even for a big burly fella like me.  But they are so good, you can't NOT finish them, and maybe that extra uneaten third-of-a-roti my son can't finish.  I always leave this place pretty well ready for a nap, and may stagger out onto Main street so full and satisfied I may walk right in front of a taxi.  I probably can't blame the restaurant for that, but there it is.   Second, and this is kind of an offshoot of the first, I only go there in cooler weather, because I can't imagine eating so much on a hot day.   But once again, it's so good, I wouldn't be able to help myself.    You get the idea I like the food?  A great, fun, funky little place with a nice cold beer and great satisfying meal.  All the staff is friendly and fun, and make you want to come back.  If there is one thing to single out, it is the home-made hot sauce, which is just right on the hot scale, and way over to the right on the delicious scale."}
{"text":"I have been to Jamaica many times, have worked in a Jamaican restaurant and I believe this may be the best Jamaican in Toronto. The place is comfy and quaint with friendly staff and just the right vibe for those missing Jamaica. I love the stewed, Jerk chicken. The steam veggies are great. Kids love the fried chicken. Red Stripe  - though - tastes no different :-)"}
{"text":"My 1st option to eat caribbean food. The roties are fantastic. The jerck chicken it has the exact heat for me.  My kids love the fried chicken( they just miss the fries). In summary very good place, love the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Ordered whole jerk chicken with rice and peas and slaw for takeout.  Slaw on point, rice and peas standard, but the chicken tasted like my own sorry attempts at jerk chicken (cover chicken in supermarket jerk sauce and then bake in the oven for too long).  Not really spicy, not especially flavourful, pretty dry. I fed my spice-phobic 6 year old the leftovers in his lunch and he didn't make a peep. This is the kind of jerk chicken I would expect if loblaws started putting it in their hot chicken case."}
{"text":"Solid Caribbean fare!  Jerk chicken was moist and flavourful.  Oxtail was so tender and yummy.  I also tried the stewed pork which was good too.  My fav was definitely the oxtail!  Coleslaw was crisp.  Peas and rice were just right.    Great neighbourhood joint with a liquor license.  Eat-in or take-out.  Friendly service.    Reggae music playing...  Brought me back to the islands, that's for sure.  :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to the Beaches, and Cool Runnings has become one of our most frequented restaurants either to dine-in or take away. The place has a nice laid-back vibe to it, and the staff are very friendly. One tip: if you plan on doing take away, order online so you get a 10% discount on your order.  The food is amazing; very tasty and large portion sizes. And all at a very good price. Our favourites are the half jerk chicken, the chicken & goat platter and the goat roti."}
{"text":"Was my goto for Roti (was).  My daughter and I got Food Poisoning from the chicken Roti...and yes it was definately traced back to the Roti. Called the manager the following day to inform.  They did not seem to receptive about me telling that their food made us sick...they made it about someone trying to get a refund $$.  Told them I don't want my money back...just giving them feedback on their food.  It seemed they could care less!  Walked by a couple of times and saw the yellow rating from the city.  Not sure how sanitary the kitchen is.  Jamaican food cannot be cooked to order and has to be prepared in ahead of time (I am Jamaican so I know).  I am a big believer in supporting local business...trust me...there are other choices for good Jamaican.  Never one to bash a place but just say'n!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but unfortunately my toilet had a serious workout after woooooo wee!"}
{"text":"Okay i rarely write reviews huh .. But i read em lol how ironic   But anyways went out looking for some food with the girlfriend we live along the North York Danforth Area and thought we try this place out right . Very small unique carribean setting. Ordered the jerk chicken and Shawty got the roti i think curry chicken roti ..goodness gracious the food was the bummm !! Like i mean the coleslaw was POPPIN' if u know what i mean i would certainly be going back soon enough to try something else !!!!#coolrunnings i recommended to anyone else  !!! YAH MAN"}
{"text":"I love it here.  The jerk chicken is great.  The space is really nice and people are great.    Great selection of Caribbean drinks.  I tried the Tiger Malt which looks like Guinness but tastes like molasses.  I don't think I'll try that again, but I like that I got to try it.    This place used to be some retail shop and on either side of the door are these nice tables in display windows.  It's kinda cool.   I like it here."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was flavorful but the sauce was sometimes overpowering. Good meal that will fill you up."}
{"text":"I ordered potato roti which is safe enough that is should be delicious. But it's was HORRIBLE. The roti shell itself looked bad but it taste worse. The curry had no flavour. I ended up taking a couple bites and throwing it out.   Maybe the rice or meat dishes are better. But the potato roti was gross. I mean if you can't make it don't just put it on the menu because you think it should be there."}
{"text":"YAY! The chicken roti is so great and so filling (it's like $10 and I can barely finish half and feel full - share with a friend if you've got a smaller appetite, or order one for yourself if you're super ravenous - I promise the portion and the taste will not disappoint you). It's like... Carribean burrito :) Wrapped with a lot of care, so you food doesn't completely fall apart on you (one of the things I hate about eating burritos). The lady at the counter was really friendly and the orders came in a timely fashion. My friends and I took our orders to go. It was a great lunch to go but I reckon it'd be nice eating in as well - the place has a nice homey atmosphere and there are tables good for small groups. Not good for large groups though."}
{"text":"I have ate here on 2 different occasions. The service and atmosphere is great, food is a little hot for my tastes but very good. I just have to cool down with a beer LOL. A great little neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was ready on time. Pleasant service and the food was very tasty. We got two entrees but honestly one would've been enough for two people. Definitely recommend if you want good Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Have tried a few dishes here and I keep going back. Best I've had yet.. Drive in from Durham to get my fill.. Great job."}
{"text":"Yum, my favorite place for Jerk and Roti's, the shrimp roti is on the regular rotation...   Atmosphere reminds me of being in the Caribbean, as does the music and beverages, when it get's all cold and dreary around here, I find myself with a sudden craving..."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with DW and was pleasantly surprised.  Good portions good. I had the jerk chicken (was very moist and tasty), DW had the Ox tail and it too was very soft, fall off the bone.  Saw two guys with the Roti - looks good and plentiful.  Service was friendly. Lots of take out.  Sitting area is small, so more than 4-5 people would be a hit or miss if you will get a table.  Will be going back to see if the kids would like it..."}
{"text":"Was craving jerk chicken since I haven't had it in a long time and ordered dinner take out from this place on skip the dishes at a whime. The food was ready to be picked up in no more than 15 minutes since the order was placed and we were not disappointed. The food DELICIOUS - truly mouth watering. I had the half jerk chicken dinner with rice and peas; the portion was huge so I was unable to finish it despite not having eaten all day. Amazing portions, prices, cook of the chicken. Had the rum cake for dessert to top it off and it was prime."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. Their Kingish Escovitch, especially, is really good! Their fish is fresh, the sauce is flavourful and spicy (if you want it to be), and their beans and rice are yummy too! I've only ever ordered take out and they're pretty efficient and consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chana roti and was so disappointed. It lacked so much flavor and actually made me feel sick. So many onions. I have tried 10+ Jamaican roti restaurants in Toronto and this was the worst. Their chicken roti is fine, so I'm confused how this one could be so different. There is clearly no substitute for flavorful, scrumptious meat.   My boyfriend had fried chicken, with rice and peas. So yummy! Such a generous portion too.   I will return once I can stomach food again."}
{"text":"extremely good. happy as can be totally hit the spot  exactly what we were craving. good service chill atmosphere tasty"}
{"text":"Good food but the prices are high for what you get. Service was lackluster."}
{"text":"Sort of stumbled upon this place when I was craving something different to order in. Some of the best jerk and fried chicken I've ever had! Nice large portions and super fast delivery. Will definitely order again...oh wait...I already have!!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny shop/bar with great food!  I tried the oxtail and goat platter, with a side of plantains.  Incredibly yummy, and I had food left for the next week.  If this place was in Denver, I'd eat here a LOT."}
{"text":"To be honest I was not going to eat here. When I was going to enter the resto, a man was slamming the front window from the inside with a menu trying to kill a wayward fly.  Once I decided it was worthwhile to try it (it took me a long time to get there) I walked into a smaller space than I expected. The location had minimal seating and the chairs and tables seem to have experienced quite a bit of wear  I ordered the curry goat with rice and peas, as I have been craving it for a while. It was probably the best curry goat I have ever had (other than my mother's). Perhaps I was starving and feeling emboldened by my courage, but I loved every bite. The rice and peas were perfect, with just the right amount of scotch bonnet. However, the coleslaw was nothing to write home about; It was a bit too watery for my liking (I was not there for the coleslaw though!)"}
{"text":"It doesn't happen often but once in a while food is so good I want to cry. Instead I just say to the wait staff over and over it's sooooooooo good until they Don't really know what to say anymore (you can only say I'm glad you enjoyed so many times) and start to look uncomfortable.   I had the small jerk chicken dinner which comes with rice and peas (kidney beans) and coleslaw. The seasoning has just the right amount of bite and becomes addictive. I was full long before I stopped eating...and I only stopped eating because I ate it all!   Husband had boneless goat rotI. I tried it and it was also quite good. He said it was the best he ever had.   The service was really fast and the waitress was lovely and helpful. I will definitely go back as soon as possible! My only complaint is not trying this place out sooner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it. Prices have gone up in the last few years but still worth it.   Jerk Chicken is the only way to go."}
{"text":"Cozy hole in the wall place for great Caribbean food.  I tried the Ox tail ($17), half jerk chicken ($16) and fried plantain ($2.5)   I would recommend the half jerk chicken. I enjoyed the flavour even though it was a little spicy for me. The large side of rice and coleslaw helped to tone down the spice level. The meat was moist throughout other than the chicken breast (expected).The serving was also huge! It definitely can be shared with two people.  I found the fried plantain to be nothing special and the \"large\" oxtail while super tender was tiny in comparison to the half chicken.  This place also seems to be quite popular for takeout as we saw many people coming in and picking up food to go."}
{"text":"The shrimp roti is amazing!! I believe they make their own roti bread, it's so soft and fresh. The vegetables are fresh, the sauce is delicious. There aren't a ton of shrimp in the shrimp roti but I find myself craving it often.... The seating area of the restaurant is small, maybe 7-8 tables. I usually order take out and it comes hot and fresh."}
{"text":"It's such a quaint little spot. Very clean and cozy. The server was friendly and made me feel at ease, even though I was eating alone.   I ordered the chicken roti. Huge portion size. There were many large chunks of chicken, but it was incredibly underseasoned. This was the blandest curry I've ever tasted. It can't be classified as good curry. It's runny, yellow muck.  I deeply regretted eating at this establishment as I became extremely ill afterwards. I know it was the chicken roti since I had been so safe with my food choices during the last week. I feel like throwing up again at the thought of that roti.  Please do yout intestinal track a favor, and stay far, far away from Cool Runnings unless you want HOT RUNS! And to constantly be RUNNING to the toilet. It ruined my whole trip to Toronto, and my experience with Jamaican food in general."}
{"text":"Oxtail and jerk chicken combo, such a cool spot with incredibly friendly service."}
{"text":"On my way home I just had to stop by to check out what all the hype and hula (sarcastically of course!) surrounding this joint was all about. After reading the few raving reviews of this place i was most definitely curious! As it turns out these guys deserve much more attention than what they are getting. To simply put it, the food is absolutely fantastic in every way.  They serve the dry(my preferred) version of jerk chicken. The meat is extremely tender and flavourful even at the breast. Perfectly seasoned yet still powerfully potent is how I would describe the flavour profile. This is some extremely well cooked chicken to say the least. The rice is again tender, pillowy and perfectly seasoned. On top of all that you throw in some of the best curry chicken I've had and you have a winner here.  What really sets this place apart from others is their refined flavours. Everything is perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. You can really taste the attention to details here.  Definitely on my top 3 list of Jerk places in Toronto."}
{"text":"He best roti.  The wrap taste fresh and unlike a store bought wrap like other places near by"}
{"text":"Before you die you HAVE TO TRY the SHRIMP RUNDOWN from this place. I believe your tastebuds will thank you forever. Everything else is very good here too but that dish is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great place for a hearty and delicious meal. I had the 1/2 jerk chicken meal and the oxtail on the side. The serving size was way bigger than I thought, they really do give you half of the entire chicken. It was really well seasoned and cooked, meat wasn't dried at all. The cole slaw was also one of the better ones I've had.   Service was very good considering how big our party was and there was only one waitress. The place is cozy so it may not be best for large (6+) parties.   Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is always good for a well flavoured, homemade tasting West Indian food Fix. The chicken is well proportioned moist and flavourful. Some of the best Jamaican food you'll find In the city."}
{"text":"I walked past this place on my way to dinner at a nearby restaurant. I didn't realize exactly where I was in this unfamiliar neighbourhood. My companion and I decided to stop in here for dessert after dinner.  We ordered coconut ice cream and a slice of sweet potato pudding. Our server brought us the pudding and mango ice cream. She asked us if we would take the mango ice cream instead but we declined.  The pudding was very dense and dry. You could see that it wasn't baked very evenly. The red sauce all over the plate, an attempt to elevate the presentation, actually clashed with the flavour of the pudding. It wasn't necessary.  It took quite a while for the coconut ice cream to show up. We finished the pudding completely by the time it arrived and half the glass was melted ice cream. See photo. I'm certain that could have been avoided.  I really wanted to upgrade my review for this place but I can't. Both the food and service were disappointing. Two strikes is enough. Sorry."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood! Stewed chicken is my go to take out meal, but the jerk chicken is excellent too. Rice and peas are well spiced and tasty, and rotis are great. An institution."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out several times and have never been disappointed yet.  Portions are generous and food is flavourful.  Today I went in for their lunch special.  For $5 I had a jerk chicken sandwich with a drink.  I don't know where else you will get \"real\" food at that price.  The owner was in and was very friendly towards his customers.  I will be back many more times.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"When I first had a chicken roti at Cool Runnings, I was amazed at how much chicken was in there!  The bread was not too thick or thin. It was just right.  Most Jamaican restaurants make their roti bread too thick or too thin. Cool Runnings must have a secret recipe. I am just assuming that they have one.  In conclusion, Cool Runnings deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"Outstanding rotis and a great neighborhood establishment. We get takeout and the rotis are so huge that they barely fit on our dinner plates. Everything tastes so fresh and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great roti and jerk. Love the gravy.  I've eaten a lot of west indie food and this is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"The VEGGIE ROTI that Cool Runnings makes is OUTSTANDING. It's like a Caribbean Chipotle Burrito, with more love and care and savory goodness. One of the only places in the area with this vegetarian & healthy option. Always friendly and cool staff. Just writing this inspires me to order a roti for second lunch today."}
{"text":"One of the best roti places in the city. Good quality chicken and lots of it makes all the difference. Big portions and great value. Friendly owner operated establishment."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with the family (of course!), and based on the reviews we ordered fried plantains, jerk chicken, oxtail, chicken roti and a side order of fried chicken for my son.  It was definitely more than enough food!  Great portions and the meat was all fall off the bone delicious.  My son enjoyed the oxtail and fried chicken with rice and peas but wasn't a huge fan of curry (I think he found it a bit spicy because he started crying... hehe).  Service was decent and as other reviewers noted they have a lot of people doing take out.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw, which I thought was too creamy and sweet, but everything else was great!  This is going to be a regular for sure :)"}
{"text":"Mmmm! Good food. Nice little shop setup. Big heart service. I had the jerk chicken with rice and beans and had more then I could finish. Such a full favor, spicy jerk, had me sniffling in a few minutes. And then... it about the slaw. I love there slaw salad.  I asked them why they had 2 locations so close to each other. After such a good meal I realize they could be next to each other, there just that good."}
{"text":"Last November and the mercury just dropped below zero. Its Roti time!  Only just discovered Cool Runnings while driving down Main Street. It seemed busy, which is always a good sign.   My first visit so I went for my standard: boneless chicken roti   Very very quick service, (surprising). Very large portion size. (enough for two, almost) I should have ordered it with a channa... lesson learned.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed their soup of the day-Wednesday's Fish! I order no dumplings and very little potato (always trying to watch the waistline). It was very flavorful and perfect amount of spice."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots. Great, simple jamaican food served here. I really only ever get one of two things from the menu - Jerk Chicken or Chicken Roti. Both are awesome.   The chicken roti consists of curry, boneless chicken, potato and carrots. One of these is very filling. The chicken is always very tender, as are the veggies. My only issue with it is the level of spice, which is quite mild. This is something that is easily remedied when I bring it home though.  Jerk chicken with Rice and Peas is my other meal here. A large order with give you a generous portion of about 4 smaller cuts of chicken. They pour ox tail gravy over the rice and chicken which is incredible.  There are many true jamaican spots in the East end of the city, if anyone knows of one please share. They also have a second location up the street on Danforth."}
