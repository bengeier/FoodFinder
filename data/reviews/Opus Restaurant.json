{"text":"Yo, Mario...  \"Mr. Curly\" here.    Nothing but a 5'er would suffice.  Your chef and company are incredibly inventive.  The supportive, background, subtle favors of each individual plating component are a wonderful experience - each comes through on it's own, at it's own time.  I was amazed, again and again.  Needless to say, the wine listing is nearly matchless - clearly, some smart thought went into it.  Many thanks...   bo"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant, their foie gras is extremely delicious, it literally melts in your mouth. We have a baby with us to celebrate my birthday and the owner and server was welcoming and accommodating for us giving us a nice quiet corner to dine in. Their service was great and food was delicious! Would definitely recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Opus is a break the bank restaurant in the heart of Yorkville... hence you see mostly bankers/lawyers in the restaurant.   From what I tried off the menu the gras fois,  and the lamb were fantastic. The coconut lobster was a bit disappointing as the coconut flavour was way too overpowering and I couldn't taste the lobster. And their \"giant\" scallop... was very tasty but giant?... not so much.   At the end of the day, this place is probably your best bet in Toronto if you're looking for that special bottle of wine from let's say 1981! Fantastic wine selection... highly recommended if you're into wine.   Lastly, as some have already mentioned, I also enjoyed the classy, intimate bar area. So this would be a perfect place to maybe grab a couple of drinks with a \"date\", and only if this is like 4th or 5th date and things are going VERY well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, beautifully presented. It is very expensive for what it is, but it's been there for 20 years so they obviously know what they are doing. Wine list is extensive. A nice experience although my wife thought it too snooty."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great wine list and terrific service. Our waiter kept us in stitches while providing excellent recommendations from the menu.  I really hate people who take pictures of the food to post online, but the presentations were just beautiful and the Flavors just as good. Our favorite in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ambiance at Opus may be nice but expensive fruity drinks ($14 at happy hour) and many missing items on the menu - no steaks, no tomatoes, no ice tea, no etc...., was very disappointing.  Our group of 8 was not impressed. The bar area was overlapping into the restaurant area and many bar patrons were inappropriately standing next to where we sat.  We've been to Opus 3 times and still no improvement."}
{"text":"Hugely overrated.  Appetizers we ordered: salad: WEAK                                       crab: OK but small portion                                       Foie gras: very good  Main course: NY strip: 10 oz.. Excellent                       Venison: small portion                       Hen: average; a little dry  Desserts: Creme brûlée: good                 Apple fritters: poor                 Honey ice cream, fig, walnuts: good  The restaurant was surprisingly empty.  They told us to order early before a big party arrived for outside.. They never did.  We did order early.  There was a looooong wait between ordering and receiving each course.  Service was great.  Would not go again."}
{"text":"Opus is one of Toronto's best restaurant's hands down. They have received a Wine Spectator Award in the past and have one of the most extensive wine lists in North America.  Be prepared to ay for the best. This is top tier eating, drinking and socializing. If you're like me, and you like to eat at the bar, there is always a good mix of people perched at the bar or drinks or for food and there's a real sense that it's a community of regulars who are welcoming and social.  The waiters are all pros and know food and beverage inside and out. In the summer, they open their back garden patio as well, and it's gorgeous with a big tree in the middle. You feel like you're not even in the city.  Be prepared to see big name politicians and stars (I've see Christopher Walkin and Wendle Clark here) alike, dining at Opus.  It's totally one of those, \"in the know\" type joints.  Favorite dish: pan-seared tuna. And their molten chocolate desert is made on site from chocolate they import direct from Portugal. It's like heaven in your mouth. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"You know those restaurants where you have something so good you wish you were a dog and could just roll around in it?? Or you start talking about it and you have to pause so you can get the slobber under control? I know this isn't polite but.... (roll roll - drool drool - slobber!)  The wine list is obscene. I was lucky enough to go with a wine lover who was prepared to do it justice. The sommeliers are really in charge here - but friendly and not too pretentious. Three bottles and several hours later, I'm pretty sure this place deserves its highest Wine Spectator Award several years in a row!   Although the wine tends to take center stage here, the dining is excellent. Our waiter was very gracious and, as expected, happy to provide recommendations. Most of our dishes were top notch. I will outright disagree with the previous reviewer who thought the mushroom appetizer was just ok - it looks humble on the menu, but was far more than the sum of its parts! I have no idea how such a simple dish can be so rich, but it might have been my favorite of the night. The next best - probably equal - was the caribou loin, which was perfectly cooked and so tender and delicious it was unreal. Even the Israeli cous cous underneath was amazing. I personally ordered the pepper-crusted tuna, another signature dish, but compared to the caribou it wasn't up to par. It was served on a rice cake that was sticky, with a tough crust that was a major disappointment. However, all was well again with desert - a pear tarte paired with a pear-infused liquor on the side, a rec from the waiter. It was perfect, delicious, and an amazing end to a great meal. Best of all, the sommeliers made us feel so welcome that my wine-lovin' guest went home with an older copy of their wine list - and the staff followed us out the door to offer it to him!   Yes, we blew a ton of money on this meal - about 200$ apiece. Was it worth it? Uh huh. Yes, definitely. If you have an interest in wine, especially, this place can't be missed! We'll be looking for special occasions to return."}
{"text":"Opus is by far my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  The customer service is unmatched, and their wine list is fantastic. Their chef Jason is magical, and makes me wish I wasn't allergic to seafood. The foie gras is spectacular.  I strongly recommend this place to anyone who cares about quality and understated elegance as opposed to flash."}
{"text":"First time visiting Opus. Had some preconceived notions about it being stuffy and super swank. But the service from each staff member was lovely, extremely competent, warm & very welcoming. The wine list is literally a book that runs the gamut up to $5000+ bottles of wine. We didn't feel obligated to keep up with the Joneses, so to speak, and asked for a wine around $100 that complimented the tasting menu. The tasting menu was fantastic (see photos & descriptions)! Very nice for a special occasion. Only negative would be the clientele- some typical, loud, boorish big-spenders in there. C'est la vie."}
{"text":"The food at Opus is out of this world!  I'm not sure how the chef does it, but the combination of favors mix perfectly to create a mouthwatering, delightful dining experience.  The regulars mix easily with new Opus customers which makes this beautifully arranged space warm and welcoming.  Opus has a full service bar which can cater to your every need.  When local entertainers are brought in, it's so easy to lose yourself in the wonderful music, tantalizing cuisine, and welcoming atmosphere.  Opus is like a vacation......all your troubles seem to melt away, if only for the evening.   Without hesitation, I recommend the Opus experience.  I suggest calling ahead to see if there will be live music.  The best local musicians just seem to gravitate there.  It doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Great place. They greet you and make you feel like a friend from the minute you walk in. Great menu turnover so always something new to try. Terrific wine list. Check out the classic Richebourgs in the wine cellar"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the neighbourhood, we used Yelp to find a restaurant for dinner and we were delighted with our choice. We had the fresh oysters appetizer - the red wine mignonette sauce was delicious and I am not that fond of mignonette sauce. My husband had the venison and I had the prime strip loin. I like my steak medium rare and it was done perfectly. My husband's venison was melt in your mouth tender. For dessert, we shared the chocolate truffle tort with whites chocolate ice cream. The chocolate flavour was very intense - which was a good thing. The service was attentive without being intrusive and my husband was very impressed with how speedy they were. Definitely worth every star of the 5."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon special with shaved truffle--there was no truffle. The owner admitted that they messed up, but his solution was to offer us a drink or a dessert with a candle in it because it was my birthday. We payed the $450 bill (included a bottle of wine) with a 20% tip (because it wasn't the waiter's fault), but when I spoke to the owner afterwards I told him that the appropriate adjustment would have been to take the item off of our bill. He did offer to do that, but I told him that it wasn't about the money and I just wanted to let him know that he should have automatically made the correction at the time that he admitted their mistake. Don't get me wrong, everything else was delicious, really!  But we would have loved to have gone back there and now just feel like we can't endorse them."}
{"text":"Tony and Mario's restaurant.  Excellent service, decor, atmosphere, acoustics, music choice and food.   My favorite haunt!  I always order the Malpeque Oysters, the seared Foie Gras, the seared Tuna, the cheese platter, the hot molten-lava chocolate cake and a sorbet palette cleanser.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have a lot of experience in fine dining, and although the food was spectacular, the service was not.  My husband and I were on the younger side of the clientele that evening, and I guess that meant to them that somehow we deserved lesser service.  We weren't even told the specials, and were served lesser glasses of wine with a lot of sediment.  We left after the main, deciding not to get dessert.  Very disappointing.  Fine dining for me is about the excellent service as well as the food, and they just didn't do it.  We left feeling rather insulted."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, food, service, environment is the absolute best in Toronto. Haven't had a bad experience ever. I would say they have the best food in Toronto and maybe even the best food in all of Canada."}
{"text":"I went there for some sweet wine or dessert after a meat-heavy dinner with a couple of friends. We were traveling from the U.S. on vacation and were looking forward to a good sweet wine such as a late-harvest Riesling or Canadian ice wine to celebrate our last day in Canada. There was a Riesling Alsace Cuvée Ste. Catherine 2001 for $22.50 per glass that I ordered under the recommendation of the waitress/sommelier that it was a \"very sweet\" wine from France. I specifically asked her about the wine because I was not familiar with Ste. Catherine. I asked her again if it was sweet because sweet Rieslings from Alsace are rare except the late harvests. It was definitely not a sweet wine. I explained this to the waitress and asked if she had tasted the wine. She insisted that she had and she stuck to her claim that is was very sweet. She was, in fact, offended by my question about whether she had tasted the wine. I have never gone to such a high-end wine bar with such an unprofessional waitress who argues with the customer without even tasting the wine to see if maybe something was wrong with it. Considering that they are charging $20+ for a bottle of wine that costs around $45-50 retail, it is even more ridiculous. And even if I were wrong, I would expect a little more deference because wine tasting is generally a subjective evaluation. Do not be enticed by their impressive wine list (some of their wines run in the thousands of dollars per bottle). They would probably not admit it even if one of their $10,000+ bottles of Pomerol or Romanee-Conti were corked. And, finally, to add insult to injury, they actually charged us for the $22.50 glass of alleged sweet wine. Wine Spectator and other sources concur that the wine is \"off-dry,\" a far cry from \"very sweet.\""}
{"text":"A favorite for excellent service, food and atmosphere. Award winning wine list. Perfectly elegant and professional in every way."}
{"text":"I splurged and treated myself to dinner at Opus on my first night in Toronto --that's what one does after getting 6 hours a sleep within 36 hours.  A local told me Opus was the restaurant was a must. It's a bit hidden in the dark so pay attention to the numbers. The dress code is fancy so I was happy that maitre de didn't give me any attitude for looking like a rugrat lugging 3 bags around...  I started with the sauté of mushrooms with garlic, herbs and tomato. It was pretty good but I don't know if it was worth the $19CAD...I then had the Canadian striploin with truffled vegetables and fines herbes reduction,-- perfectly cooked --not as juicy as Jacob's though. Yeah...I would have given Opus a 5 star but then I had Jacob's steak...I surprised myself and squeezed in the dark chocolate molten cake and caramelized banana with kalamansi sorbet. The molten cake was good but would have been better if it was warmer. With 2 glasses of wine my total came out to $100USD....yikes...well, you only live once and who knows the next time I'll be in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place, I first came in 1997 and still as good or better, and the owners are always there to make sure you have a good experience. I could eat the foie grass  all day."}
{"text":"I went to Opus a few days ago. I like the decor, very homey/steakhouse feel to it. it is in yorkville but not the heart of yorkville. the food was ok not great.   appetizers seared fois gras- 5/5 tuna tartar-2/5 bison tenderloin- 3/5 rack of lamb- 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Simply put my favorite resturant anywhere.  Service and food is immpeciable.  It never dissapoints. I've been maybe 10 times and everything I've tried has been perfect.  The foie gras is the only thing that never changes and is out of this world."}
{"text":"I have been to OPUS about 4-5 times now for dinner. Their wine list is amazing, and the cellar downstairs is just beautiful. I beleive they are one of the restaurants in the world that has such an extensive wine list--and that's impressive. Please try the chateauneuf du pape......incredible.  The food: the steak tartare is good, the salads a bit bland . The gnocchi is GREAT..very filling though so watch out! The meat mains have been good, but i would not say the MOST memorable plates. Make sure to get the creme brulee!!  The bar at the front as soon as you walk in gives the place a cool yet very classy atmosphere. The martinis are very good, and I would suggest dropping by for a drink even if you are not going to have a meal."}
{"text":"Had a special occasion to splurge on and landed at arguably one of the Top 3 restaurants in the city.  When it comes to dining at the very high end, few places do it better than Opus.  Hidden off the beaten track of Bloor/Yorkville hustle and bustle, Opus occupies one one of the elegant Victorian houses that dominate the neighbourhood.  Inside, the room is elegant and comfortably laid out with lots of plush dark grey furnishings and rich wood accents.   The magnum opus (and likely from where its name derives) of this fine restaurant is its encyclopaedic wine list containing everything from the rarest of the rare to the eclectic.  All compiled in one large volume too extensive to comb through in detail but full of surprises that jump out as you browse.    Opus boasts a 52,000 (yes, not a typo) bottle wine cellar and fortunately, a polite and personable sommelier to steer you right.  He possesses a knowledge of wine as exhaustive as his wine list and could probably name and price every bottle in that book having personally curated the massive collection.  Never intimidating, he is down to earth and easy to engage.  The staff is top notch and deliver flawless service.    The food is expertly prepared and free of the pretense of a chef that's trying too hard.  I had the lobster 'ceviche' to start and a cut of medium rare tenderloin with a sliver of foie gras and truffled gnocchi.  Both were delicious and beautiflly presented.    When dining at the high end, you come to expect excellence and consistency and this is what Opus excels at - high degree of quality delivered every single time.  You will bet on a return visit if nothing else than to enjoy the rarest of fine wines and all the accoutrements to go with it."}
{"text":"Lovely.... simply lovely.  This is an elegant experience with gorgeous and very enjoyable food.  Beautiful atmosphere with spot-on service.  The food is visually stunning, and follows through in taste.  Truly a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Opus is a classic and very classy restaurant. I was impressed with every course.   I started with the Beef and scallop carpaccio (with black garlic, truffle and parsley); my date the Tuna tartare and caviar (with buttermilk, quail egg, granola and flowers). As my main, I had the Lamb rack and shoulder (with carrots, salsify and mint), my date, the beautiful Rabbit Ravioli. We finished with the Vanilla crème brûlée (with langue du chat and fresh berries) plus ice  cream. The meal was divine, the service exceptional--everyone who works here seems relaxed and happy (which clearly is a nod to the owners, bravo)."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Opus. Must say I left feeling let down.  The good: oysters were awesome, the foie gras, the lamb and the tuna mains.  The bad: the tuna and hamichi tartare a flavorless joke for $23. The molten chocolate cake which was dry.  Our waiter was dismissive of our constructive and polite feedback. That simply should not happen when spending $400 on dinner for two. Hence, I would not go back. I am food industry professional and I am simply blown away by being dismissed completely not even an acknowledgment."}
{"text":"This is a real nice low key place. Food is good, ambiance is nice, and the music is nice too."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's best, fine dining, Italian restaurants. A classic setting. Wide-ranging menu, and exceptional wine list. Not inexpensive ($250/person)."}
{"text":"If ever there was a restaurant that is deserving of winning a James Beard Award AND Michelin star multiple times, Opus would be that restaurant for you.  From the moment you walk into the establishment there is a warmth that is extends further by the owners, Mario and Tony, who are genuinely happy to see you.  The food is exquisitely orchestrated playing a symphony to your palate in flavor.  You will be taken care of with precision service by experienced staff.  Each dinner has always exceeded our expectations.  We are looking for excuses just to come back and host an evening dinner event there."}
{"text":"Came here for a late valentines day dinner. First if all i would like to say the valet parking is definitely a plus. Amazing service. Very elegant setting and atmosphere. Perfect for a date or gathering. Service is amazing. Constant checkups and top offs for drinks. Knowledgable staff.. coat checks and proper fine dining edicacies. We ordered an assortment of cured meats which were amazing and full flavoured. Also bought the seared tuna and cod dish. Also amazing seafood. The saute mushroom addition was full flavoured. Bought a grapefruit cocktail and white wine chardoney full flavoured and paired well with fish. Definitely would recommend. Fine dining at its best for me thus far."}
{"text":"Appetizer we had the risotto and the snow crab and artichoke the risotto had very good flavour they had popcorn pieces added to it which was different but in a good way.  The crab and artichoke was light and pleasing a perfect start to our dinner.  Mains Venison and Grouper Portions are perfect size The venison was very tender and flavourful Grouper was light with great flavour as well  Dessert We had the most delectable dessert: the chocolate soft cake and black cherry on dolce de leche.  It was so light and fluffy and with the perfect amount of sweetness to it.  Perfect end to dinner.  Wine Selection The biggest wine selection I've seen so far. They had a specific person that you speak with when ordering your wine and they were very knowledgeable.  We had a bottle of wine 2004 Merlot from California and it was great with dinner.  Staff The staff was very courteous and friendly.  They were very hospitable and was very attentive to our needs.  They consistently visited our table to refill our wine glasses and water.  Overall customer service is on point.  Very classy atmosphere and the set up allowed us to feel like we had our own private space.  This will definitely become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"I went to Opus with my best friend for dinner last night. It was my first... and last time visiting that establishment. The atmosphere is beautiful, but the food is lacking. We started the evening off with cocktails (I ordered a Honey Nut Cheerio Martini and she ordered the Ultimate Raspberry Patron Margarita) both of which were good but not worth their $12 and $14 price tags. Next up? Fried okra appetizer. It was straight out of the freezer section of our local Costco. Unoriginal and ordinary. We had to take a few moments to declare war on the 10 gnats that had taken to dive bombing our table at random intervals. Entree course was up next. I ordered the ribeye (medium) and it came with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits (4 butterflied shrimp on a bed of bruschetta and jalapeno cheese grits) My steak came out well done. My potatoes were over salted and my 4 out of 6 of my asparagus spears were limp. Her grits were AMAZING, but the shrimp was not seasoned... not underseasoned...there was NO seasoning to be found. Also, the plate was missing a proper bruschetta and instead... swimming in corn. Yes, corn.   So, when our waitress checked in I told her that my steak was overcooked. She apologized and offered to make me a new one. I wisely declined and told her I would just eat my sides. She came back a few minutes later (plate in hand) and told me that the manager wanted to see my steak...see my steak? Seriously? So I gave it to her. She came back 10-15 minutes later to assure me that the manager agreed with me that the steak was overdone. Hallelujah, I can go on with my life now that I have received the okay from the boss. Did the manager come out to personally apologize? No. Did the chef make an appearance? No. Will I be returning to Opus? No."}
{"text":"Low ceilings and interiors aren't consistent. Not what I'd expect from a higher end restaurant. Unattentive wait staff. The food was overall subpar. Burrata cheese dish was terrible and sloppy. My tuna main course was extremely underwhelming. The entire experience was extremely underwhelming."}
{"text":"This is my second time to dine in Opus, again excellent service and high quality of food and wine does not disappoint me!  The oyster from PEI are so fresh, way better than most oyster places, but it is on the more expensive side of the price.  The steak is well cooked at medium rare, and my blackened tuna is so amazing. We also had the snow crab meat with radish for app, the portion of snow crab meat is very good!  I will go again next time to try out their other entree"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a ton of fine dining restaurants, but this is one of the best I've been to. The location is very quaint, situated on a residential side street, the place inside is elegant and cozy, and the wait staff is as professional and courteous as it gets. The somelier had a lot of recommendations for ordering wine. The wine list was the size of the phone book. All that said, I was not paying as this was a company dinner, so it would be hard to give an objective view on a free meal. The portions were on the smaller side as you would expect, but after several courses, including dessert and several glasses of wine, I was stuffed.  For the entree, I had a deer steak, which was much more tender and not as gamey as you might think.  I had no expectations as to what contemporary Canadian might entail, and I still couldn't tell you what the big differences are, but all I can say is that if you want a special dining experience, this is a great place. I would say everything I consumed, app, entree, wine and dessert must have totaled something like $150, to give you an idea of the price range. It looked like there was an outdoor area in back, but I couldn't say for sure, as it was dark out."}
{"text":"The service and food exceed 5 stars! I had the sweet corn bisque and tuna tartare. The sweet corn bisque was just so flavourful with the bit of uni flavour (I'm an uni fanatic). And the tuna was so fresh. I just had two appetizers and they didn't push for more sales, which I find classy. I hate going to restaurants that are so desperately trying to increase the bill."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the very best restaurant I've ever been to.  I went on a business trip so I wasn't looking too closely at the prices and ordered the food for the food.  Wow! wOw! WoW!  It was absolutely amazing.  I ordered the Foie Gras and it was mouth watering.  The wait staff was extremely hospitable and knowledgeable.    I would recommend this restaurant for a wonderful high-end, but still warm and comforting, experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the beef tartare which was decent but far from the best I have had (The Chase).  I had the venison and my wife had the veal tenderloin.  Both were cooked to perfection and had great flavor.  The negative was the service and atmosphere.  It began with the waiter giving a scowl when I did not order a wine priced over $100 and thereafter the service was perfunctory.  Although the restaurant was not busy the owner was AWOL and was seen only on arriving and on leaving.  The whole evening was cold and sterile.  I guess if you are a regular you get good service but for an occasional customer they could not have cared less."}
{"text":"I would have to say the best restaurant in Toronto. Still. It has outlasted so many trendy ones that have come and gone. Boba came second, but sadly is gone now.  Best foie gras I have ever tasted. Ever. And yes, this includes many forays into the Southwest of France itself. The maple syrup demi-glace is genius.  Sadly the caribou tenderloin has slipped from the menu. It was simply heaven. As was the mini-rabbit appetizer.  Save room for dessert. The Almond stuffed pear tatin on red plum puree with cardomon ice cream is a taste you will never taste again."}
{"text":"Sunday night - FANTASTIC jazz from 6-9.  Great food, great drinks, upbeat and positive atmosphere.  Our entire party loved their meals, quality (great), portions (huge) and the service (warm and friendly). We will absolutely be back - Give Opus a try - you'll love it."}
{"text":"The fois gras, version and lamb racks were really good.  The meat was very tender and juicy.   The squash soup wasn't thick as I thought.  It's very salty and not many flavours.  Excellent service and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Superb wine list, intimate service and tasty food.  More of an italian and french list with some hard to find gems.  More of a formal setting, so be prepared to dress up for your special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant opened by two brothers almost 20 years ago after their experiences at other high end Toronto locations (Cibo and Prego). The wine list is unmatched in the city and most likely in the entire country. From Jackson Triggs to vintage Petrus. The menu is great, while constantly changes. The steak is a constant and is always of the highest quality. Well informed staff, many of who have been their since the opening."}
{"text":"First off, the service was impeccable. Friendly, personable, unpretentious...our server really took care of us. The drinks were good too. I had rusty nail - a drink that many restaurants seem to mess up, and it was bit on the sweet side but still good.   As for food we ordered the beef tartare, and I really enjoyed that. Everything else was just OK for me. The fois gras my girlfriend loved. Me? It was good. I don't seek it out, so I would take her opinion over mine. A steak that was decent, but not great. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake deal. I liked it - I'm a dessert person - but I wasn't blown away by it. It was the generic molten chocolate cake that most restaurants make.  Food overall? Meh. Good but stuffy fancy food done the same way it always is. Very little creativity. Service? Excellent. You are definitely paying for the service over the food. Decor and atmosphere? Generic fancy restaurant. Nice and quiet though. Would I come back? I doubt it. Would i recommend it? If you're meeting your significant other's parents for the first time, I might recommend this place. But probably not for any other situation."}
{"text":"I went here once in August due to it being right next to my high school where I was of course going to go back to in a week. Opus sits perfectly in Yorkville, though it is not inexpensive. Around $70 CAD per person if you don't include alcohol. Speaking of alcohol, they have an amazing wine list that spans across the entire globe over the course of 90 pages. I knew that I would not get the the Petrus 1963 wine which cost over $40,000 CAD.  Cuisine: Innovating European fine dining with slight Canadian twists. The best of it's kind in the city.  No. of guests: 3 This was planned by my family who thought I deserved something for passing my first semester of school with flying colours.  Meal time: Dinner  Cost: $$$$ The menu changes frequently, though it usually maintains the price range of $16-25 CAD for Appetizers, $120-395 CAD for Caviar, $35-45 CAD for a Main Course, $7-11 CAD for dessert, and around $20 CAD for cheese,  Ambiance and setting: Looks like an abandoned, vegetation infested building from the outside. This will fool you instantly, because the moment you walk inside you will see jet black walls with a breathtaking bar. The waiters and co-owners greet you as they come dressed in tuxedos. They always bring a nice option of some sort of tomato-cornmeal bread before you order any drinks of appetizers, It's an overall dimly lit dark restaurant that really makes you feel as if you are dining at quite a serious place.   Service: Amazing, They will reveal the price of all items as their faces are locked with a heartwarming grin. They will recommend any wine or food they see fit, I was served by a man named Tony.  The Chef: We did not get the chance to meet him, though I believe his name is Jason Cox and if he's anything like the food he made us then he's amazing.  The food: You may order anything off the menu along with a bottle of wine of your choice. They have beautiful hotplates and bowls that all have a beautiful vibe to them.  The Experience: When you leave with the taste of the food in your mouth you will always be happy. This is what the restaurant is, Happy and beautiful, nigh-tearjerking.  This is good place to come once every 4 to 6 months if you are adventurous when it comes to food."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant downtown in the heart of the U of T area. The food was delicious but since we were here as a group it was quite noisy & crowded. There were other patrons there besides us as well. The washrooms are located downstairs & they were clean. Servers are courteous & professional. I just found the tables a bit too close together. Some tight squeezes to get past people. Still it's a nice place. I hear the back patio is lovely in the summer time, but on the day we came it was too cold & windy for that."}
{"text":"Spectacular. Everything splendid. World class, small French-style plates. Had the ravioli w/ Swiss chard. Brilliant. Great spot all-around."}
{"text":"Amazing food, wonderful service.   My girlfriend and I had our first date here.  They sure knew how to make it a special experience!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of attending a wedding at this location.  The food, service and setting truly exceptional.  Thanks to the owner and staff for making the occasion truly memorable!!  We look forward to returning to try more menu items!!  I can't give a better recommendation."}
{"text":"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with Opus.  The bartender, Damion, was very attentive, friendly, and prompt.  The food was awesome and seemed to be prepared very promptly.  The only complaint I have is that the owner interacted with everyone in the restaurant but me and my two friends.  I had been sitting at the bar alone for at least 45 minutes before my friends arrived and noticed how the owner was speaking to everyone else.  I know I was there for at least 2 hours & the owner still never acknowledged me or my friends.  I'm a big fan of customer service & feel that managers/owners should always interact with their patrons to assure that they are enjoying themselves.    All in all, I would visit Opus again however I would suggest that the customer service skills for everyone, including the owner, be refreshed."}
{"text":"Attentive staff, great wine, but VERY mediocre food.  We had the foie gras for appetizer which was good.  And for main, we had the seared fish (special dish of the night, forgot which kind of fish) and Venison (medium rare), and they were just horrible.  We normally love fish and venison but the fish was extremely fishy and had no taste to it.  The venison tasted very gamie, plain, and was grilled poorly.  The portion was tiny to begin with, and we could only eat half of the meat since it was so poorly done.  I'm not sure how can this level of food live up to the standard this restaurant tries to deliver.  If one dish was subpar I can assume it's just a bad day or bad luck.  But when both entrées were horrible, and one of them was even a \"special of the day\" I just don't get it... maybe they lack constructive feedback, I'm not sure what was going on but we surely will not be returning... it was a disappointing tasting experience."}
{"text":"The best Foie Gras in town! Valentines dinner and can't wait to come back again.   Appetizers: Foie Gras over mapled apples on a bed of delicious current puree sauce. Had to restrain ourselves from ordering another before our main entrees. The snow crab appetizer followed suit which was also shelled and paired nicely with an artichoke salad.   Specials:  We selected the PEI oysters which were served nicely with a tasty shallot vinaigrette and the usual toppings. Very fresh and not too wild of a taste.   Mains: Rack of Lamb: cooked medium and was perfect! I dislike eggplants and Opus was kind enough to replace with other vegetables.(Service was 10/10)  Striploin: recommended to cook as medium rare and it was made perfectly! Amazing flavour and tender in the centre.   Wine: Pinot noir, Duckhorn Migration. Paired well with our mains and Foie gras.   Overall 10/10 for service, food and ambience. We asked about Brunch and they only serve Dinner after 5pm."}
{"text":"A quietly laid back, yet classy atmosphere with great food and taken care of by friendly staff. Thank you for a wonderful experience.   Off menu items worth inquiring about."}
{"text":"This is from a while ago....I splurged and treated myself to dinner at Opus. The dress code is 'dressy'  so I was happy that maitre de didn't give me any attitude for looking like I just took a hike. I had  the sauté of mushrooms with garlic, herbs and tomato. It was pretty good but I don't know if it was worth the $19CAD...they have a nice vino list from their cellar...good set of Napa of cabs. I'd come back, and I'll not wear sandals next time."}
