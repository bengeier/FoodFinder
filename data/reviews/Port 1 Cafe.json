{"text":"I really loved this place it! They helped as much as possible  and they were fast! They grind the espresso beans right in front of you to give the best taste! They have many drinks and food options and the gelato was to die for!! So many to pick from! The staff was very knowledgeable  and helpful !"}
{"text":"Went here on a bike ride. Service was excellent. We both had grilled Montreal smoked meat sandwich combos. Tasty and good portions. Homemade gelato was excellent. Salted caramel gelato was way better here than even at Sweet Jesus."}
{"text":"A nice coffee shop by Port Credit area. The place is really descent and comfortable. However the coffee was watery. Honestly I had high expectation after reading all the reviews. I hope that was just one of their bad day :)"}
{"text":"Went to Port 1 for the first time today with my friend Fraser Jamieson, and I have to say I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed a delicious latte along with a personal pizza and soup of the day. Of course I couldn't leave without trying some gelato as well! Everything was excellent. I'll definitely be back again along with friends. Great atmosphere and great food/gelato!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here. The owner is super friendly and accommodating and although I haven't tried much, the chipotle chicken sandwich is unreal! I am getting so hungry thinking about it. This place has a great location, with great food, coffee and service. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Was waiting for a table at dinner time and saw the word gelateria so decided to see what it was. The gelato was a great texture. The coffee flavour I got had a bit too much of an alcohol taste from whatever flavour additive, but I was craving coffee so I got it anyway. The amaretto gelato was delicious. Staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I dropped by this cafe on a whim over the weekend.  They serve hand made gelato, coffee and quite a few lunch items.  It's fairly small inside with only a few tables but in the summer, they have 5 or 6 tables outside so that you can people watch while working on your tan (side note - still an epic fail for me this year).  I ordered the latte with almond milk.  It was absolutely delicious.  Have you ever had strong coffee that was actually sweet and tasted good? This was it. This latte reminded of the coffee I had in Latin America and was amazing.  

Verdict: Great place to hang out during a lazy summer day."}
{"text":"The gelato, especially hazelnut flavor, is delicious. But their crepes lack flavor and tasteful preparation. It seems that they are trying to sell too many types of food in one small place. Were they to specialise, in gelato for example, their food would be much more appealing and it would be a better experience overall."}
{"text":"Located at the northeast corner of Hurontario Street and Lakeshore Road, I feel like this place gets forgotten in the hustle and bustle of all the options available in Port Credit, but truly, it isn't a bad option in the area, especially if you're looking for some late night coffee or a snack! 

First, 'check in' on Yelp. You'll get a free scoop of gelato (a pretty generous scoop, I might add!). I asked for the Red Orange gelato and it was fine - not too sweet, but could have been better and colder in temperature (it was basically melting once it was scooped into a sample cup).

Second, it's open until 11:00 PM on Friday nights, so if you want a laid-back spot for a quiet, relaxing coffee date in the area later in the evening (that isn't a bar), this is an option available, especially if other similar spots in the area may be closed earlier. 

Third, the menu and ambiance. It's pretty quiet, decent amount of seating. There were about 8 flavours of gelato available when we visited. Some selection of hot drinks, some pastries, and a limited selection of sandwiches and pizzas. I ordered a Chai Latte, and it was fine - it tasted a little watered down, but I appreciated that it wasn't too sweet and was a nice, hot temperature.

Fourth, parking. On a Friday night, street parking across the street on the Lakeshore Road was free after 6:00 PM. 

Overall, not a bad spot in the Port Credit area, and points for its later hours, which is the main reason we were there late on a Friday night. For a Chai Latte, I paid around $4.00."}
{"text":"This lovely Persian-Canadian owned joint is absolutely charming and the gelato will blow your mind! There hasn't been a time where I've been to this place and there hasn't been a line up behind me. 

I was told by the owner that the gelato is made fresh everyday. Talk about quality! I've only tried pineapple, strawberry, grapefruit and lemon but my goal is to try all the different flavours by the end of the Summer. I also picked up a bunch of freshly baked goods for my hubby and he loved them (he's also a bit of a dessert snob so you can trust his tastes!). 

I ordered a fresh fruit shake from there once and it took a long time but it was really fresh fruit so I'm not complaining. 

The prices are a tad high but I'm totally willing to pay for the consistent quality that I'm getting. I also love supporting local businesses that know how to deliver good, homemade options for the community."}
{"text":"It was a nice place although I felt a little bit cold inside I can't wait to go back in the summertime"}
{"text":"The gelato is the best hands-down in The GTA,had a nice experience good atmosphere very clean . They let you try different flavors so you can see which one you prefer. All the gelatos that I've tried were excellent."}
{"text":"I went to Port 1 Cafe and Gelateria the day after returning from vacation in Italy. The gelato at Port 1 was as good, if not better than what I had in Venice. The owner was very friendly, and allowed me to sample many different flavours. Great service, and product!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week, owner was really nice, place had lots of options other than gelato.  I had the dark/milk chocolate gelato and it was perfect, not bitter and not too sweet."}
{"text":"The best gelato!! Fresh and delicious!  Very reasonable prices and good sized scoops!"}
{"text":"A nice small coffee and gelato spot. 
If it's busy keep walking.. 
It's crowded.
Will come back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating my gelato at port one! There was no line up which was nice and you are able to taste up to three flavours. I had the chocolate gelato which was super chocolatey and delicious! My boyfriend had the mixed berry which he said was really good. He stayed outside while I ordered with my dog and I guess the server saw me feeding the dog and she offered us a cute little doggy gelato cone. He had a banana gelato cone and loved every lick of it. Because we had the dog with us we ate our gelato outside and there was a bench conveniently located right outside of the door. For some reason lakeshore was infested with nats worse than I have ever seen before but we were lucky there weren't any around port one. One downside was that they didn't have any garbage cans outside so when you finished your gelato you had to go back inside to throw it out but definitely delicious and my pup was super happy!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Port Credit for the day and I always start my day with a coffee. Searching on Yelp of course - I came across Port 1 Cafe and it was only a short walk from where I needed to be! 

My fiance and I walked in and I immediately noticed the gelato of course, and the art hanging around the cafe. Art was pretty cool - a little overpriced in my opinion but I like when cafe's sell local art! If you check in, you can get a free scoop of gelato! I was pretty sad that it was so early in the day and I needed coffee not sugar - so I opted for no gelato this time.

We both ordered an ice latte, mine with almond milk and his regular milk, and we decided to try Irish cream for the syrup. Honestly why haven't I ever gotten this syrup before!? Well - usually cafe's don't have that flavour I guess, or it's not popular but I am so glad the girl behind the counter suggested it! YUM! The coffee mixed really well and I could tell she made those coffee's individually and very carefully. I appreciate when someone takes their time, even with an iced coffee! We chatted a bit about the day, and she was very polite and sweet! 

I want to go back and try their crepes next time, and some of their brunch/lunch items! Such a cute little cafe. Not very much seating inside, but luckily it was a hot day so we didn't mind walking with of coffees to help us cool off!"}
{"text":"It was sooo sooo sooo hot at port credit today. Just wanted to sit down and relax and have something cold. Well Port cafe was a good place to hang out. 
They offer smoothies, gelato, hot drinks, cakes, food- quality was great, quite pricey but good portion.

The thing that I most appreciated was their initiave to promote local artists. They hanged local artists paintings in their store, great thing to contemplate while you are eating or drinking at this place"}
{"text":"Gelato was really yummy!! We also got a discount cause of the yelp checkin  will be back for sure :-)"}
{"text":"I only had one chocolate gelato, so this is not a full review. I was thoroughly unimpressed with my gelato. The texture and consistency were good, but it tasted like a very weak mix of NesQuick and water. The server was very soft spoken, and was not enthusiastic about serving me. And the other staff seemed disinterested in the establishment. They offer coffee and other Dufflet desserts, but I have no motivation to return.

The biggest upset is the price. For $5, you would expect a good 3 oz of gelato. My portion (served in a sugar cone) was barely 1 oz. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"It's convenient, sufficient seating, open late, walking distance, loyalty card, and best of all, the gelato AND dairy free gelato! 

I've yet to try the grilled sandwiches or crepes but many people seem to enjoy them based on what I've seen."}
{"text":"Nice quite shop with great ice cream and smoothie options."}
{"text":"Tip:  Underground parking is just north of the café, at the lights for Park St, turn into the condo, 1 Hurontario.

I was too stuffed from brunch, to enjoy any treats (or even gelato), so I only had the space for a herbal tea.  However, based on my impression from enjoying a tea with a few gfs, I thought the place was very welcoming and warm!

I was looking forward to sweets made by Amy Smith, or other indie bakers, but all that was available were Dufflet pastries.  I thought they also carried stuff from Danish Pastry House, but I could be mistaken.

Their focus seems to be homemade food, including personal pizzas, sandwiches, & soups, gelato, & their caffeinated drinks.  I hope to try out some foods during my next visit...NOT after a big brunch meal!"}
{"text":"I have got a free scoop of gelato after check in! Free stuff always tastes better haha! The coffee was alright with nothing special."}
{"text":"I've had this little spot bookmarked on Yelp for a little while now. Yesterday I was taking a stroll in the area and decided to pop in and check it out.

Located at the bottom of a condo building in Port Credit. Not sure what the parking situation is like, as we walked over.  It's a small space with maybe 6-7 tables, one table with two comfort red chairs (need more of these!) glass tables are clean, and saw the owner and employee cleaning and tidying up while we were there. Glass walls give customers a view of the outside, watching the world go by. There was a sign for free wifi, but I wasn't there for too long and didn't connect.

When you walk in you come face-to-face with the gelato gallery. They had a decent amount of flavours to choose from and will let you sample a flavour you're interested in. The presentation behind the glass looks very appealing and the owner told me he makes all the gelato himself in the back (brownie points for that!) They also had a few different types of tarts and pastries to choose from in the encasing. There were also signs for soup, pizza, etc. but I  didn't see anyone else ordering anything other than gelato or coffee while I was there.

I had a hard time choosing a gelato flavour - they all looked pretty good. I ended up having the green apple gelato which was extremely flavorful and creamy. My grandmother had the pomegranate, which I didn't try but she said was very delicious. A small cup (one flavour) cost us about $3.95 each plus tax, two flavours will run you $4.95 which isn't too bad. Perfect for a hot, sunny day!

The owner was behind the counter when we walked in and was very friendly and informative. All-in-all, I will be back to try the other flavours!"}
