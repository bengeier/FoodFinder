{"text":"This place is stuck in the 1970s.   3 reasons why i knocked this place from 5 stars to 3 stars. Get ready.  1. Customer service. The staff looked miserable and bored.  2. Decorations and atmosphere. This has got to be one of the most depressing bowling alley i've ever been to. No music playing, the lights are so dimmed, everyone that works there looks like they hate their job. It sucks the life out of you.  3. Operations. The scoreboard was very glitchy and 2 of the lanes i tried. I even heard the group beside me complaining about the scoreboard messing up.   Ya come here if you're in the area, but avoid it if you're hosting a fun event."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our New Year's Eve family night of bowling. Splitsville offered a NYE flat-rate package deal, which included: 2 hours on a lane (max 6 people/lane), shoe rental, large cheese/pepperoni pizza and a $5 arcade card per person (which the kids went through in minutes)!  It was a great atmosphere for the kids. They provided NYE hats/tiaras and horns. There were also plenty of bowling ramps for the small kiddies to use.  Often other bowling alleys have only one or two ramps, at most.   The pizza was surprisingly quite good...much better than any other bowling-venue pizza I have tasted. Just note: we were 1 adult & 3 kids, but if we were a bigger party, we likely would have ordered (at additional cost) a second pizza. Every lane was booked and the kitchen staff were very efficient, as our pizza arrived within 45 minutes of our start-time.   Pros: *Clean venue; *Friendly, helpful staff; *Tasty pizza; *Parent-approved videos on large screens (before 9).  Videos likely change for later crowd.  We will definitely return to Splitsville, both during the year and next New Year's (if the same package deal is offered). The only (minor) issue we had was not finding enough light-weight balls. We tried to locate a 6-lb or 8-lb ball for our little one, and they seemed to be used at other lanes. We eventually found one, but were also sharing with the kids beside us.   Overall, a fun time and a great venue."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Been here a couple times. Everyone bowling here is pretty old so it doesn't really have a live atmosphere to it, so it's not my thing. Staff are okay but they look bored as hell. Prices are the same as other places. Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and very user friendly. Close to Wonderland and a great choice of fun for a rainy day.  Reasonably priced and food available for purchase. They are generous with portions as well.  Shoes are typical and very used as expected.  Bring your own socks!!!!  Sensors for lanes actually work! Don't pass the line:)"}
{"text":"Great music!!! Went Saturday night, fun cosmic bowling.  Great bar and snack prices.  Sad there was no gravy for the poutine, but the young girl and young guy were very nice in the snack bar :)  Great professional service  Thanks for a great time Woodbridge Bowl!"}
{"text":"Very nice bowling alley with many lanes. Everything looks to be in good shape. They only charge you per game in the afternoons, the hourly rates are available later during the day."}
{"text":"For bowling, it's a great time.  Quick, fun games, and the staff is super quick with starting a game and fixing any issues that may arise while playing.  Food though is a totally different story.  Ordered the chicken wings and fries and although the food was great, took over 20 minutes to get it to us (already almost on game 2 by the time) so if you are only playing 1-2 games, almost might not be worth it to order food.  Also, the tables are very dirty, the staff should really do a better job at attending to the facility and making sure it looks great all day."}
