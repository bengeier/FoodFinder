{"text":"My family and I went here on father's day to celebrate.  I live close by and would love to find a good rest we can frequent in this area.  I had the Greek salad.  The dressing was very strong and tasted like chemicals.  I would have loved plain ol' oil and vinegar, but this was strange.  My husband had calamari which he liked and the pasta with shrimp which he also liked.  My son had their pasta with marinara, no flavor at all.  They serve you bread but it tastes wierdly like pizza dough, we didn't care for it.  The server was ok, nice enough but very rushed, strange because the place was pretty empty, only one other table when we were there.  We had the cheesecake for desert.....it was ok, just ok.  I had the lemonade to drink, disgusting....I was hoping for fresh squeezed this is just right out of the Coke machine.   We also had their ice tea, which again just your regular ol' black ice tea no flavor....could get this at Q.T.  We spent over $50 but the food quality is just lacking here.....won't be back."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighborhood. After two previous attempts at Italian fare, it seems this location finally has the right tenant. Fans of the Miele brothers locations in Tempe will not be disappointed. This is simple Italian food at a reasonable price.   After three visits, one dine-in and two take-out, I've found a nice consistency to the service and quality of food. The pastas were al dente and the tomato sauce had a pleasant sweetness to it. The pizzas, cooked in a brick oven, had a chewy crust and plenty of toppings. My favorite, however, is the braciola - a stuffed, rolled round steak that's braised in a red wine tomato sauce. It had terrific savory flavor and was so tender it could be cut with a fork.  The delicious food combined with great service will definitely keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I love this place! It's great for date nights or family gatherings! I've never had anything bad from here, their white pizza is to die for! The butternut squash is Devine! Their salads are huge, big enough to share. Sometimes I just get a pint of their sauce when I'm feeling lazy for my own dishes at home, it's so good!!"}
{"text":"We are from the bronx, NY where good Italian food can be found on every street.   The food here is as good and even better than what  we had back home.   Joe and his staff are fantastic and always willing to make changes to satisfy their patrons.   Florence and Barry"}
{"text":"In all fairness, this 1 star is for how we were greeted when my husband and I walked into an almost empty restaurant this past Tuesday night.  We didn't stay to eat because the guy working there didn't say anything when we walked in and then acted annoyed when we asked to take a look at the menu.  We eat out a lot and wanted to try something new, but unfriendly service at the door is a huge turn off for me.  We ended up trying Vintage 95 instead.  Much better choice if your looking for a more friendly atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Moving from Long Island, N.Y. to Chandler in December 2013, my wife and I have been looking for a place to have a good slice of pizza...well after many attempts with little success, we came across \"Amalfi Ristorante Italiano\" here in Chandler (why did it take so long to find it?). I ordered just a plain cheese 10\" pie, my wife, a ham calzone, and our son, homemade italian spinach soup  and a sausage parm hero.  The pizza pie was excellent, great cheese, oil and sauce...crust was good, a little thin, but the BEST pizza I've had in Az.  The calzone was delish....the sausage in the hero was, again, the best tasting we've had in Az.  Service was excellent...the whole experience was delicious, tasteful and enjoyable.  This will become our long lost PIZZA JOINT(as reflected in N.Y. terms)."}
{"text":"The ravoil and canoil was superior  and the service was fantastic and friendily. If you are looking for a small home town restaurant  environment with big taste at a faboulos price ."}
{"text":"Just had spaghetti and meatballs for lunch. Really hit the spot. The sauce was nice and thick with just the right amount of spices. Service was quick and friendly.  Eaten here several times before usually for dinner and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible.  If you're from Jersey or NY, don't even think about it!  Little pieces of Mozz on the Caprese plate, and the tomatoes were mushy.  The dressing on the Ceasar salad had an aftertaste.  Has the owner sipped the water he's serving?  Tastes like nasty tap water.  My wine glass came with about 3 oz. of wine in it.  Cheese slid off the too-thick crust of the pizza.  Host told us it was NY style thin-crust pizza.  Wanted to try something new close to home.  We'll be even more loyal to Grimaldi's now."}
{"text":"I decided to try somewhere new for lunch today and my girlfriend suggested we head to this place. Checked Yelp and was excited to see a few good reviews. We arrived and were seated quickly by a very nice hostess.  Our server came over and while he was friendly and attentive he smelled terrible.  Every time he walked by our table he trailed a tear inducing odor. We still weren't ready to completely give up on the place despite the server's poor hygiene and decided to order:  Chicken Bruschetta A small Pepperoni Pizza and some Fettuccine Alfredo  The Chicken Bruschetta came out first and looked fantastic. The presentation was excellent but upon biting into it we learned it was made entirely from salt. The sliced chicken on top of it looked as if it had been bought frozen and just thawed and tossed on top.  When the Pizza and the Alfredo came, again both looked amazing, we were setup for even more disappointment.  How you screw up Alfredo is beyond me but it seemed like they forgot to add cheese and just gave us some noodles in a pool of condensed milk.  I never thought of pouring milk over noodles for breakfast but now I know that it wouldn't substitute for cereal.  Now onto the pizza, I'll be honest it I liked it. A little bit heavy on the cheese but if we had just gotten this take out and not sat in to enjoy the scents I probably would have given the place a 4.  However even pizza is extremely hard to choke that down with a scent that can best be described as urine soaked hobo. We paid, left, and probably still tipped better than we should have.  I wouldn't recommend this place, if the servers can't be bothered to shower and wash their clothes once in a while who knows what goes on in the back."}
{"text":"Went with my two kids - just ordered a pizza which was very good kids liked it a lot. Haven't tried the rest of the menu but the place is comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when it opened way back when and my mom had a coupon. My parents lived close by. It's been our go to place to eat in or take out a pizza ever since. My family lives in the Bay Area so we obviously don't eat here often but due to circumstances I am back in AZ once a month and always make time for Amalfi! The pizza is so good - and the prices are amazing (remember I'm coming from Bay area) but honestly I can't get this good of pizza unless I go straight into SF and it would be 3x as much $$! The dinner salad is huge and can honestly feed two easily. I also love their minestrone soup!  We hosted a large group here in February and everyone loved their meal -- and the staff was very attentive - absolutely no complaints. In fact I'm headed to Chandler next week so Amalfi, here we come!! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the house bread and penne pesto is delish! Our server Caitlyn was very attentive and sweet! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"EDIT:  After reading the owners response, I'll let you decide if you want to give this guy your business.  I'm sure the food is decent, just don't come here expecting a happy hour or the ability to use the coupon shoved into your mailbox every week.  This review is for pricing/advertising only.  No food was consumed. We received a flyer in the mail with coupons and advertised  specials.  Yelp reviews looked good enough to try it for happy hour for the first shot.  We went in on a Sat night around 5pm (extremely early for us) and were seated promptly.  The flyer we received stated 1/2 price appetizers and 2.50 domestic drafts. We were not given a happy hour menu and we had to ask about the specials.  The waitress stated that they have 1/2 portions of appetizers for 1/2 price.  WTF?  Isn't that full price? Oh, and if you ordered from their \"happy hour\" pricing you couldn't use the $5 coupon.  So in my mind they basically dragged you in there with false advertising.  I'm not a cheap person, but don't appreciate this sort of set-up.  We walked out. We eat out a lot and typically leave reviews for places we enjoy.  This bothered me enough to leave this review.  If you don't care about pricing and false advertising than this place might be alright.  I just prefer to give my money to a business that deserves it."}
{"text":"Two of us ordered thin crust pizza. It was the best I've had within a 12 mile radius. Still, the center crust could have been a little crispier for our tastes. The tiramasu is also good, and the bruschetta. One of us tried the eggplant last visit, but it was not so good."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service . Staff is very friendly and provide great insight to their menu. Have you tried the mussels yet? OMG great flavor and not just one time we have ordered these several times. Have tried the pizza and pastas and they all have been spot on. Very comfortable setting ...not loud like many other places!"}
{"text":"Service was great - very nice servers. Food was awful - tasted like something created from a can or TV dinner - pizza was not cooked all the way and cheese was very poor in quality - as pizza cooled the cheese became clear? The Alfredo tasted like cheese whiz :("}
{"text":"Been here 4 times, so far, and each time was impressed. Nice atmosphere, with great music. Love the pizza and the lasagna. Clean restaurant, and great service. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"I/we are so happy that we found this place.  It's only a couple miles from the house and the food is great!  I enjoy the lasagna, including the extra sauce ;-), and my son loves the Alfredo.  I plan to try something other than my standard lasagna at our next visit.  The ice water served is just fine and it's free.  The staff is nice including both owners; Joe and Sergio.  I highly recommend this local eatery!"}
{"text":"Just had a half hero and. Salad. It was good. They charged $.50 for mayonnaise on the side. Wow"}
{"text":"AMALFI PIZZERIA PROVES THE TRUE MEANING OF GREAT ITALIAN FOOD !!!  Our friends told us to try Amalfi Pizzeria, they also know how picky my husband is when it comes to food..REAL Italian food which is hard to find in AZ. We are both born and raised 100% Italian & also speak Italian as our second language so we do know the difference between real Italian cooking  & American Italian cooking.. My husband loves Veal & has had a hard time finding a place that has the best veal until I took him to Amalfi Pizzeria, he was in HEAVEN and was beyond thrilled to finally find a place that has DELICIOUS TRUE AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD, the wait staff was super friendly, the owner came over to our table and made sure we didn't need anything and was very sincere & friendly.  The bread they serve as you sit down is fresh & hot right out the oven.., I am in love with their Caprese Salad & Lagana, our daughters loved the white Bianca pizza, for Apptz we had the Calamari and it's to die for.!! the food portions are great along with the prices . It is very clean, wonderful outside patio & it in a beautiful location, great Italian music plays throughout, the bathrooms are nice & super clean.  We now come here once a week & always bring family & friends that visit us from out of town who enjoy good food & wine. Everyone we bring or recommend all love this place !!!    Im more thrilled that my husband who is the worst possible food critic   LOVES , LOVES , AMALFI PIZZERA...!!!!!  ** A MUST TRY**   ( Dont for get to try their homemade Ricotta Canolis & Terra Massue for desert )  Thank you for making us true Italians PROUD  Ciao, Rita & Davido"}
{"text":"Great food. Had a couple apps and they were super fresh. Bread is crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy in the center. We all got different pastas. All good."}
{"text":"Interesting trip to say the least. We got in and did not get noticed for a while. Stood there and just as I was about ready to walk out. My boyfriend decided to make a game out of it and see how long we could stand there until being seated. After a waitress, waiter, cook, and guy at the bar (who I am assuming works there) looked at us and mentally decided who was going to take our table a waitress came out of the back and seated us. She admitted she was new and apologized on everyone's behalf. Got my salad and ordered our pizza. While waiting for the pizza I couldn't help but notice the other waitress twirling her hair and fidgeting with her glasses. Now- I've worked, managed, and been into many of restaurants I know that's a big no no. And I don't think you need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out. But with the luck we were having she delivered the pizza. Pushed past my germafobe tendencies and ate some pizza. Now after dinner the ice water went through me and i had to use the girls room. low and behold. The waitress that was twirling her hair all night was in the bathroom with a waiter. Took one glimpse and I was out of there. It was time to leave. Now forget about the \"thanks for coming in\" or \"have a nice night\"  4 tables was too busy for this restaurant to manage. If our waitress wasn't so sweet we would have definitely left."}
{"text":"Awesome. The cheese garlic bread is just delicious. Have had many things off the menu and all have been great!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Same owners for going on six years now. My favorite pizza in the East Valley, but have tried multiple pasta dishes, appetizers and lasagna. Don't know if they still serve the Beef Braciole, but it is simply amazing."}
{"text":"This has been on our to do list for way too long. The  homemade bread was delicious. The pizza and spaghetti was scrumptious and the service was superb. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is simple and stays that way. I was pleased by the Chef's Special of Sweet Potato Ravioli and I had a seafood pasta dish that was excellent! The service was a tad slow, but I loved the environment and relaxed atmosphere. I would love to try their pizza next time I go in. Great people and food. Grab a bit of frozen yogurt at FrioMio next door and your meal is complete!"}
{"text":"I usually get takeout from here.  The Pizza is very good.  I have eaten in the restaurant a few times and it was just a strange experience.  Nothing in particular just a weird vibe."}
{"text":"Toppings were fresh, the server showed me my takeout order before I left to confirm it looked ok. The pizza was much larger than expected so it served our family of four well with leftovers!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, the pizza is great and the price is super reasonable. If I'm picking up a pizza for myself or the kids we like this best!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with Alex D's review of 2/15 and give Amalfi's a \"D\" grade.  The place is run down...dark, dingy and dismal inside, so don't expect an upscale restaurant experience here.  The wait staff is comprised of young girls who are obviously not trained on the restaurant's menu or experienced at customer service.  The food is OK but if you judge an Italian restaurant on it's marinara sauce, then Amalfi is below average at best...very bland and tasteless.  We wondered if it was \"dumbed down\" to appeal to the Sun Lakers who keep this place open.  We're in our sixties and were easily the youngest patrons in there last night.   The owners who are supposed to \"speak and cook Italian\" were nowhere to be found.  This is a value proposition for retirees, as the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.  If you're looking for really good Italian food in clean, upscale environment, try any one of Babbo's 8 locations around the valley.  Closest is Rural and Ray on the Chandler/Tempe border."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Plain and simple. Also, you guys aren't located in NY. Your prices are not calibrated right for the quality of food, size of portions, and service. Figure it out. I'm also pissed because I ordered food, picked it up and left, and they forgot my dessert. I went back and picked it up and though there would've been an apology of some sort or maybe even adding an extra Cannoli but no. Not going there again."}
{"text":"Wow---what a delight this place is.  I seriously cant believe this place isn't standing room only.  My boyfriend and I ate dinner here after church on Sunday. I tried the seafood risotto for $13.00 and I can tell you this \"It was worth $26.00.\"  Every bite had seafood in it.  There was octopus, clams, and shrimp.  The flavor was beyond incredible.  My boyfriend had the canneloni which was amazing.  The sauce was full of flavor and they make the pasta onsite.  I can tell you this the name of this restaurant might have pizza in it but you are seriously missing out if you dont order these two dishes.  Our waiters name was Anthony, who is from New York, and he made our dinner an experience.  We are going back tonight with 8 people for my sons birthday.  This is the best Italian food in the valley hands down."}
{"text":"A late lunch early dinner today for 5 of us. The server was great and his recommendations from their specials list were right on. Every dish was good, even the spaghetti with meatballs the size of baseballs. Stuffed pork tenderloin Marsala had a wonderful flavor. We'll be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place. Absolutely no organization on how to run a restaurant. I walked in and asked for a table and was told a 15 min wait so I said ok. Then 2 other couples came in after me and they decided to sit at the bar and wait for their tables. We were the only ones in the waiting area when the hostess came up and said a table is ready for you. So we followed her and sat down then this older man, maybe the owner, says don't sit there and makes us get up and proceeded to explain to the hostess that the two couples that came in after me are up next for a table and I would be 3rd up. I told him that's bullshit and he tried to think back to what order we walked in. I was wanting to try this place but I will never even give it a chance because if they don't care about their customer service they probably could care less if their food is worth a damn. Do yourself a favor and skip this place unless you want to be thoroughly frustrated."}
{"text":"Okay, I know I praised this place to the sky before, but I had a less than stellar experience with their service tonight. Ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees for three, but the waiter did not bring bread to the table (I had to ask for it). Then, one of the entrees was not made as ordered and they repeatedly denied making an observably obvious mistake which led to an annoying back and forth argument with the kitchen. Bottom line: The food is definitely great here, but the operation is too small to handle the slightest variation from their menu and their waiters need some training."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian/pizza restaurants around. The food and service have always been well above average when I visit, even with large groups. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"Went for the first time, Saturday night. Great atmosphere and wonderful service, (Thanks, Mike.) Wife had the Braciola, it was fork tender, great taste. Could not have made it at home any better. I had the Shrimp Diavolo, pertect amount of heat, not sweating like crazy like some I have had. Also you get a basket of nice crusty hard bread. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am updating the review.  We still go here and the pizza is good-although not great.  The antipasto salad they serve however is kind of sad.  Some salads look great when they come out-this one does not.  And the portion size-both at the restaurant and for take out could be larger for the salad."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.   The meat Stromboli with a side of sauce is a great tasting, wonderful, tasty delight.   After living in New York for 16 years to get great dough for pizza and Stromboli.   Would highly recommend the 2 slices of oizza and a soda for $5.99"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had a tilapia special, which was tilapia with a brandy sauce over spaghetti. The sauce was simple and tasty, but the fish was too fishy tasting and not good, so I just ate around it. Great sangria. My biggest peeve was that we were served unfiltered tap water, which in Chandler equals undrinkable.   Service was average. When we walked in, we stood there for a couple of minutes before anyone greeted us. Awkward. Our waitress, however, was friendly and efficient.   It's close to home, so we might try it again as it was reasonably priced and I like supporting local businesses. A little more effort could make this place a star."}
{"text":"Hands down, the most authentic, freshest and best tasting Italian food EVER! Anybody who knows me, knows I love food. My faves to eat here are the Amalfie bruschetta and the strattiotoli(sp?) Soup!! Love love love this place! Customer service is great too, thanks Bridgette(sp?)."}
{"text":"Chicken pam was very fresh and cooked perfectly. Sauce was good but became acidic. Friendly staff with a great east coast feel. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"We tried this spot last week and were pleasantly suprised at how great the food is. We really loved their spin on the garlic bread appetizer."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not get a picture of the item they called pizza.  We had the restaurants signature pizza. The middle was very soggy as though it wasn't cooked. Still doughy. The appetizer was the mozzarella sticks. These were cooked in the same oil as the fish. Stupid idea. Who wants to eat fishy cheese??  I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy let alone a friend. How do you give a rating 1/100th of a star?"}
{"text":"Great local, authentic Italian food.  We had the calzone, penne a la vodka, margharita pizza, and the gnocchi.  Each dish was fresh, hot, and delicious.  If it wasn't for the gift certificate we got, we might have never eaten there.  We'll go back when we are in the mood for authentic Italian.  We hope this place sticks around for a while."}
{"text":"This place is great. Location is good. Service is always excellent. Food is consistently delicious. Love to go here and also get takeout. From Calamari to Pasta, I've almost tried everything on the menu except the heroes, and everything has been wonderful."}
{"text":"Amalfi is our new favorite place to eat out at.  Prices are very reasonable, and service is superb.  The pizza ranks right up there with Sal's Gilbert Pizza, Buddyz, or Jet (yep, I happen to really like Jet's Pizza).  On the plus side, draft beer is very reasonably priced, and they have several beers on tap to choose from.  I would like to see them add Garlic Knots as a free appetizer at lunch, but hey, for these prices, I can't complain.  I can't wait to try their meatballs - gosh they looked good!  It is a bit noisy during peak hours, but after a few beers, well, who notices?  LOL."}
{"text":"Went there last night and food was spectacular. I had the gnocchi and it was great. My Aunt had the butternut ravioli with cream sauce and it was equally spectacular. Definitely need to go again"}
{"text":"Our first two times here were pleasant. Today I would say the exception I have is that a cigar store has moved in nearby and the ducting must not be separate. The restaurant had a  cigar smoke smell to it. The prices seemed high and there were too many servers just waiting near the entrance for the next customers.  Don't think we will go out of our way to come here again, when we have restaurants within walking distance of home"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended but ended up being a disappointment. Food was not authentic , service was so so.  Overall impression...I think they are happy with their regulars and new customers need not apply."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I knocked a star off because of the sign that greeted us as we walked in. It said (to paraphrase) that if you take a picture of a server on their phone your meal is free. I get that keeping folks off their phones these days is difficult, but I don't want to feel like I'm supposed to be \"spying\" on the wait staff, or that they need to feel adversarial to me. We're all just people. If it's a problem with an employee, given them warnings and let them go if it doesn't work out. Be a diligent manager. Treat people like adults.  My two cents, anyway."}
{"text":"If you like a lot of cheese this is your kind of pizza place.   Scratch that. I like the right cheese to crust ratio. I also like my cheese more than just melted.  Amalfi has all the right tools but can't build my kind of pizza.  They have a real oven with a stone deck. If I ever see one of those Domino or Papa John type of pizza ovens I walk out. That's why no Spinattos or Rush St Pizza for me.  They have a good crust and a good sauce. Even the pepperoni is good.   But with the pounds of cheese they put on a pizza, it just can't cook to the right texture in a brick oven at a super high heat. It just melts into a big mess.  Sad to say but for the price I would rather go to Papa Murphy and take and bake.  But that's just me. If you like your pizza swimming in cheese, so much so that if you tilt the pizza slightly it will all pool to me side then this is your place."}
{"text":"Visiting Amalfi is like visiting beloved family!  On Mother's Day my wife and I had a wonderful meal.  As always, the food was delicious.  The staff is wonderful, and the overall experience was just a joy.  My only regret is that my stomach is not big enough to accommodate all the wonderful, delicious, enchanting food that comes from the Amalfi kitchen.  My wife and I are native New Yorkers, and Amalfi brings back so many wonderful memories of good New York City Italian cooking.  It's truly a delight!"}
{"text":"I checked Yelp first, and reviews said the Pizza was good, amazing, great, and the best around. Yes, it was good and tasty, but SUPER SALTY! -- Is it always that salty? If it's that salty all the time maybe they should put a warning of some kind on it!"}
{"text":"Tonite's meal was quite a surprise.  I've had great lunches there in the past but for some reason, the food in general was bland.  I started with the Straciatella Soup....and believe the chef on duty tonite forgot to season with salt and pepper.  I asked the owner to educate me on Straciatella and confirmed it was definitely missing those two ingredients altogether....and the owner said I should add it myself.  The caprese salad that my wife order was ok, but the chef seemed to have forgotten to drain the artichokes from all the water it had collected, which left a pond of water with each piece.  Then the seafood linguine arrived and it was ok.  I ordered it in the past and they prepared it perfectly with lots garlic and white wine and seasoned perfectly with bold flavors.  But tonite it was not as perfect as I remembered.  Once the check came, to add insult to injury, the restaurant actually charged me extra for garlic. That was a shocker that an Italian restaurant would charge me extra for adding garlic.  I don't think I'll be back...it's a shame, my first two meals at lunch was magnificent.  Something had to have changed since the last time I was there."}
{"text":"The food and service are always great! The lasagna and tiramisu are a must! It's the best Italian food in the area by far."}
{"text":"We came here to eat from out of town by  recommendation , and this restaurant was so delicious and the staff was so warm and friendly we felt right at home. The food was outstanding I haven't had authentic Italian food like this is a long time! Our server was amazing he gave us recommendations and was so friendly! I can't recommend this restaurant enough if you want FANTASTIC Italian food!!!!! 5 stars aren't enough"}
{"text":"This place is a train wreck. First of all we had a very unprofessional waitress Marisa. Her service was terrible literally the worst I've ever had. Decent food pizza was good. We had a waiter there we loved Michael. Too bad they don't keep good people. This girl literally was the absolute worst.   Sorry guys take care of the good ones Joe and Sergio. Won't be back with that one working there."}
{"text":"Amalfi's is mine & my families favorite Italian restaurant! Coming from the east coast this is hard to find! I highly recommend trying it out and must say you will never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I work nearby, so I come here several times per month for lunch. The pizza is really really good, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the prices are reasonable. I'm A bit surprised this place is not busier, must be the slow season before the \"snowbirds\" come back. Check em out if you're in the hood."}
{"text":"Went with my wife with the hopes of finding good Italian food. Authentic isn't something we hope for anymore, good is now our target.   Ordered the shrimp appetizer special. The tomato based sauce was very tasty, but the shrimp was a little over cooked and therefore tough.   I had the Beef Braciola and again enjoyed the tomato sauce, it was a thick marinara I believe. The beef was pretty good, seemed a little tough though.   My wife ordered the salmon with spaghetti and a beurre blanc citrus sauce.  The salmon was overlooked and a bit dry and the sauce wasn't very tasty. It was definitely missing salt, perhaps other ingredients. Not sure how to fix it.   All in all, nothing to write home about. I am thinking this place is really more about its pizza, that seems to be what most people on Yelp are enjoying.    The service was good and all the staff were very friendly.  There is an odd sign about using abusive language.  The only other place I see a sign like that is at the MVD."}
{"text":"This pizza place has great pizza! Originally from NJ, I have a high expectation floor pizza places here that say they are authentic. Nice and thin pizza dough and just the right amount of cheese. I will be trying their dishes for sure??"}
{"text":"This is the first time we visited this restaurant since we moved into the area. The restaurant was a recommendation from a friend I knew who knew the owners and said it was a great Italian place. Upon arriving we took a look at the menu and I can say is an Italian this menu is very varied and had a lot of the traditional Italian  meals that I'm familiar with. We decided on having a 16 inch margarita pizza for the four of us. The 16 inch pizza was more than enough to feed the four of us. The crust was excellent and the sauce was also very well-prepared.  Service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and seamed to enjoy working at this venue.   Alcohol prices were very good with $4 for well and $2 for beer."}
{"text":"The Italian dishes are tasty and adequate. Casual and comfortable. Not NYC Italian slow cooked good, but very decent for area. Have no expectations and you'll walk away happy and satisfied. Note: happy to report upholstery replaced with improved seating comfort. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant.  Courteous & friendly employees.  My wife had the spaghetti and I had the lasagna.  Both are New York style, taste great.  Lots of bread, drink and whatever else you want Italian.  Casual and laid back and great for kids as they have all styles of pizza.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal today with great service! My husband I decided to stop in and try this restaurant tonight. We weren't disappointed. They had happy hour all day, so appetizers and beer was so inexpensive (pounders of Bud light were $1.99).   When we first sat down, we were promptly greeted by the server and quickly brought our drinks. We tried the veggie pizza and a house salad. Salad was fresh tasting and came with a yummy loaf of warm, fresh hearty bread and the pizza was served as it came out of the oven so it was nice and hot. The crust had a bit of a crunch to it which added to the great texture of the pizza.   Server was attentive and had a fun personality. We never had to wait for anything, which was very much appreciated!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for a birthday party.  Both the food and service were excellent.  I am happy that this place is so close to my house as I know we will be coming back often."}
{"text":"We've been here 3x and the food is delicious! Black ink fettuccine w seafood is a favorite! Pizza is great and can't go wrong with the meat lasagna!!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza I have had to date. Its far away for us, but we make a special trip once in a while to spoil ourselves here. My husband found this place when he was out on a job in that area. Told me about how he had the best pizza of his life....I was skeptical to say the least. He doesn't even like pizza. A few months went by and I say \"ok, lets go try this place\". We made the 40 min drive and when we arrived I was still very skeptical. We were the only people in there and it wasn't anything fancy. WOW!! He was right. It was the best ever.  I haven't tried any other food there, but I can say 100% that the pizza is phenomenal"}
{"text":"My wife and I were on this side of town and thought we would try this place out. We were greeted right away and seated. There was a older couple sitting in the booth next to us and the lady had a ton of perfume on that made it unbearable. We asked the waiter to move and we moved across the restaurant that was under one of the TVs. This TV that was above us had Fox News on and the volume was up on it. I asked the waiter if they could turn the channel to something other then news and he said he couldn't change the channel because the owner would get mad. We ordered the pizza and had high hopes because of the brick oven we saw in the place. The pizza was horrible and reminded me of a pizza I had once at Peter piper like 20 years ago. The best thing this place had going was our waiter. We won't be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great food and service !!!  I ordered chicken Parmesan with a house salad and I also had to try their meatballs.  Excellent ! I'm fussy about meatballs, these were tasty and had great texture."}
{"text":"Pizza is true New York style, calamari is delicious. Good service. I will be going back for sure. Cozy and casual. Family owned."}
{"text":"Ok, the pizza here was actually VERY good. The lunch special price was appropriate. My friend and I were in a rush for lunch, and though we were 1 of 2 parties sitting down at the time, the service was sluggish. Our server was not attentive and even forgot to bring us the lunch menu initially. They did, however, give us some free bread knots and marinara while we waited for our meals. The pizza is New York style (my favorite) and the cheese was very good. Great toppings as well. The interior is nothing special, but it's clean and kind of has a sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here. It's thin crust, toppings are always good (we like the crumbly sausage), mozzarella is stringy and delicious, and the crust is nice a chewy (thanks gluten!).  The price is also very reasonable for the amount of pizza you get.  That being said, we always ordered pizza for take-out, but tonight we wanted Pasta and we thought we'd stop by and try their pasta. The fresh bread was nice as a starter. They have olive oil and balsamic for dipping along with butter.  I had the meat lasagna which was awesome! It has sausage, the perfect amount of cheese, and plenty of sauce for each bite. My dad had the spaghetti and meatballs, which he says were good (better than mom's, though that's not saying much).    The staff is always friendly, the place is never too busy, and it's close to home. We'll be back again and again! Thanks Amalfi's!"}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place and I think they do a couple things really well-Chicken Parmigiana, Caesar salad and bread (an important part of an Italian meal experience). He gets the Veal Parmigiana or Clam Linguine and always enjoys it. The other things I have tried aren't to my liking, but I think this restaurant is worth a shot."}
{"text":"Wow it's really too bad a quality restaurant something like this. Wouldn't make pasta noodles from scratch. They serve some type a crappy spaghetti noodle with their dishes. I had chicken Marcella which was really really good. It's too bad they're cheap pasta noodle.  They make homemade bread absolutely outstanding  My recommendation is to do something with these pasta noodles. Crazy to ruin such good food. It be better to raise the price a dollar and get quality pasta noodles  I really hope they take my recommendation"}
{"text":"I give this place two stars because I feel like they are trying. Otherwise, they would only get one star. It is clean, nicely outfitted and the servers are nice.  That is where the good things end.   We started with garlic knots. Another reviewer said that they were fresh baked and tasted great. Ours where rubbery and very hot, we saw that they were sitting in a bin directly under a heat lamp. Fresh baked? I ordered fettucini alfredo with chicken. My boyfriend ordered meat lasagna. Both dishes was terrible.  The sauce on my pasta was as white and thick as latex paint. It was also just as bland! There was absolutely no seasoning on anything that we ordered... His lasagna was \"bland pasta and pureed tomatoes. The meat is like pizza meat crumbles\".  Not at all what we were expecting after reading all of these yelp reviews... I don't know who could call themselves an \"excellent cook\" and approve of this food. I think the only reason that this place is still around is because the 65+ community loves this type of bland food. (When we were there, we were by far the youngest people... by decades.)"}
{"text":"Amalfi is a true neighborhood gem. Whether you're looking for expertly crafted pizza hot out of their brick oven, hot subs and heroes,  or pasta dishes that will leave you quite literally breathless...Amalfi will tantalize your taste buds and satisfy the biggest of appetites. If If I sound overly effusive,  I just ate there 30 minutes ago and am still basking in the glow of the incredible dinner I just enjoyed. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Amalfi Ristorante Itallano for lunch.. This was an amazing place. This family owned and operated establishment produced a superior product at a very reasonable price and the service was friendly and efficient. We spent 2 hours there for lunch and was absolutely delighted."}
{"text":"We had planned to get Asian food, but unexpectedly the nearby restaurant was closed.  So we spotted this place and came across the parking lot.  The menu was pretty basic.  Not that many options.  A few sandwiches, pasta entrees, pizza, which is fine.  I'd rather they do a few things well than a lot of things not-very-well.  The waitress said the soup of the day was a spinach in chicken broth.  Sounded interesting.  Well, it really wasn't.  Not bad, but not really special or interesting.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  I went with a simple spaghetti and meatballs.  My wife had the soup and sandwich.  Both were fine.  Again, nothing special.  But fine.  We did the lunch special option (cheaper), and the portion size was quite adequate.  I would not go out of my way to come here, but neither would I avoid it.  If I'm in the area and want Italian, I would stop here again."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in Chandler - maybe around the new Alamo Drafthouse Cinema - and you're in the mood for a slice of pizza or maybe some Italian food, then you really need to stop in at Amalfi and give them a try. Their pizza is DIVINE, as is their fettuccini alfredo and their penne alla vodka... I really should order two orders of the latter just so I can bring it home and have another helping the next day, it's THAT good. Service is always quick and friendly. The food is consistently good. I really should try to get here more often, as should you."}
{"text":"Blah. Pasta was very chef boyardee-ish and they didn't even put ricotta in the calzone. There was literally nobody in there when we were there which should have been our first indicator. Two stars only because the server was so bored we had some attentiveness and fairly quickly had our meals. Wouldn't return again. Go to the Mexican place in the same plaza- it's awesome and the only thing worth your time on that corner."}
{"text":"For a strip mall location the layout and interior space are quite nice.  We had a small pizza, a Greek salad, and cheese ravioli.  Overall the food was solid, though not spectacular.  It was a good value for the money, as the menu is quite reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The food sucks and the staff is rude.  When I walked in at 8:30 on Saturday night, some goon that greeted me said I had 30 minutes of dining time.  When I say down, some grumpy chick took my drink order.  I looked into the kitchen and saw some big fat dude eating a sandwich, licking his fingers and preparing food.  It was disgusting.  So I left."}
{"text":"Today we`ve been at the Amalfi Pizzeria and we had some of the best food we ever had here in Arizona! The Caprese salad was so fresh and tasteful and also we had a delicious Lasagna! The service was great and so was the ambience!"}
{"text":"Love the veggie pizza from this place. We call ahead and the pie is always ready on time and well made, they show you before you leave. Get job guys!"}
{"text":"The food is ok however the service or at least one waiter is very ride and will infer that customers are liars, I will never frequent this restaurant"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place.  So disappointed.  My appetizer of fried zucchini was $7.00 for about 15 chip size pieces.  No flavor.  I ordered the eggplant parmigiana, which was absolutely disgusting.  The batter wasn't crispy, completely soggy mush all the way through with slices of cheese laid on top and watery sauce.  Again, no taste.  The kicker was the waiter brought bread out and an oil mixture.  I figured it was olive oil \"Italian butter\" you dip your bread into.  Nope.  I soaked a piece in it and it was oil and VINEGAR for salad dressing.  I didn't have a salad, sooo...?  The waiter never came back to get my check, everyone ignored me, so I had to walk up to the counter and ask to pay. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and love it. It is great to find a new place to dine, especially Italian food. Ordered the Amalfi 16\" deluxe and it was a great pizza, the mozzarella sticks were tasty. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"So..so pizza.   The waiter was awesome..Scott..but I've had better pizza.  Need to try something else on their menu. .."}
{"text":"Had the Margherita pizza and a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. Both were amazing. Their sauce is great and not to acidic, and their pizza dough is crispy and light. Would highly recommend. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Amalfi's has a very good New York style pizza. the rest of the menu is very predictable, and the items I've had have been delivered in a manner that matches my expectations for the price I'm paying. Most of my experiences are take out, although Joe and the staff have always seemed friendly to me.  Which is why I cannot understand the two very whiny notices printed and taped to the cash register instructing the customer how to behave.One was about not asking for a return after having taken out food days earlier, the other was equally petty. I do not understand why they choose to display their dirty laundry for all customers, but it definitely brings down the atmosphere and lowers the expectations of guests.  Good pizza, I hope they stay in business, and I hope they read this review."}
{"text":"The food is nothing at all to write home about. I had the three cheese penne, while my daughter had ravioli. We also ordered a salad. Let me start with the house wine in the tiny glasses. Glasses were small and wine was just ok, and i suggested the right size glass for red wines and to spiff up the smudged glasses. Then the bread came. It arrived in a basket slightly overdone at the top with four packets of butter tossed in the same basket. I think this should be reconsidered. Who knows whose hands touched this and then now the packets were touching the bread. I tried to push that thought aside and made us a nice oil, vinegar and asked for oregano, so i made nice dip for the bread. The bread was actually very good. They may consider doing this dip thing for their patrons to kick it up a notch. While waiting for our entrees i noticed the taller maybe middle aged waitress was touching her nostrils with two fingers, giving a good amount of time rubbing in and out, maybe they itched, i don't know, but i was thoroughly grossed out. The manager was standing right there, and he said nothing to her. She made no move to go wash her hands, and believe me, i did not take my eyes off of her. She was not our waitress, but i was worried she would bring us our food as sometimes they help each other out. She went on to stretch her legs, grabbing her shoes and pulling her leg backward, touching her hair where it fell out of her bun. No. Please don't do things like this. It really made me nervous. Thank God a man brought our food, not her. I never ever saw her wash her hands or leave the area. Our entrees were definitely \"meh\" rating. My penne had overdone penne and the noodles broke apart with barely touching the fork to them, lacked seasoning, and the top had what tasted and looked to be just tomato sauce. I took two or three small bites and pushed it aside. The waitress didn't bother to ask how we liked it, if there was anything wrong. She was not observant or maybe didn't care. So far, the salad went uneaten, because even for a salad it was not good. It had barely any lettuce, mostly 3 types of olives, some lame and pale tomatoes and feta. There was nothing to really put on the fork and eat. They should consider minimizing the olives and serving just one type of olive. i suggest the kalamata because the many slices of black olives, green olives, and small kalamatas were weird. My daughter said her ravioli was ok, but she didn't finish it. We wasted $50 on a meal, and i regret it, as it was not worth half of that. I really wanted to like this place. Im guessing they are in business because of location to Sun Lakes. It's convenient to them, but it is just not good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new local Italian food place. Our old stand by had lost it zest and the food was going down hill. We took the kids and went to Amalfi's. we found it by just driving by one night, Turned out to be great place staff was great and the food was great, table next to us said Pizza was the best so the kids got it, I had Lasagna with a meat ball, butternut ravioli for son in law( his favorite).  Looks like we found a new place for Italian, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here for the Living Chandler Cash Mob on September 13th.  We got there around 4pm and there were a few people but wasn't super busy.  We were seated immediately, offered water and menus and because we had a Living Chandler wristband, we ordered the free bruschetta, which was fabulous!  The bread was soft with a bit of crunch and the toppings were so fresh and perfect.  Another great plus...they offer Pellegrino in the larger size bottle so we split one.  I had the spaghetti with clam sauce and partner had the gnocchi.  Both were generous portions and both were fabulous!  The marinara sauce on the gnocchi was perfect with the tang and sweetness and the clam sauce was garlicky and so good!  We ended our meal by sharing the creme brulee, which was just the perfect small size for each of us to have a few bites of sweetness.  Although the caramelized sugar top was done just right, we both agreed that the creme was a bit runny.  Still tasted wonderful.    Service was perfect, spot on, and the place is airy and clean.  Thanked the kitchen staff for a fabulous meal on our way out!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok place.  I love the outside patio area.  The owners are nice and accommodating ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to go here- I was raised on Italian food & am a pretty excellent cook, so I was skeptical, but had a truly wonderful time.  We ordered the Antipasto salad, Calamari, a White Pizza, and a \"spicy seafood pasta.\" The salad was fabulous- there were chunks of provolone and big pieces of meat- and the dressing was fabulous! I am a balsamic enthusiast, and their Italian dressing has a balsamic base that I loved. Our white pizza had large chunks of Ricotta on it. It was a little overwhelming with all of the other flavors going on at the dinner table- but when I put it in the oven & ate it the next day- it was to die for!   The seafood pasta was my least favorite, but still had some very charming qualities. The sauce was not at all spicy for someone who likes spice- but had we asked them to spice it up when we ordered, I am sure they would have. The Shrimp in the pasta were huge and hearty though- and that is always a plus.  More than anything though, I appreciated the service at Almalfi's. There were only a few other tables there that night, and each one was treated with personal attention and care. We ended up being the last table in the place- leaving right at closing time- but we never felt awkward or forced out. I felt welcomed to finish my meal, my wine, and my conversation before leaving. They changed the TV's for us when we asked, and turned up the volume on them when the other guests left (which we didn't even ask them to do.)  I left with a full belly and a feeling of hospitality. I would stop in for that Antipasto Salad or another White Pizza anytime!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  The first time we ate in.  Split a bottle of wine and ordered the white pizza.  It was very good.  Craig, our server, was really friendly and very attentive.  The next time we ordered pizza's for pick up and Craig took my order over the phone.  Once again, super friendly and nice to talk to.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One again we had an amazing meal. Great ambiance and our server Scott was fantastic. We tried the special of muscles and pasta and the shrimp bruschetta. The muscles were cooked perfectly but the BREAD goodness was fresh, soft and delicious. And with $4 wine and beer for happy hour, you just can't go wrong! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had read about this restaurant somewhere, and after the Yelp reviews, we decided to experiment with the family.  As it is my standard, we always judge a pizzeria based on the cheese pizza.  It allows one to judge the dough as well as the sauce just on those merits.  Once you start loading toppings on the pizza, it removes from the sauce.  We were seated immediately on a Friday early evening: 5:30pm.  The restaurant is very clean, well arranged, not too noisy.  Perfect for families.  We started with Fried Calamari.  We had to order two orders, as it was Happy Hour, and portions were slightly smaller, as the waitress explained to us.  The Fried Calamari was excellent, but the sauce needed more seasoning.  It tasted relatively fresh though.  The pizza was the problem, and the reason for the two star loss.  It was bland.  The dough was plain and mildly undercooked.  The sauce was quite bland, had almost no intrinsic flavor of its own.   When you eat a pizza, you should be able to hold the piece in your mouth and slowly allow the juices of the sauce and oil from the cheese to seep over your tongue and through your teeth, and then finally down your throat.  The entire experience should be seamless and wonderful.  We ended up having to add parmesan cheese (which I almost never do) as well as pepper on my wife's pizza to add flavor.  Finally, I asked the waitress for dried oregano, which we all added to our pizza.  She was surprised, stating she had not heard a complaint of that nature.  But looking around it wasn't hard to see why.  We saw people ordering Sicilian style (which looked excellent) as well as almost all the pizzas were topped.  No one was ordering just a cheese pie, which is the standard New Yorker request.    I saw the manager speaking with his kitchen staff, and I'm assuming they were discussing the sauce.  The sauce should be consistent and flavorful every time.  It's the basis of a pizzeria.    However, the calamari was excellent.  Service was wonderful--our waitress was very nice, attentive and polite.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  The pizza needs some adjustment though."}
{"text":"Their Stracciatella Soup--the Italian answer to egg drop--with garlic and spinach--has won me over as a fan. Served fresh when you order it, hot and tasty with fresh, warm bread--yum. Reasonably priced, comfortable, good service--maybe this ain't NY, but neither is the price. It gets my vote for a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was our first trip here. Wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The yelp stars for here don't seem accurate. The food is wonderful, big portions at a good price. We are more than happy to return. Our server Andrea was very knowledgable and courteous. We had very quick service."}
{"text":"WOW!  2 for 2!  We stumbled on this new pizzaria a few weeks ago and fell in love with not only the food, but the staff!.  The pizza's are pretty much 'create your own' and the toppings are endless.  We had an Artichoke Heart, Basil, Sausage, and Tomato pizzia that was to die for!  Their dinner salads are huge and served in a cold plate/ bowl.  Tonight I had the Seafood Rissotto and I can honestly say I have not met its equal in any Italian restaurant.  Absolutely amazing!  Our server [and everyone] was friendly and courteous.  If you blink, your drinks are refilled. The place was very busy and everyone seemed pleased with their food. The portions will allow you to save some for lunch the next day, which was tough tonight because it was so good.........We'll be back again.........and again.  You need to try this place if you're in town."}
{"text":"went back again because we were in the neighborhood, and really liked it last year.  We started off with an excellent antipasto, plenty for four adults.  I had a small pizza that was very good, J had pasta with gorgonzola cream sauce and a house-made sausage - yummy, and T had penne pasta with vodka sauce - also yummy.  D had chicken Parmesan that was crisp breaded and the house red sauce on linguini - scrummy. Service was excellent, even though the joynt was packed.  We got out of there for $75, including several glasses of wine.  gotta love that. This restaurant has got it all going on.  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good i like the service, i can just call in an pickup the best pizza around in 15-20mins thank yoU!"}
{"text":"What Happened? We ate here after Amalfi's first opened, The pizza was great!  Several \"to Go\" orders later and a handful of times dining in, this establishment is now out of the rotation of places we will eat.  Everything from the pizza crust to the cheese seems to have been substituted with a poorer and cheaper quality. We ordered a large selection of entres the other day for some guests we had over. Eggplant and some seafood dishes.  The food tasted like a \"TV\" dinner and ended up mostly in the trash. We gave this restaurant several chances to do better but it is not to be. It would be nice if they had kept up the good quality they started out with. Save your money.."}
{"text":"I would give half a star if I could. The calamari appetizer is bland and poorly fried.  After a disappointing appetizer, we hoped that the pizza would be the saving grace, only to be let down again.  Do your taste buds a favor and order a pizza from Venezia's."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The bread baked in a brick oven was amazing. Their vodka sauce is light and decadent. My bf had beef bracciole and it was so good! Definitely my new place for Italian. Service was exceptional too!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, clean.... Butternut ravioli was amazing and the pizza was just as good! Owner was there and very helpful and made sure everything was going smoothly ( I think he was on the Soprano's lol) The 3 star lady can't give a full review because she hasn't tried more things.... If you know you can't give a complete review then don't give one at all!!"}
{"text":"Best deal in town.  Great pasta, great pizza and amazing service.  It's actually a hidden gem in a low key plaza and we were very happy to find it.  Prices are probably the best in the area for good Italian fair.  Love the bread too!"}
{"text":"We had 2, 16 inch pizzas and shared with 4 people. We definitely came out really full. And I can eat a lot of food. We had 4 different toppings and pizza Margherita was my favorite one. One waiter also speaks Italian which is awesome. The only thing that is not so nice is the whole restaurant set up. It doesn't make you really feel you are in a restaurant when you look at the tables, it looks a little bit like a fast food place. We had desert too. The ice cream covered with chocolate was amazing and the tiramisu was compared to a lot of places here in phoenix very good."}
{"text":"Fake Italian food for old white people.  Poor service.  Wifi is available but no one knows the password. They \"run out of limes\".  Cheese pizza made my 5 year old puke."}
{"text":"This is really the best kept secret for Italian food.  When you arrive do not be confused with the pizzeria name on the outside.  Yes it is a pizzeria but it is much more than just pizza.  The service was great, we were greeted with a friendly face and the server was prompt.  We ordered the appetizer, drunken shrimp.  It was amazing, highly recommended to order if you go.  I ordered the penne ala vodka and it was delish!  My husband got a shrimp dish, it was good.  The rating of a 4 comes from the lasagna dish, it was a little to al dente for our liking.  I bet if you ask it to be non-al dente they would make it for you.  Definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I love the owners and the pizza and bruschetta keep me coming back for more! If I get fat - lets just say I know who to blame hahahaha!!! The waiters need some training but the chefs are on point! Truly Amalfi style!  Got the margarita and the bruschetta Amalfi, the two things I get every time and the veggie pizza! Yum yummy yummmm"}
{"text":"The prices were not good for a place with no atmosphere. I have found many better Italian restaurants in the East Valley with better atmosphere, prices, service and food. We will not return this was our second and last visit."}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced and good portions. Service a little slow , but they were busy and six at our table. Everyone enjoyed their entree and house wine decent and inexpensive."}
{"text":"We live within 5 miles of this restaurant and just tried it for the first time recently.  The chicken alfredo is heavenly creamy!! We also ordered a meatball and ricotta pizza that had our tastebuds doing cartwheels! If anyone is used to Italian food back east,  you will be very happy here!!! I am so excited we found this place. Thank you Amalfi and keep up the fabulous food, quality ingredients, and great service!! Oh and I forgot about the bread. ..omgosh the bread!!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for lunch under the impression that it was authentic Italian. Hmmm, I don't know about that. And while that debate remains open, I will say it definitely fits the pizzeria theme that it is and then some.  I ordered the calamari (It was PERFECT. breading. Not too greasy...) served up with marinara, a spinach salad (substituted the gorgonzola for feta), and a spinatella soup. Really enjoyed all of it, especially the soup which was an egg drop type of soup with lots of garlic and spinach. Yum!  The best part was that all the servers there were very friendly and attentive. Can't beat pretty good food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Wow what has happened to this place?!?  Not sure if they have just gotten lazy these past few months but  something is clearly wrong. I have gone a few times in the last month and each time the quality of the food has really gone done. The freshness seems to be gone. The marinara sauce now taste like cheap Prego store bought sauce.  I ordered some Lasagna and it seems they dumped an entire jar of sauce on it. Couldn't even see the Lasagna anymore I had to scoop away most of it just to be able to get to the pasta.    Once I started eating it it was bland and again lacked any anything of decent taste and flavor. Highly disappointing as when it first opened it was very good.  Now the best thing I've eaten these past few months has been their complementary bread."}
{"text":"Our new \"go to\" place for Italian food. We moved here from St. Louis where there are great Italian restaurants on every other corner.  It's been hard finding a neighborhood place here that's more than pizza.  Spaghetti is always the first test and Amalfi's gets high marks with a great sauce, large meatballs or savory Italian sausage. The seafood risotto and linguini (both often on special) are so full of seafood morsels you wonder how they afford to to it. And my wife loves the white pizza. Prices are reasonable too. Ask for waiter James, he is the best."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Food was delicious and delivered in a timely manner. I enjoyed the atmosphere of having tvs on in the restaurant, but muted with relaxing music in the background. You can still catch sports scores without all the background noise!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite go to places to eat. We do try and get there before the crowds. Food is always great the price is very reasonable. The staff are excellent and friendly. The new specials are creative and tasty."}
{"text":"We had the pizza and cheese raviolis.  Both were delicious. We also ordered some type of chocolate mousse pie for dessert.  Yummy. The sauce is very tasty the crust style on the pizza is perfect.  The only negatives were a dirty plate, which was switched out, and there was a slight aroma of bleach cleaning solution upon our arrival.  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Pizza was unfortunately below average. The crust was very bland. Chain pizza crust tastes better than the crust I are here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! I love their pizza sauce. Wish the place was a little bigger but other than that it's the best!!!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and have always thought this place was amazing, but tonight I had one of the best pastas I have ever had (and I'm not shy about ordering wayyyy to much pasta). I had the chicken pesto ravioli in a pink sauce and oh my goodness it was AMAZING. The best part, we even got it to go and it was still like it was served straight out of their kitchen to my table. YUM. Must try restaurant, family owned and we love to support local, it doesn't hurt that this place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"WOW, I am really impressed with this place! The food was amazing! The desserts were even better! You must try the cannoli and the spumoni, absolutely out of this world! We will definitely be going back...often!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I'm happy to say we were totally satisfied! Our service was great and the food was spot on. I was so happy that when we received our meals, not one of the plates were scalding hot (no heat light time!!). Our food was very fresh and of excellent quality, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"All we can say is AWESOME! White Pizza is better than Grimaldi's (and we live Grimaldi's), owner is very nice and outgoing, we love the bruschetta and the pizza. Everything we had has been great! We hope they are there to stay! I don't think we are the only one's that feel this way...every time we go there it's packed!"}
{"text":"Meh. The food here is really nothing special at all. Literally I would say anything here is over Olive Garden quality and possibly slightly lower.  The waitress we had had the most insane breath that our entire table noticed it each time she would come over. Simply no excuse for that!!! Straight rotten teeth smell. She was young too. Maybe 21 tops. Mexican girl.  Pizza was doughy as hell and soggy in the middle. Crisp everywhere else. Way too thick.  Lasagna tasted like it came out of a box.  Squash ravioli of some sort was actually decent. Tony little serving however. 6 raviolis for $15?? Really?  The staff here stared the whole time in a very awkward way. Mexican dudes working the counter were just very uncomfortably staring all through dinner. Awkward!  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food!   With visitors from Iowa we decided to give this restaurant a try.  My sister and husband have traveled a lot and they were impressed with how good the food was.   We enjoyed our lunch and I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Pizza was nice and delicable.  Servers are very friendly also . The complimentary bread is pretty yummy ."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place, really wanted an antipasto salad, but after the recommendation of the wait staff also decided to try the White Pizza.  The salad was very disappointing - though it looked good it lacked flavor. So I was then looking forward to the award winning white pizza... it was disgusting!  I couldn't even eat it, mounds of what I think was ricotta cheese, I had to scrape it off there was so much mounded on top of a crust with another cheese - again little flavor.  I was so disappointed I did not even take the remainder of the pizza home. I was so hungry and so looking forward to a good meal, you couldn't pay me to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's so hard to be open-minded when you have an Italian chef in your household. We've tried to like this little joint several times. We've had the pizza  both Sicilian and regular along with some salads. The Sicilian is too heavy/doughy not like true Sicilian pizza. And the other is just so so. The plus is the people are great and service is good. We need to try other dishes to give a complete review."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the food here. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs. I enjoyed the sauce and meatballs were excellent. I especially liked their bread. Fresh-baked bread is always a plus. My stepson had tiramisu for dessert and he said it was delicious. He also enjoyed his calzone a lot. We went on a Friday night and it was busy, but we had reservations.   I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I am a bit luke warm on this. we figured try a new local. We arrived at 5:30 so we knew there could be a dinner rush. The restaurant has a little bar on the left side as you walk in. There were several open tables and it seemed busy. Three wait staff a woman and two men were busy rushing around.We were seated and our server (Scott)came over and offered us drinks and asked if we had any menu questions. We settled on a Diet Coke and a glass of wine and two pasta dishes. I had the butternut squash ravioli 13.99  (a chef special)and the hubby has the penne add sausage 10.99/2.50. We got a small Loaf of bread and we decided to add a dinner salad to share. The salad  (definitely not two peoples portion) but at 2.99 not an issue. Pino was 7.00 for the glass. A few things were red flags but we chalked it up to they are busy and not enough staff. Our pasta was served by the older dark headed waiter who I assume might be the owner. He was shouting directions to the other waiters so that made me think that was the case. The food was ok. The portion of butternut squash was 5 pcs and made this over priced in my opinion. The penne was a more suitable portion. Seems a lot of people got pizza so We will try that next time, yes a next time as I think to be fair it's required. We saw a lot of \"older\" patrons so I believe they are usually a bit more discerning and most were earring the pizza. Out the door 43.21 not including the tip and I let the hubby handle that. I would say fair for a meal even if a bit. One odd observation was a older man with Grey hair in the kitchen who seemed to be watching the cooks.. (very odd)?"}
{"text":"The service was great, lovely ambiance and comfortable seating. We were really happy with the penne all vodka and primavera pasta dishes. I'd definitely come back again. Staff scored high with us and that's always refreshing!"}
{"text":"I am old school Italian from South Philly...!rst time there yesterday.I ordered spaghetti and meatballs to go.I found the gravy(sauce)acidy and the meatballs bland but tender.The best part was the bread.Overall add a little sugar to cut the acid from the tomatoes and cook the sauce with additional \"Italian Seasoning\""}
{"text":"This was our first experience eating here and everyone really enjoyed their meal.  From the bread they bring out to the meat lasagna.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Went to Amalfi today for lunch. It was my first visit and my wife's second. The food was outstanding. The stracciatella soup, described by a previous reviewer, was the best soup I have ever eaten. Really. The Greek salad was wonderful. Because I am on a diet, I am often hesitant to order Greek salads because many restaurants douse them with high-calorie dressing. This salad had a vinagrette dressing applied sparingly. The salad itself was so flavorful it didn't need much dressing. Couldn't resist the freshly baked bread even though I am trying to avoid starch. My wife is a connoisseur of Italian food and loved her fettuccine alfredo. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The lunch prices are quite reasonable. For slightly more than you would spend at a fast-food restaurant, you can have a delicious and--if you choose wisely and resist temptation--healthy sit-down meal.  UPDATE:  My wife and I went to Amalfi this evening to celebrate a special occasion. Our experience was just as good as before. In fact, we both ordered the same menu items as described in my first review. Hey, if you find something you like, why change?  I would like to address a criticism another reviewer had of my previous review: I described the loaf of bread served before the main course as \"freshly baked.\" The other reviewer said it could not have been freshly baked because he saw it sitting in a bin under a heat lamp. This time, I asked our server, James, point blank whether the bread was freshly baked. He said, \"Yes, it just came out of the oven. We make it here using the same ingredients as the pizza dough.\"   Granted, I was not in the kitchen when the bread came out of the oven. But I'm certain that the bread was freshly baked, just as surely as I can identify a potato that is twice-baked and someone who is half-baked. If the bread sat under the heat lamp, it could have been for no more than a few minutes.  This was the third visit in a row we have been served by James. He is always attentive, courteous, witty, and smiley.  One clue that the food is authentic is that the cooks speak to each other in Italian. Granted, I don't speak Italian, and they may have been speaking in gibberish just to fool me. But I'm not into conspiracy theories.  What could have been better? Well, my wife said the women's restroom was a little warm, as if the air conditioning wasn't quite reaching it. And because I am not a sports fan, I would have preferred to have been seated closer to the TV showing some people building a log cabin than the TV showing a soccer game. Other than that, neither I nor my wife has any complaints. Still five stars."}
{"text":"From the food to the staff working here, Amalfis is fantastic. I am never disappointed with any of the items I have ordered off the menu. Their pizza and pasta are delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves good Italian food."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices.  Why am I rating this 3 stars?  This place could be on one of those restaurant rescue shows.  The owner doesn't know how to manage/motivate his employees into a real team.  He walks around the place like a dictator, employees seem to almost be in fear of him.  It was hard to watch.  Too bad, because I think this place could be a real revenue machine.  Another guy (we believe his son) working there seemed to know exactly how to interact with employees and customers.  He should be the one running the place and the owner should either stay in the kitchen or stay home and watch the money pour in.  Update:  Things seem to be operating better, there's less employee stress now.  I don't know what changed but I like it.  BTW, the food is fantastic and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Back again for the 3rd time. Ordered the white pizza (again!), which is our favorite, and gnocchi. lived the gnocchi, the sauce was fantastic, just like we make at home. We met the owner, Sergio. He and my hubby spoke Italian and I felt like I was in Italy! Che Bella!"}
{"text":"The food was great! We  had a pizza and it came to the table hot. The lasagna was delicious.  Great friendly service.  Close to Sun Lakes. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for about the past 2 years and have always liked the food and staff.  The staff is super friendly and personable.  They will do half and half on pizzas so we can each have our favorites.  We'll continue to return!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Now, a few years later we revisited with family that goes here often - we told them about our first experience (below) and they convinced us that is not the norm. This last visit was great I must say.  Maybe because my family were now regulars there, they were greeted, the owner came over to talk, the waiter was super nice and attentive. And the food was very good.  Maybe shake up the menu a bit with some specials, but what was there was tasty and had good sized portions.   FIRST REVIEW  Jan 14, 2012  Ah.. the third Italian /pizza establishment in just over a year in the same location....you would think they might have learned from the mistakes of the last two, but no!  First, marginal food.  Maybe it will satisfy the taste buds of non Italians, but certainly not those of New York Italians!  From the tangy somewhat bitter tomato sauce to the very tough (like shoe leather tough) eggplant parmigiana we were so disappointed.  The only bright spot in our meal was the Ceaser salad and the very friendly server.  As for the owners, now they have quite a lesson to learn in customer relations and interactions. While looking at the menu we noticed one of the pizza entrees was called \"Astoria\" pizza.  We asked if that was so because an owner came from that city in NY?  The waitress said she thought so and would ask.  She did, and when she came back to take our order she said yes, he moved from there.  My husband said to tell him that we did also and told her briefly what area of Astoria and that we used to go to the local pizzerias there.  We asked if he was there tonight, and she said \"Yes, somewhere.\"  Now really, the place is all of about 2000 square feet...  Needless to say, we saw her telling him, he was standing just behind our booth and close to the register.  Not once did he come over or acknowledge any of the customers.  We took that as disinterest, which most business owners can hardly afford nowadays.  So out we went after our so so meal, vowing not to return to try the pizza which didn't look too bad.    And of course we will be telling everyone we meet up with about our experience there.  We live in a community where going out to eat for most is a few times a week happening."}
{"text":"We're there on a Friday night and here's what we saw: Busy atmosphere, lots of customers eating, families, a bar off to one side of the restaurant. We were seated very quickly and decided upon the Italian Sausage Parmigiana Hero sandwich, a side salad, the Spinach Ravioli, and Spaghetti with baby clams. Bread was fresh and warm, came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The marinara sauce on the ravioli and on the Sausage Parmigina was sooo tasty, you not belief! The side salad had lots of mixed greens and black olives and tomatoes, that was nice, and the house dressing wasn't bad. The only real ding was the Spaghetti with clams lacking in taste somewhat, and maybe they should give their servers Parmesan Cheese graters, or at least black pepper grinders - for the love of god! I've really got to reserve judgement of this place until I eat some of their PIZZA, otherwise I liked it - and one of their servers bore uncanny resemblance to actress Cara Delevingne, you got no complaints..."}
{"text":"I was here a year ago and am disappointed in their declining services & food tasting. What happened? Change in ownership?  Chef?  Or staffs?....   When our waiter came over to ask us what we wanted to drink, I saw him using his finger to pick the side of his nose. I was in such a shock that I starred at him pouring our drinks the entire time from our tables all the way to the bar. I knew he knew that I was starring...and he felt that it was strange. The entire time, I was praying that his fingers would not touch my food after I order them.   We ordered fried cheese ravioli (special for $3.99) and bruschetta for appetizers. The filling for the ravioli was gross and it was soggi. We ate two of them and simply couldn't finish the rest of them. Thankfully, bruschetta was still delicious. The toasted bread had just the right amount of crisp & I really enjoyed it. For main entree, I ordered what I had a year ago, spaghetti with clam in wine sauce. The sauce was watery and clam was a bit smushy. Overall, it just didn't taste anything like the first time we were here.   As far as the service goes, our waiter did not check up on us often. He didn't even give us the complimentary bread that they gave to every table. When I asked him why, he simply said that since we ordered appetizers, he didn't think we would want them. He did bring it to us upon request but I definitely wasn't happy. Not \"once\" he stopped by to ask if the food was OK during the meal.   I am highly disappointed on the change in food as well as services. I don't know if I will come back here again."}
