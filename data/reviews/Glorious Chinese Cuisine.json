{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Honestly when we were ordering, she was pressuring us to order more food and was talking shit about us. We ordered the sweet and sour pork and the lady was like, \"sorry we're sold out\" as a \"joke\" and laughed with her worker. WHAT?!?! What type of costumer service is that?!?! She was glaring at us like we trashed the place and after we ate she asked if we wanted to order more food... WHO WOULD ASK CUSTOMERS TO ORDER MORE FOOD AFTER EATING??? NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Not worth the money or time."}
{"text":"Very unorganized when they are busy. Special Father's Day set menu. Just like most other tables. The table beside us that sat about an hour after us got their service completed before ours. Didn't keep track of other tables farther away but dinner turned into 3-1/2 hours of disappointment and frustration. About 6 employees that we approached kept telling us our food was just about to come out ...for 40 mins. That happened on 2 occasions throughout the evening. Lobster came out last. Burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. No apologies offered but a few excuses were."}
{"text":"Service was terrible,  I came here with my family and we were there for 4 hours because they took so long to bring out all the food...ridiculous. Food wasn't even that great and I'm pretty sure the dessert that we got went bad. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Should have known before walking in that this place was no good. Stopped by around 6pm for dinner but it was pretty empty inside. I walk in and the servers ask how many people. Once you answer, they ignore you. What was the point of me telling you if you were going to just ignore me and let me choose where to sit? Food is mediocre, wasn't the best but wasn't horrible. The real issue is their service. Other than the two men that worked there everyone else had this attitude. You'd ask for something and they give it to you after doing their own things first a.k.a talking to their colleagues. When it comes to paying the bill and you don't give that 10% service fee, they start to give you shit. The manager doesn't say shit because she makes her workers do it (the lady in black with the attitude). The lady proceeds to make up bs saying their restaurant always charges a 10% fee but also says if we don't pay it it's ok. If it's ok then don't come back to my table to tell us! I already paid tip for shit food and service but clearly it wasn't enough for them. So I don't pay and I get ready to leave so the lady comes to take the tip and starts speaking really loudly to her manager; \"I ALREADY TOLD THEM BUT THEY DIDN'T PAY EXTRA.\" Lol don't say you won't force us to pay if you're going to give so much shit. Never coming here again and I know I won't regret it."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT AT ALL COST!!!!   My family and I ordered one of their set dinners for $400 and it's suppose to include a 4 lbs lobster but instead, we go a double lobster (which by the way was a $50-$60) difference even at the super market.  Asked the manager for explanation and she said they ran out!!...  LoL...  Not only did they scam us but they refuse to reduce the amount of the bill!!  Never coming back here!!....."}
{"text":"This restaurant may not be a bad place if you are looking for inexpensive dim sum. It has a big parking lot. You will never have a problem in looking for a parking spot."}
{"text":"ON TO THE NEXT ONE.  
I know you're not supposed to rate Chinese restaurants based on customer service but if I did, Glorious would get 1 star. I've been here a few times in the past and the service was horrible but we dealt with it because the food was ok. When we heard it was under new management, my family decided to give it another try. We had an 8PM reservation and arrive at 7:55PM. We weren't seated until 8:40PM and when we made our reservation, we had also reserved suckling pig (yue ju) but when the waitress came to take our order, she informed us that they were out for the day. What is the point of a reservation if you're not going to get it when you get there?  We order something else from the menu and one of the items was a 4lb lobster. When it got here, it was definitely not 4lbs. We asked if they were making it two ways or if the rest of the lobster is coming on a separate plate but the waitress said that was it. When we confirmed with her that it was four pounds, she looked at it confused and then looks at our order form and was like \"Yes, yes, this is four pounds.\" I don't want to sound like I'm complaining but if I'm going to deal with bad service, I do expect speed or good food to make up for it. (you know the saying: Fast, Amazing or Cheap - you can have two but not all three) 

Overall, the meal was edible but it wasn't amazing, customer service sucks at Asian restaurants and it sucked here. The change of management changed nothing. Still two stars and I think I'm being generous on that rating."}
{"text":"I tried out their dim sum and their dinner. 

DIM SUM:
I went with my family over the long weekend.   If you order before 11:30am, it is a reduced price of $2.50 ($2.18 on weekdays).   The food is decent with some items that are pretty good for the price.   The restaurant is large but we called ahead for reservations. 

DINNER:
We preordered the roasted suckling pig.   The pig was freshly made that day and tasted delicious.   We also got a Peking duck and had the option of mixing the meat/body with eggplant, highly recommended!  

Overall, this restaurant is quite good.   Nothing fancy by any means and there's better tasting restaurants in the area.   But for the price, this restaurant is worth checking out.   The service is left to be desired however as they seem a bit understaffed in both instances."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars.

I just got home from Chinese new year's eve dinner. I never really liked this place because they always had bad service, so when I found out that this was under new management I was hoping it would be good. And tonight definitely met my expectations. 

We were seated quickly, and because it's cny we ordered from their cny set menu. The food came out quickly, I saw the staff working quite efficiently and even saw the owner's young son helping out. Poor boy, saw him getting confused a few times. The food was good except one dish was quite salty I don't know what it was called. All our dishes came on time, none missing unlike the year before. 

The servers and hostess were also nice and friendly (what a surprise).  And there's a huge mirror by the washroom! Lol good for checking yourself before you go back to your table :p.
Anyway, I haven't been here for dim sum since  new management took over so I'd come back to check it out!"}
{"text":"The food is at or below average. Peking duck was alright but the pancakes were misshapen and caked with flour. Sweet and sour pork was a good portion (loads of meat). Soup was salty af. Octopus tentacles were quite good. Decor and service were fine. Really quite middling."}
{"text":"Glorious. I forgive you. I accept the fact that your fuck up was just that, a fuck up. A one-time thing. You were going through a rough period and mistakes happened. What's important is that time and time after that, you really showed that you cared. 

After that disastrous night, I thought we were done for good. Unfortunately, my grandparents absolutely adored you. I guess that's what happens when you get on the good side of my family. Clever move. But with every family dinner, holiday, birthday, or whatever we celebrated within your walls, you continued to show you deserved their loyalty, and ultimately, mine too. 

Take your roasted suckling pig for example. Perfect, every time. The skin is crisp and the pieces are thin. The presentation is fantastic. And your lobster. Never overcooked or bland. Whether it is tossed and fried in Maggi sauce or steamed in ginger and green onion (the better option in my opinion), you deliver crustacean goodness. 

And then sometimes, you surprise us with these little gifts of yours. Just last night, you gave me flavourful sticky rice stuffed in fried chicken. How does the skin stay so crisp while surrounding such deliciously moist sticky rice? Just when I thought you've shown your hand, you keep surprising me. 

And service. Well, I don't know if you even made any changes, but I'm glad to see you back to your normal self. Food coming out efficiently, servers being attentive and friendly. To be fair, it's all been consistently mistake-free the last few times we've seen each other, which begs the question, what will happen if something DOES mess up again? Will you try to push away blame again? For now, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  

You're attentive, and talented, and damn you cook a good chicken. So by continuously winning over my stomach, you've won your way back into my heart. We can start over again.You can become truly glorious once more, in my eyes.  

(14/100 - 2018)"}
{"text":"We came here on family day with my family, but after we arrive they told us we never reserve, but I definitely remember that we called in for reservation a day before and they also double confirm our reservation and also ask us if we should order some foods ahead of time. Also, I have my phone history saying that I did call in for reservation. They just push all the fault on us, that make us so mad. And that is not the only thing, after we  sit down to order food, they never let us finish our lines when we want to say something they always turn around and walk away. We called for ice water more than 3 time and never come. I just think we will never come back again, just bad service, very bad service."}
{"text":"Monday to Sunday: 8:30am to 11:30am (S, M ,L) are $2.50 each, SP are $2.88

Monday to Sunday: 11:30am - 4:00pm (S, M, L) are $2.88, SP are $3.28

Holiday: S $2.50, M $2.88, L $3.68, SP $ 4.68

Walking in, it felt like it was nicely decorated, one word to describe this is \"yellow\". The lighting, table cloths and chairs were all covered with yellow. The only thing red was the carpet.

Taking a look at the menu, they didn't have many selections and the prices are mediocre for a dimsum place.

I really enjoyed the portuguese sauce chicken pie. It had a pineapple bun crust and was filled with Chinese styled Portuguese sauce, if only it was a little hotter though. The shell of the tart tasted like the nom flaky egg tart shells. The price for this was $2.98 for three pies.

Then came the rest of the items, the rice wrapped fried dough and rice wrapped beef roll were INCREDIBLY small dishes. I felt like the made a whole roll and only gave us half the portion and another table the other half. There were literally 6 pieces of the rice wrap beef roll and 9 of the rice wrap fritter roll as you can see from my pictures. These were not small items either. The taste was mediocre, nothing too special, as other yelpers point out, probably a three star out of five.

What I really didn't like was the waiter's service at the end. When she handed us the bill, and collected it, she smiled and said, \"No change right?\". EXCUSEME? First thing, I think it'd be best to say, \"Let me come right back with the change\" to let the customer decide how much they want to tip. Secondly it was a 25% tip and my range of tips really vary based on the restaurant and for this one personally, i would tip 10%. To ask, \"Do you need change?\" bothers me as well because you are putting me in an uncomfortable position. Being brutally honest, I usually tip more for the environment and how the waiter phrases things, e.g. returning change.

Lastly, we literally just received a paper $5 bill as our change recently at a bakery and we decided to use it. The same server who said, \"no change right?\" comes back to us and literally without any polite gesture said it was fake straight up cause there were black scratches on it.

Note to you: I JUST went to the bank to verify and deposit it and the bank took it in because IT'S NOT FAKE. 

Food was mediocre, Portuguese sauce chicken pie was delicious, service was horrible."}
{"text":"Mashup of two different times I've been here. 1st time, service was not great (missed half of our order, then were slow getting it into the kitchen, then messed up our order again), and food was average, and sometimes not hot enough. 2nd time was a totally different experience. 2nd time, service was surprisingly good for a Chinese place. Food was also good, and everything came out piping hot.

Highlights:

Some kind of egg with fish innards - A delicacy I'd never heard of, and off menu, but somehow ended up on our table. They crisped up the top so it was more like a frittata. Tasty, but not quite my thing. All the older people at my table enjoyed it. Nostalgic for them. Supposed to be eaten with white pepper. I did put some on my bite. I then proceeded to inhale the white pepper before eating the egg. So much regret.

A rice noodle roll dish with preserved veggies and minced pork. This one is not the roll kind of rice noodle, but the scraped rice noodle kind of roll. I know. It's odd sounding. The preserved veggies on here really make the dish pop. I prefer my rice noodles rolled, but for the taste of this one, I'll let it slide.

Bitter melon and chicken slices on hor fun ($8.99) - This dish was HUGE. It could easily feed two people. It was bitter in a good way, and the chicken pieces had a nice springy bite to them.

Egg tarts - Not the little ones. The big ones. Flakey shell. Yummy custard. 

Funfunfun:

We heard that towards the end of dim sum service, if they have leftover baked items (BBQ pork pastry puffs, egg tarts, etc.), they'll bring them out on a tray and sell each plate for $1. Then, IT HAPPENED! We may have gone a tad crazy. 2 plates of egg tarts (3/plate). 2 of BBQ pork pastry puffs (3/plate). 1 of preserved duck egg pastries (3/plate). 1 of some kind of Shanghai style pancake stuffed with minced meat and veggies (3/plate). Remember. $1/plate. Oh for the love of cheap eats.

Happy full. Very happy full. We'll see if the first visit was an off visit. Will come again."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time. Cause family wanted a new place for dim sum. Decor and table setting etc are mediocre. We were seated at a table that had rips in the table cloth and a red paint stains. Utensils were not all clean, but that's fine we just wiped it. 

They had a checklist order sheet with no underlayer. And I notice there was 2 columns, which I later noticed I clicked the wrong column. One column was for adding an extra, other was just for the main order. After you submit it they print out what you ordered.

My dad always complains tea isn't hot enough. But tea was hot here..and they use a small teapot and pour hot water right at your table.

I was observing the ladies that bring out the food. I'm surprised they don't wheel out a cart. But instead they pile a small round server's plate with food. And the lady can't help to put her bare hands on some food, to keep it from falling.

Food surprisingly all came at once. Which was really great! Presentation for some were nice. Like the Pineapple Chai Siu Baos (Baked Pork Buns with Sweet Crumble on top) and Chong Fun (Steamed Rice Noodles with Fillings) had nice plates. 

We ordered at least 10 items:

Ha Gow (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings) 
Outer layer was a bit thick. But it was regardless, tasty!

Siu Mai (Steamed Pork Dumplings)
Pretty good in flavour, texture, and it was nice and juicy.

Pumpkin Corn Congee
It was ok. A bit grainy but flavour was ok.

Braised Chicken Feet in Red Sauce
Pretty good as well. Just a tad sweeter than I like it.

Chiu Chow Fan Gao (Chiu Chow Steamed Dumplings with Minced Pork, Veggies, & Peanuts) The size is quite big..but it lacked the pork, there was more radish inside. Taste was good though. Nice chewiness of the skin.

Steamed Bean Curd Rolls
Nothing special but wasn't bad either. 

Steamed Shrimp Rice Noodles
They are shorter than other places but they are cut all uniformly the same size and stacked on top of each other. Making the presentation nice and tidy. The soy sauce had its own space on the plate. Texture of the noodles were really smooth. Shrimps were fresh and soo good.

Beef Steamed Rice Noodles
The filling was just the same beef ball filling. But it was still good and so yummy!!

Pineapple Baked Pork Bun
These were so cute and yummy! They were not stingy on the filling. And the top crumble was so good. Bun was spongy and so yummy.

Red Bean Pancakes
This was so so. The skin lack flavour and a bit cardboard like.

Overall, the food was food, service was good. Would come back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Have been craving for dim sum for weeks...
2people weekend lunch around 12pm
8 dim sum for $30
And we were stuffed
I think 5-6 dim sum for two people were enough.

Tho the name is glorious its entrance is nothing like that.... The interior was fine.

I saw some of the reviews that this restaurant isn't very busy but we did have to wait for 15-20 mins to be seated. 

The manager was so busy that our tea didn't come when the food was already on our table.
Seems to be short of staff

The food itself was pretty good. 
1. Egg tart- nothing special
2. Spring roll-crunchy and hot-recommended
3. Stuffed eggplant and tofu- nicely done and hot and crispy-recommended
4. bbq pork pastry-nothing special 
5. Bbq pork rice noodle roll-chunky bbq pork pieces!-recommended 
6. Fried bean curd roll? ????-crispy and hot-recommended
7. Steamed turnip cake - though it says it's ??, it's actually served in a ?- chunky turnip 
8. Fried mushroom and meat bun-???- cold, no mushroom at all and fatty meat, NOT recommended

Overall the food and prices were reasonable. And I don't think there are Places that have special prices after 11am
Here the Small medium large dim sum are 2.88 each after 1130am. 

[graphic!] Although one thing that disturbed me was the seafood in the tank at the entrance..... One eel..... All by itself in a tank..... Seemed to have tumors? Around its tail and its head...... The skin at its chin/gill area was like peeling....So gross I didn't wanna contaminate my phone....."}
{"text":"The food here is decent - our family brought our own fish to have them cook for us. One of the few restaurants that allow customers to bring in their own fish however there is a service fee associated to it. Ordered the Peking Duck and they provided a lot of wraps which I find most restaurants seems to always lack in. Unlike others, service was not as bad however when the food starting to come in all at the same time - they took our soup bowl away when there were still a fair bit left. It was not a busy day so they clearly had space to put the bowl on another table honestly.

I had a chance to try their crab with clear noodles and butter - it was very well crafted and tasty. Overall I wouldn't mind giving this restaurant another chance at the same time I wouldn't say that they have a particular specialty to mention as well."}
{"text":"Was here for last minute Chinese New Year Dinner. This place never really have lines and the tables are big. The staff is nice here. As for the food, it's ok considering we don't want to wait at other restaurants. It's good for big groups. There were a few combos ranging from $68 to $198. We opted for the $198 combo which includes 6 dishes ( soup, veggies, suckling pig with jelly fish, 2.5lb lobster, half chicken & a veggie goose dish) 

In comparison to Landmark Restaurant (my previous review) this place is better value and service. If you have a big group and don't want to wait for a table, you can check out this place for dinner!"}
{"text":"Standard dim sum place. It never reached full capacity even right before 11:30am which is their early bird special. So if you want dim sum and don't want to line up or wait then this is the one to visit. 

Nothing really stood out above the rest and some dishes were a complete fail for me. Refer to my pictures that a label as fail. 

Service was very efficient. The place is nice and clean. They just need some special items on the menu that actually taste good to attract more customers.

Closer to a 2.5 for me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite dim sum places. The portions are good and their flavours are excellent. If you come before 11:30 or on weekdays it is reasonably priced.

Staff: Their staff is very nice but quite forgetful. On my family's recent visit, we ordered a small dish of hot sauce for dipping and it took a couple reminders before we got it. Otherwise, they're acceptable.

Ambience: After the recent changes, they now boast a completely open concept dining area. There is one raised stage area that can be used for events. We actually had one of those tables during dim sum and I accidentally took one too many steps backwards but I made an impressive and graceful save which I deserve an Olympic medal (sport TBD). Other than the layout, the rest is good too.

Food: My favourite is fish is their BBQ Pork Pineapple Buns. They're so meaty, sweet, and delicious. They're Siu Mai is also pretty big in terms of meat. Their Beef Rice Rolls were soft and tasty too. Two thumbs up for food!

Everything tasted great and love coming back each time."}
{"text":"Crowded on a weekday lunch time. Some of the customers are frequent visitors. Everything is reasonably price for everyday folks, and good price for the food that you are ordering. Definitely not the most high end place for delicacy, but convenient for  quick lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty standard dimsum place. Service was a bit slow in the beginning and some of our dishes came out all at once so we didn't have much room on our table, but that wasn't a big deal as we ate pretty quickly. Food itself was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I did however really enjoy their squid, shrimp rice noodle roll (cheong fun), and the shrimp dumplings (ha gao)! It wasn't too packed or busy during lunch/around a Sunday."}
{"text":"The food here is not bad. Service was not as bad as mentioned by others Yelpers. I can see that there could be an opportunity for attitude and rudeness, after all we don't goto a Chinese restaurant for its service. Quality of food is fairly good and the price is fair. Thy have a Peking Duck special for $14 which I would highly recommend. I would recommend this to others if there not picky about ultimate service experience."}
{"text":"Came here today and we got a table in the middle of the room. We could feel cold wind coming from a vent above. When we mentioned it, they acknowledged the wind but did nothing. The food was good but became cold quickly because of the cold air. Will come again but I hope they have better control of the drafts in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Just came out from emergency room of Scarborough Grace Hospital.  My sister went to have dinner with her boyfriend's family on Sunday.  Today Tuesday from the morning, they all vomit in different degree due to food poisoning.  After 2 packs of saline water dispersion in the hos,Moshe's much better now."}
{"text":"Our party of eight had dinner here tonight and we thought it was excellent food at a reasonable price, prepared quickly and plated attractively. Yes, the service is not 5 star as noted in some other reviews but when everything else is factored in, it didn't matter to me if the servers forgot about us now and then. Just flag them down and they will help you. The place was full and busy and so they were understandably busy too. We all enjoyed the food. Each dish was generously portioned. The final bill was less than $100 for 5 adults and 3 children. We will return."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum this past Saturday around 1pm. Restaurant was about half full. We were seated quickly and service was generally ok (in generic Chinese restaurant service standards). A special mention should be made for one of the waiters. He's an older gentleman but he was very friendly, hard-working, and was quick to bring anything you requested. 

Weekdays from 9-11:30am, it's $2.18 & after 11:30am, it's $2.88 for s,m,l 
Weekends from 9-11:30am, it's $2.50 & after 11:30am is $2.88 for s.m.l. SP dim sums are $3.28.

My favourite item that we ordered was the milk custard with ginger sauce (55). It's dessert so what's not to like, right? It has a slightly weird jello-like consistency but it's just the right amount of sweetness so I enjoyed it. :)

I did notice that their menu hosts some unique dim sums that I haven't seen elsewhere. We ordered the duck liver rice roll (50) to try and we basically left it untouched. I will admit I've had my fair share of innards from chickens and ducks but the taste and texture of the duck liver was weird and made my boyfriend and I feel a little sick to our stomaches upon our first bites. Definitely don't recommend this! 

As for everything else we ordered (see pictures), they were alright. This restaurant also has some lunch combos that you can order alongside your dim sum, which is nice. Will probably return with more people to give one of those lunch specials a shot because you get quite a bit of food for $30."}
{"text":"Grand Opening Special 10% discount on Weekday. Early Bird Dim Sum before 11:30 am at 2.50 for S/M/L and $2.88 from 11:30 pm to 4:00 pm. Price point though a little more than the previous business but still not bad.

The interior now has a more open feel since they took down the partitions and the dividers which dated back to their Swiss Chalet era. (this used to be a Swiss Chalet!)

Dim Sum selection is decent and the items we ordered were well prepared. Nothing really outstanding but this is like a regular neighbourhood place that one might frequent. 

Service is rough on the edge. Servers were all nice but just dumping orders on tables with sauce splitting all over the place seemed to be the norm... Not a place to impress your oversea guests or your future in laws."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on Saturday morning, 10:30AM. 

My dad came here for dinner and thought it was decent, so we thought to try it out for lunch/dim sum. 

First thing we did was come in and get a spot. Took around 5 minutes to find someone to mark down a table for us.. while she was doing so, absolutely no eye contact. 

The main server gave us the private room, which had about 3 tables in it. One of which was used by a worker eating her breakfast. The table was very small to accommodate 4 people - especially for dim sum. 

While being seated, the servers aggressively put down our plates. He held about 7 people's worth of cups and plates and dropped them all at our table - ended up rolling around making us catch it for him before it drops on the floor. While he assembled the plates for us, he'd throw everything on our table. Some plates were actually fairly dirty... 
 
They have a lady walking around adding water to your teapots. I would like to complain about the teapots, they were so damn hard to pour tea... slowest pot ever! 

Let's get to food shall we, dim sum before 11 on a weekend is around $2.60, some special items can range to $4.00 so be careful. They also have lunch specials.. 
food came out relatively fast... that's because some of it comes out cold, great (ready for that stomach pain)! 
The food wasn't anything special, if anything, it is much worse than other restaurants in the area... i.e. Hard rice, sour meat, cold dishes. 

Overall, I will probably not come back."}
