{"text":"I highly recommend this cafe/hookah lounge! I came in for a cup of authentic Java and end up staying for hours, best hookah in town!  The ambience is perfect :-) Mediterranean music is awesome :-)) staff is so hospitable...A great place to order a cappuccino, authentic pastries, they have the best hookah! It's a sheek spacious lounge with plenty of tables and leather comfy couches AND I got to connect to free-wifi all at once!  I sure will tell my friends!  And did I mention service!  I give this place a thumbs up"}
{"text":"This could be a great place to come smoke hookah if they added a little more improvement. First of all from the outside the place looks closed, they need to add a bigger and brighter sign nobody knows about this place because there's no advertisement. And the place is so boring with their old people music , when I asked the waitress to change the music she said she had no problem changing the music so she put on a song I asked her to put on then a minute later some old guy came inside talking on his cell phone and yelled at her to turn it off , I heard her trying to explain a customer requested it and the guy was just shouting while still on the phone smoking a cigarette seemed like he didn't speak much English but the guy changed the music back to the boring music which was a bummer. The manager should consider being more open to American music it would bring more customers because I've invited a few friends to the lounge and they all say the place is boring and full of old people it was like hanging out at a library, you need to add some young hip people to the scene. We loved the hookah though Chris made me a special mix flavor best I've ever tried, that's one thing that's a plus about the place no doubt. The service could be a little more organized for sure. Some days I can get good service and some days it's shit for example on a couple occasions I would order tea (really good tea btw) or coffee I would have to wait for a ridiculous amount of time before I received it, the guy would completely forget that I ordered drinks , sometimes I wouldn't even receive my tea until the girl server would come in. After a couple of times of this happening I would only come to the lounge after 8pm when the girl would work, the only way I could get a decent sandwich or hospitality is when she worked. Unbelievable I order a sandwich from the guy and he says he doesn't know how to make it and the girl isn't working and asks me if I want to order something else , I order a smoothie, doesn't know how to make that either, asks him if he can make a cappuccino; what a surprise he doesn't know how to make that either . So I just said forget it , so don't order anything from the guy because you won't get it or if you do it'll be an hour later. I'm not really sure how you work somewhere and don't know how to make 90% of the menu. Don't get me wrong I like coming to Lava Cafe Hookah Lounge just wish it was more hip like New Moon Hookah Lounge or Jabbars Hookah Lounge. Just change it up once in awhile"}
{"text":"This place is great. The music is nice not  too loud. The lighting and decor is great. Nice hookah flavors and they make lattes and cappuccinos which is pretty cool. Love this place. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Not exactly sure why this place is rated as high as it is...except that it seemed like they cater to their friends better than their new customers ( perhaps a lot of these good reviews are from their friends). I also read in the reviews that they had apples to smoke from, but the guy at the counter said they did not. I asked for a menu and they didn't have one...they gave us 1 mouth piece and when i asked for 2 additional he told me that the hose was new and the mouth piece was more for decoration. I said that's great that it's new but id like 2 more mouth pieces...I didnt exactly want to share spit with my friends. They did check up on us frequently which was nice. I also did not like how the big couch on the patio had a reserved sign and 3 people showed up to use it...they also had a fan blasting directly at us and didn't have music for like 2 solid hours. It was okay, but not the kind of ambience I like when I smoke hookah."}
{"text":"I love this place. The classiest and most chill environment. A place you can actually have a conversation at and relax... without extremely loud music and flashing lights everywhere. All the other hookah places in Phoenix are trashy and annoying and filled with chaos. This place is clean, actually has a cafe and a great seating arrangement. It's like 45 min away from me, but worth it"}
{"text":"Yesterday Halloween party was amazing ,you know how to party ! 
Food is great and good hookah . Good job !"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite chill spot. They have a nice space interior with comfortable seating. On the patio they have very comfortable couches. They have wifi so you can come read a book or your laptop. In the evening they turn on musters and fans on the patio so it's nice and cool. The staff is very friendly and accommodating especially Jasmine! They also serve sandwiches and drinks, and you can bring your own food. There is a nice middle eastern restaurant right next door with delicious food! They also have punch cards for the hookah, 7th one is free!"}
{"text":"This is one of the more beautiful hookah lounges in the valley, leather couches, nice finishes, marble tables, classic high-quality boardgames like backgammon and chess (and they also have cards). I just came in for a Turkish coffee and it was done right, very strong and not burnt! 

They also have hookah and traditional Middle Eastern sweets like knafeh. I saw some people studying since it's very close to MCC, but there were also dates here and friends hanging out. I loved how the owner was sitting down with a friend playing backgammon on a nice board. There is also a patio if you need one. And they play traditional Middle Eastern music which added to the authentic atmosphere.

My only complaint is that they don't have dancing/a club feel on weekend nights like a lot of the hookah lounges in the valley do. But otherwise, a solid Middle Eastern cafe and hookah lounge!"}
{"text":"Favorite hookah place in town at the moment. Staff is very pleasant. The hookah is clean and smooth!"}
{"text":"Hookah Lounge with indoor and outdoor seating. It was very clean and spacious, not crowded like some hookah lounges. Yhe music played at a comfortable level.  The couches were big and comfy. It smelled nice. They make lattes and have snacks, they are new, so no menu yet."}
{"text":"A great place to visit and having a good time. It's chill, the double apple hookah is great. The knafa was delicious also the overall of the place decoration is amazing. I would recommend it. Good prices though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cafes to come to! Best hookah, drinks, food and service! Chris is one of the nicest guys and our favorite FAVORITE employee he takes care of the entire lounge and all it's customers. Make sure to check it out you truly will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"my first time in here, and im already in love with this place lol.
7abeet their Konafa the most!"}
{"text":"I had an interesting and unique experience. Here's the breakdown: 

Hookah flavors & variety & quality-- there were quite a few hookah flavors--we tried double apple which was pretty good. I think they use the Al-Fakher and Starbuz brands. 

Atmosphere- lots of comfy seating w/o too much crowding. Overall chill vibe. Solid contemporary music. There's also outdoor patio seating 

Service- our server was really attentive. He was quite the character and kept us laughing the whole time.

Other- There were no menus available or defined prices but everything was decently priced. $16 a head. Also had some tea here. Everything was overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to stop in and hang out, coffee and tea bar is excellent with some unique snacks.  Great place to stop after dinner next store at Green Corner and relax.  Owner is really nice and passionate about his cafe!  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My fav place so clean and very chill and quit the customary service is amazing ! Love this place"}
