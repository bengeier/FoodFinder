{"text":"Quality of food is sub par. We wanted to see the farm animals, which was also a reason we chose this location, but there were not."}
{"text":"Your typical sugar huge volume shack. Nothing outstanding except for the time we waited before being seated. The utensils and plates were not properly cleaned. Toilets were iffy also. Food and service were ok. It's unfortunate because it's a great place for kids. They have a little farm with a lot of animals, a playground, sleigh ride and a little train."}
{"text":"Cabane a Sucre is an amazing thing to celebrate.

 Beginning of Springtime means Cabane a Sucre or Sugar Shack time.

 The sap collected by the Maple Trees is boiled down to beautiful Maple Syrup. 
Boiled down some more and the maple syrup becomes amazing Tire=Toffee in English, and yes it's sweet! Boil the toffee more and you get Maple Butter.

All the beautiful chemistry of Love( maple sap) that comes out of the Maple tree are made in ideal conditions of Cold nights and Warm days , Quebec is great for the Cold part.

I was excited to go this year. The drive through the scenic office buildings to get to Bouvrette was different, then all of a sudden a barn starts to emerge. 

 They have a separate room where you purchase the meal tickets, then proceed to be seated in one of the dining rooms.  Our waitress seemed to have been overworked or tired, they do this Cabane a sucre Breakfast all day long from when the 'season' starts until there's no more snow and sugar left!

They used to play Traditional Quebecois music but the waitress said the majority complains so it was some random Radio station, I was disappointed.

 The food is brought out Family style and you have to serve yourself.  Pea Soup in a Large red Pot was good, not rich creamy tasty, and not Hot, Warm soup.
   The oreilles de criss or in English translates into Christ's Ears which happens to be Pigs Ears and Pork Rinds. Those were good crunchy and salty and delicious.

  They also brought out a plate with Sliced Ham and it looked straight out of a package, I passed it was nothing special.  The Baked Beans came in a Huge bowl with a tiny bit of Beans at the bottom, we had to ask the best waitress for more.
We got a smaller bowl with even less Beans, they are very stingy with food here and this is an All You Can Eat, you would think they're be generous plating the food for a Table of 8 ? Lots of asking for food here..

 A guy comes around with a Big Fluffy Omelette. That was good just fluffy light, tasteless so it soaks up Maple Syrup and tastes delish! You have to wait until he comes around to your table again to cut the omelette on your plate. 

Our waitress managed to forget to bring us a few things off the menu, after I asked she brought out the mini Hot Dogs (supposed to be in Maple Syrup, barely) and coleslaw at the end. 

The waitress had a tray full of tiny cut desserts on plastic plates for us to choose between crepes or Maple Pie.  I tried the crepe I thought it was good with Maple Syrup of course.  The Maple pie was generic and nothing special.. Seems like a trend for this Cabane a Sucre.

With the meal you get a ticket for Maple Tire (toffee) on the snow. This is what the Sugar Shack is About!!!!  They boil down the sap in the shack.
   The guys here let you have as many sticks as you want, I was watching it seems most tolerant people can handle 6 Popsicle sticks full of sweet gooey toffee before getting Sugar Sick.
 
Time to burn off those sugar calories
 
There's a double horse drawn carrage for a 'sleigh ride' and the driver has a pet bunny to keep the passengers entertained.
  
 There are a couple barns behind the building with Farm animals, the Ducks, Chickens and my fav Liama, Donkey were fun to watch and you can feed them corn and feed.  I feel bad for the animals, I hate that I don't think they're very happy.

Was a fun time, I doubt I'm coming back. They're  stingy with the food, the service isn't friendly, it was a Birthday at my table and not a word. The Maple Products were delicious it's hard to mess that up!"}
{"text":"My year revolves around two \"holidays\": Halloween and the yearly Sugar Shack visit. It's always a bit tricky to explain the attraction of a Sugar Shack to a non-Canadian, but to me nothing's more comforting than dining with loads of strangers in a typical rural decor and busting my calorie limit with maple syrup. Bouvrette is, in my opinion the best place to do so. The setting is pleasantly rural (think log walls, checkered table cloth, an exhibition of old agricultural artifacts and plenty of Canadiens vs Nordiques posters). The place used to be a racing track and some trophies and cool Black&White pictures remains, as well as pics from the time Celine Dion celebrated her birthday at the place. Yep, now that's a place with history!
But we all go there to pig out, and Bouvrette has one of the most extensive menus I have seen. You just don't get to choose, they sit you, and they bring it ALL out: pea soup, 5-inches high omelet, oreilles de criss, coleslaw, little cocktail sausages pickled in maple syrup, ham, roasted potatoes, and beans. And then you get to choose between the desserts: crepes or maple pie. Needless to say, you can ask for as many refills as you want!
But you probably want some more, in which case you could head out to the cabin where they sell maple syrup on ice (tire in french, pronounced \"teer\"), the price being included in your diner reservation. Hmmm. If you need a stroll, you could go see all the cute little animals.. Awwww baby goats! and hens, rabbits, chickens, roosters and donkeys. Your whole Easter farm is here! If you have kids, they'll love taking a ride on the little train that surround the property, or maybe in the horse-drawn carriage!"}
{"text":"OK le décor est charmant, typiquement cabane à sucre, mais 3h d'attente pour s'assoir et manger, sous pression, c'est pas fort!!! Le personel (sauf notre serveuse, qui était très gentille), est sans classe, ni sourire et bouffe ordinaire sans plus. Nous avons presque dû nous battre pour avoir des oeuf dans le sirop. La serveuse nous a même dit: \"jvais me faire arracher la tête d'en demander 8!\" 

Ça ne vaut pas le détour, Il y en a de bien meilleures!!"}
