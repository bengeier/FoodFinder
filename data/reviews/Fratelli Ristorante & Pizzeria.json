{"text":"We ate there tonight and have had dinner at Fratelli's at least 25 times. The hostess and waitresses are always polite but sometimes very slow. Tonight the restaurant wasn't very full but service was too slow. Really, my only complaint is when we have to eat inside instead of outside. The restaurant is EXTREMELY LOUD inside. It drives is crazy. Still, we go back. We think the food and wine are excellent and very reasonably priced. This is not a pizza parlor; it's an Italian restaurant that sells pizza. Don't expect white linen tablecloths but McDonald's prices."}
{"text":"A moderate Italian restaurants serving decent Italian in the Fort Mill area. Pizza options are very overpriced, especially for simple speciality pizzas (Margherita) and cost per additional toppings on others. Service was just mediocre. Limited outside seating."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! I am very shocked and disappointed that customer service even exists at a \"restaurant\" like this. Yesterday evening, my boyfriend and I ordered a meal to go shortly before closing. We PAID for extra shrimp as well and extra meat balls with our meal. Got to the restaurant to pick up the food, got home and opened the food and received ZERO shrimp and ZERO meat balls. The calamari we got was old and the salad did not have Parmesan cheese as we requested. I was livid! I could not call back until the next day as the place was closed. I called and spoke with a really nice young boy who said our meal would be replaced and compensated for as I informed them that I had pictures of what we bought and the receipt and I was told to come back in the evening to pick up. I was taking a nice long nap and was awakened by my phone ringing. I answered and it was a very rude man I think his name was Jim who instead of apologizing decides to argue with me and make it seem like an effing liar instead of fixing the issue and talking to the staff that gave us a completely messed up order! I am DISGUSTED! Places like this don't deserve loyal customers! I like to spend my money where we are appreciated!!! This place needs to do better and as my family are residents of Baxter village I will be sure to spread the news like wild fire! I feel very very mistreated!"}
{"text":"Used to love here until the service became crap! Was seated by the hostess and she stood around so we asked for drinks. \"The servers wear black, I'm wearing pink *blink* *stare* I mean I could still get your drinks\" so before I thought to apologize and explain myself, forget it I'll wait for the server.   Then the soup was cold. Took forever for our food when we were the only 5 people in the entire restaurant. Meanwhile the hostess chatted about hobbies with the other server girl la Di Dah. I can't come back"}
{"text":"Love Fratelli's! Wife and I had a good time there once again. Food, service and ambiance excellent. Always have my wife's favorite wine and super cold draft beer. Great to sit at a little two top by the window and watch people walk by. Very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Love Fratelli's!  My late husband and I would regularly have our date nights here. Fra Diavolo with Shrimp my absolute favorite. The offer wine dinners quarterly, pairing the fabulous creations of Chef Mandy with a selection of wines. A great way to try new flavors of food and wine. For you new comers don't take my seat LOL. Joe, the owner, is awesome very helpful with wine selections if you're not too sure of what to pair with dinner.  He's never stirred me in the wrong direction. Try it when you're in the mood for some Great Italian or just a slice of pizza & you can even watch them create your master piece."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  Baxter Village self-proclamations of high end and quality did NOT occur at Fratelli's.  As other mentioned, overpriced for the clearly frozen pasta dishes (Lasagna, for example) that are served cold in the middle. After bringing this to the attention to our server, it was totally unacceptable that his response was, \"you're the second person tonight mentioning this...our apologies.\"  If it happens once, correct it. Twice in one dinner service that evening? Fire the \"chef.\" However, the fact the center of my block of lasagna ($12) was cold, revealed that this \"authentic\" Italian eatery is nothing more than \"out of a box Italian\".  Thank God (there was a microwave available to apparently reheat the frozen slab) for re-serving fully hot and melty 10 minutes later.  The lasagna was ok in the end, but didn't taste any better than Michael Angelo's frozen lasagna! But, when I microwave my Michael Angelos, it isn't served ice cold in the middle."}
{"text":"I love the Hawaiian Pizza at Fratelli's!  But the service (eat in and take out) are not so great.   For what you get, the prices are way too high."}
{"text":"Best marinara sauce I have ever tasted. Linguine was cooked perfectly. Great meal, excellent service."}
{"text":"I like this place but I have had a couple bad delivery experiences. I would love to give 5 stars if the staff was on point. I figured they would be better considering the fact of 60+ dollars for three dinner items and a piece of cake. I called three times to fix order and they still did not complete my order. Cooked perfect what I did get."}
{"text":"I just paid $26.00 for a terrible pizza and had to wait about an hour for it!    But wait it gets worst, the first time I dialed the number to order the phone rang for about 10 minutes without being answered so I hung up.  The second time it rang for about 5 minutes and was finally answered by a not so cordial person.  I ordered the pizza and was told it would be ready in 35 minutes. When I walked in to pick it up 30 minutes later, I was told it would be a few minutes more, the were very busy, it took about another 15 minutes before I finally got my 'Specialty' way overpriced pizza. It was not worth the money or the wait.    By the way this is not my first time there, I have been on several previous occasions,  each time saying I would not go back.  They are overpriced, under portioned and not very hospitable.  They will not get another dime of my money.  This place deserves no stars."}
{"text":"I thought from some of the reviews this place would be horrible. We went here because we had a coupon and were very pleased!. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The raVioli and fettuccini Alfredo were exCellent. The only coMplaint I would have it's that they do not serve a pizza for one person, only 14 inch and bigger. We definitely willv come back when we ate in the mood for Italian. Also the atmosphere and lighting had a great romantic feel. It would be a great place for a date Night."}
{"text":"Dinner recently my wife and I with friends. We are not from this area and they suggested Fratelli's. Very pleasant setting outside in alleyway. Attentive and very nice staff and service. Food very good. Could have been excellent except for - get this - the chef leaves off capers on veal piccata dinners , two. When we let the server know the chef was not that concerned offered a side if capers . Should have comped something. Will give them another try. Report later"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the prices for the Italian specials were crazy high for nothing special.  The ambiance is lacking, and the service was terrible.  Our waiter didn't even care that the wrong sauce came on our chicken parm...  He didn't even offer to correct it.  Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Has the eggplant Parmesan and ordered a medium sized Pizza. Excellent food very often take and tasty. You could taste the authenticity in the sauce cheese and how food was prepared. Definitely worthy of going again"}
{"text":"Overrated. Both food and service were wanting- there are several superior choices for Italian fare or pizza in Ft. Mill/Tega Cay."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today at lunch. Pizza slices were good and mozz sticks were better than most places.  Menu is a bit pricey for what they served. The appetizer was $9.  All in all not a bad experience.  I have no comment however on the Quality of their wine pouring but I recon if you count your ounces of wine in each glass you probably need to be at a \"high end, classy establishment\" not a small italian restaurant where the average menu item cost $13."}
{"text":"Ben Q  We dine at Fratellis several times a month. It is consistently excellent. Their pasta is superb. The sauce flavors are light and delicious rather than over powering. The atmosphere is quietly sophisticated yet very family friendly. We cannot speak highly enough about the service."}
{"text":"Very good Italian!!!  Service was good, funny thing that they didn't know what a \"hero\" is.. They referred to it as a hoagie! Cool! Would defiantly come again!!"}
{"text":"Ate there once and was truly disappointed. I ordered the Alfredo pasta that was close to 15$ or around that general range to go. It came back and when i took it home there was no chicken. I realized that it was an extra 3$ up charge that was a protein. They should have at least told me when I was sitting there with the rest of my friends. The wait staff is friendly. They could clean up the place but overall it was way overpriced and could do some renovating."}
{"text":"Visited Fratelli's last night as a pre-Valentine's meal with my wife and two daughters. First thing first...ordered Lemonade for my daughters to drink, and they ran out. I'm not sure how you can run out of lemonade on a weekend, especially from a fountain dispenser. Oh well, just some water I guess. I then asked for some info on the tap beer selection. The server didn't have any idea about what was what, so he had to go check. After checking, he restated what he was told, and any selection I picked, they were out also. I finally settled on a Stella after trying to get 4 other beers. My biggest frustration was that the server had to go and ask after each request, so I felt like I should have just walked up to the bar to get first hand answers. It took way longer than it needed to, and he probably should have just told me the 4 or 5 beers that they actually did have.   The bread was ok, and the Pizza was good, but the dining experience was horrible. I would not recommend dining in if you go here...just call for take out, and you will have a much better experience."}
{"text":"SO close to stripping another star off this place...and it's a shame, because I really like their pasta side of the menu, and it's really close to my house!  Went in here for dinner this past weekend, and ordered a glass of wine.  The first drink I ordered, I got a half pour.  I'm talking like, LITERALLY three ounces.  OK, I was annoyed, but maybe the bartender was in a rush.  Second time, same thing!  Rediculous.  I brought it to our waiters attention, and he blamed it on the \"big glasses\"...um, I took three sips and the glass was gone.  I know you don't fill a redwine glass to the top, but come on....six ounces is a proper wine pour.  You fill the glass to the very point where the bell breaks.  I got three, three and a half ounces at most both times.    This place is getting dangerously close to pricing itself out of the competition for the value you get."}
{"text":"I ate at Fratelli's on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. It was very quiet, but the service and food were excellent. I ate the chicken piccata which was the perfect portion size and very tasty. My lunch date had the meatball sub which was also very good. The prices were excellent, I will definitely be returning to Fratelli's in the future!"}
{"text":"I have had several meals here and it never has even remotely impressed me. The food is poor - the service sub par and unless your group has the right demographic look to fit Baxter the staff is quite rude."}
{"text":"Only my third time visiting but feels like we've been going there for years.  Again, I ordered my favorite appetizer (not a menu item) prepared enthusiastically by their expert chef.  As in previous visits, the mussels in white wine and garlic were again AWESOME!  From the owner, to the chef, to the bartenders and servers, we are continuously treated well whenever we stop by this neighborhood establishment.  Stop in soon and create your own culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Really nice Italian food in the heart of Baxter Village! We had a wonderful lunch here with fantastic service from Kyle our waiter. Ordered the Chicken Piccata and it was really gooooood! Wonderful to sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine and watch the passerby's!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"We had given up on Fratelli's because the prices just became too high but then after hearing the same TV ads over and over about their new lower prices we gave it another shot. The ads say dinners for $10 and believe me, there is nothing on their dinner menu for that price. A simple chicken dish served over pasta was $19.99. It was good but it wasn't worth the money. The place was empty which is a shame. If they truly lower their prices, as they claim in their (false) advertising, perhaps they would once again get the good crowds they once had. Fratelli's, please take note and make some changes before your name is a distant memory."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. We have eaten many times here and also catered from them. My favorite dish is the chicken parm. My wife's favorite is pasta with clams."}
{"text":"I found this to be very close to real NY Italian. It's one of my favorite places to eat in Baxter."}
{"text":"This had to be the most overpriced, under quality pizza we've ever had, which was surprising considering the location. We ordered a large, half cheese and half with toppings. Each side was supposed to have 4 slices, but our side with toppings only had toppings on 3 slices. The crust was literally paper thin and the cheese was very sparse. We're used to ordering thin New York style pizza but this was so much thinner, and underwhelming.  The toppings were sparse as well. So now that you know how bad the quality was, here is the price: $27. For a large pizza that was the BARE MINIMUM to be considered a pizza. The quality was awful and the price was ridiculous. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible. I got Spaghetti Bolognese as a carry out order. I had to wait at the front awkwardly until I finally got someone's attention. There was only ONE family in the whole restaurant. Not to mention the boy taking out the pizza was staring at me the whole time without saying anything to me or getting someone. The dish was 17$ and it was the saltiest thing I have ever tasted. The \"famous\" bread was....unremarkable to say the least as well. I have never written a review for a restaurant in my life, but felt compelled to write this one. Get a can of Spaghettios and some crackers for dinner instead. You will be more pleased."}
{"text":"First Italian food since moving from California. Loved it! I had the baked ziti with sausage, Char had eggplant parm with capellini. We definitely will come back, can't wait to try the meatball sub, I have a childhood standard I measure by and still looking for something like it. If the red sauce on the baked ziti is any indication, I have found it!"}
{"text":"I had veal Marsala which cost me $27. The veal was so tough that I had to cut it with a knife.  The pasta tasted like store bought cheap pasta. The gravy tasted like package brown gravy with a dash of Marsala.  I was very disappointed and my Money was wasted.  Although the bread was delicious and the waitress was nice,  I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"The food os pretty good Italian fare but the portion sizes are small and the prices are HIGH! I really wish I could recommend the place, but you need to take out a loan to eat there, especially for dinner."}
{"text":"O"}
{"text":"Love this little Italian delight. Great food and Great service. The staff is always friendly. We really enjoy outside dining on the covered patio. Plus, the best lunch specials around Baxter Village.   find them on twitter @fratellibaxter :)"}
{"text":"This was okay Italian food. Went here on a date. Wine selection was good. I thought many of the items on the menu were crazy overpriced. For instance the standard pasta fare was reasonable but then other times like piccata etc were almost twice the price.  I had the manicotti which was very good a solid 4 stars and my date said his lasagna was excellent.  The service was ok until check time where we waited quite a long time for the check. My main issue with the place is that it doesn't seem to have an identity. Either be an upscale Italian eatery and class it up or be a family Italian restaurant. It's very weird to have $10 manicotti and then $22 entrees that are pretty standard Italian fare. A lot of people go for the pizza and there were quite a few families there while we were there enjoying pizza.  Again... This was odd as the ambiance is more romantic upscale- darkly lit, candles on tables, waiters in white shirts ties and black aprons. Just needs an identity and then the food quality and prices to match."}
{"text":"Allison, the waitress, was awesome! The food was bad. It tasted like oil was looted over the angel hair. And it looked like the restaurant was run by a bunch of young boys that didn't know how to manage inventory. If it wasn't for the company I would have lost it."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Our server was very attentive and thoroughly explained the specials and other entrees. The house-made balsamic vinaigrette was great. I had the special, the chicken pizziola-- chicken breasts with pomodoro sauce and capers. It was delicious. It was a very large serving and I ended up taking most of it home with me. I had only been to Fratelli's one other time--a year ago--and at that time I had pizza. They did a great job with pizza, too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is OK. That, however, is the best one can gather when reviewing Fratellis: it's just OK. The is just OK. Not horrible, but not great.   Walk one more block to Six Pence, or go across the street to Lui Lui's. You'll be better off."}
{"text":"We received a Groupon for a gift so we went again.  The prices are still ridiculously high for what you get and the quality of it."}
{"text":"My family and my friends love Fratelli's. we are from NJ/NY and it is the closest spot to us that even comes close to good pizza. We don't do chain restaurant pizza so we were thrilled when we moved to Baxter that we had such good pizza so close to home.   The service is always pleasant and they remember you when you return. We love that about this place. We dine there or get take out once a week. Love it."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer and wine selections, some reviews are comparing the pizza prices to chain pizza, there's a huge difference in the size and quality of why your getting here not to mention they use real cheese.  Right there in my top 10 restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is very good and servers try to please. This was our 3rd visit and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night. The creamy dill sauce was fantastic with the salmon. Chicken parm was excellent. Tiramisu was nice way to top it off. Nice atmosphere and the waitress was very friendly and kept drinks filled. She provided great service to us. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality Italian food! The portion size is perfect and the service was great. We have tried a gourmet pizza, chicken parmigiana, eggplant parmigiana, and chicken marsala. Every bite was fresh and delicious. If you're looking for a taste of Italy and a great atmosphere this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but food was definitely not tasty. The pasta sauces all tasted as if they came out of a store bought can. Most of the dishes were all sauce with very little meat. The chicken was dry. And for the food quality it was a pricey meal."}
{"text":"Fratelli Ristorante is a small friendly restaurant in Baxter Village. The service was fine and food was good, but very overpriced. Spaghetti with meat sauce and a cup of soup is over $20. I could make something similar at home for less that $5. My wife's Fettuccine Alfredo was over $20, because she added two relatively small meatballs. This is Disney World pricing without the ambiance of Disney World.  Dinner for three was $80, and we had no drinks, appetizers or desserts!  It was almost $5 for a Caesar salad (small dinner plate) that you could get out of a package at Publix for a family-sized salad for about $3.  I'm not sure I'll be back any time soon. There are too many other restaurants that are better and less expensive."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Stood in the middle of the dining room at 7:30 on a Tuesday in the middle of a slow dinner rush and they can't figure out seating for 10 minutes.  waitress comes over and asks for our drink order.  Me: what beers do you have on tap  Waitress: umm i don't know...I don't drink beer so...  I guess there is no beer list...   Bread delivered to the table with no plates, no butter, no silverware... had to ask for plates or I guess we can just eat off the table.   Salad and food arrived and we were maybe checked on once by the waitress and had to ask someone else for extra dressing.    Overall the food was ok but I don't think I'll be returning   I don't know if the server was new or just unmotivated, but this is certainly an undesirable customer service experience I hope they improve on!"}
{"text":"I genuinely do not know how this place stays in business. I've lived in the area for nearly 10 years and only went because someone had given me a gift certificate. The prices are ridiculously high! I got a small side salad for around $5 and it was about 2 bites worth. The pizza is nothing special. In fact, I picked it up and by the time I got home (just a few blocks away), it was already cold. And I know it was \"fresh\" because I was there waiting for it to finish up for quite a while. It was a Saturday night and it was about empty. Again, I cannot figure out how this place has stuck around for so many years. Save your time, go across the road to Empire Pizza!"}
{"text":"Just like everyone else said, it is okay. The chicken Alfredo was decent.  The menu said the sauce was homemade and it didn't taste like it. The lasagna was decent. The tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  Our waitress left us numerous times to talk to a guy outside the restaurant. This wasn't not a great 1st impression an I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Server was great. But that was pretty much it.  Came on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded at all. We ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana , Spaghettini Vongole and Calzone.  Eggplant was okay. Calzone was okay. Basically for the price point I'll just head to Olive Garden or something.   The Vongole was just a disaster. It was soooo salty. And I mean salty to the point I couldn't even eat it. Salty that if you had some kidney issues, you'll have edema after. Salty that if you had Meniere's Disease, you would hear clanging cymbals in your ear.   Also, you really can't call a place fancy if 1) No spoon is served with your order of spaghetti and 2) If your Parmesan cheese is in a dollar-store glass container filled with processed Parmesan (even Olive Garden provides freshly grated ones).  Was disappointed and will most likely not return."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy my time at Fratellis and today was no different. I love the lasagna (they make it fresh!) and the blackened salmon on Cesar salad is awesome.  I'm sad to see the dining room somewhat empty most of the time as I really like this place.   try the veal, salmon, or Hawaiian pizza (my absolute favorite!) they make it with their homemade Alfredo sauce. the only place I know of around that does that without it being a 'special order'.   I will definitely keep visiting and I hope to see more people there next time."}
{"text":"Company Christmas Party night.  We reserved spaces for our company which was about 55 - 60 people on a normal weeknight and they probably should have closed the place to the public or at least put a sign up that there was a large group inside because I really felt bad for the customers that weren't in our party.  We had tables setup with appetizers to start.  Chicken Fingers and Mozz Stocks straight off the Sysco truck.  They weren't terrible but to call them Meh is a stretch.  We had a choice of 4 or 5 Entrees.  I had the Chicken Parm which is pretty standard.  It was an edible chicken breast with ok tomato sauce and melted cheese on top.  They brought out the entrees in waves meaning they chicken parm came out first then after about 10 minutes the eggplant etc...which was weird since nobody ate together.  I understand it was a large group so they did what they had to.  The bar was a hot mess all night.  Drinks took forever and when they came out anything \"mixed\" wasn't done right.  Sweetie had a grapefruit martini that had so much simple syrup she had to request extra grapefruit juice to dial it down some.  With a big group that was drinking as much as we were we would have appreciated experienced bartenders.  They also had 3 \"hostesses\" huddled around the podium for most of the evening.  I can't stand that, they only had about 5 tables open for other guests not in our party why the hell did they need so many hostesses?  Eventually they started pitching in refilling drinks and clearing tables.  Like I said this was a special party of a large group so my review doesn't reflect a normal business night."}
{"text":"Good people, good food, good service, great wine.  It was good for the kids b/c they can draw on the table and they just grab at the bread! Pizza nyc pizza with sausage and onions was good.  Salmon and roasted red peppers was cooked very well and a combo that was amazing.   Overall we will return.   7 year old review- I like the pizza but I don't love it  5 year old review- 5 stars 5 55 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered bolognese for takeout. I got home to find it was, in fact, not bolognese at all. It was just an order of linguine pasta--sauceless and without meat. I had no words. I threw it out and vowed to never go back, as one of my favorite meals on the planet was shown no respect at what is supposed to be an authentic Italian restaurant. It's been a month or so later and I'm now opening the floor to Fratelli's to speak their piece regarding the matter."}
{"text":"Horrible!   The prices were ridiculous!  This place won't be open much longer.  No wonder we were the only people in there!"}
{"text":"Tasty.... calamari was tender. Eggplant was delish. Craft beers on tap!!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I tried to stay positive about this place.  After all, it's in Baxter Village, and things in Baxter Village are supposed to be above average, right?  But when you watch your waiter spend the greater part of your dining experience flirting with two girls at the bar instead of checking on your food or drinks the experience really goes downhill fast.  We were one of TWO tables the guy had, yet the food came out cold and another waiter had to fill our glasses.  The food was pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but for the price you pay you expect to get it warm at least.  I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Sorry but first thing I should have noticed was that all the tables had a smiling child with a big pizza.  The adults weren't eating ..... another cry for another location. First of all, though I have found a well kept and clean bathroom in a bad resturant... i have seldom or never found a a good resturant with an untidy bathoom. The men room had not been checked in over 4 days, and the grout in the tile was a science experiment. The lobster ravioli tasted  very very fishy and the 8-9 ravioli looked like teabags, not little meat/cheese pouches, and the sauce was  out of a can.... this meal was so bad it had be returned. As my partner and i finished off my Eggplant Parmesan ( two requests a for spagetti spoons later)  our replacement meal arrived Chicken Parmesan ... again with tomatoe sauce from a  can. I wish I were done! The check arrives ... an unapolgetic $50.00..... No Nancy we are not in Olive Garden (The food would be better ) ..... No alcohol and i had no salad ..... Well, the secret to this misery is, no weren't \"Comped\" a meal, we were charged extra because Nancy's replacement meal did not come salad.. The resturant busness is tough......... so plezzzze leave it to professionals.( or at least have someone check the Mens room more than once a week) Would I go back sure/// but only after checking the restrooms."}
{"text":"Great food! Went with a group of people and we had the chicken parm, deep dish pizza and shrimp scampi. Kearnen our server was great!"}
{"text":"Too pricey! $41 for 2 orders of bolognese (spaghetti with meat sauce which was $17.50 each) and garlic bread.  We ordered take out and I guess our first clue should have been the menu without the prices. The food was good but would be priced better at around $10-12 each."}
{"text":"We frequent this place often. Typically we get pizza which I find to be the best in the area. The pasta dishes are good too, nothing exceptional but good. It's convenient and there's never a wait (which is great since we have a baby with us!). The service is always great. Very attentive. The prices however are a little high for what they serve and their location. But still very good! We enjoy this place a lot, esp during the nice weather when we can sit outside."}
{"text":"This was horrible. The pasta with bolognese sauce is like they ran out of sauce, so they boiled pasta and put mildly seasoned hamburger helper on top. Overpriced and bad."}
{"text":"Having been to Italy recently, I was truly impressed with the menu, the quality and taste of the food, the wine list, and the service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to check out the joint during the festival going on in Baxter Village. Baldie ordered a Sicilian/Pan Pizza slice and a regular slice. Man, that slice was delicious!!! The owner is from up north, so he knows our pizza. The sauce was fresh and tomatoey and the crust was perfect, not doughy or too thin. It also had a nice amount of mozzarella. So good. I had the fried calamari. They give a nice portion of it and it was good too. Just a little over cooked, but still tender and delicious. Ordered a side salad and that was just ok, no big deal. My drink tho!!! Damn, it had a lot of vodka. It was ok after I watered it down. Our server was really nice and accommodating.  This might be our new Friday night pizza place! Abbondanza!!"}
{"text":"My review is very similar to most.. Service was excellent and the staff was very pleasant.  The manager also came around and checked on patrons - always a good thing..  But the bottom line is that the food is average at best and very pricey for what you get.  This was our 1st trip - was going to get pizza to try but couldn't make myself pay $22 for a pizza. $26 if you want pan.. We saw others with a pizza and honestly didn't look that good - so we went with the Stromboli, side salad, cup of minestrone and cannoli..  The soup was VERY tomatoee (made up word).. Was very bland and wasn't good. I'm also used to some pasta / Mac shells in mine. This had none and a chunk of tomato took up half the cup..  the $4.50 side salad was fresh - but would not have fed a bunny. The small plate was lined with lettuce - remove 1 piece and you are at the plate.  The Stromboli was average - nothing special. Wasn't bad - wasn't great.  We were not a fan of the marinara. The cannoli was pretty good. A little extra like chocolate or caramel drizzle or something to make it look good would have helped. Just placed on a plate. At the end of the day, we wanted to try this place.  We have now and it was ok. Just not something we would think about going back."}
{"text":"This is a reasonably elegant place.  It is a favorite of families with kids.  Keep in mind that Baxter Village is full of them and so are the restaurants.  The music is old school Italian and the food is too.  I had the manicotti which had a perfect temperature and topping of cheese.  The food shines in the elegant but approachable setting.  Quite a few nearby Italian places suffer from a lack of flair.  That is not the case here.  Parking is in the back for the most part."}
{"text":"It's a very classy looking restaurant. I had the pizza and was a bit disappointed. There may be better items in the menu. Most people I know agree with me in they the foods on the disappointing end."}
{"text":"Well, in this case, it's hard to even write a review, because we never actually ate!   But we'll review the service, in this case - which was truly nonexistent.  We came at 1:00 on a Sunday.   There were three other customers in the restaurant, and three wait staff plus the hostess.   We were seated, and after 15 minutes, no one had even come to serve our water, or ask for a drink order.   So we decided to cut our losses and walk out.   As we walked out, no one asked us what was wrong - just the hostess cheerfully saying, \"have a nice day!\"   We did - at another restaurant.      Just an FYI.   We decided to give Fratelli a try this time, after almost a two-year interval.   Last time we were there (again - it was two years ago), one of us bit into the plastic microwave pull-off dish cover.   That experience, combined with this non-service, means we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Went on a Saturday around 5:30. Attentive service. Nice house Chianti. Calamari spent too long in the fryer and was quite dark, which was disappointing because I had heard the calamari was fantastic. Spaghetti Pomodoro was delicious, though. Order meatballs to go with it; they were great. Big serving which came home with me. Mr. Bill had chicken piccata which was small in portion, strong in salt (capers?), and lacking in any lemony flavor. I'd go back, if only for the spaghetti Pomodoro. Oh, and PLEASE have balsamic on the table; the olive oil and pepper dipping sauce for the bread really needs a kick."}
