{"text":"Mama Mia Too wants to be a good restaurant.  It is a charming place inside, and the staff seems very earnest.  It wants to be a place where regulars go, sometimes with friends, to enjoy fine dining.  The food does not meet those expectations.  My own sense is that the volume of business is not enough to produce excellence from their extensive and ambitious menu."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've had since moving to Lake Norman. Excellent service and friendly wait staff. The prices are very reasonable too. I had the gnocchi Gorgonzola and it was excellent. I highly recommend seeking out this quaint restaurant for your next meal."}
{"text":"OMG, WTF!! It took an hour and a half to be served, and that was with reservations.  Others were leaving in droves.  We had two small children with us, who had to suffer for two plus hours.  The food was horrible, overly salty.  We had to ask for parmesan, which we never got.  Our drinks were never refilled.  We should have left when we walked in and saw how filthy the chairs were in the front foyer.  Run for the mountains!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Not fancy. Not too expensive. The food is always delicious. Never hard to get seated. Try it!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! We decided to give this restaurant a try since it is so close to where we live. We were very pleasantly surprised. The wait staff was great and the food even better.
My husband always asks a lot of questions before ordering at a new place and the server did not steer him wrong. She suggested the veal saltimbocca because the veal had just come in and was trimmed and pounded 45 minutes earlier. It was delicious. We joked that he definitely out-ordered me, even though my eggplant rollatini was really really good too. We will definitely go back there. The atmosphere was wonderful, nice and quiet. We could actually talk to each other and hear each other. 
Great place!"}
{"text":"After just moving to the area, my husband and I were looking for \"our\" place.  We were craving Italian and love supporting small businesses so we stopped by on a Wednesday evening.  Here is what we experienced....

Service: upon arrival, we were \"greeted\" by a hostess who asked us if we had a reservation. We glanced at the mostly empty seating area and she added \"...well you don't have to have one.\"  Huh. So she seats us and turns out is also our waitress.  We were starving so I was about to order our drinks and possibly some appetizers when she interrupts me to read off a lengthy list of specials. It seemed to take forever to get our drinks. 

Food:  When the bread came, it was fresh, delicious, and disappeared quickly. That is where the compliments for the food ends. I even asked our waitress if they order food from a frozen food company because there was absolutely NO flavor.  You would think that an Italian dish might include oregano, garlic, onion, parsley, basil.... Nope. My chicken parmigiana was literally unseasoned Panko crusted chicken and a sauce that was almost acidic because the tomato flavor had nothing to be balanced against. I honestly felt like walking out after the first bite and going to Olive Garden and I despise chain places. My husbands favorite dessert of all time is Tiramisu. He has driven to EarthFare right before they close just to get a piece of there's.  He actually declined their's and asked if we could get ice cream from McDonald's instead. It was that bad. 

Value: everything you need to know about their prices, known from the fact that only the first loaf of \"complimentary\" bread is free."}
{"text":"As always, a perfect meal. We went last night for our 5th anniversary and the service and meals were all wonderful.

The bread came out warm and the mozzarella and peppers in olive oil were very nice.


I had the Zuppa di Pesce and my wife had the Gorgonzola gnocchi. They both hit the mark and were nice with the bottle of wine we chose.

Ralph and Amany always treat us so well. See you all soon!"}
{"text":"We were craving pasta and didn't want gross chain Italian food, so we decided to try Mama Mia Too.  It was AMAZING!!!!!  Authentic Italian with terrific flavor and huge portions.  I got the Ziti Vodka with chicken which was creamy and delicious!  My husband got the Chicken Parmesan and he said it was the best he'd ever had!  We also got the garlic bread which had cheese toasted on top - absolutely delicious!  Not to mention it is the cutest little restaurant with tons of character and very nice people!  This will definitely become a regular spot for us!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I have read the other reviews and I can see how it may be hit or miss.

We have been there several times and the food and service has always been good.  There are many price points $8.95 to $30+ so Mama Mia's can accommodate most budgets.

We did go there one Valentines day and did not care for the reduced selection \"special menu\" (common for V-day) and we did not stay.

The reason I like this place is it is off the beaten path and you can find a quiet corner for a romantic date night."}
{"text":"This little country-house-turned-restaurant in downtown Huntersville produces high quality food in a relaxed atmosphere. We started with a Calamari appetizer that was spot-on. Only one piece was a little overcooked but the overall flavor was excellent. I had the Veal Marsala and my spouse had the Chicken Marsala.  Both were very good. The sauce was simple, traditional and exceptional. For desert we had mini cannolis and they were phenominal!"}
{"text":"What a great find. Have driven by this place daily but decided to take my daughter for a girl's night .  A lovely table by the window (though the view of Huntersville-Concord Rd. would not be my first choice). Service was swift and thorough.  Wine was a big pour (thanks) and the salads and our main courses were quite delicious and can't forget the warm bread brought to the table.
Will return soon."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for some good Italian food, but was really unimpressed. The food was mediocre and nothing really special about the experience. It says 'Fine Italian cuisine' but it didn't live up to this."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food,  friendly staff, great value!  My favorites include anything eggplant, scallops, and chicken parmigiana-sautéed chicken.  This Jersey girl is right at home."}
{"text":"I wanted to have some good ole' Italian food and decided to check this place out. I've lived in Huntersville for a long time and this was my first time there. I walked in and placed an order to take home. I was in the mood for some great red sauce. As I was talking to the hostess about the sauces, the owner overheard our conversation and describes all the sauces and how they are all made from scratch. (That's what I wanted to hear). I placed two orders of eggplant parmesan and a side salad. The meal also came with a side of pasta. While waiting, the hostess took time and explained the history of the house, the restaurant and gave me a tour as well. She was so nice and I had a great time learning about the restaurant. The portions were huge! The red sauce was fantastic and the eggplant was cooked perfect! It's up there as one of the best eggplants i've had! Again, the sauce was great. The only issues was the side salad. The hostess mentioned that it was too small for two to share, but I took a chance. Next time i'll get a larger salad. If you are looking for some authentic Italian food...you're in luck! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"A great local spot! Highly recommend anything with their vodka sauce, and their Ralph salad is a must. House made tiramisu and creme brûlée are to die for. Not super budget friendly, but definitely a worthy a small splurge."}
{"text":"Visually, this place seems like it'd be a good date night restaurant.  It's a little cheesy on the outside with a poorly thought out paint job and a sign in dire need of a graphic designer, but inside it is very romantic with large paintings and an opulent feel to it.  Unfortunately, that's the only really impressive part of the dining experience here.

If I had to sum up eating here in one word, that word would be overpriced.  There were bottles of wine on the menu for over $50 you can find at other restaurants in the low 30s (and buy for yourself for less than 20).  The food wasn't bad, but it was very unimpressive.  The gnocchi with gorgonzola I could have made better at home.  It was nothing more than gnocchi covered with alfredo sauce with a little gorgonzola mixed in and plopped on a plate.  No herbs, no spices, not even a garnish.  And for this we paid fine dining prices with a final bill for two people of over $80.

The service was friendly and unobtrusive, but nothing especially noteworthy.  It was also very quiet, but that's probably due to the fact that only one other person was there that night and he was dining alone.

If you're really hankering for spending 30x the store price for a chef boyardee meal, this is the place for you.  Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"When you want a break from Luce, Toscana or Fiamia (all excellent Italian restaurants) and you crave Italian food as you remember it from little Italy in NYC. Give Mama Mia a try. I had lunch here today and not only was my dish delicious but the lunch prices were real inexpensive, half the dishes were under $10."}
{"text":"Do not go here! I'm surprised there isn't police tape around this shack condemning it. This has to be one of the filthiest restaurants I've ever set foot in. It's an old house, and it looks like the people who own it haven't made any modifications since the turn of the century...the 19th century.

It's supposed to be Italian food, but it's more a mix of cookie-cutter 1980's pasta dishes and wtf-ever happened to be cheap at the market that day. I only looked at the food here, so I can't tell you how it actually tastes, but if that's any indication there's a reason why I just looked.

Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"This was our first time there. Food and service were exceptional . Even the owner came by our table to check on us . It was a Sunday evening at 6pm and the restaurant was mostly quiet .Which seemed surprising , seeing that the food and service were so good . Prices very . We were a party of 4 and our bill was just under 100. That included the wine we drank .My advise ,please try this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"This bread was fresh and hot from the oven. It came with a nice oil vinegar, spice dip. My husband had the Ralph salad with oil vinegar and spices. It was wonderful

Our entrees were a disappointment and were just so so. My husband ordered Chicken marsala and thought it was salty, flavorless bland and  maybe even frozen. It should have a distinctive wine flavor. His didnt. I had a chicken with artichokes and it too was over salted but edible. Both entrees came with a tiny side if angel hair marinara and broccoli. 

Service was great, very friendly, except for a delay in bringing our check. Based on the past reviews i think we will keep looking for a local favorite Italian restaurant. My advice to the restaurant- revamp you recipes, watch salt use ( people can add their own) atmosphere and service was great."}
{"text":"Great little Italian place here in town.  I went here fun lunch and had some great authentic food with fresh crusty bread.  Another little diamond in the rough.."}
{"text":"Remember that age old question of prego vs ragu? It was literally the burning question of the 80's and early 90's. What if you could experience the best of both worlds in the safety and comfort of a restaurant!? Why just wear vintage when you can experience it first hand. If you're not coming to Mama Mia Too's, you're missing out on a life enriching moment that will take you back in time faster than a delorean to those days your mom would heat up a can of Campbell's soup hot over the stove for you. Some other details for the sticklers:

Pros:
Gorgeous old-timey house
romantic ambiance
NOSTALGIA

Cons:
Stiff service
The food.
Pricey for what you're actually getting.
Buyers remorse

Ain't nothing in this world beats nostalgia. Seasoning be damned! Eat at Mama Mia Too's and you just might be a little kid again."}
{"text":"A long time favorite that after all these years, still does not disappoint.

My son and his girlfriend came up from Atlanta over Labor Day and we enjoyed their stay. Ate out several times but on the last night, I wanted someplace that was nice and quite with great food and Mama Mia's in Huntersville came to mind.

Back in the late 90's, we were at a meeting in Atlanta and when we were discussing where to go for dinner, one of our friends pointed out that one of the best Italian restaurant that they had found, was in our back yard. Had lived in Cornelius for about 3 years at this time and this place was only about a mile from where I worked in Huntersville.

Needless to say, we went as soon as we got back from Atlanta and loved the place. My wife even through a surprise birthday party for me here although I will omit which one it was.

One of our favorites and it did not disappoint this time either.

Made reservations for 6 pm and because of traffic, were a few minutes late but no problem. The hostess promptly seated us. They have the restaurant broken up with curtains, drapes and other design elements into smaller more intimate spaces that take away from the overall size of the restaurant. It's a house or probably a mansion in it's day, probably built around the turn of the last century in what was then, downtown Huntersville.  Completely restored  and very tastefully decorated in period furniture in warm inviting colors and textures.

We were seated in a nice alcove with a window view on the gardens and street. Our servers were there promptly and we did not want for service the rest of the evening.

Several started out with wine and I must admit, they have a great selections of wines by the glass or the bottle.

A rather large menu with many items to choose from including 5 veal dishes.

My son's girlfriend chose the Lobster Ravioli while my son had the Veal Scallopini. My wife had the Veal Saltimbocco and I chose a Caprese Salad followed by Veal Parmesan.

A few minutes later, the bread course arrived. Fresh baked bread, straight from the oven with plenty of butter and olive oil for dipping. A good start.

The Caprese Salad arrived next and it was delicious although I will admit I have never had it served in a bowl. Normally presented on a plate with tomato and mozzarella alternating garnished with balsamic and basil. Still good and a good quality mozzarella.

Dinner and the table fell silent as everyone proceeded to enjoy their dinner.

Flavor, texture, presentation, atmosphere, service etc all worked together to make for a memorable dinner.

Going to have to make a note to self.  Dine here more often."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous, probably the best in the area.  They need a decorator to help with their interior.  I'd say they did it themselves.  They need to stick with what they do best!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem! Had a friend tell me about this place figure I'd give it a try! Now I go all the time! The penne vodka is amazing!"}
{"text":"Favorite Italian restaurant for my husband and myself. He loves their veal Parmesan. They make their own homemade bread served warm before each meal. I had the special tonight which was lobster, shrimp, scallops and vodka sauce it was fantastic. Fish was fresh, tender, perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Portions on small side and pricey for what you are getting, salad sub par. Gnocchi was equivalent to store bought kind and the Fra Diavolo was good but too small of a portion for the price paid. House merlot was real nice. Service is very friendly but decor was dated and sub-par on cleanliness."}
{"text":"We chose to take out the Chicken Alfredo- however we had FOUR pieces of chicken. For $17 I expected a lot more than four tiny pieces of chicken. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal!  It looks like an older house from the outside but the flavors they cook with are wonderful!  I am glad to have tried it.  I would definitely recommend you try it too!  A local spot that is not a chain is hard to find!"}
{"text":"Well thank goodness for this classy high end restaurant that serves the best of the best. I took myself on a date whilst the husband was in Mother Russia.

Try the mozzarella lightly fried and oven baked.

Also, lobster ravioli in crab infused vodka sauce is heaven on a plate.

Pasta y fagioli was another must try.

So far everything gets 5 stars, I'll go back to try more of the menu next week.

To the lady that gave 2 stars because you had 4 pieces of chicken with your alfredo for $17 go to TGIFridays. This is top notch fare and prepared fresh! You get what you pay for, girl. I think they could get away with raising the prices for the quality they serve to be honest."}
{"text":"I wouldn't want a 1 star... so they didn't get a 1 star. Took forever to get drinks, the food was pretty bland. We the placed an order for a side salad to go. We were very specific in telling them it was for someone and not us. They have us 5 pieces of chopped up lettuce 2 cucumber slices, and 2 giant tomatoes. The worst salad ever constructed. We will never go back."}
{"text":"As Promised to the owner that I would give her a $35.48 rave review! My 17-year-old son went there before Prom. I begged him to find another place because 1. This place always looks closed because there is NEVER anyone in their parking lot, It looks dirty and run down from the street. 2. I thought it would be best to go to a restaurant closer to the Prom venue in Charlotte there are tons of better Italian places than this DUMP! and 3. the reviews showed it is not very good! My son arrived on time for his reservation at 5:30 he was served and done with his food by 6:30 the prom was starting at 7:30. If his check was given to him on time he would have been able to make the 30-minute drive to the venue and still have time to spare. But no! The incompetent staff who only had three tables at the time could not seem to stop gabbing and give my son his check so he could pay his bill. At 7:15 my son called me and said he had still not left the restaurant. My son is a very respectable boy and does not make any waves so he did not complain about the food which he said was not good and trust me he knows good Italian food that is what he grew up on. He did not complain about the service. What he did do was call me because he was uncomfortable and he just sat and waited. I ended up going to the restaurant and arrived at 7:30 so he could leave for his prom and I would wait for the check. I asked for a Manager but conveniently there was none available. I told them that the wait was ridiculous that there was no one in this place and it took over an hour to get the check. I ended up disputing the charge because of the horrible food and service. The owner decided to respond to the dispute saying there were no problems that evening! When the bank sent me her response I decided to call her and I explained what her staff did and she said I will give you a gift card, I said I did not want a gift card because I would not go to her establishment EVER!. I said I wanted a refund and she then gave me a story that the reason she filled out the dispute that way was that if she agreed she would get a fine. (Never heard of a bank fining anyone but whatever). She then said she would call me back but to give her 2 days. A week goes by and no response! I called and she said since my son ate the terrible food that she would give him half of his money back, I said no that is not what I requested. I told her that the dispute has now been escalated and her response was to go ahead cause you will never win. Well guess what  I may not get my refund from you but I will give you $35.48 times a million in Rave reviews. You are a very poor business owner. Your food is horrible and your reviews below show what a terrible business you run."}
{"text":"Average.  Nothing special. We went at 7:30 on Friday night and the place was empty.  No real atmosphere.  The service was prompt, but lacked the polish I would hope for from a host and waitstaff.  Food was ok.  Bread and dip was really good.  Salad was plain jane, lettuce, cucumber and tomato.  My wife had the chocolate cake for dessert which was good.  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place. It's in a quaint house and the owner is an old likeable Italian guy that reminds me of my father in law. But the food was overpriced and just ok. The service was slow and inattentive. This place isn't the worst but it truly is a 3 Star experience"}
{"text":"Such a quaint place.  The food was very good.  With the exception of my husband's dish, the portion sizes were good.  There is a kid's menu, complete with spaghetti and meatballs.  I will say the salads were a little overpriced, though.  All in all, a nice place for a nice dinner.

After speaking with my friends about their dinners, I found out how overpriced their dinners were.  Watch out for those specials!"}
{"text":"Very good sauce and fresh food. The decor can use some sprucing up. Portions were a perfect size. I would recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, I have driven by many times and so glad that I finally had an opportunity to enjoy an evening here with my boyfriend.  The food was delicious.  He had gotten veal and I had gotten a pasta dish.  The server we had was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient."}
{"text":"I love going to this place!  I read a review that said \"Tired old italian food\"  I guess that is what I am looking for.  Yes the recipes are old solid Italian food, but when I'm in the mood for Italian food like I had all over Italy, this is the place in NC that I think of.  I've had several dishes off the menu, my favorites are the veal sorrentina and the shrimp fr diavolo.  My girlfriend had the chicken piccata and loved it.  Unless you order a pasta dish which stars the pasta and sauce, the pasta is a contorno or side dish as it is in all of the place I ate in Italy.  They have good hearty soups (large portions so be careful).  The only knock I have on this place is cost.  They have one menu and it is for lunch and dinner and the prices are the same.  I gotta admit the portions are the same also.  The staff are friendly and helpful and attentive.  If you are looking for true Italian style cooking then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Extreamly pleased with my meal of chicken Parmesan and angel hair pasta.  Everything was delivered quickly and the waitstaff was attentive.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I SO wanted to LOVE this place!  I have wanted to eat here since we moved to NC 6 years ago.  I imagined nothing but greatness every time I drove by for years.  I finally convinced my boys to go and man was I  overwhelmingly disappointed and unimpressed.  The only thing the place has going for itself is the quaint house that it is in.  Everything else is sub-par at best and ridiculously over priced.  We ordered mushroom ravioli, ziti vodka and a kids spaghetti with waters.  Our bill was $57 with the tip for two adult entrees and one child entree.  Four small raviolis for $18 bucks is insane.  The portions were tiny and entrees do not come with soup or salad.  We always leave restaurants with left overs for lunch the next day because we can never finish our meals.  There was nothing left on any of our plates.  Not because it was good food, but because it was bird food.  They definitely nickel and dime you here.  They even charge extra from bread refills.  Really?  Olive Garden and Carrabba's are better than this place.  Antico, Basilico Italiano and Nonna's as well.  Speaking of Nonna's my teenager and I ate there last night.  We ordered cheesy bread, penne vodka and baked ziti (both of which came with salad or soup).  Our bill was $35 before tip.  We have left overs for two days at least.  Yeah definitely not going back to Mama Mia's.  Never again."}
{"text":"Superb authentic Italian food. Made with fresh ingredients and a refreshing change from chain restaurants.  Maybe a couple of other reviewers complained about the prices, but they are in line with chain restaurants and the food is A++  We continue to choose Mama Mia time after time.  Love the Lobster Ravioli and Shrimp Skampi.  The tiramisu is something I have tasted all over the world (including Italy), and this is among the best."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! We went on a Friday night so it was a little busy and everyone was running around with their heads chopped off. It's like they didn't know how to handle so many people. We waiting a while and finally got sat. No one greeted us or brought us water for 20 minutes! People that got sat after us had water. Someone came by and apologized because they were out of cups but the people that got sat after us already had their drinks! We were very upset by now but didn't want to leave cause we were starving. While we wait for our drinks, a couple that was waiting with us in the beginning left and said to us \"good luck.\" They never got service and waited at their table for 30 mins. When we got brought our water, the guy (we never knew who our server was because no one introduced themselves and we dealt with more than one person) was about to run off again and we had to tell him we are ready to order. We never got asked if we wanted to drink something else as well. Good came out and it was average. Guy refilled our water and said \"it's never been this Busy, sorry! I will be here later than 10\" he was complaining to us about how long he had to stay at work. We don't care!! We were there for almost 2 hours! Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on my birthday and had a wonderful experience.  The marinara sauce was surprisingly delicious and tasted fresh.  The bread was really good too.  I had wanted to come here for awhile, so I was had I could finally get to try it. 

Greta service, very attentive throughout the visit. I lie the atmosphere a lot. The restaurant is in an old house and there are tables in different rooms creating a very intimate setting.

Th tiramisu was one of the highlights of the evening.  A very happy way to end my birthday Dinner."}
{"text":"Quaint house with great ambience. The food was absolutely amazing! There were 5 of us and we all ordered different things - all of them were superb! The taste was awesome and portions were huge! The service was extremely friendly and attentive without being bothersome. They even brought out a free 'birthday tiramisu' with a candle and sang happy birthday to the birthday girl in our party. Amazing place- we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant after reading a lot of the reviews.  The restaurant is in a cozy house.  The service was fantastic and the food came out quickly.  I had the gnocchi gorgonzola.  I don't think they make the gnocchi in house, but it tasted good.  I was surprised how much flavor was in the simple side of pasta that came with my wife's eggplant parm that she loved.  Now, is this the best Italian food I have every had, no.  Is this a place I would recommend, yes."}
{"text":"Great meal. Good portion no so much we where stuffed and great tasting. Mama, a big fellow, was very sweet coming to the table several times to see if we were ok. I would skip the salad. I had the eggplant and it was great. I was not a fan of the meatballs(still can figure what was in them) but I also tried the veal and it was great as well. Next time we ill try dessert. I must say It's the best Italian we have had out thus far in the area. Give it a try. I think the prices are a bit higher than on the yelp menu, but not by much.If you want a suggestions(mama) tablecloths would add a nice touch and maybe change the entry way into a  more homey feel like the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very fresh with the farm to table feel. Not the greatest service though."}
{"text":"Sat for twenty minutes without an acknowledgement from a server. Thank god for the busser bringing bread."}
{"text":"Two of us dining with a $34 bottle of wine spent $108.  One appetizer with mozzarella with peppers (We didn't like it).   Two entries and there u go - $108 before tip. My fiancé wanted to substitute sauce and there was a $4 charge.  The bread was good and we ate all of it because of the long wait between appetizers and our entrees.   When we got our meal we asked for more bread and they said there would be another $4 charge.   Most of the time Italian restaurants pride themselves on their guests leaving full.  I had the lobster raviolis and there was four of them in a bowl for $20 - we left very disappointed.   The food itself was satisfactory, but the price and the atmosphere wasn't."}
{"text":"I've come to update my review to brag some more. Their food is incredible!! Everything is fresh!! Amazing food!!!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The people are very nice but the food lacks flavor that makes me want to take another bite. I think the atmosphere was nice, but they were kind of slow. I'll probably pass in the future. The manicotti was good, but not good enough for me to say \"Mama Mia!\""}
