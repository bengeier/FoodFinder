{"text":"The only negative I would have to say is that the ambiance is not the greatest. The place is clean and well kept but I just stick to the takeout. Other than that the food is on point! The prices offer a great value for the servings of food. Some of the best butter chicken I have had West of Little India. The service is always kind and fast."}
{"text":"Modest place with great food portion. 
the best thing the restaurant I have was the cilantro sauce and the chicken biryani and the also have decent kulf and fresh naan"}
{"text":"*UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN* I've been here a coupla times in the past.  This time my take out chicken was ICE COLD on the inside.  For anyone who has ever had the displeasure, eating undercooked chicken is not a fun food poisoning experience.  I will never ever eat here again."}
{"text":"***THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC!!***

Came here for the very first (and certainly not last) time tonight and was totally blown away by the quality, taste, affordability & authenticity of this food.

Hands down, this is THE BEST Pakistani food West of Yonge Street (and possibly outside of Gerard St/Little India) in the general 'downtown' area of Toronto. 

Honestly. WOW. The Naan, Chana Masala, Tandoori Chicken, and Beef Kebabs are out of this world!! 

Stop what you are doing right now and GO there RIGHT NOW. (If I wasn't so full after all that delicious food, I'd go right back!)"}
{"text":"I just had the chicken karahi.  I wish they had a boneless chicken option as well since I would have preferred this.  The rice was hard and they over loaded the take out container with too much rice.

The sauce for the karahi was pretty tasty!  

The dish was okay...I would have preferred boneless chicken and paid more for it.  The dish was not worth the price."}
{"text":"I think perhaps the only pakistani restaurant in ChinaTown, this place was a good spot to grab a quick bite to eat. The food was flavourful, but not very spicy. We had chicken tandoori kabob and fish pakoras. The price is decent."}
{"text":"Taste ok, but when you paid almost 10$ for butter chicken, only 4 small chunks of meat is just unacceptable. TOTAL RIP OFF!!!! Will never go again and would not recommend it for anyone."}
{"text":"To my surprise the food is delicious.  Very good 
Keema naan, Brain masala, Karahi gosht, garlic naan"}
{"text":"I am currently eating the butter chicken from Sizzler Kebab.
Tongue status: delighted
Belly status: happily full
Mouth status: on fire
Wallet status: satisfied
Who needs a man when you can spend Friday night with food this good?

Sizzler Kebab is a small, spiced gem in Chinatown. The small parking lot is always stuffed with cabs, and the fluorescent lights always bright. You don't come here for decor, but you do come here for the food. 

My white girl taste buds get slightly intimidated here but the subtle, steady burn is paired with piles of flavour.

This butter chicken is no overly-sweet, tomato-soup-style mess. The chicken has been char-grilled first so it's tender and flavourful even before being bathed in a rich, complex, spicy and deep red sauce. Most of their dishes are excellent, reasonably portioned, and well-priced. I only once had a lentil dish that tasted a bit off, but everything else I've had is near divine.

Naan is house-made, fresh, hot and so goodI sometimes get the garlic version to go just by itself and eat it pantsless and happy, alone in my apartment. It almost replaces Tinder.

The guys running this place are lovely and obviously work very hard. So go put your pants on (as you must) and get yourself some naan. I promise a happy ending."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka was well done and tender, and for about $10, came with a huge naan. The salad were pieces of cucumber and lettuce, nothing special. My dad's chicken karahi had pieces of tendon and skin attached to it and neither were really that spicy, it also came with a lot of basmati rice. Food is cheap and fresh if you order the meat items, but the vegetarian dishes appear to be sitting in deli vats next to the counter for I-don't-know-how-long."}
{"text":"Agree that it's a total rip off. Only 4 small pieces of chicken with the bone in, splintered for $7.90. It was dry and tasted old. I was here before for the lamb, which was fatty, small and tough.

The person admitted everything in the Kitchen is cold and they heat it up on the plate or in a Styrofoam container when ordered. Mine was too hot and cold, very greasy and lacked flavour. Since I love Pakistani food and live nearby, this is a huge disappointment.

 They seem to be trying to make as much money possible by serving the lowest quality on food they can find.

The TV set on loud volume was not good either. This place looks like a dive and has lousy food.

Oh, and people should know it's only been open for a few months. The owners are obviously cheap to put what looks like as little money as they could into the decor."}
{"text":"Gotta love the influx of kabab places downtown. Pamier Kabab, the Afghanistan kabob house further south on Spadina has them, but Sizzler looked good for lunch so I stopped in. There is plenty of room for seating but the stark white walls looks like more effort could be taken to make the place look more enticing. That doesn't matter if the food is good and it was. The lunch specials all looked good. A return visit could help me decide if all their food is basically the same or if they show some culinary skills with a menu steeped in tradition. Check this place out for lunch, I'd like to hear some other reviews of their fare. Something tells me they are holding back somewhat, have potential, and if you know what to order, they could step up and become remarkable."}
{"text":"After reading positive comments here on yelp, I decided to go to Sizzler Kabab to try their chicken curry combo. On the menu it shows that salad is being served next to the chicken and rise, but I did not receive any (they are trying to be sneaky I guess). The restaurant had a nasty smell, which I am not sure what exactly it was (and didn't want to know). The Mangolasi was tasting not delicious and the chicken curry was not that good either. The chicken pieces were mostly burned and the lady who served the food had not much manner. Overall, it was a bad experience and I would not go again to this restaurant. 

Would I recommend this place to a friend? Of course not!  This restaurant would be my last resort for indian or pakistani food. Although I have not tried their pakistani dishes, I would still not go there again because of the overall experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best kheer hands down! Best chicken biriyani in town as well! It is also halal and open till late which makes it very convenient to order take out after a long day at work.

Would love to see better interior though!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a few blocks from the University of Toronto. It looks like your average diner so if fancy ambience is your thing just move on. But if you like cheap good food then this is your place. They have daily combo specials under 10 bucks that will fill you up. I like their kabab combos which will come to you fresh and hot. They are also open late to accomodate the students. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I've ever had. Yuck. Everything from the butter chicken to the rice to the green disaster was absolutely wretched. Never again. Puke."}
{"text":"went here today for take out, the portions of rice and fish were decent and the food was average., not enough salad and it was rolled up inside a tin foil, i asked for an extra green sauce and they charged me 50c, i don't mind paying, however i only got half the container size full. pretty cheap restaurant in general and not worth $12."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing a bad review of this place because the staff are very friendly, but the food is absolutely terrible most of the time. They rely heavily on their microwave to warm up their food. Chicken is always dry and over cooked, everything is way over seasoned and over spiced. If irritable bowel syndrome is your passion, then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Every meal I've had here has been full of favour. Ive tried just about every Indian restaurant in the core and this one although not fancy has food that stands up to or beats them all. Their variety of briani dishes are all amazing and they are open very late. Perfect for the after party cravings."}
{"text":"Nice location and they seem to open late. The place is cafeteria style and pay upfront when ordering. There wasn't much service and they don't seat you or anything. I get the feeling it used to be a ice cream store given the layout of the register. Take outs and delivery seem to be their main selling point. I don't usually see many people eating in when I pass by the place.

The food was alright. I got the lamb biryani and a garlic naan. The biryani came with a small salad which were some cucumber slices and leaves and a soda drink. The lamb was good but a couple of the pieces were almost all bones. They also seem to have forgotten the garlic in the naan I ordered because it tasted bland. After seeing the other reviews, I expected more from the naan. The food felt dry towards the end. I suspect that's why most of the combos offer a choice of a drink. The green sauce thing was very watery but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that. It tasted okay and I dipped the naan pieces in it to eat.

Overall, it was okay and very filling. I'd probably come back again but expectations aren't high. This place seems good for getting a simple naan to go though."}
{"text":"Simple place and simply good food. The chef/cook used to work at a  place over at Sherborne and Carlton. I've been a fan ever since. 

Place is clean and easy to get to by transit. Not a place to go for the venue, service etc etc. Just let your taste buds decide."}
{"text":"Not that many options for vegetarians but still love the food... my husband loves there fish fry.. and we get it almost every other day.. the food is worth the price"}
{"text":"Talk about hole in the wall! I had gone past this place many times, thinking, \"I want to try that place,\" but I never went in, mostly because the atmosphere with its stark fluorescent lighting and basic tables never really called to me. The other day, I finally tried it. Went with a friend at 1 in the morning after work. 
Ordering here is a bit strange because it looks like a fast food place but there's no menu up on the wall. The man handed us a printed menu and explained the options. Everything looked delicious so we decided to try many things. They brought all the food to our table as well as a pitcher of water and delicious hot sauce. The service was amazing, and the food... wow! It was damn good! Certainly better than I expected from a place that looks very \"walk in, walk out.\" This is high-quality stuff for fast food. If the decor here was a bit better, I think more people would try it out and then the word would spread... Seriously this place is delicious. Definitely try the chick peans (channa). That was the winning dish, although everything had a lot of flavour. 
I love Chinese food, but Sizzler Kabab is a nice little break in the sea of East Asian restaurants on Spadina."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The portions are small, dishes are oily and meat is about as low a quality as you can ger for human comsumption. Most of the buriyani got tossed because it was so inedible and they didnt have dhall in stock. The world's most widely consumed legume and you dont have any? ANY other Indian takeout but this would give you better value including the expensive Bindia where at least you can eat all the food and savour the flavour differentiation with excellent quality meat."}
{"text":"Loved it for a late night delivery. Came at 11 pm as promised and the Chicken Biryani ( better than Lahore tikka, less oily and Basmati rice cooked well) and the butter chicken were really good! Will make sure I shortlist this in my restaurants in Toronto for Indian delivery"}
{"text":"If you are from Bangladesh and you miss the halim from back home, the halim from here will hit the spot!!! The halim is pretty damn good but the portion is not very big. The boneless malai chicken tikka with naan was pretty decent as well. Would order from here again.

Food ordered through Ubereats."}
{"text":"This review is only for their chicken kebab combos. The combo is $8:50 including tax and comes with 2 chicken sheekh kebabs and the option of rice or fresh naan, salad and a choice of pop or bottled water.

The kebabs have been fairly consistent and the fresh baked naan is always good, spice level is medium to hi and the kebab is very flavorful, for the price you cannot go wrong.
The decor is not great, you wouldn't want to go out on a date at this place. Place is open till the early hours 7 days and till at least 4am on the weekend. The normal crowd in this place seems to be taxi drivers.

I have never tried any of the curries in this place so I can't say anything about those dishes."}
{"text":"The butter chicken is perfect.  Tasty and spicy.  The chikken tikka is awesome. 

The naan is fresh and chewy.  

All dinners come with a fresh salad.  The fried fish is perfect.  

Don't stress, have some sizzler. 

And don't forget to order the biryani.  Yummmmmmmmmmmmyyy!"}
{"text":"Well priced but the food is average at best.
General review: Too salty and dry
Really really bad service
The decor is soo bad that its almost repulsive
Place is clean
Good nan
What we had
Chicken Grill
Beef Kabab
Butter chicken
Naan
(Kheer) Rice Pudding
Only the naan is worth having again"}
{"text":"The price was decent, and the service quick and polite, but unfortunately this wasn't my favourite meal. The butter chicken here had a bitter/tart/sour tinge to it that I've never seen before in the dish. It took away any enjoyment from the otherwise properly spiced meal. Very heavy on the tomatoes as well. Next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"very very small portions, butter chicken is very spicy and garlic nann bread was flavorless."}
{"text":"Ordered butter chicken with rice & naan. Payed $12.

For 2AM, the food was pretty dang good. Lots of sauce included with the butter chicken, which was a plus for me as I love to cover the rice with it.

Overall, decent food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Would I bring a first date here? No. She'd probably leave but if she's that shallow, I wouldn't want to be with her anyway. Moving on...

If you're looking for a real South Asian meal, this place is the real deal.

I grew up in Vancouver but I spent a good 10 years in India and other parts of South Asia. When I moved to Toronto, finding decent Indian comfort food wasn't easy.

I usually order the Haleem, Any Biryani (depending on my mood), Tandoori Chicken is the real deal and you should try out their breads as well. I haven't ordered each and every thing on the menu but anything that I have tried, was worth the order.

Don't walk... Run to Sizzler Kabab."}
{"text":"Good food. Fair prices. Would recommend for culture foods. 7.99 can get a nice combo with a drink included. The portions used to be bigger but still okay to feel satisfied."}
{"text":"Made a stop here to get Chicken Biryani for my son and also decided to try their Seekh Kabobs and Falooda. Their Biryani and Seekh Kababs are nothing phenomenal. Falooda and Naan are pretty good here."}
{"text":"A small little place with good food. Very basic set up and docor. If you are looking for cheap Pakistani food, this is the place"}
