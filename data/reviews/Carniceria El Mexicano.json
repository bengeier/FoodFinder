{"text":"Don't be too shocked,a carniceria in the barrio of El Mirage. However this one rocks.  
The pollo preparado or chicken faijita meat is the sole reason I visit this tiny hole in the wall and a near weekly basis!!!  Its the best hands down.  Food City has nothing on them in terms of pollo.  Grab a few pounds of marinated chicken, a bag of real tortillas (no mission tortillas for me thank you!!) and fire up your grill!!  Invite your friends over and its fajita night!!! Their mexican cheeses are great too.  I prefer the ranchero and my hubby the cotija.  They both are great in the fajitas.

The meats are good too, just pick your cut and they add the meat to a bag of marinade and you're out the door.  

Fair warning, this is in El Mirage!  Don't be to surprised if English is the second language here!! There have been many times the check out girl told me my total in Spanish.  The guys behind the meat counter speak english so you're safe.

Also this place has recently changed names it is now Carniceria Uruapan.  its right next door to the cell phone place."}
{"text":"As previously cited, this is now named Carniceria Uruapan & is in a less than favorable location...BUT...
  Let me just say that they have the best carne asada we've EVER had.  We've purchased ranchera from carnicerias all over the West Coast & this is simply the best.  Meat doesn't have chewy stuff, marinade isn't overpowering & it's just damn good!!  $6.49/lb is a little higher than the $5.99 we're used to, however, it was BOMB.  Can't wait to try more..."}
{"text":"Love the season chicken if you want to grill some amazing food get ur meat there it's so good!"}
{"text":"Great butcher shop , burritos are killer , prices are reasonable and the menudo is really good."}
{"text":"Love their hot food to-go specifically the chimichanga that is just pack with carne asada for $3 . Their gorditas are amazing ($1.75 ea) but sellout early in the day. Along with the delicious molcajete  salsa this is the best lunch for cheap."}
