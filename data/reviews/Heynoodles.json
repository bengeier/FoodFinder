The lamb noodle bowl was ok. The lamb smell wasn't that strong."}
{"text":"If not for the good food, I would rate this establishment as 1 star, no service, not attentive wait person. But still would not recommend this restaurant, and won't come back"}
{"text":"If it's cold out, and you like spicy, this is a great place to come. They're open all night so it's a good place to eat if everything is closed. I had their pork belly but was underwhelmed by the meat. Their noodles are really good and they have FREE REFILLS for the noodles. Their wontons are very good and although the dish doesn't come with noodles, you can just add them for a small fee and you'll save a bit of money.

Service is fast, no credit but they do have debit."}
{"text":"Unlimited noodles refill!!

I love the texture of the noodles here! Very chewy and much better than the texture of Japanese Ramen!! 

I always like to order 1 spicy and 1 non-spicy noodles because even the mild spicy is way too spicy for me, but I like a tiny bit of spicy. 

My personal favourite is the noodles with shrimp. I also order the wontons as well. 

However, the food here is very inconsistent. The soup base always tastes different and the quality of the toppings changes all the time. Sometimes the pork chops have lots of meat, but sometimes there's only bones! Also, the wontons are sometimes very fresh and soft, but other times the skin is very tough (I think they were frozen). 

Overall 4/5 stars. Would definitely come back every now and then to satisfy my noodle cravings!"}
{"text":"Never left a noodle bowl empty before, this is a first. Taste is simple and lack depth. Stopped eating mid way through. Do not get the spicy and sour beef noodle, very oily!"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't think I'd like this place since I am not a fan of Asian noodles but my sister told me they were very good so I decided to give them a try. 

It's a nice bright spacious clean place with nice decors on the wall. I got the nutritious lamb noodle (wtheck is nutritious lamb?) less spicy and extra cilantro. Omg it was soooo good! The lamb was super tender and nicely flavoured, the soup base had a nice kick to it but felt like I could have gone for regular spice. The noodles weren't soggy or overcooked - it was very nice overall. The bowls are huge... there's so much of everything. I can barely eat half. I would suggest to share with someone and get a side if you're not a big eater. That bowl was $12.99 but you can get more noodles without extra charge.

Service is good. I asked for no peanuts in my noodles and they got worried and asked if I had a nut allergy and when we paid, she asked if everything was ok which, showed us they care about their food.

Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the services was awful. I have order delivery many times from this place and it was the first time I went there for table services.
She was kind of rude to me and the other table beside me. I ordered a meal and a drink then she didn't serve me the drink first so I assumed she forgot and I didn't bother to remind her. What's strange was the other table of 3 people  got all the food first. So then my food finally came and she just dropped my meal and left without saying anything. She also seems impatient with other tables too and I could heard them were complaining about the server. At that moment I just wanted to leave the place as soon as possible. After she gave me the bill I noticed it included the drink I ordered which never came, so I told her and she didn't even apologize. I'm not sure what's wrong but I suggest them hire someone better. I will just stick with the delivery then."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for noodle soup - quick, filling (free noodle refills) and customizable! 

Their menu is one page double sided but although not a lot of options, they do a good job on what they are known for. 

What I have tried: the minced pork dry noodles, the tomato pork rib noodle soup, and the lamb rice noodle hot pot. 

Minced Pork Dry Noodles - this was the first dish I ever had from heynoodles. It was late so I knew I wouldn't be able to finish my meal so I wanted dry noodle vs. soupy noodles. This dish actually won me over with the noodle texture. Very flavourful indeed and has a good balance of meat, peas, cucumbers and noodles. It comes with a small bowl of soup on the side which is a plus. 

Lamb Rice Noodle - I would give this one an ok. It wasn't bad but I didn't really like the rice noodle. I prefer their standard noodles more... And the lamb was underwhelming for me... Didn't have enough lamb flavour and was a bit tough for me. However, my friends who also got lamb noodles (not rice noodle) did enjoy the lamb. The thing about the hot pot style is there are a lot of other added ingredients like bean curd, seaweed etc. That I really enjoyed.

Tomato pork rib noodle - this is my go to when I want a bowl of piping hot noodles. The tomato flavour is strong and they actually give you like one or two whole tomatoes. Pork ribs are usually tender with occasional pieces that are a bit tougher. I really like their soup base for this one. 

All their noodle soup can be customized with the toppings like cilantro, peanuts etc. You can also customize the spicy and numbness level. I always go with no spice and no numb. I have had mixed reviews whether regarding spice levels. I had some friends who found less spicy really spicy but some that found regular spicy not that spicy. I guess the only way to know is to try for yourself. 

The restaurant is not that big but people are in and out quite quickly. I haven't had to wait particularly long . They have some high tables which is a bit annoying in the winter when you have big winter coats but aside from that, it's a comfortable environment. Good place to have some good food and definitely able to hold a conversation without feeling the need to scream at each other. 

I am sure I will be back again and perhaps will be having my go to dishes though I do want to try the hot and sour potato noodle one."}
{"text":"First time here.. pretty satisfying noodles . Had the beef brisket which was very tender. Nice chewy noodles. I had less spicy and the soup was still fairly rich and flavourful.  Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"I got the house pork belly noodle soup, regular spicy for $11 and a chicken soft bone side dish for $6.99.

The pork belly was tender, flavourful and juicy. The soup I felt didn't match the meat. The soup tasted like it was sesame white paste with numb spicyness. It lacked flavour and harmony of spicyness and salt. I think it didn't have any salt so it tasted a little weird. 

The soup also included half an egg, one leaf of lettuce, some picked vegetables and peanuts.

The noodles were a little too soft for my liking but decent. Next time I will pay more attention to the options they give you. 

The chicken soft bone side dish was soy based with a touch of vinegar. It was good.

I would give this place another try if I was in the area but probably wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"A noodle place. Offers a selection of bowls, and some rice dishes. Choose your own level of spice and numbness. A number of garnishes are available including peanuts, and chickpeas.

You can ask for free noodle refills. 
Washrooms were clean and spacious.

A good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The food portions HUGE. There's not much difference between the flavours/soup base. At least I'm not able to tell. The cold dishes are must tries."}
{"text":"This is a great spot with delicious noodle soup. Beware, their spice levels are no joke. I love spicy food, but I can only tolerate the mild. I had the regular spicy the first time and basically cried throughout it. 

I've had the pork belly and it's tasty and filling. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Noodles with house special marinated pork ($10.99). You can pick the level of spiciness and level of numbness. I ordered less spicy (which was the perfect kick) and no numbness (I was scared to add any). Broth was nice and spicy. I like the peanuts topping, great crunch element and adds a nutty flavour. The marinated pork was tender and flavourful but I got some pieces that were toooo fatty for my liking. Large noodle portion but the noodles they use was OK to me in terms of texture. 

I like how this place opens til late (6AM). Restaurant is kind of small but clean. Service was average and food came out quickly. Good portion size (can add more noodles for free) and reasonable price. I would come back for late night eats if you want noodles and something spicy (can forgo spicy if it's not your thing lol)!"}
{"text":"Be careful when you accept their extra free noodles. Too much of a good thing will have you regretting it later. The soup base IS oily as others have noted but its good for brining flavour to meats. Spicy means spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Unlimited noodles refill hits the spot, while customization in spice, numbness plus a good menu make this a prime spot to satisfy your hunger.

What I've Got: House Special Marinated Pork noodles and Nutritious Lamb noodles

What I'd Get Next Time: House Special Marinated Pork

What I Wouldn't: The lamb was just okay. Wouldn't go anything above medium for spicy and numb either...

Classy spot with rather nice menus offers a variety of meats to go with their noodles in a traditional Chinese noodle soup format.

There are less noodle types than the typical choose your own noodle spots, but you get to optimize your spice and numbness level.

The lamb was a bit bland; the pork was pretty good. In both cases, the noodles were alright. They taste fresh but a bit overcooked. The great thing is THE UNLIMITED REFILLS!!! (AND that explains why it's slightly pricier)

Service was good - they were quick with the water, and a bit amused that I got three refills though.
Clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Heynoodles! A new China noodle shop that set its foot in Toronto soil!  I came here for lunch didn't expect much, but the meal was surprisingly quite satisfied.

The noodles selection are great, but majority of them are spicy, so if you can't eat spicy, your choices are very limited. I order the Beef Brisket Noodle and it came quickly.  Soup based was good and has a spicy kick which is acceptable for me, noodles was great and chewy but the beef brisket was however a little rough. What really made me happy is that they let you do refills for noodles!!  If you are a noodle lover like me and can eat at least 2 noodles, it is worth the money!

Overall, a decent noodle joint for a quick noodle fix and if you love spicy noodles and eat tons of then, the price they charge you is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends. They were offering $1 Chongqing noodles as their 3 year anniversary special. You can choose level of spicyness and numbness. If you've never had Sichuan dish before I would recommend 0 for numbness as the Sichuan peppercorns can really numb your mouth to any taste. The noodles doesn't come with any meat. We ordered side dishes to add to it."}
{"text":"The noodles here have a lot of flavours. You can choose the level of spiciness and numbness. The waitresses are attentive. Parking is good. The only thing I dislike about the style of noodles is that it is quite oily and fattening. The plus side of the noodle place is that it opens extremely late; almost 24 hours and you can refill noodles for free! Overall I would recommend this to other people!"}
{"text":"Tried the spicy wonton added with noodles.  Spicy and numbing.  Definitely hit the spot. Highly recommended.  Too bad my dish isn't eligible for refills.  :("}
{"text":"Been going there about a year now, beef noodle was always good until this few weeks, last few times we went in the beef is so tough is such disappointment, told the girl she said is the same all time, total BS, I guess after they get busy they just don't care anymore.

Dumplings and noodles is still good but beef stew sucks."}
{"text":"Noodle is too mediocre. Portion is huge. But it just tastes like a lot of MSG and hot sauce. They are expanding very fast already 3 places and opening two more soon. In general I am not a big fan of franchise noodle place. Unless there is nothing else to eat, I probably won't come to heynoodle again. By the way, at the same plaza, Magic Noodle is way better than here. Not my favourite noodle place still but better than here. Also they charge 10% tips in the bill. Can only use debit card above $20."}
{"text":"Orders: Sago dessert (OK if you want it cold, not great if you want it hot), minced meat dipping noodles (mediocre...)

Cons
- Service: considering how the dessert was $5, it would've been nice if the waitress didn't microwave the plastic container and then present the dessert to us as is. A chain dessert place would probably provide better service than that. 
- Cash only, debit for orders over $30, no credit cards"}
{"text":"As a first timer, I had to say I was slightly disappointed with my noodles. Overall, the noodles were fine and the texture was good but the soup was very bland. I got the house special marinated pork with the less spicy option. The smells and visuals were there and the pork was flavourful but the soup base was lacking. However, this may be due to the less spicy option so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Pros: They have free noodle refills! So I would say their pricing is pretty fair for what you get."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food, you will adore the aroma of this place once you walk in. And if spicy is not your thing, you have the option of removing it from your noodles completely since the spice level is totally customizable (along with the toppings and the oiliness). 

We ordered the House Special Marinated Pork Noodle, Noodles with Peas and Minced Meat, and Sichuan Style Hot & Spicy Wonton. 

The House Special noodle has a slightly sweet soup base. The marinated pork chunks are some of the most tender pork belly I have ever ate in my life. The fat literally melts in your mouth and the meat flavourful. 

The Peas and Minced Meat noodle has a slightly vinegar based soup. The peas in question were chickpeas, and the minced meat is actually chopped up pork chunks which is much better than ground pork.

The Sichuan wontons were very meaty and sat in a bowl of intimidating soup, but it was actually quite mild as it was probably cooked separately from the soup.

Arguably, they all have a similar soup base, and tops everything into the bowl as its ordered, but the service was fairly quick as a result. With unlimited noodle top-ups, Heynoodles is definitely a good place to try out if you haven't. 

And if you made it this far into my review...
Located on the back of the menu is the option of a 2-Piece or 3-Piece cold dish for $3.50 and $5 respectively (look for the vertical Chinese characters). The portions are huge for the price you pay (considering you can get enoki, lotus root, etc.) and makes for a wonderful appetizer as it is served almost instantly!"}
{"text":"This place is now open till 6am!  Amazing place for late night noodles.  I've been here a few times and yes there are actually people sitting here eating at 3 am in the morning!  

Friendly staff, plenty of parking.  I wouldn't mind seeing more selection, and other types of noodles."}
{"text":"Great Chinese noodle spot in a time when everyone is obsessed with Japanese ramen, let's not forget about the Chinese style soup noodle. It is a less rich and fatty broth than ramen, but in my opinion, that's makes it more appealing that this still has great flavour. 

Extra noodles are free and the portions are good."}
{"text":"The services is great. I ordered a Noodle with house special marinated pork  and the taste is good, but the soup base is super oily. 

Will come again next time and try different noodle bowl"}
{"text":"Another noodle joint located at Midland and McNiccoll close to other noodle places like Jim Chai and Magic Noodles. 

Most servers here speak Mandarin and English. I ordered the Soybean and Pork Intestine Noodles with green onions and peanuts. I chose the regular spicy and it was just the right amount, if you can handle more spice I recommend the extra spicy. There was a lot of flavour and a good amount of noodles, definitely affordable and filling. My sister ordered the Chicken and Mushroom Noodles, the broth was light and lacked flavour. She had to add chili oil to enhance its overall taste, aside from that she enjoyed it. 

As for payment, anything under 20$ they require cash only otherwise you can pay with cash, credit or debit. Overall, I would come back here for a quick meal that has decent noodles."}
{"text":"We accidentally stumbled upon this place after hot pot was closed, and we were so grateful. It was 2AM and we haven't eaten at all that day, so a steaming bowl of the house special pork noodles was DELICIOUS!!! And we got UNLIMITED NOODLE REFILLS. The food was actually really good, extremely flavorful, and the atmosphere was really chill and relaxing. The server was really friendly, but it kinda took a while to get her attention when we needed something even though it's a tiny place. And when I was paying, she kept telling me tip wasn't included and I told her I was gonna leave it on the table, but she kept insisting us to tip at the register which wasn't a big deal, but I don't really like seeing how much a customer tips/a server watching the customer tip."}
{"text":"On our late Friday night date night tradition we decided to try Hey Noodles out since we were in the area.

Serving Chongqing style noodles till 6am, its the first place I've been to where you can not only choose the level of spiciness but also level of \"numbness\" ie if you want to know how someone who gets botox injected into their lips feels like type of numbness:)

Being the ridiculous chili head I opted for the Signature Beef Noodle with extra spicy and extra numbness.  WTF why not????  The spice was no big deal but my lips really did go numb after a while which is a new experience for me;). The taste was good but a bit too oily and salty for my preference but I guess that's how they do it in Chongqing.

One great option is that you get free noodle refills and can also customize your order by adding extra peanuts, coriander, etc.. to suit your taste.

We also had the Schezuan style wontons and the chicken bones which were pretty good as well.

Overall not a bad place for late night eats in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Came here because I was really hungry and this place offers UNLIMITED noodle refills!!!!!!

We got the chicken hearts for starter. At first we were concerned that it will be too spicy so the waiter suggested to separate the sauce. It ended up being the perfect spice level. The chicken hearts were very delicious.

We got the beef noodles (first one on the menu). We chose the spice level and numbness which was somewhat different. The noodles came promptly after ordering which was awesome. 

I chose mild spice and it was too spicy for us!!! I drank a whole cup of water with only half of the noodles eaten. The soup base was thick and reminds me more like an oily sauce. I cannot imagine people drinking the soup as it's way too oily! 

The service was somewhat disappointing. The waiter never came to check up on us nor did he refill our waters. Took us forever to wave him down for the bill. 

Overall the noodles were tasty and different. I would go back for more noodles but with no spice."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and I can't say its my favourite place, but if mu friends/family wanted to come, I wouldn't refuse! 

Normally I get the noodles with the braised beef (pork belly). The meat is to die for, very tender and tasty! 

Today, I heard that today was the last day for $1 noodles for their 3rd year anniversary, so I had to come. 

Unfortunately, the $1 only applied to the basic noodle soup wth no meat. I was looking forward to getting the pork belly, and I asked if I could buy some and have it on the side but the waitress wouldn't allow it.

Since we couldn't order meat in our dishes, we decided to try their popcorn chicken. 
I didn't like it at all. Honestly, it just tasted like frozen chicken nuggets. I wish I didn't order it. 

Anyways, I always order regular spicy, with less numb. Perfect amount of spice for me, without being uncomfortable. I always order the noodles hard and it comes out perfectly. Their noodles have a great chew and goes really well with the soup base. The soup itself isn't that flavourful but its not bad. 

Oh! This place has unlimited noodles so I love taking advantage of that. 

The service here was decent. Some waitresses were nicer than others. I asked for extra peanuts  and extra pickled veggies and they gave us large portion on the side (at no extra cost, which I appreciated). 

Overall, this place is pretty good and I'd be down to come here if I were in the area. If you like spice and chewy noodles, this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"I love Spicy and I love Noodle.

Hey Noodles just opens at Midland and McNicoll right next to Jim Chai Kee. 

The interior decor is nice and trendy. Clean as it is still new. 

Menu is simple with a choice of noodle or rice bowls. You can pick how spicy it is (or non spicy at all) plus the chewiness of noodle (soft or hard). And the best thing is Free additional noodles if you are a bigger eater.

Beef Sirloin Noodle Extra Numb ($10.95) 
The beef is of good quality and tender!! The noodles has a good bite. And yes it was spicy....... 

Since most of the spiciness is by adding chili oil so it can be quite oily. (Pro Tip: Don't play with your phone while eating!!)

During lunch hour, it took quite awhile for the food to be ready (+15 minute), I hope you have a long lunch break.

Cash and Debit!"}
{"text":"decided to try this place since magic noodle was packed out the door.   

It is what you expect.  AYCE noodles.. although i didn't go for seconds.  I ordered the sour spicy soup which i asked for less spicy.  It was perfect spiciness.  But not enough meat IMO. 

if you want carb overload of noodles, this is the place to go.  Its also not the cheapest place for noodles.  I cant complain about taste.. It was good if you like this kind of spicy oil type of soup.  prepare for your lips to stink for a while too.."}
{"text":"The noodles are good, taste delicious.you can choose different level of spicy. Even we choose the regular spice, we would not feel too spicy.  The small dishes are not that good as we thought. What we taste on them is the spicy."}
