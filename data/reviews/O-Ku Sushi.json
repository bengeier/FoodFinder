{"text":"My family and I went to the soft opening and the service and food were both amazing. The food came quickly and the water and wine at the table were never empty. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi spot! Cool atmosphere. Half off sushi on mon and wed 5-7. My favorite was the mermaid roll, but we also got the rainbow roll, kiwi roll and seaweed salad! All delicious"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good and so was the food but it was so loud in there really couldn't enjoy my time with friends."}
{"text":"Since Enso closed, was looking for a new spot in town to satisfy my pallete for sushi. Went with a group for dinner as Oku was disappointing both in food and service. The food we ordered as a group took FOREVER to make, I'm talking well over an hour. We came after 8pm so its not like it was a super busy point in the evening like 6pm is. Some of us ordered appetizers and that didn't even help lessen the irritation of getting our food served in a timely manner. If this was a place that truly cooks food fine, it take time to heat up things but this is a sushi spot and most of us ordered raw items. It could be understandable if the restaurant waited to have all the food brought to everyone at once but even that took too long. Finally, I had to have my food remade and I was even charged for something I didn't order but someone else at the table did. Multiple Mishaps absolutely deserves a negative review as I spent almost $50 on an evening that was memorable for the wrong reasons not the right ones. I definitely have to discourage people from considering here as I would have liked to know all this myself before going."}
{"text":"Fool me once...this was our second visit to O-Ku.  While the sushi is quite good and fresh, the service leaves something to be desired.  After a first unpleasant visit ( which we chalked up to Queens Feast), we thought we'd give it another try.  We went early (5:30), and even though there were only a handful of occupied tables, the hostesses hemmed and hawed for over 5 minutes before telling us they could not offer us a table due to reservations scheduled at 6:15 and 6:30.  When we promised we wouldn't linger, they gave us a table.  We ordered right away, then waited about 35 minutes before our food started to come out.  No wonder they were worried about seating us! Our waiter never came back to check on us, and when it was time to pay, he left the check on the table (even though I was holding out my card), and then came back a long while later. The whole visit felt slow and unfriendly.
Shame on me for giving O-Ku another try."}
{"text":"Duck confit buns, edamame with truffle oil, and spring rolls were amazing. The hot and heavy roll was really pricey and very underwhelming. There is plenty of variety on the chef's specialties menu that sushi rolls don't even need to be ordered. Service is friendly and quick, but not rushed."}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on the food but we could not make it past the pretentious staff! They lie about the wait times and give preferred service and entry to friends or better looking people. They were rude to my date and insulted her.  Thank you O-Ku Sushi for embarrassing me and ruining my night before it even got started unless you're a hipster douchebag good luck even getting seated we never did. i would not recommend this place to me enemies."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Charlotte! The staff from top to bottom truly care about your experience and will go out of their way to make sure you leave happy. The food is fresh and made with love. Definitely recommend the omakase (Chef's tasting menu) and the O-Ku nigiri!"}
{"text":"eh not much to write home about. was looking forward to this for months and was let down a bit. it's way over priced and the quality is good but certainly nothing to knock your socks off. the waitress was nice just out of touch. and the bathrooms - for the entire establishment two toilets and since it's charlotte, the two crappers are for all genders. oh and the one had a floor of piss. it's so damn loud in there too you can't even hear the ppl you're with. certainly won't be returning. much better sushi, better price, and cleaner places in the area."}
{"text":"Wife had Table side lobster......wow!  Succulent and delicious.  Sizzled in the truffle butter until the final bite.  Unadventurous shell fish allergy me...the best teriyaki chicken and rice I've ever had.  Excellent bar keeps.  Girl and the guy working June 10th evening service both impeccable.   Bravo to ownership here.  My first 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Stuffed my face for their half price sushi happy hour! Great ambience, beautiful decor and cheap sushi for a elegant date night. We had their lemon salmon, tuna wrapped, spider, rainbow, and dragon rolls. All for $50. Will definitely be back 5-7pm Monday or Wednesday."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for something great to come to south end and it has finally arrived!! Could not be more pleased with O-Ku if i tried!! We loved it so much we went two nights in a row. The service, food and wine are all phenomenal. Definitely the best sushi (and many other things) in Charlotte!! You must go, but please leave room for us at the bar :)"}
{"text":"Wow what a pleasant surprise. Just moved to Charlotte this afternoon and decided to walk outside and grab a quick dinner when we stumbled into the soft opening of O-Ku. The wine pairing was great and slightly unusual in that we had South African and Oregon wines that were crisp, different (from the usual standards), and delicious. We split Spicy Edamame (yummy but not markedly unusual), Ceviche Tacos ( nice presentation and very flavorful), and Miso soup. For the main course we had the Mermaid Roll (fresh with a new twist), Potato Roll (the winner of the evening!!), and Curry Duck (large portion cooked perfectly with unusual type of eggplant). The service was excellent from the hostess, server Megan, and manager Justin. The ambiance was very nice in such an old eclectic building and the indirect lighting and lighting fixtures really set the tone for a cozy evening. They plan on having half price sushi happy hours Monday and Wednesday and we definitely plan on returning.  What a great evening. So happy to know that we can walk outside Ashton South End and enjoy such a nice (and healthy) evening. Thank you O-Ku!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great especially when it's happy hour half off!! My only complaint is that it takes forever for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Pretty much a home run for me. Most of the traditional set ups have minimal variety. This places delivers options with flavor! Definitely plan to stop by next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Went there a few times and each time was better than next. Sushi has to be one of the best in Charlotte. Love there Chirashi bowl because of how fresh and filling it is. Also appetizer I think there black magic is pretty different and unique. It's tempura lobster on top of squid ink rice which is just delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to check this place out for a bit now. We finally decided on a date night on Saturday. The only reservation time was 9:45, so we booked it! 

The layout in O-KU is very nice and open. We chose to sit at the sushi bar to watch the action. I am wondering if their reservation system was correct cause it didn't look like it was that slammed (aka, there should have been reservations open before 9:45).

I settled on the bourbon strawberry drink and my husband got a glass of sake. My cocktail was fantastic! Nice flavors!

Since we had a 9:45 reservation, we had been to one place before this. Thus, we were just going to order a few things. Our waitress kept pressuring us to order more. I was a bit disappointed by this experience because, after we did not order more, she never returned (actually, that is a lie, as she returned to bring the check.). She spent all her time on the guys beside us who were going to town and ordering half the menu. Literally, other people filled up our water and brought us stuff. One waitress was in particularly sweet and amazing. I grabbed her name at the end cause she was that awesome: Zoey. However, our actual assigned waitress was easily one of the worst I have had ever had.

We ordered the salmon tar tar (side note: I asked our waitress whether she liked the tuna tar tar better or the salmon tar tar. Her answer was \"well, you should pick based on whether you like salmon or tuna\".....no joke yall. Sorry, I am probably being harsh here, as maybe she was just having a bad day), the tuna wrapped roll, and the mermaid roll. The salmon tar tar was absolutely fantastic. Beautiful presentation with the quail egg on top. Absolute deliciousness and is my second favorite tar tar dish in the city now!! Unfortunately, it went slightly down from there. The tuna wrapped roll was pretty good. Nothing amazing but definitely tasted fresh. My hubby liked it a lot though. The mermaid roll was a big dud. Like 75% rice and super bland tasting. 

The bill compared to the food was not proportionate. I left just feeling very underwhelmed. 2.5 star review rounded up for cool restaurant layout and a super delish appetizer!

However, will absolutely return a bit more down the line to see if these kinks are worked out and will update my review then!"}
{"text":"Ate here today, after typing in Sushi on Open Table, this popped up.  

We were worried when pulling up that we were underdressed, but when we arrived there were those in business casual and then some folk in panthers jerseys.

We started with the spicy edemame. Delish.

All ordered and loved the miso.

Then each were extremely satisfied with our rolls.

We'll be back. Hopefully some more veggie options will end up on the menu.  :)

Perfect for a date or happy hour: half off sushi on Monday/Wednesday."}
{"text":"Restaurant fails to provide soy sauce, wasabi, ginger, chop sticks, etc with delivery service orders. Very expensive to be so cheap in providing those items."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy, upscale sushi experience. We very much enjoyed all of our food, especially the ones that were on the Half Price options on Monday & Wednesay nights. The servers are very attentive and well versed on the menu. I personally prefer Ru Sans because I'm a Die-hard fan for life...but O-ku was definitely a wonderful fancy, date night experience"}
{"text":"During my tenure in Charlotte, I only visited O-Ku once, but I have to say out of the limited choices for sushi restaurants in the Uptown area, it's probably your best bet.  

The ambience here is definitely on the upbeat and trendy side - even on a Tuesday evening it was pretty bumpin'.  I was probably here for like 4 hours or something and never did I feel like the place was getting too quiet or anything like that.  I would recommend making a reservation since it seems like the place gets pretty crowded... actually, it could have been Restaurant Week, which would explain why it was so busy... but my memory fails me.  The decor is modern - place is dimly lit but not so dark that you can't see your food or your company.   Service was pretty good, if I recall correctly.

As for the food - we got an assortment of several different things ranging from spicy edamame, some appetizers, to an assortment of their finer sushi.  The spiced chili edamame was a good concept, but the sauce was a bit strange and I think I prefer the normal salted kind.  The yellowtail carpaccio was nicely marinated - I always enjoy a crudo/fish carpaccio as an appetizer.  We also had the five-spiced pork belly - this left a bit to be desired as well.  I prefer my pork belly melt-in-your-mouth style and this was on the chewier side.  We also tried one of their rolls as well as their sashimi - the fish is pretty decent, but it's by no means top grade sushi.  However, it's good enough to satisfy any sushi craving.

In short, probably your best option for sushi in Uptown Charlotte, nice service, and excellent ambience/atmosphere/vibe."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Really good sushi. The inside of the restaurant is also very pretty with wood branches on the columns. We had the spring roll which are very good. And I highly recommend the kiwi Kano roll, it has kiwi and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. Sexy atmosphere. 

We went on a Monday night for a birthday dinner. When we walked in my initial thoughts were, this place is sexy AND it is WAY too loud in here to be half full. 

The hostess repeatedly asked us a ton of questions because she could barely hear us despite the fact that we were standing directly in front of her. They asked a TON of questions before seating us, including our phone number. Not sure why they needed all the info as we didn't have a reservation and didn't need to wait for a table. 

Our server was excellent. Her name is Linda. We found out at the end of the night that she was in training, but she did a great job. 

We had two sushi rolls: the mermaid roll and the kiwi-kani roll. The kiwi roll was fantastic. It was full of blue crab, tightly rolled, and had a sweet and salty balance I love. 

We also had the curry duck. We were expecting a Thai type of entree with a large amount of sauce. Instead, it was a sliced breast with a curry marinade and some awesome eggplant. Recommend. 

TL; DR: get the kiwi roll. Sit in Linda's section. Enjoy if you can hear your table mates."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try o-Ku after seeing it on a best sushi list. Some of the rolls were decent, but overall very underwhelming. Especially not worth the price. I hate to give a bad review, but I was just unimpressed.  My husband and I really disliked the potato roll-- I Love sushi and I love French fries, but the combination was awful.  I will say it's a great atmosphere and great service though."}
{"text":"This spot is awesome and I am glad my coworker took me here.  Very different in the selection of Sashimi that is offered and the Lobster Temaki was phenomenal.  Every piece of sashimi we had was very fresh tasting and had a well-rounded mix of flavors.  Our waiter was very good and he really knew the menu.  We tried his recommendations and we were not disappointed at all.  I hope when I come back to Charlotte, I get a chance to come back here.  Thank you to the staff for an excellent dinner."}
{"text":"Good but not great. 
If your sushi is good we don't need soy sauce, so why are you pouring a giant bowl of it? .... oh wait I do need it!? Turns out I do. Things are under seasoned or just missing something.
For drinks I did like the Tea-quilla but most others were too sweet.
Lobster Temaki. First of all why anyone serves a a dish with 3 pieces is beyond me. How do I split that evenly with my friend!? (but that's just a personal irritatation) it's mostly rice, you can't taste the lobster which kind of defeats the purpose.
The potato roll was pretty good, but poorly executed. The potato (exterior) was a little over fried, rice was mushy. Seemed like a cool idea.
We had a few other dishes too but you get the idea.
I was hoping for at least one \"oh, wow, how did they do that?\" moment for the price point, but it just didn't deliver. Honestly all of the issues come down to the rice being too mushy and things being underseasoned. The fish seemed fine but without the rice being right everything just ends up bleh."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite sushi place in Charlotte when I want to feel super upscale in an extremely lavishly decorated environment. The lighting is low, the crowd is great, service was great. I asked for our server to surprise me with her favorite appetizers and main dishes. She exceeded all expectations."}
{"text":"O-Ku is probably my favorite restaurant I've been to since moving to Charlotte 5 months ago! 

We were told the wait would be 45 minutes so my friend and I waited at the bar. It was a bit crowded but the atmosphere was great, and the beer I got (Sapporo) was delicious and went great with my sushi later! I was having such a great time I didn't keep track of time but it definitely didn't seem like 45 minutes before we were seated. They still gave us a free appetizer to \"apologize for our wait\" though!

Sit at the sushi bar if possible! This is where we were seated and it was the best location in the restaurant. We were on the far end so we watched all the sushi and appetizers line up on the bar as they came out of the kitchen--they all looked delicious! We asked the waiters questions about the dishes we saw a few times and they were very kind and knowledgeable. 

The food itself was amazing! The free appetizer they gave us was the whitefish crudo, and we ordered south end shrimp as well. I would highly recommend both! I also ordered two rolls. I loved the lemon salmon roll. I worked at a sushi restaurant for 3 years in college so I've had more than my fair share of sushi and it was both delicious and unique enough to impress me. I also got the potato roll. The fried potato flavor was delicious but definitely overwhelming and I couldn't taste too much of the other flavors. It was still good and would be a great choice for a tentative new sushi eater. With the appetizers two rolls was too much for me to finish and they boxed my leftovers up nicely with extra soy sauce, ginger and wasabi. I think two rolls or an appetizer and a roll would be a filling meal for most!

Overall the ambiance, service and best of all food was great! I'll definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"O-Ku... O-No. this place is extremely overrated and overpriced for the amount of fish to rice ratio. The appetizers were wonderful but their sushi is dreadful. We may be back for appetizers and drinks but will never order their sushi. I wanted to love it since it's so close to my home, but I'll pass."}
{"text":"This place is New York style kids!   We had an awesome experience.  This upscale venue has a great staff, fresh sushi & sashimi, the duck breast was delicious too.  The saki was supe"}
{"text":"Best sushi in charlotte. The salmon nigiri is a must have, great drinks and the chili oil edamame!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was definitely crowded and loud for a Tuesday night. But the food completely made up for how busy it was. I sat with my friend at the sushi bar. It was kind of neat to watch the workers go to town. 

Starters..
·Edamame - very good!
·Vegetable Egg Rolls - comes with two split in half - mostly consisting of cabbage -  very good!

Beverages..
·Gin-a-tonic - made to perfection, nice and strong!

My Meal..
·Side of Vegetables - only brocolini & onions with Brown Sauce by request - excellent!
·Side of Rice - Warm and sticky - very good!

My Friend Ordered.. 
·Sashimi Tacos- tinny, but tasty. She'd order them again!
·Spicy Tuna- Excellent!

       ···She loved her whole meal!!


-Second time-

Out of Edamame, bummer! I was really looking forward to them. And it's a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Went to O-Ku last night for a friends birthday who was visiting from Los Angeles. We had an amazing time. She was very impressed with the staff, the decor, and of course, the food. Our server Allison was great, she even brought us prossecco toast to \"cheers\" to my friends birthday. We basically \"toured\" the menu and got a variety of items from each section. Her favorite was the lobster toban yaki, very very very yummy! Everything was delicious. My friend loved her birthday experience. Thanks O-Ku, you sure know how to make a girl feel special!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte hands down. I usually rag on Charlotte as I'm from DC. I've eaten extensively in LA, San Fran, NYC, Chicago, ATL, etc. The sushi here is on par with the best in those places but at freakin Charlotte prices. Yeah. They are going to be seeing a lot of me. Oh yeah, and the service was great. Folks were friendly and knowledgeable about where they buy every last piece of fish from. You just can't beat that."}
{"text":"Tried O-Ku for the first time with my family since I was visiting from CA this weekend, and was getting tired of eating so much Southern bbq, hehe. 

TLDR; the sushi is fresh and well prepared, but portions are small for the price. Great for a date, group parties and special occasions. 

Upon entering the restaurant a friendly host and waitress seated us almost immediately and took our drink orders. I was impressed by the cool ambiance and modern decor of the interior. Not many people on a Sunday evening at 6:30p, surprisingly.

Our waitress Rachel did a lovely job and accommodated my non-English speaking parents just fine. We weren't sure how much to order and my dad generally doesn't eat very much, so we started off with two special rolls, a maki roll, and an appetizer (sashimi tacos) to share between three people. We soon discovered that we hadn't ordered enough, so added another sashimi taco and a tuna wrapped roll. 

Mermaid roll - deep fried and tasty though not spectacular. I liked how it was lightly crisp and not overly battered. 

Salmon lemon roll - neatly prepared roll with salmon on the exterior that seemed fresh. the bit of lemon is a nice touch. The rest of the roll is like a simple California roll and while it tasted great, I wish I got something more interesting for what I paid.  

Yellowtail maki - good. It's exactly what you would expect. 

Tuna wrapped roll - tasty and satisfying. I'm a sucker for eel sauce and spicy mayo so this met my expectations just fine. Fish was good and well proportioned. 

Sashimi taco - not that exciting. tasted mostly like pico de Gallo salsa with a hint of fish. terribly small portions and not a whole lot of flavor. 

Overall the rolls and fish were well done and tasted fine. I just don't think it was incredibly memorable, creative, or even filling. Perhaps it's better they don't overdo it on the sushi rice, but at the same time it seemed like the portions were a bit scant for the price. You're paying for ambiance and location, I suppose. I did appreciate that they had uni pasta on the menu even though I didn't order it. 

Parking is easy at Atherton Mills. 3 stars for solid service and food, but lacks anything special for the price."}
{"text":"Best dining experience I have had in Charlotte. I purposely waited to write this review because I didn't believe I enjoyed a meal as much as I did this one. First of all...the atmosphere is incredible. High energy, great decor. The use of up-lighting to highlight and illuminate is spectacular. The spacing is cozy, yet sufficient. I felt completely immersed in all the action. Now, the food. I work in the restaurant industry. I love food and this place did not dissapoint. In fact, it elevated my palette and sent me into sensory over load. The edamame  with pink Himalayan salt and black truffle oil is amazing. The curry duck breast is divine and the lobster and wild mushroom cooked table side is an incredible presentation and delicious as well. You have to have some sushi. The sushi plates are beautiful and taste even better then they look. The A5 Wagyu Nigiri is the most amazing bite of food that has ever entered my mouth. I will be back soon and often...many more things I want to try. I suggest making a reservation, this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Definitely very good sushi. However, it is extremely pricey - Manhattan level.  Dinner for 4 and a couple beers and drinks $300+. Once the hype wears off and another new place comes to town, they will need evaluate their pricing - or they will become the next Nikko (yesterday's news)."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and wonderful service! I highly recommend you make a reservation tho - I came here with a friend on a Tuesday and there was a 30 minutes wait. I was running a little late so my friend received a complimentary yellow tail carpacio from the manager. We ordered the Bourbon tea and lychee martini and they were delicious but not too strong. I had the sushi sashimi platter ($35 version) and my friend had the tempura roll and sauteed veggies. I was quite impressed with the quality of the fish. They are up to par with other Michelin star sushi restaurants but you don't break the bank here (MF sushi in Houston comes to mind)! While we waited for our food, the waiter dropped a couple of appetizers: the shumai and dumplings combo and their version of bang bang shrimp - all complimentary of the house! I'm typically not a fan of bang bang shrimp because of the batter and the small shrimp inside of the batter but their version was big and so fresh and not overcoated with batter - I'd actually recommend this app and will get it next time! My sushi sashimi combo: I asked the waiter to serve only fish on my plate (take away any sweet tamago, fish ore, steamed shrimp and all the nonsense) and he delivered without charging me a dime extra! There was a crab stick sushi that I thought I'd dislike but it was so tasty since the crab was REAL snow crab (yum!) The atmosphere is a great fine dining, perfect for a nice date and for important business outing. Based on the quality of the food, the cost, the service and the ambiance, this place easily earns a 5 star!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to for date nights and special occasions. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the sushi is the best I've had in Charlotte - try the Ora King salmon and the pink Himalayan sea salt and truffle oil edamame. They are fantastic! The wagyu beef is also delicious but be prepared to pay a lot for a little and cook it yourself (even though it says table side presentation). While this spot is pricey and the service isn't always great, if you're looking for a cool place with amazing sushi, this is it!"}
{"text":"Convenient location, great decor and really great food.  Me and a lady friend were about to eat at USNWC and decided to just ask yelp where to get some sushi on our way back into town instead.  I'm happy we did.

My date wanted some sake and Dragon god sounds like it would be pretty tasty, right?  Oh, it was.  A little fruity for my taste, but no complaints.  We also went ahead and ordered the salmon nigiri with creme fraise and truffle.  Beautiful flavors that worked well together.  Although something else with a little crunch to counterbalance the rice, salmon and cream might be more my thing.  Then the waygu carpaccio and the roast duck buns.  Both, spot on.  I mean, really good.  Buttery, fatty raw beef with a quail egg.  The buns were pretty much boa tacos.  Relatively new to me, but liking this trend.  The duck was cooked perfectly and the hoisin was perfect.

Lots of places in town I still need to try, but good to know I now have a go-to when near southend."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in for Happy Hour. And boy does this place get packed! If you can, I'd get there right when the doors open! 

Anyway, we scored a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of Brut Rose. It was delish! 

Since all the makimono rolled sushi was half-off we decided to order two rolls: the Rainbow roll and the Dragon roll. 

After the bartender found out it was my friend's first visit, the kitchen sent out an order of one of their most popular apps - the South End Shrimp. They are delicious!!! The spicy sauce and peanuts combined make such a nice flavor combination! It's definitely a good choice to start your meal! And major shout-out to the kitchen staff for treating us so nice! 

The sushi rolls were both excellent! Super fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Dragon roll. I just love the tempura shrimp! If you're debating this is definitely one you should try! 

Overall, it was a great meal! And not to mention the service here is always so great! I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"If you like legit sushi - Nigiri and sashimi, this is just not going to be my first choice in Charlotte.... (Ru San's all the way).

It's $6 for one piece of Nigiri...  

If you like Americanized sushi it's flat out okay.  But, the prices are egregious.  If you'd like to try it, go right ahead.

But, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi place in Charlotte! I have been to over 10 sushi places and this one tops them all with their quality of sushi and service."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in the QC!!!! 

I'm very picky about sushi and have found my new go to place. 

The customer service is on point and the atmosphere is spot on. 

It's a great place to grab a sushi roll, a drink with friends, or a whole meal!

I highly suggest truffle edamame, seaweed salad, white fish crudo (personal fav), spring roll, miso soup, and the potato roll. 

I can't speak highly enough about the amazing culture, food, and friendliness of this restaurant. 

Kimball, you have brought the sushi scene in Charlotte to a whole new level. From one business owner to another, 6 out of 5 stars! Superb! 

Y'all won't want to miss out on this place! I promise you won't be disappointed and you won't find a better sushi place in the whole city!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. This place is an amazing culinary experience. I'm glad we found this place on yelp. We made reservations on Monday just in case. We didn't need it but I'd still recommend it. It was my 28th birthday and I couldn't pick a better choice for dinner.

Tiffany, our wonderful server, was super nice, prompt, and helpful with recommendations. She is awesome. 

We started with the amazing edamame with truffle oil that was on the house and they were the best edamame we've ever had. We ordered the Wagyu tartare, duck buns, and BOGO dragon roll and salmon/lemon roll. The sushi was the best. On par with your 3 Michelin star restaurants. They just melt in your mouth like butter. Delicious!

To top it off, the great sushi artists Kap and Steven made our night even greater by making us a seared tuna and yellowtail carpaccio plate which were just as great.

I love this place. The ambience is highly well decorated and inviting as well. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"O-Ku is a great place to go if you are looking for trendy, not so authentic but still really delicious sushi. The environment is great for a date night. It is definitely the best sushi in South End. We got three rolls: the Salmon and Lemon Roll, Potato Roll and Tuna Wrapped Roll. The Potato Roll and Tuna Wrapped Roll were both absolutely delicious. The Salmon and Lemon Roll was kind of weird tasting and we didn't even finish it. The Miso soup was also good as were the cocktails, especially the Lychee Martini. Service was friendly and inviting, food tasted fresh but came out fast. Overall, a solid date spot and some yummy sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi = good
Service = horrendous
If you have 3 hours to kill and like sushi, give it a try."}
{"text":"NYC scene with NYC prices. I gave them 4*'s because... well this isn't NY. This is an occasional treat yourself sushi place. The prices are steep and the choices are not super unique. The quality of the food is excellent. The atmosphere is pretty similar to 5 church... professional, classy. Initially, I went with a group of friends and we had a blast after we waited/hovered around the table to leave. I think we waited about 1 hour. But yeah, it was a random last minute thing. We did not have reservations. Worth checking out and seeing for yourself! The service was fantastic once we were seated."}
{"text":"This place is impressive in every area... the hostess' greeting when you walk in, the skill and friendliness of the bartenders, the quality and value of the food (especially with the sushi specials on Wednesday!) and even the VERY impressive  bar manager (Larisa) introducing herself and making sure everything is OK.  I had my first visit recently, and will be back very often.  There are many choices to eat/have a drink in Charlotte and I put this place at the very top.  Keep up the great work ladies and gents!!"}
{"text":"We arrived just after 5:30 pm as we wanted to avoid a wait for a table.  Even though the restaurant was almost empty, we were seated at a less than desirable table.  Shortly thereafter, two other groups were seated flanking our table and within ear shot with most of the very large room still empty.  Why cram everyone into one small corner of the restaurant?   Sure, it makes things easier for staff but we are paying to dine out and wish to enjoy the experience.  
The music was uncomfortably loud.  We asked if it could be turned down and were immediately told, \"probably not\".  Why?  There were less than ten people in the whole place.  Who would care if the music was less than blasting?  
We ordered 3 of the specialty items.  The first two were very tasty.  The third was overpriced and somewhere between \"meh\" and \"yuck\".  I know this place is all the rage but I totally don't get it.  We left hungry but decided to cut our losses and leave as we were just annoyed by the attitude of the wait staff and the less than desirable overall experience."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how amazing O-Ku is!  The fish is fresh and such a vast variety of options!  The bartenders are on top of their game and treat you right every time.  I have been so impressed by the quality, service and atmosphere!  I would recommend to any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"Went here a month ago. I liked the food and the drinks. I went back because I wanted the cocktail called Fallout. it was totally different the second time. It was sour. I was very disappointed. So I cannot give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Five stars all around, if u could give more I certainly would. 
First, the Valet guy was extremely nice and not only did he move cars but he held doors open and was funny and polite. 
Second, The ambiance is so nice, loud, and dark, it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say, not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast.
Third, the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full, but the bar did not disappoint. 
Fourth, menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious, the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting, the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi, unfortunately I forgot what it was called.
Last but not least, the service was great, my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful, sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Should have known better when the hostess at the front said \"the server on that side is a little overwhelmed\". Arrived 5 minutes late to half price sushi on a Wednesday and did not get the special. Ordered sushi, cocktails, and appetizers. Appetizers and cocktails came promptly but after 45 mins of no sushi, I asked the server to cancel the order as we had to leave for another event. The server said that the sushi was on its way and could not be canceled. Could not believe myself. Not coming back for awhile. Overpriced and lack of good service is evident. Don't be fooled by upscale environment."}
{"text":"Loved the spider roll and the salmon lemon roll. Will be coming back for rainbow roll with snow crab per server recommendation."}
{"text":"The earthy feel that surrounds you along with the staff that work together as a team to make your visit here a marvelous one. The flavors of the fresh, smooth and silky well prepared sushi were to die for. The staff went above and beyond to make our time here the most pleasant. I would highly recommend this place for any sushi lover that appreciates the quality of good food."}
{"text":"Visited o-ku the other night with some friends who gather twice a year to celebrate our accomplishments. Our visit started out great as we had called ahead to get a spot in the restaurant.  Our server Farmer made great suggestion on items to pick from.  Our server start dishing insults immediately calling one of our friends Viola Davis and then tried fluttering with her later in the evening.   Our sushi came out and none of us could locate the avocado on the roll which we brought to our server attention.  As conversation continued farmer felt it was his job to censor me and inform us our conversation isn't appropriate for the restaurant. Repeatedly telling me he was serious and if the place was packed we wouldn't be allowed to talk .  Our group of MD's were having a discuss about vagina research for the record.   We called over the manager and she informed us they have regular issues with farmer and his mouth.    There are too many places to try in CLT that offer better service and above par staff.   Go try the food but avoid FARMER at all cost.   Guess O-ku has rules of engagement."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. Awesome and adventurous Asian fusion food, we have not been disappointed by anything we have tried! I suggest ordering at least 2 items per person to start, sharing it all, then ordering a second round!
The Duck buns are my personal favorite, but the O-ku spring rolls and Rock Shrimp Salad take a close second! My husband loves the sushi and variety of seafood options. The manager, Kristen, is very friendly and gives great recommendations for food and drink. The servers have always been pleasant and attentive even when it was busy!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Every single person who we met was so kind, friendly, and helpful. The food was also great! We had the potato roll, edamame, and chicken teriyaki. All of which were good! The chicken teriyaki felt light despite being on a bowl of rice. As this was our first time we received complimentary shrimp and pork dumplings which I would get again, for sure. Our server Tiffany was awesome and so nice! She made the whole experience easy! Lots of parking available but also right off the light rail so you can walk, bike, or ride the rail to get there."}
{"text":"I would consider O-Ku the more upscale sushi restaurants Charlotte has to offer. The atmosphere is definitely classy and the service was great. I do understand the vibe they are going for with the  very low lighting but it was a much in my opinion. 

The sushi was all delicious and the rolls were large.  I would recommend the spicy tuna roll. The prices are higher than most sushi spots in Charlotte but you are in a classy atmosphere and receiving superior service. They do have half off rolls on Monday and Wednesday if ordered during happy hour. 

It gets quite crowded so I would recommend getting a reservation. The parking lot is small and a  pain to get in and out of. They do offer valet parking."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I find Oku to be 5 stars in all respects; Food, service, drinks! I apologize for the mammoth review in advance but this place deserves it!

First off, 2 tips to make a great experience at Oku. First, call and make a reservation. Sometimes it can take 45 to get a table even on a weekday... Watch out for Mondays/Wednesdays (5pm-7pm) as it can get especially crowded because of the BOGO sushi rolls happy hour!
Second, sit at the sushi bar! It's great because you can talk to the Chefs; they're super knowledgeable about their craft! However, it is a tight squeeze so a minor trade off for the experience. Purse hooks under the bar btw

For a night, I'd have to recommend the Uni Pasta, Nigiri, and Yellowtail Carpaccio. (detailed reviews below) However, honestly, everything on the menu is so good. You can't go wrong!
 
If I had to pick one dish, UNI PASTA. It's mind blowing. The dish really brings out the flavor of Uni (which is unique I admit) and it complements well with the candied bacon and the creamy pasta. Candied Bacon OP. I always get two of this dish, If you're up for new things, I highly recommend this. 

2nd Favorite: The specialty nigiri. Absolutely must try the salmon with the creme fraiche. The garnish highlights the salmon beautifully and everything melts together in your mouth. Hamachi/Yellowtail nigiri...excellent flavor. the serrano pepper adds a nice bite. Tuna with the togarashi is also fantastic but probably my least favorite nigiri. (This speaks to how excellent the other nigiri were.) The snapper with the yuzu tobiko was good and very bright in flavor. Also, chef recommended not dipping in soy sauce b/c he preps it already.

3rd. Yellowtail carpaccio...an excellent dish. I've seen it done a couple of times before but the mango garnish really adds something special to the taste of the dish. Again, another extremely well thought out dish. I can't recommend it enough. This dish does go quickly though but I still absolutely think it's worth it. 

Rolls:
Black Magic (specialty)...this is great for someone who wants something a little different. the presentation is really cool (rice is black). not my favorite roll though despite the lobster and cool appearance factor! 
Salmon Lemon Roll...because of the lemon flavor, this is a very fresh tasting roll, this for those who don't like sushi covered with sauce and just want to taste the fish. I consider it a basic, simple roll.
Potato Roll...unique roll bc of  shoestring potatoes. You'd think it would be heavy but it's not! Paired with the eel sauce, it is a savory sushi! One of my favorites to share because it's quite filling
Mermaid Roll... the scallops add an amazing touch. I think this is a good dish to understand the innovation that comes from the sushi chefs. it's a savory sushi and it's a very cohesive taste.
Tuna Wrapped: Add Serrano pepper to it!! It creates a delicious flavor combo! But only if you don't mind the bite of the pepper! 
Spicy Rainbow: My absolute favorite roll so far! Filled with lump crab, and topped with fresh fish, and multicolored tobiko, this roll is just packed with flavor. A combination of fresh and savory, I think the taste is just fantastic. The sushi chef explained to me each colored tobiko piece has it's own flavor. Yellow for citrus, green for wasabi infused, and black/red for the traditional tobiko flavor. It's quite subtle but an excellent innovation.

Chef Specials: 
Duck Buns...a great dish. It's kind of a take on Peking Duck and very savory! My least favorite special but again, that speaks to the quality of the other dishes. 
Steak Tartare...I think this dish is interesting. probably one of the only dishes that didn't blow my mind
White Fish Crudo...another piece of innovation from the chefs. it combines olive oil and lemon to highlight the fish in the dish. it doesn't seem like it'd work but it comes together nicely
South End Shrimp...just get it. you won't regret this savory dish!
Lobster Temaki...my second favorite chef special! the hand roll really brings out the flavor of the lobster. there's nothing flashy on this dish. It's so comforting. it's just plain simple honest lobster, seaweed, rice, and greens. it sounds simple but again, soo soo good!
#1 is Yellowtail Carpaccio!  

Drinks: 
I had the Lychee Martini, Cherry Soda Mocktail, & Lychee Soda. All were excellent though the cherry soda was my favorite! Yuzu Mule is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last night for dinner and this time we brought a friend! The service from the minute you walk in the door to the minute you get sat was exceptional! The atmosphere was great and everyone was so welcoming! We got sat right away and our waiter came rather quickly with our drinks. We tried the southend shrimp, salmon tartar, and the yellowtail carpaccio for appetizers. Let me tell you they were delicious!! The shrimp was my favorite. If you love spicy that is the way to go!! For entrees we got the uni pasta, chicken teriyaki and the mermaid roll! We were stuffed. Not only were they delicious but they were very satisfying. The manager came to our table and introduced himself. He gave us the appetizers on the HOUSE. It was unreal. They really do take good care of their customers. We loved it and will definitely come back but with a larger crowd for sure!"}
{"text":"Reservations for two on a Tuesday night was not really necessary, but I still would make them.  The place is right between Savory Spice and Big Ben in Atherton Mills.  Easy peasy parking (and valet should you want).  I reached out to Candyce B about dress code and she recommended Southend Casual.  Perfect--great to be outta that stuffy suit!  Megan was our server and did a nice job from stem to stern--no complaints.  The manager also came by a couple times and talked which I enjoyed.  I asked about the restaurant group (Indigo Road out of Charleston) and future eateries opening from them soon.

The star of the night were the tempura oysters:  lightly battered, tender, and full of flavor.  We ordered a second round even at $14 a pop!  All of the food was very good and the ambience was nice, too.  I ding them a star for noise and lighting--we had to use our cell phones to see the menu (and we weren't the only ones so it's not just my age dammit!).  O-Ku is a rising star in an already crowded sushi space so I hope that live long and happy in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Justin-General Manager and our waitress Allison are absolutely wonderful.. 

I must say I have to bow down to them. 5 days after opening and I can't really say they have any kinks to work out.. I'm truly impressed!! I asked Justin is it normal to have the Shu Mai come out kinda cold. He immediately explains and offered a redo, or to take it off my tix. I mentioned that it's not the reason why I asked. I was curious on why.. wondering if it was supposed to be like that or was it really a mistake.. and Justin admit it was a mistake.. He offered a complimentary ice cream.. since I never tried what he have describe, why not.. this is why I gave them a 5 stars.  He is truly interested in trying to improve his restaurant if there's mistake. To me it's minor but he want to make sure everybody is happy.. 
I guess should I really care to tell you what I ordered it.. mayyy not.. just know that the rest of the food is good. Arrives on time. Allison was a very good waitress. The house was run very smoothly.. their drinks can be a bit strong.. check out my pics.. it look and is yummy! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"O-Ku is the best sushi I have had in Charlotte! I have dined here a handful of times and the quality of the food and service is always consistently great. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also gorgeous. 

Favorite rolls would be tuna wrapped and the spicy rainbow (which is a newer addition to the menu.) The yellowtail app is also amazing."}
{"text":"Loved their Wednesday Happy Hour specials. 
Mermaid Roll was amazing! 
Somehow we had room for dessert and tried the donuts our server recommended. She was right! We loved it."}
{"text":"Over-priced. Cool atmosphere inside but get ready to pay $35 for 2 rolls that are not filling nor are they anything special. Many other sushi places in town that are much better"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. It's the best place to get sushi in Charlotte. My favorite roll is the Salmon Lemon roll, it's refreshing. Don't pass up the edamame with sea salt and truffle oil....it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Dinner with 3 friends (1 who is Japanese) and another in the group who is a former restaurant owner. All 4 of us loved this place!  
Menu selection:  I had the Avocado Wrapped Roll with tropical fruit salsa ($10.50 = truly tasty!  I would order again and again, each visit.  Seawood salad ($6) had a slightly different flavor with a dressing that was very pleasant.  Sushi/sashimi combo included: 9 Maguro, 18 pieces of sashimi for $50.  Excellent selection and flavor.  Presentation was appealing.  
Service:  Allison was attentive, knew the menu well and was able to suggest items for me (vegetarian) and my comrades (carnivores).  The manager Kristen stopped by table too to ensure everything was great.   Excellent.  
Atmosphere and interior design: very intentional.  Lighting is soft with an Edison Bulb-esque lights and modern fixtures.  Raised tables and standard height tables add to create a visually  interesting dining room.  Music -love it!  Upbeat-mood tunes at a volume that allows to both hear/ennui the beat while still hearing the conversations at your table. 

Great for: date, friend-time, business meal, celebration, even \"to go\".  

Love! Love! Love!  
My new favorite restaurant in Charlotte and I visit the city frequently for business."}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH EXPERIENCE! 

I don't even know where to start because everything was so great. From the moment we walked in the hostess was super kind and the atmosphere was spot on! Great low lighting and beautiful tree branches. We were sat at a small table right in the middle of the restaurant but it was still quite so I didn't mind. 

Our server quickly greeted us (I'm feeling horrible that I'm struggling to remember her name but I think it was Jennifer). She gave us a full run down of the menu and her favorites. She even gave us a little sample of her favorite sake to try. 

We ordered very slowly, one item at a time, to pace ourselves. We decided to start with the Yellowfin Carpaccio which was so delicate and was dancing all over our tongues. Second we ordered the Duck Buns and I will tell you right now I have a major obsession with Bao buns so these were heaven! 

Our server did a great job on coursing out and giving us time to enjoy and relax without feeling rushed. We then ordered one roll, the Spider roll. This roll was also very delicious and was a great portion! The last thing we ordered was the $35 sashimi platter. The presentation was beautiful. Everything tasted so fresh and clean! 

We told our server early on that we were celebrating my new job and when dessert came as a special treat for us we were honored that they treated us to a creme burlee. Perfect way to round out our evening! 

Overall this restaurant shot straight up to top 5 favorite in Charlotte! I am looking forward to returning and trying some more items because EVERYTHING sounded so good and it was difficult to pick just a few things!! The service that was so personalized, refined and laid back was really what took this place to the next level!! 

TRY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become our go-to sushi spot in Charlotte. I have tried so many sushi places in Charlotte searching for my favorite. And I've finally found it. What's even better? The half off sushi Mon + Wed 5-7! Amazing! Because of the great sushi and great value, me and the girls go to sushi every 2-3 weeks here and look forward to it so much. We make a reservation because there are usually at least 5 of us. LOVE YOU OKU!!!! Stay awesome!! PS, the dragon roll is probably my favorite with the mermaid a close 2nd(I typically don't like raw sushi but the mermaid has a great balance of crunch so the texture of the raw doesn't freak me out).  I love that they don't overly batter/fry this roll. It's very lightly fried so it's just enough crunch! Perfect! The potato roll is really good but the potato taste is a bit overpowering for sushi so I'd split this with someone if I got it again. A few pieces of this one is enough for me. This is a good roll for someone that doesn't typically like sushi. The cali is nice and fresh! And the Spring Roll appetizer is very good too! Also, the Shogun cocktail is really good. It has basil! Sounds weird but it's really good! Go try them out!!! Fab spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The food was beyond fantastic. Charlotte, our bartender went above and beyond! Request her if you ever go there. She made our experience! Rio was great as well! Both were very attentive."}
{"text":"After two visits to O-Ku I much more of a fan on half priced sushi night. Their rolls are innovative and have crazy ingredients that work- potato and kiwi anyone?

However at non happy hour prices its a bit hard to swallow. Oh yeah, I said that.

If you dine in Mon, Wed. and Fri from 5-7 all their rolls are half price. We sat at the communal table and we very comfortable and the well looked after.

My first visit, we had quite a large group and even though we were ordering lots of food and drinks (all on one check) our server kept getting lost for long stretches of time. Could have been bad luck or some of those \"just open kinks.\" 

O-Ku is a nice option if you are looking to dine early, mid-week."}
{"text":"After all the hype went there today with friends. The place has nice ambience and it was quite crowded for Thursday night meal. Food was decent. The sushi was good. We lived the shrimp dish. We got talked into doing the table side wagyu beef dish. I wish our waitesss would have given us a heads up on how expensive it would be. That dish was $100!! Split 4 wat worked out ok but still . All in all an experience"}
{"text":"We have been to O-ku a few times and have always had a great experience, so we thought we'd bring our out of town guests here. This time there was something off from the start. Everything was delayed from our seating to items ordered, items that were ordered were served incorrect, and some items were never served. We asked for the manager and she was amazing. Everyone always has an off day and I want to thank the business for making things right. The way we were treated by management has earned our return business. Definitely the freshest Sushi in Charlotte for even the pickiest of sushi eaters."}
{"text":"This restaurant blew me away with their service! I got a reservation for two (recommended) for my wife and I's anniversary. The whole staff came over to our table at different points to wish us a happy anniversary and they all came bearing gifts: champagne to toast, sashimi appetizer, and coconut creme brûlée for dessert! The manager himself, Robert, came over to personally wish us a happy anniversary. Everything we ordered was amazing and the ambiance is great for date night/get togethers with friends. If you enjoy sushi and outstanding service, this place is a must while in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This happy hour made me GIDDY!!! Service from the door to the table was great. The sushi was beyond fresh and delicious. And the drinks were spectacular. We even made new friends sitting at the sushi counter. I will be back and will bring folk with me. Thank you O-Ku!!"}
{"text":"Honestly.. I went with a couple of friends. We all were not impressed. It wasn't great.. in fact it was just ehhh! However the place is very nicely and our waiter Farmer was awesome."}
{"text":"We (party of 3) arrived at 6:15 on a Wednesday. The place was packed, but since we had a reservation we were seated right away. I was also happy to find out that all of their rolls are half off 5:30-7 Monday and Wednesday. Score! 

For dinner we started with the Dumpling Dim Sum. It was served with 4 pork gyoza and 4 shrimp shimai with a side of sweet chili and fish sauce. Both were delicious. 

We also ordered a variety of rolls, but my favorite was that tuna wrapped roll. The tuna was fresh and delicious. We also got the potato roll (recommended), but I wasn't blown away. It's essentially like eating a giant French fry. I personally don't care for deep fried sushi and would rather have fish instead. 

The most unique roll of the right was the kiwi roll. We even saved the sweet chili sauce from the dumplings and dipped the roll in it. Game changer!! 

The let down for me was surprisingly the lobster roll ($24 reg). The roll was tiny compared to the others and double in price. Other than it having lobster in it, there wasn't much to it. 

Overall you can't go wrong on half off night, however I think I'll only return for half off at the bar area and for a drink or two."}
{"text":"So I called an order for pickup..3 sushi rolls-30min and she said that when I come in, go to the bar and they will have my order. All fine and dandy, right? I get to the restaurant 35min later and they don't have my order, she finds it sitting by the register and it hasn't even been given to the back yet. Ahhhh frustrating but okay, people make mistakes. Tells me it'll be 5min, which is frustrating in itself since she originally told me 30, but I understand maybe they'll rush the order so it'll be done faster. 25min later after sitting at the bar like a putz, I get my order. The waitress/bartender could have at least offered me a beer/water while I waited. Just a prime opportunity, to provide some customer service, wasted. Won't be coming back unfortunately. The sushi was pretty good too"}
{"text":"Overpriced for portions, but tasty. 

Some of the smallest dishes I have been served and at some of the highest prices for what's given. However, taste was not a letdown. Hostess was friendly, server a little awkward.

Cool vibe though not a fan of darkness and wood, gives a cheap tavern feel. Windows on left side on building when walking in are interesting."}
{"text":"O-Ku Sushi is a trendy, beautiful restaurant with an amazing menu and great people watching.  We ordered a variety of sushi, all of which was fresh and top notch.  The service was impeccable and the drinks perfectly mixed.  

That being said, this is not (my) everyday sushi restaurant - it's a special occasion place.  The food is very tasty, but also quite pricey - I'm not saying it's over-priced, just don't make the mistake of thinking you're going to have an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"We are new to Charlotte and decided to try O-Ku tonight for the first time. It exceeded our expectations in every way. Our server Kendall was kind, personable, and incredibly helpful as far as menu knowledge was concerned. The food was excellent. The overall vibe was laid back, sophisticated, and totally what we were hoping for. We can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"We have been to O-Ku several times and the food is always great. Our favorite thing to order is the lobster temaki. They are definitely going for a specific vibe with  the decor and dimmed lights. It's a great place to go for a fun night out with friends. 

We went there again last night for a mini bachelorette party dinner, and the staff was very accommodating to us. They had our reservation ready, sent us a complimentary dish to celebrate, and also let my fiance purchase a bottle of prosecco in advance to surprise us at the table. We had a fun night!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is good, but service is SO SLOW. It's like the waiters are trying to keep us hostage here. The waiter also forgot to ask me for my order... I had to go up to her and remind her that I hadn't ordered. Don't come here if you have any plans after, you'll be trapped all night!"}
{"text":"Very Yummy.
This was a nice experience from the staff to the food.  Hostess was very friendly and smiled the whole time.  The woman filling water took her job seriously and helped the servers.  Our server also smiled and was polite.

The lighting and decorations made it feel super warm and cozy.  A perfect fit for the brick building they're located in.  The tall windows are also nice for viewing the south end traffic and people.

-Miso soup was excellent and they serve a nice portion.  
-Spiced Chili Edamame was a new and worthwhile experience.  You'll get your hands dirty for sure, but the heat and flavor are well worth it.  
-My group didn't know that we showed up during half price sushi happy hour, but we took full advantage and loaded up.  The flavor of the sushi was excellent.  Immediately placing it as one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Charlotte.  My one knock is that multiple rolls kind of fell apart as we dug in.  I think one mark of excellent sushi is its ability to maintain it's integrity on it's way to my mouth.  Other than that, the sushi was really good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Robert was amazing and our waiter Reggie was amazing! Amazing food and the passion fruit dessert is to die for! This is our new spot for sure!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in Charlotte. We started out with the spring rolls and the dipping sauce is to die for. The seaweed salad had an unexpected spice to it, but it just made it that much better. The lobster lollipop rolls were apparently amazing- I didn't have one. I ordered two maki rolls- tuna and yellowtail. These were both amazing. The quality of the fish was something you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte. Will ABSOLUTELY be returning!"}
{"text":"This is easily best sushi in town, surpassing my previous favorite (New Zealand Cafe, which is still very good, but does not compare). I have gone 3 times in 3 weeks. Not only are the ingredients and menu ideas fresh, but they also deliver on the traditional nigiri and sushi options. Expensive, but worth it every time. The level of service is just as good as the food. This is the only sushi place I've eaten at in North Carolina that compares to Japan or NYC's top sushi restaurants. The A5 Wagyu sushi was a surprise favorite, but you can't go wrong with any sushi item. This is my go-to Treat Yourself spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite upscale sushi/Japanese restaurant.  Upbeat atmosphere and excellent service always. Delicious and unique entrees, very fresh sushi. You must try the Tuna or Salmon belly.  If you want to splurge do the Okamase, chefs choice about 6-7 courses, you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing. Best Edamame I've ever had. Ate at the bar and the bartenders were great. Sushi was fresh and full of flavor. Recommend the potato roll"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere dim romantic lighting. General Manager came out to ensure our visit was an enjoyable experience. Glad we chose to celebrate my birthday at O-ku"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Charlotte! Really nice atmosphere and good drinks!! The staff are great too, awesome customer service"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best sushi experience I have ever had! My fiancee had raved about O-Ku and their Monday/Wednesday half-off special, so we gathered a couple of friends and went. I had set up a reservation for 6:15pm. We showed up a little early and only had three of our party of four, but they kindly say us anyway. 

Our server Samantha came out immediately with waters for the table and offered to wait for our fourth before taking drink orders. While we were waiting, Samantha brought us an order of edamame with pink himalayan salt and truffle oil. It was very good, but also very VERY salty. Samantha also brought us some pork dumplings and a kind of little shrimp cake since three of our four had never been to O-Ku before! Thanks Samantha, you're the best.

ON TO THE SUSHI! I had the Mermaid roll first. Scallop, salmon, and avocado with a spicy aioli and eel sauce. Fabulous, large portion and stayed intact betwixt my chopsticks! Second was the Spicy Dragon Roll - tempura shrimp, avocado, eel, eel sauce, and the spicy aioli again. Ri-donk-ulous. Samantha came around like clockwork checking on us to make sure everything was ok, which it was. She had just returned from a vacation and was getting back into the swing of things, so I appreciated her level of attentiveness!

O-Ku isn't the closest option, nor the cheapest, but definitely the best!"}
{"text":"This is my one of my favorite new sushi places in Charlotte! The food was great. My boyfriend and I took my mom here when she came to visit. We got the curry duck, kiwi Kani roll, potato roll, lobster roll with caviar, yellowtail carpaccio. It was so good! Of the dishes we ordered our two favorites were the potato roll and the yellowtail carpaccio. In addition to the delicious food, the ambience was great. It's a very trendy and lively place. If you like sushi, you should definitely try out O-Ku"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I wanted to try this place after hearing so much hype about it. Let me tell you, the hype is real! Definitely some of the best sushi I have had. Hell, the ginger was he best I have ever had! Imagine that. 
We first ordered he Lobster Temaki, is usually 3 that one with the plate but we ordered an extra one (for $7) more. But it was absolutely delicious. My fiancée ordered the Red Dragon Roll and she loved it, I had he Spicy Rainbow Roll and it was delicious as well. As stated, the ginger blew my mind, best ever. I don't know why, I don't know if it is because everything is fresh or what but the food was beyond amazing. Keep in mind, it might be pricey if you keep on ordering drinks like we did. 
We will definitely come back here again. Good service and great food."}
{"text":"Celebrating a big birthday with my father meant only one thing, with Omakase at O-Ku. This was my first and recommended by my brother, we landed ourselves here. If you've never had Omakase, it's basically dishes selected by the chef. You're not going to pick and choose, it's a set meal that the chef makes. That eliminates all the indecisions, and all the complications of looking at a menu and seeing what you're interested in. For people with indecisions, this is a perfect meal and experience that should definitely be noticed.

Now, in order to get Omakase, I would definitely, DEFINITELY, call ahead as I believe you can only get 4 seats at the bar at a time. Not only are there other sushi chefs that are fulfilling other orders for the restaurant, this experience is limited.  What you'll be rewarded with your hard time of getting a spot will be a 7/8 course meal.  It ranges from some sashimi/nigiri to wagyu beef, which was what I had served with this delicious sauce. I can't speak of what you'll be served, but what I was served it was great! The price of this was $150/seat, which considering of other Omakase, that's not a bad price. If you have a special occasion and you like Japanese food, I would say go for it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Greatly Appreciate the attention to table. Sashimi was good enjoyed the blue fin tuna. Dessert was a wow with four roses"}
{"text":"Visited on 9/27 around 730. Waited for 20ish minutes to get seated. When our appetizers came out we found ourselves quoting Derek Zoolander \"What is this school for ants?\" The starters were tiny - ceviche tacos are the size of a folded tortilla chip. Tuna tartare was equally as small and did not come with enough chips. Both these dishes cost you around 12-15 dollars. Sushi was okay, probably the only menu item worth getting. Do not bother with the negri, it too was bite sized and over priced. The whole experience took about 2 hrs and we did not get any cooked food."}
{"text":"Perfect for date night! We went early to enjoy a more quiet atmosphere. We loved the decor and set up of the restaurant and the sushi was fantastic! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience.  It was our first time dining there, our waitress was very helpful in suggesting sushi rolls. We chose the spicy tuna, spider roll, potato roll and the duck buns.  It was also my husbands birthday,  they gave us dumplings on the house!"}
{"text":"WOW..... we have visited several times and O-Ku does not disappoint.  The ambiance, food, and staff are first rate.  The staff is knowledgeable and polite.  Sushi is first rate. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Sushi was absolutely fantastic! We went to celebrate a birthday and they hooked us up with the Yellow fin Carpaccio and free dessert. Drinks were a bit on the small side for the price and the Dim Sum dumplings were just okay. That aside everything else was wonderful including service! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I made reservations three days prior. 
Right around 11am on the day of a very nice young lady called to confirm the time and told me about their complementary valet. 
She took the time to ask if knew the location.
Those three simple things made the visit extra especial.  

The location is convenient, the ambience is great and service spectacular.. Thank you Kimmy! 
They brought my friend free dessert for his birthday. 

The sushi is good...maybe We didn't have all the right things... We had the yellowtail carpaccio topped w Serrano peppers, which i would recommend. The shrimp appetizer was delicious, similar to bang bang shrimp but lighter. 

The kiwi roll and spicy crunch dinner were good. It was a light dinner and unfortunately I wasn't impressed w the sushi but the ambience and service by Kimmy made up for it.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance! Low key environment and chill yet hip music helped set the mood for a relaxing evening. Environment has an industrial feel with a very Earthy feel that is zen and Tranquil. The place is clean and the sushi was fresh and well prepared. Sharp knife skills with good portion size. The restaurant's sushi brings an upscale fusion mix with some new flavor profiles that elevates the dish and enhances the pallet while not alienating the fundamentals of sushi dining. The waitstaff was attentive, pleasant, and offered great insight on menu options. Being an \"out-of-towner\" it was good to have a place where my group of friends could talk, relax, and enjoy a tasty meal. I would come again and would recommend!"}
{"text":"I recently went back after an uninspiring experience when it first opened. I was pleased to see many of the issues I had previously expressed concern over were resolved.  Cocktails were really unique and delicious. We found all the food items to be excellent. But we left with a fat tab and minor hunger persisted. 

I have moved this spot to my list of sexy atmosphere specialty places to go for cocktails and apps with a group. But I'll grab a snack first so I don't spend a small fortune to get full!"}
{"text":"Living in south Florida for 5 years has made me a sushi snob. I am originally Chicago and have lived there for a long time and Chicago also has excellent sushi restaurants. My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte and we have been on a hunt to find good sushi. It was a long journey and had several not so good sushi places before we found this one!!  You will not be disappointed with the quality of sushi. We had the spider roll, rainbow roll and tuna roll. For an app we had the ceviche tacos (please note these tacos are miniature size but very delicious). I also had the bourbon basil strawberry drink ( can't remember the name exactly) and it was delicious -- not too sweet, not too tart. And although this restaurant is very new and was very crowded for a Saturday night, the service was on point. We sat at the bar ( hour wait for a table) and all of the bartenders were super friendly and provided exemplary service. The hostess stand was equally friendly and as we were leaving they went out of their way to thank us for coming and say good bye."}
{"text":"I had my first omakase experience here. It was just a wonderful experience. You sit at the sushi bar and have pretty much a personal sushi chef for your party. The chef makes whatever he wants. It's perfect for indecisive people like me who just want to try everything. You don't realize that you have been eating 7-8 small sushi plates for almost 2 hours. It was completely filling and so satisfying. My favorite is still the wagyu beef."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was below average.  We sat at the bar on a not busy night when they just opened. We waited for about 5 minutes and were given a food menu but no drink menu. We were told since it was our first visit we would be given a complimentary appetizer. When received the bill the $14 appetizer were were told as a gift was on the menu. This was disappointing. Would probably not go back due to slow and non attentive service for the expensive price. There are many great choices in Charlotte that I would prefer to try and spend my money and feel good about the experience.
Update:  I appreciate the restaurant reaching out to me and apologizing and offering to correct any issue as they let me know my experience is not typical. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've probably been upwards of 10 times and take all my company here.  2 friends and I had a great dinner last night celebrating an early birthday and got a coconut creme brulee which was so freaking good.  The chili edamame is to die for.  Seems like every time I go, a server slightly mixes up the order but nothing drastic.  Only even slightly negative comment I have.  I'll probably be back in a week !"}
{"text":"Alright so with nearly 10 months of being in charlotte I cannot deny my sushi cravings so I had to hit up a sushi joint one week. After a bit of searching, I fell upon this place with a fellow yelp elite and we decided to give it a run and since then, i have showed up multiple times post that initial visit. The place is very trendy and has a very open atmosphere with high ceilings. The décor is beautiful and the restaurant has always been packed every time I have shown up to this joint. The spots will fill up quick so make sure to make your reservation in advance. The servers/waiting staff/bartenders are all super friendly and very accommodating. Every time that I have been here, I have been seated quickly and with our servers not too far behind us. 

The joint itself has a solid menu and just keep in mind that this is a primarily \"roll\" oriented menu which they do well. I personally don't eat a lot of rolls as I am not big on the sauce but even I could give it a solid nod for the combinations they came up with. The fish is fresh although I wont say it's the freshest so the rolls will definitely be the way to go. The fish is good quality although you can tell that some of them have been frozen. Even with that everything is definitely solid and probably the best sushi spot I have had the opportunity to visit while being in charlotte thus far. I will say the service is top notch here which just adds a nice kick up to the experience. They have always been cordial and even saved my life by protecting my wallet one time with no missing items so god bless these guys.

A solid joint and definitely \"THE\" spot to visit in Charlotte if you are looking for sushi and a nice atmosphere for dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh. Just okay for price definitely worth it on 1/2 price sushi Monday and Wednesday from 5-7."}
{"text":"Small and disappointing. Swanky atmosphere and the food was tasty - but small portions for the price and worse than average service. Go to Yama Asian Fusion - less atmosphere but way better sashimi."}
{"text":"I ate here while visiting Charlotte and it was ok. I ordered the restaurant's version of a Moscow mule, the miso soup, and the salmon and lemon roll. The Moscow mule was good, however the miso soup was too salty and the roll was ok. I would have preferred if the lemon edges had been removed before being placed on the roll. The restaurant's decor was very nice and I would most likely go back but I would order a different roll next time. I originally wanted to order the kiwi roll but it was sold out by the time we were seated."}
{"text":"Lack of service at the bar. It took us 15 minutes to take bartender attention. Wines are over price.
And their food is ok."}
{"text":"Excellent food. There is nothing that isn't good on the menu. Best sushi place I've ever been too!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are 5 stars all the way. Over three visits I've tried almost everything on the menu , and had no complaints. My main gripe every single time is the service. I think the largest table I've had was 5 people, and every single time we found ourselves twiddling our thumbs for such a long time waiting to place drink orders, waiting to place apps, waiting to place dinner orders. By my second visit, we knew to go ahead and place a second drink order as soon as the first one arrived because of the time lag. Unfortunately, you rarely see your own waiter or waitress except for when they take your initial order, after that it's a bevy of food runners none of whom care if you need anything else or didn't like something, leaving you feeling abandoned after the you've gotten your food items. I just wish they would either hire more staff or just do a better job on reservations/seating tables so that people that are spending hundreds of dollars on a single meal feel like they're not being neglected."}
{"text":"This place is great.   We went on opening night last week.   The servers, bartenders and managers were extremely attentive to detail.    This place will be a hit in South End.   Go for the roll with crab and kiwi."}
{"text":"4.5/5 rounds up to 5. 

Pros: The short rib risotto is seriously the best thing I've had to eat in over a year. The dish is perfectly balanced with bitter (in a good way) Brussels sprouts, perfect buttery risotto, and mouth watering-spiced short rib. That dish is an A+

The mermaid roll, salmon and lemon roll, and spicy tuna rolls were pretty good too. Not amazing, but pretty good sushi. 

The miso soup was perfect. Exactly what miso soup should taste like. A bit like shellfish, salty, but not too salty. 

The environment/decor was cool too. 

Cons: our water tasted funny- like bad tap water. 

It's a bit pricey. Our total bill for two after a 15% tip was 77 dollars. 

Overall, I would recommend for a special date night."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the South End neighborhood. This is a solid place for a dinner date or a cocktail. Very trendy, kind of urban chic atmosphere. The place was packed on Friday night.  

The wine and food are fairly pricey, but good. Bottles of wine range from $45-$110 per bottle and sushi rolls range from $11-$25. 

I highly recommend the south end shrimp appetizer and the potato sushi roll. Both were fantastic. 

Though pricey, the food, atmosphere, and location are great. I'll be back, especially for half price sushi night on Mondays and Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Charlotte is a city that seems desperate for new bars and restaurants. When one opens, Charlotteans rush to it and those restaurants and bars are overcrowded and unprepared for dealing with such large crowds. Two months later, these same places will, if well managed, still be in business. For example, Babalu started out packed, and now it's parking lot is pretty empty even on weekends. If Charlotteans want to sustain good restaurants, they have to continue to support them, not just rush off to the next new place. Today's case on point is Charlotte's newest and probably largest sushi restaurant, O-Ku. Is the food good? Absolutely. Is it worth the value? Absolutely not. O-Ku has Nobu prices but not Nobu quality. Service is decent given the overcrowded environment, but the restaurant is too noisy, food production and delivery spotty, and the ambiance more of a club than a fine dining establishment. O-Ku is just OK."}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere!  The food tasted good and was of good quality but the portions on the sushi / sashimi combo were stingy. Our waiter also never explained what was in the combo, even when I asked (\"chef's choice\") or when it was served. The service was also very slow, especially as we had a 9pm reservation; not prime time. I'd go back with the hopes that the service improves and I'd definitely order something else but I wouldn't be the one leading the charge."}
{"text":"Amazing. This was our second trip to O-Ku and it somehow topped our first awesome experience at this new hot spot. Not only are their rolls inventive and delicious, but their sashimi lets the freshness and quality of their ingredients shine. We had the spring rolls (could have eaten anything covered in the sauce that comes with it), a spider roll, rainbow roll, and black magic in addition to some of the best sashimi salmon either of us have ever had. Mark the manager was so kind and really made our Sunday night out fun. We felt very well cared for by him and our waiter (Adrian...?). So happy to have you guys in the neighborhood and can't wait to come back again! You might have dethroned our former favorite sushi place... :)"}
{"text":"The tuna tartare was amazing. Sushi was fresh which is enough to be considered the best in Charlotte. 

It gets pretty busy during happy hour."}
{"text":"Tonight was our 1st visit to O-Ku Sushi. I would highly recommend it to anyone. We moved to the Greater Charlotte area last December. We've been frequenting a local sushi restaurant in Huntsville. We now have a new sushi restaurant to go to. The quality of sushi was outstanding. Everything was fresh, light and very creative allowing us to taste each of the ingredients. The service was 2nd to none. We were able to order off the menu and really took care of us... NO CREAM CHEESE!!!"}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant had a beautiful ambiance to it. There was a subtle and sweet aroma in the room and the lighting although potentially dim for some was adequate to read the menu and enjoy the art and modern chic decor. The food other than my own that i saw looked exquisite and well prepared. The wait staff was beyond exceptional and expertly blended into the surroundings. I will definitely be back to explore the menu further.  

The bar is also an excellent spot to just stop for a drink or a quick bite.

Valet service on site. 
Regular parking also avail."}
{"text":"O-Ku... the new Southend Japanese resurant is flipping heads at their fresh cuisine. I've been twice, both times it's been good. It's top five Japanese restaurant in Charlotte. 

The decor is modern, super trendy (so the chairs are a little uncomforable). The food is unequivically Japanese (this is one of the few places where you can actually get fresh wasabi in Charlotte) and it's well executed. I think the best way to experience it if you go with a few people and do it tapas style."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place, but could never get a weekend reservation.  My fault for always waiting until the last minute.  I finally planned in advance and headed there on Wednesday at 6:30pm.  We were told that there was still 30 minutes left on the 1/2 priced Sushi & Maki rolls.  You better believe we got our orders in real quick!

I ordered the Vegetable Tempura roll and the Avocado Wrapped roll.  I'm not a huge seafood person, so I always appreciate when sushi places put inventive veggie options on the menu.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The tempura roll actually just had lightly tempura veggies inside a regular roll, so it was tasty without being heavy.  The Avocado wrapped roll had beautiful, thinly sliced pieces of avocado laid on top, with some delicious mixed veggies inside.  In addition, we ordered the regular edamame...nothing special about this, but it was good.

Lastly, we finished off the meal with the chocolate bento box.  The warm chocolate cake was decent, but the green tea ice cream was quite tasty.

Overall, the decor was modern, food was great and we enjoyed our meals.  Service was a bit slow and the wine was OK.  I think next time, I may just come in with either a date or some friends, sit at the bar and order some food/drinks.  The cocktails look amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi we've had since moving to Charlotte! The rolls were the perfect size and had just the right amount of sauce - not too much, but you didn't need any soy sauce since they had a lot of flavor on their own. We really liked all 4 rolls we got. The atmosphere inside was very trendy.  They have half price sushi on Mondays and Wednesday's, which would be a great time to try this place since the sushi is a little pricey."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant experience I've ever had for a restaurant that is in it's first week of opening.  I give it 5/5 stars for that reason alone! The food and cocktails were excellent although I only had sushi rolls as I had heard amazing things from friends who had eaten at their Charleston location before.  The ambiance is classy but not too classy where you start feeling uncomfortable if you're not in a three piece suit.  They've done a great job with the interior as the decor and furniture are very nice, new and pleasant to the eye.  I will be a frequent visitor for sure, especially during their Mondays and Wednesdays happy hour (50% off all sushi rolls between 5p-7p).  GREAT new addition to the ever growing Charlotte restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"My meal was underwhelming. I ordered the ramen which was around $15 and that price is without even adding any protein.  It had a few mushrooms and some onions and was mediocre at best. I also ordered the spider roll which was $14 and it was actually pretty pathetic. It was smaller than a publix roll and was very bland. For a $30 meal I honestly feel pretty gipped. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. I would go to yamarazu. Huge rolls and amazing ramen."}
{"text":"O-Ku is such a great sushi spot, especially for date night. My husband and I walked in on a Friday night and were able to grab 2 seats at the bar, there were tables open as well, though. The bartenders were incredibly friendly and helpful. I went with the bourbon basil berry lemonade and he got the shogun. Both drinks were delicious. I also feel like they're great cocktails for only $11 each. 

We started with the dumpling dim sum, and it was a nice size to share. The flavor of the dumplings was great, especially the shrimp ones. We had a bunch of pieces of nigiri along with the negitoro roll and the potato roll. The nigiri was so fresh and delicious. We recently went to Japan and I was on a bit of a salmon nigiri bender while there, and the one at O-Ku took me back it was so good. The negitoro was also great, I wish it had just a little more tuna, but it was still worth it. The potato roll is more of a treat, it's a little heavy so it's nice to share, but the potato outside was crispy and awesome. The service throughout our meal was excellent and we had such a nice time. The ambience here is also dark and romantic, a nice place to relax with a drink. This will definitely be a regular sushi spot for us!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Charlotte food scene.  I love the creative nature of the dishes and the space itself lends to a trendy crowd and a nightlife atmosphere for either your lounge needs or straight hungry self.

The waygu (sp) tartare was a great way to start my meal and followed up by the spider roll.  Of course spider rolls aren't exactly the most creative thing on the menu but was done excellently regardless.

Interiors are pleasing aesthetically and the staff was attentive and cheerful to say the least.  Be prepared to either valet (recommended) or park a bit of a distance away due to the layout and density of the parking lot and surrounding area."}
{"text":"Traveling through Charlotte, we came here on the recommendation of a friend. So glad we did. 
Dinner. 
Sat at the sushi bar. 
The spicy chili edamame was awesome. 
The spicy rainbow roll was incredible. The show-stopper was the Lobster Temaki. Butter-poached lobster handroll. And it looks like a work of art served in a wooden holder. 

Get the Lobster Temaki!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! Great service. Is a little expensive. But the atmosphere is nice and there is an interesting selection of sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you have a flashlight (lighting way too dim to read the menu), small appetite (portions might as well be kid size), and want to leave feeling dissatisfied. I had the Mermaid Roll, Salmon Lemon Roll, and Sake sashimi. The Mermaid Roll was decent at best, however the roll only had 4/5 individual tiny pieces. The Salmon Lemon Roll tastes like a Harris Teeter to go California Roll with salmon and lemon on top. The salmon in general was good quality, but was served warm. Right after eating at O-Ku, I went to a cheaper sushi place just to fulfill my appetite for larger portions at a better price. The hip atmosphere with its exposed brick and high tables could not compensate for my poor experience. Very disappointed since Charlotte Agenda highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We hit O-Ku on a Friday night.  We made reservations because, well, they take them and it's nice to get a seat at a busy place on a Friday night.  We were greeted immediately when we arrived and taken directly to our table.  After settling in we noticed that the lighting was a little strange.  It was that kind of \"at dusk\" light that never lets your eyes fully adjust.  Still, the decor and ambience is really nice and it is, overall, a very comfortable place.  

Our waitress had a sort of casual, disinterested, attitude and wasn't extremely welcoming or helpful when we explained it was our first time.  I felt like she could have pointed out some highlights or something to let us know why O-Ku was different or better than going to our favorite sushi places, Rusans and Yama.  

We ordered a couple starters.  The Tempura Oysters were awesome.  Crispy fried and deliciously plump oysters.  The Dumplings were, meh.  They were split into Shrimp and Pork with the shrimp ones being really tasty and the pork just so so.  Then our waitress surprised us with an order of Yellowtail Carpaccio!  She moved up several knotches with that move.  The Carpaccio was really good.  It wasn't a huge serviing but the fish was fresh and tasty.

We ordered two rolls, the Rainbow Roll, and the Dragon Roll.  Both were good but nothing outstanding or different than a number of other sushi joints.   I had a piece of Toro and it was so delicious but super expensive.  

In the end, we decided that, while we would be back, O-Ku did not show us anything that was spectacular and out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Ok, 3.5 would be my actual rating here.  This is a solid place, bumped up a little because of the deal they are offering mondays and Wednesday's with half price sushi from 5-7.  Also bumped a little more because Reggie our server was awesome,  really nice guy, hooked us up with great service.  I would have been disappointed had we had to pay full price but at half off this is similar to a buy one roll get one free place in plaza midwood.  Decent sushi here, nothing special.  Sushi guru is my top sushi spot in town and this did not live up.  This place reminds me quite a bit of Baku near south park mall.  Prices would make you think the sushi is top notch here, the offering makes you question.  I would come back for half off time but never full price."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and enjoyed Sushi at the bar during Happy Hour.  The atmosphere was really great and the food was good.  They even had my favorite Pinot Grit.  I will return."}
{"text":"It was pretty much what I expected - high end ambiance to justify outrageous prices.  I knew this ahead of time so I waited until I had an opportunity to host a work dinner.  So this week I had a customer come to town and took him and my partner.  We went early (~5:30) because we were going to a hornets game afterwards.  I assumed I wouldn't need a reservation at that early hour but when we arrived the hostess said she could only seat us at the sushi bar.  I called her bluff and said we'd go somewhere else and the manager who happened to be standing next to her seated us at a table.  We ordered a some apps, which were good but teeny tiny, and the sushi was fine but I don't think I could take a pepsi challenge against any other sushi place in town if you took off the fancy presentation.  As expected with cocktails, sake, wine, and 3 hungry diners the bill was astronomical (and the rolls were half off!).  If you're looking to keep costs down stay away from the nigiri.  I'm not a sucker for high end experience and prefer a more casual environment.  Ru-san's is my favorite in Charlotte and I'd go there over this place any time."}
{"text":"Service was excellent -- I was on a work trip and dining alone -- lots of the service staff seemed concerned about my being alone so were always checking in. My water glass was always full, the recommendations were helpful, and the food came out promptly. Given the fun clubby music and dim lighting, this would be a fun place to head with a group of friends.

The tuna belly sashimi melted in my mouth and had a nice kick from the wasabi layered between the fish and rice, the lobster temaki were very filling and contained some tasty aioli that brought all the ingredients together nicely (no soy sauce necessary!) and the yellowtail carpaccio was thinly sliced and seasoned perfectly with a mango cube on top that perfectly complimented the dish. 

I'd like to return and try more of their cooked options (raw fish is a little hit or miss for me). Overall a tasty spot!"}
{"text":"Sweetie and I wanted to try something different for our anniversary and we like sushi, so why not go and see what all the fuss is about?

I made a reservation on OpenTable for a Friday night, 6:30 so I didn't have to wait in the line that was sure to be formed by then and off we go.  I got the obligatory reminder call on Friday afternoon by a pleasant lady which is always a nice touch.

We showed up and they had free valet parking which is a nice touch since nothing is worse than parking your own car and having to find a spot at a hot, new restaurant where everyone else is.  Walked in to a nicely decorated, well thought out space.  So dark I had to use my cell flashlight for the menu.  Nice music playing and servers were plentiful.  We got a nice hightop near the front door which was a nice table to start but as the restaurants filled up the overflow from the bar with people waiting for seats got a bit annoying as I really could care less about the guy this lady picked up on Tinder but was forced to listen to because she stood right near my table.

Our server was nice, attentive and was good at what he did.  I'm not a drinker so I usually order Iced Tea and come to find out they don't have Iced Tea on the menu.  WTF?  This is an outrage, all \"sushi places\" have Iced Tea.  Besides, this place originated in Charleston SC, the birthplace of Iced Tea and they're in the south for crying out loud.  This must change, now.  Anyway, I sipped on Charlotte's finest tap water instead.  

Appetizer was the O-Ku Spring Roll which I highly recommend.  Nice selection of fish, some wonton crisps for added crunch and an outstanding sesame sauce for dipping.  Well done!  I grade a sushi place by the innovative specialty rolls and frankly O-Ku needs to beef it up, they only have about dozen on the menu and not too many standouts.  We had a Rainbow, Kiwi Kani, and Mermaid.  The Kiwi Kani fit the bill of innovative, and was delicious, the addition of the fresh kiwi made the roll and it was wonderful.  Dare I say one of the best rolls in the Queen City.  I noticed on the menu that they had fresh wasabi, not the green dyed horseradish that most have.  Come to find out they were out.  Here we go again, no Tea and no fresh wasabi?  Our Server suggested the pickled wasabi instead which was different and I must say, excellent.  Added a different dimension to the meal.  We finished with an almond cake or something and it was a nice cap to the meal.

I liked O-Ku.  They're still new but if you're looking for a new \"See and be seen\" place this is it.  Nicely done place with good food."}
{"text":"First impressions:
Upon entering O-Ku it's a bit dark, setting the mood for the night. Would recommend for anything from casual / romantic date to that time your family comes in town and you need to impress them with your awesome food scene in Charlotte. Our reservation was mad through Opentable app. It was for a birthday and notes were left within the app. Sasha, our waitress was very accommodating and respectful. She immediately made note to the birthday and welcomed us in. Excellent staff all around. Robert, the manager, was also incredibly personable and made it a point to make rounds to each table to ask about the experience. Something I don't expect but greatly appreciate. 

Food:
I'm not exactly the \"sushi guru\" in town but I thought the sushi was top notch and ranks high in any sushi in town, if not the best. 
We had the potato roll (does it get any better than sushi wrapped in deep fried potatoes? I'll wait) and the spider roll. Spider roll came with torched salmon which melted in your mouth like butter. I hate the fishy taste in seafood (don't judge me at this point) so I was extra critical and skeptical. Was not disappointed. Robert gave us a great rundown on the restaurants fresh practices and differences from others in town. This will be a must try for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte
Some of our faves
South end shrimp, spider roll, and the dragon roll. Top it all off with a crisp glass of one or one of their exceptional cocktails"}
{"text":"Came here opening night and during restaurant week, both times we had great service and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend the yellowtail carpaccio or dumpling dim sum to start. Our favorite rolls are the salmon and lemon roll, mermaid roll, and potato roll."}
{"text":"I think I tried most everything on the menu with my party! We literally all keep ordering and sharing. The lobster rolls seemed to be a huge hit for everyone. I especially enjoyed the dumplings and they even custom made lobster tempura for me. That was impressive. I also thought they were very good for a friend who was in our party that was vegan. I will def go here again. 
Hey O-ku, can you open for lunch on Sunday? I'd so appreciate it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and it was packed! All the hype about this place lives up to it. Beautiful modern decor with lots of space. Fast and attentive service and polite staff. Started with a few cocktails and they were well balanced. As for food, we started with the lobster temaki which was a sizzling plate of lobster and mushroom goodness. Also has the wagyu tartare which I could finish myself. We had the black magic roll and it was very good. You have to try it first without the soy sauce and wasabi to appreciate the taste. The mermaid roll was probably the best part of my meal!  Just a very well put together roll with all of my favorite things! The bowl of chirasi was a bowl of seafood freshness. Each piece melts in your mouth. Cheers to the executive chef!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. The decor of the restaurant very nice. Great for date or dinner with friends. The staff was great. The waiter walk us thru every piece of the menu. We tried the miso soup and edamame with truffle oil as an appetizer. Both very good.  For the entree we tried the hot and heavy sushi roll, spider roll, and  mermaid roll.   Our favorite was the hot and heavy roll. It has a full lobster tail inside. Very filling roll. Overall great experience. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. We started off at the bar while we waited for the tables to be set up. He did make a reservation ahead since the size of the party was more then 10 people. The service at the bar was quick and easy to order. Their drink list was impressive and there sake list seemed good too. When they were ready to seat us, we were seated in this ackward L shape. On top of that some of our guest couldn't even sit with the main part of the table. They were given a little cocktail table for 4 people. I understand it was a big party, but the reservation was made a head of time, so i don't understand why the seating was not planned out better. While the front of the table received service, the back of the table waited about 20 mins before anyone took our drink order. When my boyfriend asked if we could put a drink order in, we were told by the waitress \"not yet, I'm still counting seats\". I've worked in the restaurant industry before and wouldn't tell a customer I'm still counting seats. But, cutting her some slack, she may have been new. Anyways by the time we got our drinks the other half of the party already got there main entrees. We didn't even put ours in yet. The sushi was good and we did get a cold sake which was also fine. I live close by, so I will be back and hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR
Monday, Wednesday & Friday
5:00 PM - 7:00 PM

Complimentary Valet."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great people. The atmosphere was beyond enjoyable throughout the entire experience. My experience was started off by Zoey (I apologize if this is spelled incorrectly) who greeted me with a huge smile and a genuine attitude. As anyone that eats out often can tell you, that is not a common thing to see from the hostess!  As she was a phenomenal way to start my experience, I also had the pleasure of having Alex as my server. If you like smiles, laughs, and a friendly personality then you will love Alex. She gave me space while still maintaining a connection. The food was fantastic. Sushi is honestly the best I've had in Charlotte and is definitely fairly priced  for the quality of it. The yellow tail carpaccio and the King Salmon Usuzukuri were both great light options to get the taste buds going before  settling into my meal. Both had a slight kick to them which was enjoyable. I ordered the mermaid roll and the eel dragon roll as my entrees and they were fantastic as well. Justin the GM checked on me and made sure that everything was great and was certainly a pleasure to talk with as well. Overall, this was not my first time at O-KU and it will not be my last. As any foodie will understand, this will certainly be in my rotation! Thanks O-KU."}
{"text":"The Best Sushi ever! 

Monday evening, I visited during happy hour (5PM-7PM) for half off sushi!!! Luckily, I was able to make a reservation for two through OpenTable. Just a side note! This place gets PACKED!! Reserve a table!! Also there's complimentary Valet parking. 

This was my first time visiting, I can finally check O-ku off my list! I love the ambiance here! Very trendy with low lighting, small tables (unless you have four or more) also it gets pretty LOUD!! 

I ordered the Potato and Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc! Talk about the perfect evening! The Potato roll is very popular! I definitely look forward to ordering dessert next time!! Drinks are a little pricey. Not sure if they have specials during the week. I look forward to coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. The shrimp starter was absolutely the best item I had, South End Shrimp!!! I could eat the whole bowl! The servers are fabulous! Friendly, polite, personable ! Very impressed!  I usually don't like champagne- but the prosecco was very delightful! 
My negative would be the VERY dim lighting. It was so hard to see the menu & the food. The beautiful presentation was lost in the darkness. Literally had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. 
Everyone was so pleasant- what a great experience !!
Very busy place on a Tuesday night! 
Free valet parking 
And should it matter to you- they have 2 single use Unisex restrooms. 
This would be an excellent date location."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating at O-Ku. The food is above par and the sushi is some of the best in Charlotte in my opinion. The Truffle Oil Edamame is delicious!"}
{"text":"Only rating this based off my experience there last night. Didn't get to try any fooWas wanting to try this after eating at O-Ku in Charleston. The weather was perfect last night, a Wednesday, so a wait anywhere around 7 was expected. I called ahead and asked what the wait would be. The hostess let me know that we would be one of the first to be seated. I asked how many minutes that would take and she said it all depends on when we get there and they will assess. We got there within 10 minutes. The hostess said it was a 20 minute wait. Odd, since on the phone she said we would be one of the first seated. I felt like they baited us into coming in to wait. After over 20 minutes I asked how much longer and she said we'll be seated soon and that parties that came in after us had reservations. 10 minutes later, they seat our party of 3 at the bar. We asked for a table and she said there's a wait for a table and that there's 7 groups ahead of us for a table. Over the phone we were one of the first to be seated and w. We just left and went to Futo Buta instead. Don't appreciate how we were lied to from the get go. We shouldn't have stuck around."}
{"text":"If you're wondering why this place is packed on a Saturday night, it's not because the place is trendy, or that the staff is super friendly, or that it just opened. While all of this holds true, it's simply because the food is outstanding. This place is the definition of #WorthTheWait.

And is it really waiting if you're sipping on some drinks? Check in, give the hostess your name, and head over to their convenient bar with a staff that knows how to burn a drink. Relax, enjoy the ambiance, and let your cocktail ease that hangriness out of your system while you wait for your exceptional dinner.

We had the cracked shrimp appetizer which might of been my favorite appetizer I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. I don't even like sashimi but we tried it anyway, and guess what? It was delicious. Top it all of the sushi was prepared fresh and we finished every bite. If you're looking for some great Asian cuisine, look no further; O-Ku is your spot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to take people is O-Ku. O-Ku is a nice sushi/asian bistro that has the most fresh seafood in Charlotte. They serve sushi, rice, tartar and other asian foods. One of my favorite parts is the atmosphere. It is an old brick building that has been turned into something so beautiful. The dimmed lighting and few decorations give it a clean simplicity. The service is also top notch. Every time we have been the waiters/waitresses have been very attentive and able to assist with any question you have on the menu. When ordering, I suggest ordering family style and getting a bunch of dishes to split. They have plenty of small plate options and sushi that is a good portioned roll to share. On of may favorites was the tuna tartar. I am all about tuna when it comes to sushi and it is so fresh at O-ku so anything that has tuna... GET IT! If you are looking for a nice date night out or a place to take the family when they are in town. Head on over to O-Ku."}
{"text":"I had avoided this place for a while because I wanted the \"hype\" to die down and for me to get a proper experience at O-ku.  Solid 4 stars, not only because it's a sushi place in SouthEnd, but a really decent one at that.

On a Monday evening, the dinner rush was pretty crazy.  Luckily I was having an early dinner with my sister so we went around 5:30.  Greeted promptly and seated, we decided to go on a sushi journey through the O-ku menu.  I do want to note that all food items come out as they are prepared so you may get your rolls before appetizers/ chef specialties.... so just come hungry and have an open mind.

Our server was friendly enough and walked us through the menu.  We decided on edamame with truffle oil, SouthEnd shrimp, tuna wrapped roll, and nigiri:  yellowtail, tuna, and otoro.  We ended our meal with a chocolate bento box dessert.  Everything was exceptional and we left with full bellies.  Couldn't help but notice how busy the restaurant became (on a Monday night!).  So I take that as a good sign.

Atherton Mill is undergoing some changes, but O-ku should be here to stay and it will be interesting how they do during the demolition/construction of the rest of the mill.  Currently there are ample parking spaces and complementary valet if you don't feel like walking.  Personally I don't ever valet if I don't have to - luckily I can just walk here so the poor valet people don't have to drive my prius around the block (in disappointment that its not a sports car).

Definitely coming back to try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of eight and had a really fabulous experience! I feel like there's not very much inventive food here in Charlotte and I'm so thankful that o-ku came along! We ordered about 10 different dishes and shared and I loved every single one of them. I also ordered two of their craft cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed those. Great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great environment, with a definite decor, enough to feel cool but not overwhelming or overrated."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the O-Ku on King Street in Charleston, and this O-ku didn't let me down! It's in the Atherton Mills area by Big Ben and Sola Salons. It's a beautiful interior with a great ambiance, perfect for a Friday night group or date night. We had a group of 8 that was coordinated easily with the GM, Justin. He was awesome, along with the rest of the waitstaff and hostesses. We couldn't stop gushing about how great the service was! I tried the tuna sashimi and split the spider role and the lobster hand roll (I forget the proper name). Healthy portion on the rolls, with some unique offerings. Love it here and can't wait to go back - thank you for great service and delicious food (and drinks!)."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan!  The SouthEnd neighborhood has been begging for quality sushi!

The interior of O-Ku is super modern with a warm and cozy feel.  It's super clean and the bar service was excellent and friendly as we awaited our OpenTable reservation to be seated.

I think O-Ku would warrant 5 stars but the service was quite slow.  Table service was nearly full but tables seemed to turn at a reasonable rate.  We placed an order for 2 rolls and the Yellowtail app, knowing we'll order more as that arrives.  We then opted to put in our 2nd and 3rd order after waiting 45 minutes.  Our first course didn't arrive until 70 minutes into our seating.

Back to the food though!  The yellowtail was incredible.  It's plated with a sliver of Serrano Pepper but it wasn't overly hot.  Excellent balance with the heat and the other flavors.

We also had the Firecracker and Black Dragon rolls.  Both were phenomenal.  If you haven't given this new spot a shot, nows the time.  The newness has died down and you won't find better sushi within a decent radius."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and give them 5 stars! There's nothing more I could've wanted from O-Ku. I used to live in Charleston and have been to the original O-Ku several times. I'm always on the hunt for good sushi and I just found it. 

Like other posters have said the restaurant does have a great vibe, similar to the original. When it gets going, I'm sure this will be the place to see and be seen. The service was so good, it was almost too much. Our meal was probably 45 minutes start to finish because the food came so fast and we were too hungry to linger! I mentioned on Open Table that we were celebrating a promotion and every single person congratulated us and we got 2 glasses of champagne on the house. What's funny is it seemed like they were congratulating my husband when it was my celebration dinner. With a name like Aleks, it could've been either one of us so I'm giving them a pass. 

We shared the dumpling app and 3 rolls.I would skip the potato roll next time. Fish in all three was really good and fresh tasting. I can't wait to come back during Happy Hour now that I work nearby!"}
{"text":"Service was slooow but worth the wait. I really enjoyed my crab salad sushi roll. The ingredients tasted so fresh! I kinda customized the roll to what I like bc I'm picky. They made it perfectly. The ambiance is perfect for a intimate dinner."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried this place recently. After 5 years of working at an up-scale sushi restaurant, we've become a bit snobby when it comes to our sushi. 

O-ku's sushi was unreal, so different and unique with such great tastes - really impressive. A little pricey, but you'll get what you pay for. 

We also ordered an edamame appetizer - $5, which is super reasonable. However, when our server brought it out, there was only a tiny handful of edamame on the plate! It was truly laughable how small this serving was. 

The glasses of wine were also overpriced, $11 being the cheapest glass you could order. We stuck with a draft beer for $7 - fairly good beer selection but definitely overpriced. 

Our server was good - knew everything and anything about the menu, but needed you to know that. Almost went through every item on the menu and was a bit overbearing. Good service, didn't forget anything, just a bit abrasive.

We'll probably go back. Our server suggested (among many other things) that we try Wednesday nights because they're 1/2 off sushi, sounds great. We might just stick to carry-out though."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great for date night, groups, but probably not very family friendly. Service has always been consistently swift. Sushi is great and you can modify the rolls to add your own touch. We have had some saltier than desirable food here in the past which is why I wouldn't give it all 5 stars but it is certainly worth a try. Go to sushi roll is the spicy tuna crunch."}
{"text":"Very last minute birthday dinner destination that turned out to be surprisingly pleasant. I was in town from Miami on a forced trip due to a hurricane, but lucky to have family in NC to welcome us. I don't know Charlotte well at all, so I depended on other Yelp reviews and the approval of my little brother who actually lives in the city. We had an early bird dinner reservation at 6:30pm on a Monday after learning of the half off sushi happy hour till 7pm. My folks were treating us so I tried to be mindful when choosing a dining venue. The restaurant by far exceeded expectations. Our server Jennifer was very attentive and super sweet. She sent two appetizers on the house as a birthday treat and thoroughly explained the menu as it was our first visit. The sushi was of great quality, the decor was inviting and the service top notch. I will definitely remember the experience next time I'm in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I somehow convinced my doesn't-eat-seafood boyfriend to Oku after the Panthers tree lighting event. From the get-go, service was very slow, from seating us to a waitress coming for drink and food orders. I wouldn't have minded the leisurely feel, but it was after 8pm and we were both starving.

Service aside, I just wasn't impressed by the sushi there. Our waitress recommended the rainbow roll, and it barely had any seafood wrapped on the outside of the roll. I'm guessing the fish in it was about to go bad so they were trying to sell it off. We ordered a couple of veggie rolls as well to split, and the avocado roll was pretty yummy but the tempura got two thumbs down from me (although the fella liked it). The tempura veggie just had some fried squash wrapped in a roll which I found to be really odd. The fella also ordered the wagyu nigiri, which he said was quite good.

The menu had promise and the atmosphere felt expensive and intimate, which I liked. So, I'd be willing to try Oku again and order something different, but we got off to a rocky start with mediocre sushi."}
{"text":"Surely enjoyed the atmosphere, ambiance and service! Beautiful decor and lighting inside. The sushi is not terrible, just very pricy for some pretty basic rolls. I would recommend the appetizers over the actual rolls! However, the bogo is the way to go for first timers!"}
{"text":"I'm so jealous that this place is walking distance from my brother's condo! Good thing too since parking can be a challenge, although there's also valet available. We walked in around 5:30pm on a week day. There were still plenty of tables available but I thought it was weird that the two hostesses asked for my brother's full name before assigning us a table.

We were seated at one of the front windows which was nice because the lighting is pretty dim in there. Our server greeted us warmly and explained the menu to us since it was both our first time here. The menu was concise and easy to follow. I like how items come out tapas style. We started with the Edamame with Pink Himalayan Salt and Truffle Oil (yum), followed by the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll (also yum and the roll was the right size and not overstuffed), then two pieces each of nigiri: salmon, hamachi, and the O-Ku style Bluefin Otoro. The pieces were fresh, not overwhelmed with rice or wasabi, and delicious. I liked how there was a option to just get traditional nigiri/sashimi or try one of their seasoned pieces. The last dish to come out was the South End Shrimp. The flavors were good but the shrimp were drowned in sauce so it wasn't crispy anymore. Least favorite dish. 

I was impressed they had a dessert selection. We split the Chocolate Bento Box. The cake was warm and fluffy accompanied by three mini scoops of green tea ice cream. I was expecting more fruit based on the description but it was only one strawberry.

Glad O-Ku is within walking distance so I can come again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Charlotte!! 
Make reservations for weekends - I was celebrating my bday on a Friday evening and all the slots were booked except for 5pm. It was still mostly empty but it was fine because all of our food came out exceptionally fast. 

They gave us yellowtail carpaccio on the house for my birthday, which I think was a nice gesture. The fish was thinly sliced and very tender with great flavor. We ordered 3 rolls for 2 people: the kiwi kani roll, potato roll, and the mermaid roll - the last two were fried and pretty crispy. All the rolls were delicious and very flavorful. My favorite was the mermaid roll but it only came with 6 pieces. The potato roll was interesting and good as well. The kiwi goes well wish sushi but it was more bland compared to the other two. 

The star of the dinner was dessert: our server recommended the coconut creme brûlée, and it did not disappoint. If you love coconut, order this!!! So good.

The inside is kind of too dark - group next to us had to use their phone flashlights to read the menu...

But service overall was great and I'd come back any day, if not just for the creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment. Swanky, hip, perfect ambiance for dates.  The waitstaff here were pleasant, friendly, and very attentive.  The drinks though limited selection- are very tasty with just  the right amount of kick. I tried bourbon basil lemonade - so good! The squid and seaweed salad was also very good.

The sushi...meh. I wanted to love it but it wasn't the best and I love sushi. High rice little filling or meat for the price this is not acceptable. It was some of the most tasteless sushi I've had in a awhile. Half price on Monday's. I would come back for apps or drinks after work but wouldn't rush back for the sushi."}
{"text":"As a first timer, when I walked in I was amazed by the decor in the restaurant. After being seated the server was very prompt to get my drink order and a martini I chose was excellent. The table ordered several appetizers and sushi rolls. Everything was great I will definitely return good food and good drinks always a good time."}
{"text":"An upscale sushi spot that is all-that. Arguably the finest raw seafood I  have eaten other than when I was literally standing on a dock in Japan. 
I have always gone earlier in the evening so parking wasn't an issue, but they have valet, so if the little parking area is full, just let them park for you. 
The atmosphere is wonderful. Music just loud enough to amp up the energy without being so loud you cannot hear. Actually the acoustics are pretty good, because even when it fills up and the noise level rises it is not insufferable like some other places. 
The poke bowl app is one of my two menu favorites, with the butter poached lobster handroll being the other. I did not try the rolls, but they look very Americanized. I will stick to the melt-in-your-mouth sashimi, of which my favorites are the octopus and yellow tail. 
So why not five stars? 
Well, they have food runners and water-pouring people ( I don't think they are the same), and a couple of them have worn strong perfume, so when they come to the table it tends to assault the senses. I have been to the restaurant four times and it consistently happens. And, I love low-lighting for dining, but when you see even young people are having to get out their cellphone flashlights to see, maybe you could make it a tad brighter? Neither of these issues is a deal breaker, more like annoyances. 
Heads up that you will drop some serious cash to eat here (my beloved lobster handroll is nearly $20 alone.) 
Keep up the quality and I will pay what I need to."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, so so good.  service is avg at best, maybe just the server who waited out table.

came here on Wednesday and the restaurant was half full.  we wanted to try their specials, so we order the duck buns, the squid ink sushi rolls, beef tartar and bunch of other rolls.

we did ordered couple cocktails as well and they are alright.  (not great and not bad.)

the $21 squid ink sushi roll doesnt have the aroma it should.  it's a very basic box sushi with no fresh fish in it.  a little bit overpriced.

the rolls are comparable to other sushi joints, even I can compare them with new Zealand cafe (not that they are great).  avg at best.

I'm pretty picky about the service.  we need to flag the server, and ask the busser to get us our server when she was filling out water.  otherwise, the server would camp out by the sushi bar and do his chit chat.  we sat around the hostess stand and all three hostesses were playing their phones...  this place supposed to be top notch in service?  I donno.

the interior is very nice and no wait for us, which is a plus.  I just dont get the hype of this place.  it just an avg quality restaurant but with good decor and marketing imho.

I'd probably will be back on their mon/wed special, otherwise, I won't miss this place."}
{"text":"My fav sushi place in town!! I am super picky about Japanese cuisine but o-ku is def one of the best Japanese restaurants I tried in the states. Highly recommend the wagyu nigiri and box style sushi. In terms of dessert, the green tea ice cream is just average but the tuxedo cake is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"I was back in town for work and it happened to be restaurant week.  I jumped at the chance to try O-ku since my first try was a fail; they had just open and the wait was over an hour. In short: The location is great, the decor is on trend, the service is excellent ESPECIALLY a young lady named Qinesse (keep her...great customer service skills) -- the food was good but not spectacular.  Perhaps I had my standard set too high, not sure. It was by no means bad but just a high-ok.  I will say the selections were indeed creative.  I would go back but it would be more for the social aspect of the venue."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this hot spot, I finally got to check it out!  For starters, the wait was long...well over 30 minutes...but that was to be expected considering that this is one of the hot spots right now.  The ambiance was very stylish...dark (almost too dark?), sexy and modern.  Then the best part...the food!  I ordered the Dragon Roll and Potato Rolls!  Actually, there was a bit of a mix-up in the order, and they initially brought out the Spider Rolls instead of the Potato Rolls, but when I pointed that out, they immediately sent out the Potato Rolls...and let me have the Spider Rolls on the house.  All of these items were excellent...almost melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Then the dessert!!  Thanks to personal research on my part, I knew they had ice cream mochi balls, so I had that...and as expected, they were also Dee-Lish!!!  My only complaint there is that they lacked a dessert menu, so I had no idea how much my dessert was going to cost me.  In short, the food was superb, the service was excellent and the ambiance was stylish.  This is a restaurant definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service and experience. Went there with a party of 5 to celebrate a birthday on a Monday evening. We were probably one of the only 3 tables there and about the last to leave. Our waiters couldn't be bothered with working and we had to literally get out of our seat to look for our server every time we needed something (water, drinks we ordered 45 mins prior, and mix ups on small plates) I wanna say the main thing that drove me to write this review was prior to the event we  prepared and set up a small cake with a candle to be brought out to the table and the server rushed it out with no candles, no happy birthday and one spoon (lol) --- Charlotte needs less \"trying\" in ambiance and more service! I run into this issue anytime I wanna try a new place out in the city.  --- won't be back.."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I have mixed feelings about O-Ku Sushi.  I think the hype is what ultimately led to a bit of a letdown on our part.  

They are located in the Atherton Mill on the corner opposite Luna's Living Kitchen.  If you get there early enough, you can easily snag a parking space and avoid using the valet.  

The inside is every bit as lovely as noted in the reviews - it's swanky and hip, with high ceilings and exposed duct work.  The lighting is dim, but sufficient for viewing the menus and still having the desired ambience.  They also play great music.  

My husband and I visited early one Wednesday during their half price sushi night (available from 5-7pm).  That was a big bonus, since the sushi is a bit expensive for what you get.  We ordered four things (in order of our favorites) - Lobster Temaki hand roll, Potato Roll, Tuna Wrapped Roll, and Salmon Lemon Roll.  The latter three were covered under the sushi deal, but the Lobster Temaki wasn't, and was still worth every bit the $18 price tag.  Their signature roll, the Potato Roll, was crispy and delicious.  My husband preferred the Tuna Roll more than I did, since it seemed a bit salty to me.  The biggest disappointment, however was the Salmon Lemon Roll, since it was practically flavorless.  When I compare this to the similar roll from CO, there really is no comparison - CO's is hands down the best, with the added lemon aioli that elevates the dish.

We both had lychee martinis, and they were really (really!) good, and not too sweet.  Service was excellent as well.  Our server offered a few suggestions upon hearing we were first-timers, and was both friendly and efficient.

So is O-Ku the best sushi place in Charlotte?  I don't think so.  But we would absolutely return for three things - the phenomenal Lobster Temaki hand roll, the Potato Roll, and, of course, the Lychee Martinis!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give 3 stars as I was so excited that Oku came to Charlotte and was really looking forward to coming to dinner.  Me and  two if my good friend came in for Happy Hour last night.  It started out with my reservation not being in the system.  I called a week and a half in advance and chatted with the hostess about how excited I was to try Oku Charlotte.  However, the hostess was great and although it was busy she found us a great table.  We ordered 5 or 6 rolls all of which were delicious as Oku always is.  We were prepared to stay a while and have a second bottle of wine.  Three servers shows up and started clearing our plates before we were even finished.  We articulated that we were not done and they brought us new plates but it was a bit awkward and we felt as though we were being rushed out.  I have been going to Oku in Charleston for a long time and I never felt rushed or unwelcome even when it was happy hour.  That feeling of being welcomed is the main thing that kept me coming back time after time.  I will give Oku Charlotte one more try, but I thought it important to share my experience.  I want to love it as much as I do in Charleston."}
{"text":"Place was packed last night and I had a great time celebrating my bday! Would love it if they had a patio but now that I think about it that might be hard due to its location? 

Sushi was excellent and our waitress was extremely nice and helpful.  It was a little hard to hear conversation as it was loud...but not too bad. Loved the decor and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Place reeks of truffle oil. We were given a 1.5hr wait time since we didn't have a reservation... it was a total bougie ploy to make it look exclusive, which they can't pull off when you can clearly see 6+ open small tables behind the hostess stand. Thanks for turning us away - Ru Sans was really great tonight."}
{"text":"I had a really exceptional experience here.  I had fabulous service by an extremely friendly and attentive waitress plus great food.  I had a little mishap to start with my salad, it's not worth mentioning-but I will say the staff made up for it times 100.  

I ended up liking the Black Magic (which I would get without aioli next time), but really liking the potato roll.  I had miso soup and veggie egg rolls, which were good as well.  The bento box chocolate cake finished off the meal because it was my friend's birthday.  It was delicious and served with green tea ice cream.

Thankful to the staff here for making my visit so pleasant.  They are the main reason for my stars and for me returning again."}
{"text":"We went late but the service was great. Sat at the bar and met tim. A knowledgeable employee whose suggestions are on point!! The sushi was the best I've ever had and o love at the beach!"}
{"text":"VERY IMPRESSED!  This spot is definitely for real sushi lovers....LOVE LOVE LOVE.  You can't go wrong with the kiwi kani, salmon lemon, or mermaid rolls.  All the sushi rolls I have tried so far have been just awesome.  Little rice, lots of fish and FLAVOR.  If you are looking to try a great appetizer, the shrimp dim sum is just extraordinary.  The presentation of food is excellent.  The service is great.  This might have just came out if no where and stole the #1 spot of sushi restaurants on my list...and that's a very difficult thing to achieve."}
{"text":"I thought about not writing this review because I was so enthralled in the conversation over dinner that I didn't take a single picture. But then I thought about how amazing the food was and I just had to give this spot it's credit.
We went with another couple who are close friends of ours. We went on a Thursday night and had reservations. Eventhough it was a weeknight, it was pretty packed so I would definitely recommend reservations. We shared several dishes and I can't even remember them all. That being said, my favorites were: LOBSTER TEMAKI, PASTA with CANDIED BACON, and SHORT RIB. There was also a raw salmon dish that was delicious! 

The food was impeccable. The service was top-notch. The vibe inside was super cool (the wooden sinks in the bathroom were so unique). We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The decor at O-ku is enough to make you want to dine at this unique establishment. Dimly lit and servers in all black give it the feel of fine dining. The appetizer edamame in truffle oil was fantastic. We also ordered the dumpling dim sum which was suggested by our knowledgeable waiter, Tony and it was an excellent choice . I ordered the chicken teriyaki with fried rice. I have to say it is the best fried rice ever! All others at the table ordered sushi and it looked and tasted amazing. We will definitely be back our next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great atmosphere then this is probably your place! Food is good and drinks are ok. Had one bartender that couldn't make a drink and told him about it and he didn't want to do anything about the bad drink so had to have someone else handle it. Liked the guy who handled the problem but next time went in they had him waiting tables and not behind the bar. Overall not great value for the money but they do have valet!"}
{"text":"This is the best place I have had sushi so far in Charlotte!!!

One this place is pricy for sushi but I believe you pay for what you get sometimes! 
Well just heads up come on Monday and Wednesday night between 5-7 pm because it is 1/2 most their sushi. Eight pieces come in most and I tried three different rolls.  **Spicy crunch tuna was my favorite. 

I have to say the texture and taste were on point( so in normal terms for some people it was very tasty) There was the right blend and not too much sauce added on top like some places. 

In addition, the sushi tasted fresh and that is the most important to me because when you taste bad sushi it can turn you off from eating it for a long time. 

I would go back again even on \"regular\" price as the atmosphere is very nice and a good date if you are looking for a date night."}
{"text":"For those of you that are used to highly quality food from cities like New York, Chicago & Atlanta this is a restaurant I would definitely recommend! The sushi is fresh, the service is pretty good, and the drinks are well made by the bartending staff! Great atmosphere for date night or a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"I absolutely O-Ku The first week it opened we went Sunday and came back on Monday for the 1/2 Sushi (also on Wednesdays) because it was that good. The second time we at the Sushi Bar- pretty cool if you want to watch your sushi be made. They also serve local beers- my fave's is the Hornet's Nest. The next time we went Greg Olsen and his wife visited so, if Mr.Reliable is gracing O-Ku, I'd say his word is pretty-reliable ( it's OK to laugh or shake your head in dismay). This a quality sushi place and with a great selection for alcoholic drinks. I have no doubt they will be expanding their space or to another location very soon."}
{"text":"This is really a 5 for the food. Across the board amazing decor. Nice vibes. Our waitress was good but some of the supporting crew was not very good.

Have to admit that Im quite particular about service being that I'm a NYer. (And I've visited Japan a few times)

Definitely now one of my favorite sushi spots in Charlotte"}
{"text":"2nd time back to this place after the first bad experience.  Much better.  Liked to the atmosphere, which is comparable to a posh NYC sushi restaurant.  I would go back for sure, either for a date or birthday."}
{"text":"Came here for a bridal shower dinner and the service and food were amazing! Ordered the potato roll.... YUMMY! And we had some kind of shrimp appetizer that was delicious as well! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations for tonight and was seated promptly. Every dish we ordered was delicious. 

Tuna Tartare- a little on the smaller size as far as proportions, but so tasty. 

Dim Sum App- came with 4 small pieces of shu mai and 4 dumplings. So delicious but definitely not comparable to authentic dim sum. 

Hot n Tasty Roll- decent size, flavors worked well together and was good

Salmon and Lemon Roll- chose this one due to the uniqueness and it did not disappoint! Probably my favorite dish of the night

Sashimi- we got both maguro and hamachi. Both were really good and fresh. Slices were a little bit on the thinner side than what I'm used to in other cities. 

Overall, pretty good food, service was attentive, and I'd recommend to anyone visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. We got the dumpling dim sum, Kiwi Kani Roll, Potato Roll, Salmon and Lemon Roll, and mango/chocolate Mochi. All were incredibly delicious. Monday and Wednesday are half price on all sushi rolls which is an incredibly good deal. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is gooooood.  Yes it is trendy. And I guess you could say it is expensive, although by our standards it certainly wasn't. This is quality, fresh, well done sushi in a trendy, fun hot spot. It is hopping!  But the rolls and sushi were amazing and fresh and tasty and we had to stop ourselves from pigging out worse than we did!  This is sushi extremely well done. Even what we would consider NORMAL here was extraordinary!!"}
{"text":"ehh! If I had to sum up my review in one phrase I'd say that the fanciness of the venue is offset by the mediocre food & service, and less than average drinks. I was here with a couple friends one Saturday night, and the place was packed. Loud and lively, it's a great spot for a big group on a weekend. We started off with some drinks, and while I can't remember what everyone at our table ordered, I do remember that no one loved their cocktail. I'd recommend sticking with sake, beer or wine! The food presentation was lovely... nothing out of the ordinary though - flavor wise. The service was slow that evening, but in general the staff seemed very nice and courteous. There are a handful of comparable spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is great. The snapper is out of this world. Love it love it love it. Amazing menu, amazing service. We sat at the sushi bar, such skilled and talented chefs! Will be coming back, no doubt!"}
{"text":"The Lady and I had an absolutely awesome experience here. New Years Eve, we made call-ahead reservations that afternoon and arrived right on time (6:30). Easy to find on the side of Atherton Mill and easy to park as well, although they do offer a valet service. The ambiance oozes cool. Uplit branches, dark lighting, servers all in black, and few touches that say \"Yea, I'm also a japanese restaurant too\". Prices are on the high side, but not like..unreasonably high. Just not-every-week high.

Everything was to share, because that's how we do sushi. That's how everybody should do sushi. Our order:
Appetizer: O-Ku Spring Roll. Filled with fish and fresh veggies, and this sweet peanut sauce that I just wanted to pour on everything.
Rolls: Potato Roll. This was a really cool take on a fried roll, it had a fried potato 'crust' on the outside and well done fish on the inside. 
Mermaid Roll: Tempura fried and the only \"warm\" sushi on our plate, it melted in your mouth. 
Spider Roll: There's torched salmon on the top and that alone makes this roll worth it. Definitely would get again.
Yellowtail Hamachi: Laid on a basil pesto and had a thin slice of serrano pepper on top. This order will change depending on the quality of the fish, but ours...man. Awesome. This was good fish.

Our service was also excellent; our waitress explained everything in great detail as well as why certain things paired well with eachother. It was a pleasure eating at O-Ku and I can't wait to do it again."}
{"text":"Not sure why this has such good reviews, maybe we went on a bad day. I am also willing to cut some slack to new restaurants. Our food was at best \"okay\" and very overpriced. It was Halloween weekend and the staff was all in costumes which made the vibe a little clubbie/unprofessional. My sashimi platter took an hour and a half to arrive to the table (they did give me a glass of wine for the wait), but what bothered me is that they tried telling me that sashimi takes longer to make than regular rolls. That is insanity - sashimi is literally cut up fish- and I frequent the best sushi places in the US (nobu, morimoto, sushi samba, sugarfish, katsuya) and this has never happen! They were aware of issues but only the waitress apologized. I never saw the manager and we have several issues during our meal. Go spend your hard earned money at Nikko - yes it's pricey but at least you always have great service and great food!"}
{"text":"After a horrible initial experience, the manager contacted me to give them another chance.  I did not take any compensation or special treatment for a revisit, and I specifically told the manager that I wanted an organic experience.  We arrived to a not so crowded O-Ku and were promptly seated.  The waitress who brought over water to our table greeted us by the name on our reservation (nice touch).  We were happy to be there on one of the 12 Days Of Christmas deals, half off a bottle of wine!!  It was delish!  We ordered our food, and I was very clear that I did not want ANY fish eggs due to me being vegetarian.  This time, it was a success... no fish eggs.  However, the chef forgot to put avocado in my two ingredient roll (avocado and cucumber) so he apologized and remade the roll promptly.  The waitress took the roll off our ticket, even though we did not complain or ask for that to happen.  Great service!!  I was slightly disappointed that two out of two experiences resulted in food being incorrectly prepared, but the resolution of the issue by management was quickly mitigated to our delight and utmost satisfaction.  Service was exceptional this go around!!  I am glad to have given this a second chance, they did not let me down!"}
{"text":"I am wow'ed. Flabbergasted. Amazed. Appeased. EVERYTHING IN THE BOOKS! 

The only downside was that they had reservations on reservations so I had to sit at a community table with my boyfriend. 

Aside from that, the sushi was buy one half off, so we got two separate rolls each and they filled us up with no worries and my boyfriend knows how to EAT. One of the rolls my boyfriend got was a potato roll, and he stated how he liked how unique it was and that it would be a good roll for anyone who wanted sushi but didn't want fish or any type of protein in the roll. 

The ambience of the restaurant was so sleek and modern, it honestly felt like fine dining for a much easier price. 

My advice to you is if you want a table, call for a reservation and make sure you have adequate time for parking. The restaurant is in the corner of a shopping center with limited parking spaces near it, so be prepared to walk a little."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews from the Charleston location, and a sushi spot opening close to me, I was looking forward to checking out the new spot.
I made reservations for four on Wednesday night at 6:15, after hearing they have 1/2 price sushi rolls from 5:00-7:00.
We arrived at 6:15 and were seated immediately, and noticed the place was not as crowded as I expected being its first week. Needless to say, I love the atmosphere, great decor, bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner.
We decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter, a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings, served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good.
We ordered a variety, six, of the specially rolls. All were good, but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes, Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll, one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns, never again.
I was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab, by 6:30, so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try.
Prices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey. Not sure I would rush back, but did enjoy the atmosphere and may stop by for a drink or 1/2 price roll again."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews, I was bracing for another let down. I am happy to write that while the food did not blow us away, and the price tag was a little steep, I was very pleased with the service and the overall experience. 

Friday night 6:45pm, the place was pretty hopping already. Scoring a RSVP at this place is like trying to get a golden ticket. My initial RSVP was 9pm, sort of late for dinner but my friend and I were fine. Then last minute on day of, some cancellations must have happened and we got ourselves an earlier time. 

This isn't a big space. The entryway isn't grand. In fact it is very small, kind of hidden. Just look for Big Ben (the British pub) and it's next to it facing Tremont. 

SETTING: Intimate, small with good use of high ceiling industrial space to make it feels less crowded but you are pretty close to other patrons. We were sat at a table right at the bathroom entry, not the greatest spot but for 2 people it was fine as we sat away from the walkway.

DRINKS: We had beer and liquor drinks all night, thus can't speak of their cocktails. I did see quite a few unfinished cocktail drinks at other tables... so maybe just stick with beer/liquor/sake. 

FOOD: I had the miso soup ($4) - the seafood dashi did give it a little \"ocean\" taste so if you don't eat seafood, beware. We had the Wagyu Tartare ($16) - it was a little tough/chewy which I didn't expect. Good flavor but for the price and the tiny portion, not sure if I would order this again. For entree we shared the largest sashimi/nigiri combo ($100). Not sure if any 2 people need $100 worth of raw fish (lol). Great presentation. Lots of food yet we somehow managed to finish almost all of it. BEST were the salmon (Scottish & Ora King). Enjoyed the Uni. A little disappointed by the Otoro, but I am never much of a tuna fan.

SERVICE: Allison was really attentive. And when my friend got caught off guard by the black volcano salt and didn't quite enjoy the Otoro, she got the manager to bring us another 2 pieces without the salt for a 2nd chance tasting. 

ONLY RANT: What's up with the 2 single use (unisex) bathrooms for the ENTIRE place? This is not about the nightmare of the bathroom law politics, this is about the practicality of not enough bathrooms for use. Be prepared to wait in line (both guy & gal), and to feel rushed while in the bathroom (because you can hear the complaining from the line across the wall). 

OVERALL - good, definitely less disappointing than other new spots I have tried recently. Will revisit and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday evening for my fiance's coworker's birthday. The coworker's wife works here so the staff was super nice to our party of I think 9 people. The chef was very generous to give us food on the house. They must really value that employee but anyways food was pretty good. The only problem and why I gave it a 3 star was because the next day, both my fiance and I ended up having a stomachache and going to the restroom more than usual. I hate that that had happened because it was my first time there and I was thinking I'd come back here again some time."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night. The food is always great but the expediting is terrible. We saw our meal sitting out for a solid 10 minutes before it was brought over to us after it had been cooked. The dumplings were lukewarm. If they had just sent them out early (they are an app) then they would have been better. I would rather have my food staggered and warm, than all together and cold. There were also 4 people standing over by where the food comes out chatting and goofing off with some guy sitting at the sushi bar. The wait staff has 0 sense of urgency, but would go back for the food."}
{"text":"O-KU never disappoints. Our waitress was amazing. She gave us recommendations and we tried them and everything was phenomenal. I love that the plates are shareable and always full of funky flavors. Its a great place for a special occasion and for a different take on sushi. I couldn't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh unique modern Sushi and Asain dishes!! Sooo tasty you can taste the quality. Yes can be pricier but usually sushi is more on expensive end and this is worth it! Try all of the small plates and appetizers and share with your party. I'm in love"}
{"text":"This place is an interesting mix of sushi-Asian-fusion-dark-lighting-dining. The drink menu is a good mix of sake, cocktails, beer and wine. I mostly had sake, the wait staff gave great descriptions and offered samples of the various sake. 

The o-ku spring roll is fresh and a great way to start the meal, though the soy sauce reduction was a bit grainy. I had two rolls, the mermaid and the very light and fresh salmon-lemon.  But my favorite of the evening was the tuna tart! I am a huge fan of truffle oil so it might be an acquired taste for some. 

The only drawback of the evening was how quickly and easily it was to spend money as most of the items are $15+ and that some sake is not available
Unless you buy the bottle."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great dining experience!  Great ambiance!  Very cool upscale decor!  Great presentation of all dishes and everything was delicious!!!  The service was great too!  Definitely need reservations!!  And, they have valet parking!!
Two very satisfied thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Went to O-Ku last night and everything about it was out of this world! We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Samantha was our server and she was FANTASTIC! She actually just got back from a two-week, cross-country road trip. Samantha, you are the bomb and I hope you take me with you on your road trip next time.

Anyway, we started with drinks because we were waiting on a member of our party to arrive. Samantha brought out complimentary edamame, which was good but a little too salty (my only complaint). She also brought out complimentary pork dumplings and a bite-sized shrimp dish since we had two first-timers in our party. The pork dumpling was delicious -- great flavor -- and I loved the ginger dipping sauce.

I ordered the tuna crunch roll and the avocado wrapped roll. The tuna crunch was awesome -- tender tuna with great flavor from the eel sauce. The roll didn't fall apart when I picked it up, which I appreciate. The avocado roll had vegetables wrapped in rice with a layer of avocado topped with fruit salsa and ginger. It was really unique and tasty.

Our experience was fabulous -- food, service, parking, atmosphere, and drinks were all amazing. 

Also, I love their Monday and Wednesday half-price rolls from 5-7pm. 

See ya soon, O-Ku!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and great atmosphere. Get there early or sit and the bar and expect to spend a lot!"}
{"text":"Tremendously good sushi. I had the salmon tartar, the quail egg, the salmon eggs, the wagyu beef nigiri and a rainbow roll. The wagyu beef nigiri and the salmon tartar stand out as incredibly good--possibly the best beef I've ever had, actually. The eggs were nice and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Great decor, sushi, and friendly staff! We sat at the bar, and the bartender was super friendly and accommodating, I wish I could remember her name. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Great vibe and unique atmosphere! Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has extremely nice décor and a good vibe. A very open concept and great lighting. Parking was a breeze on a Thursday night.

Sushi was fresh but unspectacular. Maybe a little heavy with the rice (vs protein) on the rolls we ordered. Miso soup was standard.Tuna Tacos were comically small. When they came out everyone laughed. We thought that it was a joke. Knew they wouldn't be full sized taco but they were about 1.5 inches long. 

Service was prompt and attentive.

Everything tasted fine and I certainly wouldn't be opposed to coming back to this spot. You are paying for the vibe and decor which are admittedly great but it is a little pricy (as most sushi places are) and there are better values out there for my money."}
{"text":"This was a treat! A choice Japanese restaurant in Charlotte! The decor is warm and modern elegant, and very comfortable noise-level. We sat at a high top table which gave us a good view of the whole place. The waiter was great, gave an overview if the whole menu and had smart recommendations. Favorite dishes: the lobster maki rolls--delicious! And a bit filling. Also loved the tuna cerviche & seaweed salad (I can't believe I've gone this long w/o trying seaweed salad. I am getting info that from now on).The mermaid roll was interesting, very tasty. The salmon sushi was very fresh, as was the octopus. For dessert-butterscotch pudding with caramel & black toasted sesame seeds. Not as heavy as it sounds--and super flavorful. O-ku is a special occasion restaurant! Also good for in town clients.They know their fish and their recipes are wonderful! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food: Excellent
Service: Excellent
Atmosphere: Excellent

Awesome restaurant and their GM is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for dining for a special occasion.  Neat cocktails.  Appetizers are interesting.  We got the dim sum and wagyu tartare.  The dim sum disappeared but I was the only one that liked the tartare.  The other two I went with didn't like the consistency.  We all got sushi for dinner.  The green eggs and hamachi sushi is very flavorful but word to the wise - it has asparagus in it so if u don't like asparagus, might wanna avoid it.  We sat at the bar and the service was decent until around 8:15 when they started getting super busy.  Basically there was a second line of people around the bar and understandably the two bartenders had trouble keeping up.  

All in all, great experience but the reason I gave it a four is because of the price.  I definitely think this place has great food and decent service but I'm not sure the cost is justified.  You're definitely paying for the atmosphere here (and maybe the cocktails) because I would certainly make the argument that ru sans down the street has sushi that's arguably just as flavorful (and many, many more sushi options) for half the price.  So if you're not interested in a date night or trying to impress someone at a hip new restaurant, I'd go there."}
{"text":"First time last night and loved the place, great atmosphere, good pour on the cocktails and apps and sushi where excellent.   Rivals the Charleston O-Ku for food, service and atmosphere.   New favorite place."}
{"text":"A friend of mine raved about this restaurant, while warning me about how it gets to capacity quickly. I made plans to forgo the reservation route, and just go in right as the doors opened for the evening. I didn't quite get there when I anticipated, and I wasn't in the mood to wait, so my date and I had already chosen a backup in case we had to wait for a seat. Luckily, even with most of the chairs occupied, we were able to score a table right away.

The decor is lovely and it's a great setup to impress your date. I started off with a Lychee martini while looking over the sushi roll selection. Everyone says the potato roll is delicious, so we ordered that along with the Mermaid, and two others. All of the rolls were delicious. Typically I can decide which ones I would skip on my next visit, but they were all so good, I truly couldn't choose. I actually wish I had ordered a fifth roll. 

O-Ku is a definite GO!"}
