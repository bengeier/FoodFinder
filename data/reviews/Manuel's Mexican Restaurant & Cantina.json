{"text":"Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Not great, but not terrible either.

Pros: My wife liked the salsa, but I say it's just okay. You get two different types, and the red salsa they give you just tastes like a mix of Hormel chili and ketchup.

-Taco; Really liked the shell; it was like you get at a street vendor, seemingly just-cooked and folded. The chicken inside also tasted \"homey,\" like chicken you boiled for hours to make a soup till it was tender. Very brothy and nice.

-Speed; our food was out in a matter of minutes. Kinda scary, actually, as one reviewer put it. Is everything frozen and reheated? Didn't seem that way, as I said my taco was pretty good. But who knows?

Cons: -Lack of spice; nothing on either of our plates had any spice. That said, I feel this place is definitely Mexican food for dumb Americans who can't handle it. Not that I'm looking to burn my mouth on every bite, but a hint of something here and there wouldn't hurt.

Most everything else about this place is unimpressive, but passable. The decor is what you'd expect, service is decent, prices okay I guess. I'm not sure why other reviewers think this place looks dumpy, seemed clean and presentable to me. I'd say \"in a pinch, it'll do,\" but with so many other Mexican places around that's meaningless and Manuel's is just a face in the crowd.

Bottom-line: Go here if you want typical Mexican with a slightly better-than-average dining room atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant based on the appearance--which wasn't bad but not super special either.  Totally worth the stop though!  Seriously good Carnitas.  House-made hot sauce.  Great prices.  Muy bueno!!"}
{"text":"Hector, who works in the bar area is the man! He deserved all of,our tip. I hope their management realizes what a good worker he is."}
{"text":"I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting."}
{"text":"The best food! The best service! Great looking after their recent renovation. We absolutely love Manuel's, everything is terrific."}
{"text":"Previously liked this place a lot, but the last few visits have really bombed. Most recently, a couple days ago. 

Here's the thing, this place is currently undergoing some major construction. There are no signs indicating the place is even open, let alone where to go since the front door is basically a disaster area of blasted asphalt and bare bones concrete blocks.

That said, these folks should be thanking the HEAVENS anyone is walking into their establishment.

So my recent visit went like this: Me, my Dad and my Aunt came in for lunch. Jesus was our server. Dad asked for the mini-chimi appetizer. I order a chicken burrito with fundido and verde sauce. No beans, just rice please.

Dad gets a full sized chimichanga, whilst my order is not only missing verde, but the rice. My order goes back once they realize the mistake...they bring it back, only now with rice still missing. Dad meanwhile realizes he's got the wrong item too.

Brought the issue up with Jesus, who is clearly irritated and has the audacity to argue that my Dad ordered from the lunch menu. Thing is, I saw him point to the chimi on the appetizer section when he ordered. Wrong answer, Jesus.

Service was so rude, I'd be reluctant to return to this place ever again.

Word to the wise: Get the attitude in check, Jesus. Don't blame the customer for your ordering errors... especially when people like us are willing to dine in your very dusty dining room as your establishment undergoes construction."}
{"text":"This place is very overrated. Food will cost you 15-20 dollars per person, and you can get much better from traditional Mexican diners at half the price. Service was not good, and the food was not good. I had Fajitas, and Applebee's produces a better product. Will not go back again, and in an area dominated by a lot of quality Mexican cuisine, this is a place to skip"}
{"text":"Quick, easy and delicious. My fiancé and I went here to ran a quick bite to eat ! Service was friendly and quick! Food was super good! I got the pollo fundito! My fiancé loved the mango margarita! We will defiantly return!"}
{"text":"OK for food. it falls into one of my routine lunch places if I run out of ideas. good for margaritas."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food. Nachitos came out and made me laugh, as the name implies that they are small. They are not. Great fajitas too."}
{"text":"The BEST salsa, hot sauce and chips hands down! Isn't that why we go out for Mexican food? They also serve delicious calabasitas but just call it their steamed vegetable."}
{"text":"I haven't  been to Manuel's in awhile and as always the food was really good. We were seated in a back room close to the kitchen. I'm always cold but I was roasting in that room. The waiter took great care of us and I loved the margaritas."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in the vicinity. Their food is always excellent. I love their chunky salsa, not spicy. Their other salsa is spicy! I LOVE the green corn tamales!! Also love the sopapillas, but wish they would fill them with whipped cream! I've tried Tee Pee Mexican restaurant and it is boring and the food is mediocre. Forget Garcia's! Come here for the real deal!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was as well. Only positive thing about this place was the margaritas. 
I came with 5 people, I had to ask for my drinks to be refilled, every plate but one was not made right. The manager barely helped. Seemed more upset that we wanted to leave than our orders being messed up."}
{"text":"Irma, Fernando, Yasmin, & Jose are top notch servers with back up from Tony & Jesus as the best bus persons.
Coming here for years and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. One guy was running around doing everything and there were 5 servers sitting by the front door not doing anything, the guy took the order of the older ppl behind us and never got back to us, so we left. First time going and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this establishment for about 17 years, but lately the service has been terrible. My last 3 visits sucked, no drink refills or silverware. I love how the waiters ignore you when it's time to bring the bill."}
{"text":"Love Manuel's!  Always good food and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Is it Authentic? - yes.

But...I wanted to like this place and I can't. Maybe because I'm not a fan over-salted greasy sonoran food with the loud speakers from an over-amplified one man band 5 feet from my ears while I'm trying to hold a conversation. The indigestion was not a pleasant souvenir.

If I want very loud music, I'll go to a concert but it's not appropriate at a \"family restaurant\".  Put it this way - my (almost) 4 year old was on the edge of tears because her ears were hurting from the crappy music.  

Next time I'm here and want Mexican food, I think I'll just go to Teakwoods Tavern in the same parking lot and order Nacho's and a bucket of Coronas instead."}
{"text":"It isn't well known but each Manuel's is owned by one of the children of the original owner- the best one is on Peoria, that is one that you hear good things about."}
{"text":"Excellent food, bartenders are always awesome and make me my favorite beer/margarita drink.   Only thing management needs to do is get a new/bigger Margarita machine."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of this local,  fairly traditional spot for nearly 40 years!  I actually once worked at the one on 32nd Street and Indian School for a week.

The salsa I can eat as a soup.  Nice and chunky, fresh, all around yummy.  The spicier salsa can be slightly dipped in periodically as necessary for an added hotttttness.  

The menu hasn't changed much over the years.  The food is fresh and if not too careful could border non-authentic.  Overall, this is a great place you can count on for a sweet Mexican food experience.

My granddaughter and I are now the matriarch's in the family to continue the tradition of being loyal to this landmark!"}
{"text":"Our most favorite Mexican food! Stellar customer service!  Great food, great prices, best wait staff...win win win!"}
{"text":"I write this review as I finish the second of two lime candies that were given to me along with the check. While that part comes last, I feel the need to comment on how good those things are. They are exponentially better than peppermint candies that are ubiquitous at family restaurants. 

Anyway, that's probably not why you're here reading this review. Manuel's provided exactly what I was looking for--great Sonoran Mexican food and a down-to-each, low-key atmosphere to go along with it. The experience started off walking into the building, which is located in a strip mall. The building itself seemed to be older than the rest of the mall. Anyway, it worked. The interior is standard 1980s Mexican with the terra cotta tiles all over and sombreros gracing the walls and ceiling. Pretty much sets up the experience the way is should be. Two waiters both tended to the table, answered questions, took part of the order, and continued to serve us through the whole meal. Not only were they both affable, we got twice the attention!

The recommendations they provided were genuine; not limited to \"people like this...\" No, both waiters told us exactly what they liked and gave reasons. The entrees were preceded by some pretty tasty salsas (yes, two o' them!) and chips and a cheese crisp, which we ordered from the appetizers.

The two of us who dined there had carnitas and the three amigos enchiladas, both which came with rave reviews. If you're not looking for three enchiladas, may I recommend the spinach with white sauce. Neither disappointed. It's true, you need to like cheese and a little grease with you food. But that's exactly why you'd be at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to Manuels for over 25 years.  It's authentic, rich, delicious and great priced. Always have great service for. The moment we walk in. I love the steak fajitas, enchiladas, margaritas and ofcouse the chips and salsa!! It is a place I love and recommend."}
{"text":"I came in for a late dinner on a weekday and it was very busy! Luckily they sat our large party very quickly even though only a couple people were there.  The service was outstanding and I am fairly certain our server was the only one in the two front rooms, I frequently observed him picking up and delivering food on both rooms to the left and right of the lobby including other large parties.  We started with the mini chimi platter pretty standard as an appetizer.  For my meal I usually get the chimichanga with chicken fajita filling, seasoned pieces of chicken peppers and onions, sour cream, guacamole rice and beans.  By the time you pay $2.25 extra for the chicken fajita filling its around a $15.00 chimichanga so it's a little pricey but so good.  Tonight I decided on the Chilequiles since I had never seen it in their menu before.  It is kind of a Mexican casserole with chicken cheese sour cream and green sauce this version said it had corn chips baked in, usually it is made with corn tortillas but I thought \"why not I love their chips\".  Let's start with the good news it was jam packed with shredded chicken that was moist and had great flavor.  Now for the bad the chips just turned into a soggy mush and the green sauce made it feel more like a thick chicken soup than a casserole.  The rice and beans were fantastic so after finishing those and the appetizer I was okay just picking at my soup.  2.5 stars for that dish due to the chicken everyone else's food was good now I just know what I can skip next time"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and everything was amazing from the food to the dessert! I had the Manuel's chimichanga and is was delicious. I also recommend trying there fried ice cream."}
{"text":"After buying takeout dinner for two tonight, we will no longer be customers of Manuels. Overpriced and terrible quality food. I'm sorry, but $5.25 for a cheese enchilada is ridiculous, when other nearby restaurants do a better job for less.  The red chili burro I got was flavorless, and the pint of salsa (also overpriced) was lousy. I am a Phoenix native, and I won't go back. The chain has gotten careless and greedy."}
{"text":"It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. 

I've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. 

Our food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more \"juice\" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. 

I've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)"}
{"text":"Love the food here it's the first time for us here since the remodel. I still love this place and free fried ice cream tonight."}
{"text":"Wowsa! Service anyone? Not so much here at Manuel's. A gal I work with me asked me if I wanted to head a couple blocks over to split a chimi for a late lunch today. I can never eat a whole chimi, and neither could she. I was game, especially since I was hungry, and it would give me a chance to further avoid the mountain of work I had to do. I take procrastination to an art form.

Manuel's has always been a safe, average place for a quick lunch. There is nothing new or innovative going on here, but it does the job. Anyway, our waiter sauntered up to the table, and by saunter I mean he was an old guy with an odd limp (not his fault). As the bus boy was getting us water/chips/salsa, the waiter in pseudo friendly way asks: \"two margaritas ladies?\" 
I said we'd like to but we're going back to work. He gets our sadly non-alcoholic drink order and leaves. When he brings our drinks we tell him we are ready to order, and that we are going to split the lunch chimi combo. He says OK, in an very irritated tone, and literally walks to the next table without even taking our menus. As he passed back by I asked if they had flan, he said yes, took the menus, and walked off. Uh, I guess I won't be getting any?

Now I have worked in restaurants and I knew exactly was his attitude was about. Two women sharing one lunch, he was thinking low bill and shitty tip. He gave up the moment he heard we were sharing. I personally tip according to service in a situation like that, not the bill. Also he never tried to sell anything else, I practically handed it to him with my dessert question. I was going to order flan to go, but he was so rude I said forget it.  

Other than dropping off the food without a word, he never spoke to us again. I haven't felt that ignored since my 7th grade crush on a 9th grader...Chris.... The busser did the rest, including taking my card for payment. As we walked out, the waiter walked by us, and never said a word. That was before he even saw the tip. I actually tipped him just over 20%, but if he wasn't such a complete ass, he would have made more.

Believe me, I am fairly easy to charm. Ask any of my ex-boyfriends. The crabby old guy decided he wouldn't make that much from our table, and made it happen with embarrassingly bad service."}
{"text":"Great staff and super delicious food.  Don't forget to check out the Margaritas. .. great find for an out of town tourist"}
{"text":"I like their seafood enchiladas because of the cheesy espinaca sauce, but I am biased because I love cheese. Their miniature platter is especially good. I can never finish it because I stuff my face with chips and salsa. The chunky salsa is probably the best I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican restaurant none other like it great food great price great service best chips and salsa around"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example."}
{"text":"Decent food nothing special.  This location was recently remodeled. The happy hour has lots of options but the food you get for the price is not really worth it. They do have Dos Equis Amber on draft which is nice- happy hour drink prices are good and worth a visit if you're in the mood for mediocre and average priced Mexican food."}
{"text":"Had the spinach enchilada...excellent chips are fresh and service is good. Avoided the margaritas because of taquila choices but if you bot particular go for it."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Manuel's (this location) for 20+ years.  The chips always arrive nice and warm.  I've never had a bad meal at this location.  I believe the wait staff makes this place that much better.  They always are so welcoming and very attentive.  This is our go to place for special events."}
{"text":"Ordered  their Mexican  pizza . It was bland the shredded beef was overcooked  . The chips were decent but the hot sauce had too much tomatoes  and was not spicy.  Service was average"}
{"text":"It's really nice to be able to enter an establishment that makes you feel welcome and at ease right away, as if you're a visiting close relative or a family member; that is my experience of their service. The food is mostly standard Mexican restaurant favorites which are well-prepared, well-priced and generously portioned. Location is convenient and parking is usually no problem even though it is in a relatively busy commercial plaza."}
{"text":"I like the fact the food came out so fast once ordered! & especially during the lunch hour! Staff was friendly & helpful. The & lunch specials were good portions & great price!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all.

We had the red chili con carne burro and mexican pizza.  The meat in the burro could have been shredded a bit more but the flavor was nice.  I also like the little bed of shredded lettuce it comes on to help with the heaviness of the plate.  The Mexi pizza could have been a little easier on cheese and sliced olives all over it would have been nice.  But it was tasty enough.

The service was very good by the helper/busboy person but the waiter was a little on the slow side.  I'd like to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and efficient, food was very good.  I had the Spinach Enchiladas and the sauce was very good.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Come here weekly to meet with friends. Always good service.  Always delish food."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here a few weeks ago and had a good, cheap, quick meal.  $6.99 for an enchilada, taco, rice and beans...what a deal!  Good chips and salsa too!"}
{"text":"Good food. Lunch and breakfast menu as well as a full dinner menu. They can handle larger groups. We had 16. My favorite is the Pollo Especial."}
{"text":"I have been going to Manuels's since the original location close for 25 yrs. it was located on 32nd str Indian School. 28th street just recently did a make over, not that's it's not beautiful looking but I miss the old style set up, was just more comfy & I felt like I was gone in my dining room. Food is still as delicious! Love there green corn tamales!"}
{"text":"Manuel's is a chain and with all chains, some are better than others. The one on West Bell Rd is great, consistent and friendly. This Manuel's falls short of the other. A co-worker and I have gone there 2ce for \"gotta have Mexican \" lunches and both times we were disappointed. The best thing is the chips and salsa--no problems there except no one comes by to check if we needed more. Which leads to the service. At best it's slow, at worst...well, I've had to refill our water glasses myself because there is just not that attention to the needs of the customers. The food has been \"meh\", not well seasoned, not cooked with that attention to detail that is so important. I asked our waiter this last time for a dessert menu. He brought the regular menu that had no desserts on it. I went to the front and asked for one and guess what? There's an actual menu devoted to desserts. That's an example of the lack of attention to detail, to subpar customer service and overall lackluster work ethic that made us agree that 2 strikes and you're out--will not be back nor will I be recommending this particular location to anyone.We should have known that, during prime-time lunch rush, there were not a lot of customers there. Now there will be less...."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. 

Disclaimer: This review is wholly based off of service. I placed a to-go order and upon my return home, realized they forgot my cheese crisp. I'd argue that I shouldn't have to check my order if this was even a mediocre establishment considering they read my order back to me when picking up, but fine, I'll take the hit, my fault for not checking. I had my wife call to let them know they forgot our cheese crisp while I drove back. They confirmed that it would be ready when I got there. Upon my return, not only was our cheese crisp not ready, they had the audacity to ask me if I was sure they didn't give it to me. After waiting for them to actually make a cheese crisp, I headed home. When unpacking the remainder of our dinner, nothing was correct in regards to the substitutions we made. I had red sauce instead of the green I specifically ordered. No added shrimp on one of our dishes. No side of sour cream. No guacamole. 

The entire restaurant lacks any degree of even mediocre service. When you can't even get the most basic of details for an order, it's pure laziness and lack of care for your patrons. 

DO NOT GO HERE. The lack of service, the mediocre food, and the relatively exorbitant prices are not worth your time or money. This place deserves to fester and die for its serious lack of...well...everything. You'd be better off at Chipotle. At least they get your order right."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place before going grocery shopping, and ended up being a horrible mistake. It had nothing top do with our server the gentlemen did a good job; However, While we were eating we noticed two employees( two females) whispering ans laughing staring and standing directly in front of us down the dining room hall. I didn't think they were really talking about us until one pointed, and my boyfriend looked up which made them give it away. For one, I was a server not too long ago and no matter what the excuse is, you do NEVER let a customer know you're talking about them! And on top of that both of those employees weren't even working on our side, so they had no business being there anyways. I called the manager over, because I was too upset to even finish my meal. Explained to him the whole situation, and all he did was apologize, give us %25 off the bill, and said he would look into it but he doubts that the girls will admit it. Honestly, it's a restaurant, there's cameras. He suggested that we sit in the bar area next time. I do not plan on ever coming back again. If I wanted people to stare at me and be able to say what the want right in front of me, with no apology, I'd go to McDonalds. I just thought an apology would be more appropriate verses giving me a discount and doubting they'll admit to it. If you have the nerve to talk about someone you DONT EVEN KNOW AT WORK you should have the nerve to apolopgize to their face. Thanks for a stomach and headache."}
{"text":"Service here varies on the person and day of the week.
Food always looks like it was microwaved. So awful. 
Only reason I gave it two stars was because of the drinks."}
{"text":"Food is always good never had bad food. Service is good for the most part its very seldom that it is not good. But everyone has a off day. Wish the prices were not so high."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and Manuels. This location though, is terrible. As soon as me and my party (a party of 2) got inside we were not greeted. It was gloomy and uninviting. The lady who led us to our table seemed annoyed and inattentive. When we asked her a question about the outside patio she rolled her eyes. Once we got to the table we waited for a good 10 minutes before our server came around. In addition there weren't many people there. He then asked what my party wanted to drink and walked away without asking me what I wanted to drink. Then proceeded to bring the wrong things out. The chips and salsa were mediocre. This place used to be so good. We left the location due to poor quality service and food before we ordered our entrees, that's how appalled we were. I will NEVER return to this location. I am a firm believer in good customer service."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Good prices, fast, and always consistent.  The recent remodel including a great outdoor patio space was done really nicely.  All in all a very good experience."}
{"text":"Since my first review several months ago...this place has not gotten any better, and the service issues have insured that I will not be back.  I have been back here I think 3 times since then, and its still the same, the SERVICE BLOWS. Out of those 3 times, only once was the service half way descent. 

The staff seems overwhelmed and under motivated, like they are not happy to be there, you have to literally go out of your way to track down a server if you need a drink refill which is pretty sad considering most things on the menu have some sort of spice to them. 

The only reason this place gets a review or any stars is because the only saving grace is the Chips and Salsa are pretty damn good, but even this last time the salsa seemed a bit watered down. 

The rest of the food is just OK, and I have tried several items. It's good but nothing to write home about, I think the poor service just ruins it. I went in the other night and asked to sit in the back section past the bar area since I had never been seated back there before. The girl told me it was already closed for the evening but as we were seated, I noticed that there were  no less then 4 tables in that area being sat at, and 1 large party. So this miffed me right off the bat, everything else was down hill from here. 

Next time I  am craving Mexican food I am more apt to go to Julioberto's down the street and get it to go then sit in this place and get treated like a second class citizen by the staff. Hey Owner...here's a clue, have a manager on the floor, walking around helping out and meeting your customers before you lose them all."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. Pretty standard menu of mexican food.  The food comes out fast and piping hot.  I had the carnitas chimichanga and it was really good.  The guac served on top was delicious and not all runny like some others in town.  The margaritas are big, delicious and fairly priced.  Oh!  And you get free chips and salsa if you're ordering a meal.  Love me some chips and salsa, especially when the mild is so tasty.  I would go back to Manuel's to try a bit more of the menu and to take advantage of happy hour margaritas!"}
{"text":"Best chips,salsa and hot sauce! Perfect bean burritos. Friendly service and clean. I like the remodel. Cool bathroom sinks. You must check them out."}
{"text":"There food is Amazing! I didn't care for the salsa which was the only hiccup, but the meal amazing. I had the three amigos which consist of a shredded beef, shredded chicken and a spinach enchiladas (separate not combined) the sauce was amazing. I love that they brought the food hot not warm what a difference from other places that bring you a warm plate than hot and fresh. My friend had the fish tacos and again so Good!!!!! I love be the service, our waitress was polite and friendly and so pleasant, even updating us on the status of our meal. The atmosphere is perfect for large groups or even just for hang out."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!"}
{"text":"Great food consistently and always friendly service.  Manuel's is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  There are nice vegetarian options, like my all-time favorite, chile relleno and the famous Phoenix cheese crisp (something you can't find out of state).

Their chips and hot sauce are so good, you have to be careful not to fill up.  The guacamole is served in generous portions and tasty.  The atmosphere at this location is clean and lively.

I could eat here 3 times a day."}
{"text":"We have been going here for over 40 years. The staff is always friendly and courteous.
Only 1 time did we have an issue and it was promptly taken care of in a very respectful fashion.
They must treat their employees well as some have been there for 30 years.
 Some of them are on a first name basis with us. Service is always quick and friendly.
I'm very happy it is close to home as we frequent this establishment at least twice a month.
Kudos to the Manuel family for doing it right. 
Mexican tonight??? Yep."}
{"text":"Very very good. Cheese enchiladas with a taco. Even the side taco was one of the best. But a lil pricy. I got 2 Chz ench. W taco beans and rice. $18."}
{"text":"My boss and I ate there yesterday. I really like their chips and salsa. We had the lunch specials. Chimichangas. I think it cost us 20 bucks for our lunch. It was pleasant and we got our food pretty quickly. I'd go there again for lunch."}
{"text":"This is part of a local chain, this location is the missing-link in the chain.  This location is in an older part of Phoenix not a location for the tourist.  
I can only compare this place to my high school cafeteria during \"Mexican\" food day.  The place is as cozy as a cafeteria, the servers must have been trained by the \"lunch ladies\", the noise from the children is only outdone by the screaming parents and the food is a step below Taco Bell.  If you are looking for Mexican food head back to high school.  In a city full of Mexican restaurants you can find a better place by throwing a dart at the map."}
{"text":"Have always loved this place, however recently went in for dinner and the service was not only bad but the attitudes are horrible!!! We were greeted by a short hostess by the name of Dora (?) ...didn't smile &seemed like her night was going bad or something but her attitude sucked! She was complaining to another worker that she didn't do something correct right in front of customers...very unprofessional &bossy. She sat us and my husband& i proceeded to order, eat &leave as usual...oh &we had to ask for a water refill numerous times. As we left not once did the chubby female manager(who also acted like her dog just died or something) NOR did the hostess smile and say goodnight...attitude is everything people &you're going to start losing customers if you don't begin enjoying, or at least pretend to enjoy your job."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I went here for lunch today. It was good. Chips and salsa were decent. Salsa could use more heat though. Chips were crisp and tasted fresh. The lunch menu was good. We had the beef chimichanga lunch specials and a coworker had fish tacos. We all enjoyed our meals. The price wasn't bad either. Would come here again. Staff was nice. Not much of a wait at noon either which is a plus."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Nothing spectacular, but passable enough. The employees seemed a little put-off. I don't know what the deal was there. But, anyway, if you want Mexican food in the area, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect but nicely surprised!!! Awesome margaritas and the three enchilada dinner was amazing!   And so reasonably priced!  New favorite Mexican!!!"}
{"text":"We have had Manuel's cater our office lunch twice in the last month and both times it was a hit. After years of falling back on pizzas we needed something new and Manuel's has been a great change.

First time we ordered the chicken fajitas and the second we ordered tamales and both were very well received. Sides were great and the salad was fresh. Both times the food served more than stated in the menu.

To top it off from the hostess to the managers they were nothing but helpful and everything was packed well and very professional!

Manny's will defiantly be a \"go to\" for us going forward."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend on 6/1/2013. What's not to like? It's close by, has a nice atmosphere, great service and reasonable prices. I had the mini steak tacos and edamame. Yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get takeout right. I ordered the same thing at Manuel's that I typically order at Tee Pee. The takeout was 100% better. Crisp, neat and tasted fantastic. I'd recommend Manuel's over Tee Pee if you're looking for good takeout."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at Manuels for 20+ years. We order dishes that arent even on the menu anymore and they make them no questions asked! Best salsa we've ever had. My grandmother moved away and insists that we have a family dinner at Manuel's everytime she comes to visit. The staff is quick and courteous. The prices are great. Definitely a place everyone should try!"}
{"text":"I've had excelente service here! Everyone is on top of their game and it's a very uplifting atmosphere, everyone is happy and energetic! I've had very good service with my waiter but the busser or other waiter Jesus A. Was the bomb he had outstanding work ethic!! Excelente Jesus A.!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group. I got the greens salad and it came in a dish the size of a child's bath tub. They mixed it at the table and I could barely make a dent in it. Everyone got tacos, enchiladas and chicken dishes and all were pleased. Service was excellent and they did not complain about splitting the bill eight ways. Beer, cold. Check. Good salsa, too."}
{"text":"Their shredded beef tacos are my go-to as well as their chips and salsa. Order takeout from here all the time!"}
{"text":"Great food...been eating here for thirty plus years. Food has the same top quality since I started eating here. Like family here....love the food! Best Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This food was pretty good, nothing spectacular. The wait staff is excellent, very attentive and helpful. The taquitos are crispy and have decent flavor. The rice is a little mushy, but has good flavor as well."}
{"text":"Usually we have a great time at Manuels but it was the worst food I had ever had on Mother's Day! Had to have my my soggy cheese crip remade and still was disgusting, the lettuce heady old sour taste to it the beans or water watered-down we go there at least once a week, after this horrible meal I'm looking for a new restaurant!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a local valley favorite for Mexican food, be sure to check out Manuel's. This is one our family favorites with weekly specials, best chips and salsa you can find, keep it coming!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 7 for a later lunch on Saturday. They were able to seat us right away and the service was great. The complementary chips and salsa were very tasty and they were refilled several times for our hungry group. Everyone said great things about what they ordered. 3 of us got different versions of the Chimichangas. I got the Carnitas with red sauce and it was fantastic. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been going here practically my whole life. It is my favorite mexican restaurant. It's not fancy, but it's not run down either - it's just right. The waiters are also always very nice.

I'm a total salsa snob and their chunky salsa is the best salsa ever. The hot sauce is also highly ranked in my book. I've had their cheese crisp, enchiladas, chimis - basic stuff like that. 
Their fried ice cream is really good too!

And the best part about it is that the salsa is wonderful at their different locations too. I'm just partial to this location since it's been the one I go to the most.
Very reasonable prices too.

Try them out!"}
{"text":"We are from Oklahoma visiting family and they brought us here, it wasn't yelp found :) 
Food was delicious the staff was very very helpful and kind. 
If your in the neighborhood this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! I come here with my family all of the time. Good food and spicy salsa!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this mexican place a try for a really late dinner. Gotta say it was pretty good! First off, the environment was comfortable and clean. Huge plus because while I'm all for hole-in-a-wall places for their great food, I still don't want them to actually look like a hole in the wall... that's not so appetizing. Our server didn't take long to get the drinks and put our order in. The food came out piping hot! Even though those plates could be like a 90's mcdonalds lawsuit for being so hot, the food was really great. Everything tasted well seasoned and fresh. I would definitely come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Not like my neighborhood Manuels. This place was cold, the service was sparse, and the food was horrible. Stay away."}
{"text":"I may be spoiled because I come from LA where the Mexican food everywhere is amazing but this place shouldn't be considered Mexican. Should be called tex-mex at best since even the salsas aren't even spicy enough or tasty enough. They're basically tomato sauce you could add your pasta to. And what \"Mexican\" restaurant charges for extra onions, cilantro and jalapeños? You could get handfuls of that for free at a taco truck. Very basic place. I'm again not from here and just here for work, but best place I had for Mexican so far in Phoenix is Irma's kitchen."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food for the price. 

Hot sauce is outstanding! Very affordable, clean and the staff is perfect. 

I can't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"October Menu of Taco The Town is great, offering a variety to meet everyone's tastes. I love the dessert idea of Pumpkin Mini Chimis! 
Manuel's is a long standing face representing the face of quality Mexican food in the valley. Since their restaurant on 32nd & Indian School, they have provided us with the level of food and friendly service we've all grown to love. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Manuel's? Well some locations are better than others. The one in Phoenix is on the old and dirty side, but the ones in Scottsdale and Mesa are nicer. The food is good, but a little greasy. I love their chips and salsa (all you can eat). Their prices are reasonable and they have a lot of items to choose from."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for a chimi and a marg. One of my friends had recommended it as being a little better than most \"border food\" places.  I have to say, I was walking in expecting very little. Every bible belt fatty from the midwest was there, acting like white trash, mispronouncing every word on the menu. I'm sure you can picture the type I'm trying to describe. I made my way to the bar and watched the baseball game during lunch, even though it wasn't on when I came in. The bartender was extremely accommodating and the service was great from start to finish. I ordered the green chili chimi and it was actually much, much, better than I had expected. I actually enjoyed the dish. The margarita was weak, and wouldn't recommend that, but the food and service here are actually pretty good. Take it for what it is though, as it is still greasy, heavy, border food."}
{"text":"This place has \"gringo\" food, not authentic. The food is not bad, but I doubt I will return. For real Mexican food, go to Rositas Place or Comedor Guadalajara."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place the food is always good. I think it's the best chips and salsa in town and we usually fill up on that before our dinner even gets to us."}
{"text":"I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!"}
{"text":"I have been going there for some time. Since the new bar I had not seen Patrica. I went in tonight watching sports and she was working at the bar. She has a great smile and works very hard and remembers everyone that goes in. Great service"}
{"text":"3 stars sums it up well enough. Decent, not great.

Acceptable chips. Decent salsa. Really very good hot sauce.

I had Tampiqueña which is a skirt steak and cheese enchilada. The steak was a bit over cooked and was seasoned with too much pepper. The enchilada was OK. nothing special. The guac was straight forward and good, just pretty skimpy. The carne machaca was disappointing. The menu says, \"special seasoning.\" more like \"no\" seasoning. 

The service was polite and friendly. The place was clean throughout.

No complaints. Just nothing to call attention to this place that begs for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here heard great things of other locations but sadly this location was no Bueno.

Parking sucks.

Called ahead to let them know we had a big party of 13 had to wait 1/2 for table.

My Menu had red sauce and tortilla on it. Yuk...

No Horchata.  Boooo

Salsa NOT! It was like chunky Tomato Sauce and Ketchup.

Took 1/2 an to take our order and it was only 8 of us, we had to tell bus boy that we were ready to order, so he had to get waiter.

Our food did not come at the same time it took 4 times.  Two plates at a time 5 minutes in between.

We ordered the Fajita's and it did not come out sizzling.... It was luke warm & barely any Chicken and even less Beef. 

A good thing was they did split our bill.

Very expensive.  2 Soda's and Fajita's for 2 was $42.00....

Went to restroom, only 2 stalls. One stall had 2 toilet liners on the toilet with pee all over it, someone didn't flush! The 2nd stall was occupied with someone farting.. It was a filthy bathroom so I walked out.

It was jam packed but don't let that fool ya.  I will not be going here again sadly."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I keep coming back. Yes, it's an older building but it feels authentic. Hot sauce is one of the best in town. Order the cheese crisp, extra cheese and extra crispy. Yum!"}
{"text":"Manuel's is consistent. Service is fast and friendly. Chips are warm and salsa is satisfying. When I worked closer, I'd come regularly for work lunch. We would time them bc food came out so quickly. Record time from server walking away with our order to returning with our food was 4min 53sec! Food is nothing that will wow you but if you're looking for a filling, mediocre Mexican meal (which I often am), Manuel's is a must. 

Also, they just finished their remodel. Bigger bar and brighter atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here on Cinco de Mayo and it was oddly a little slow.  The carne asada was great though.  They sat us in the back which was kind of weird.  They did give me a free t-shirt though! Very cool.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"I have been to other Manuel's in the past and a couple weeks ago I just wanted to have so good 'bad' Mexican food, so we went here. This was a huge disappointment. The BF and I got very 'easy' and Americanized dishes- I got a cheese crisp and rice and he got a bean and cheese burrito. I will say the cheese crisp was pretty disappointing. It had no flavor at all....none of that delicious cheesy goodness that is the essence of Americanized Mexican food.... I definitely will not be back here again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Manuel's, and it's MY PICK to take my family and friends for a good Mexican meal. It's consistent, clean, and has a great variety of dishes to choose from. The margaritas are pretty tasty, too, and well proportioned on the libation part, IYKWIM. The restroom have been modernized to make hands free washing and drying of hands an ease, but if you're like me and Sheldon, who need a paper towel to open the door upon leaving, they have those too...BIG Points, here!

I've been here on several occasions...once with my daughter's family, including two little ones, once by myself, and once with my favorite woman. The service has been great at all times, with the chips being served as if they are needing to make room in the Kitchen, or something, because they keep coming!

I'm big on service, and I've learned that good service will find good customers, and I can be a very good customer (when I want to be). Last Friday night it was hopping! Diner time, right? We got seated fairly quickly, but the area in which we were seated had a huge family shindig going on, and our server (Michelle) was hustling. We saw her make SEVERAL trips with hot plates coming from the kitchen, so I thought I'd speed up the libations and went to the bar myself, while my partner was left with ordering, should our server get a break from the the loud family...no worries though. It was my night to be a great customer, and it paid off!

We complimented our gal for doing such a fine job, not only with attending to our needs, but the entire section she was in charge of. She thanked US, and even gave us a 15% discount because we had to go get our own (well liquored) margaritas, SCORE! This went right back in HER pocket, because like I said, this night I chose to be a Great Customer, and it paid off. Oh, and the food, it was good, but I don't really remember (see the note about the Margaritas)."}
{"text":"The Dogg says. Muy bien Manuel's.  It's the Sonoran style type of comida Mexicano that is prevalent in AZ.   My taco was full of shredded beef and had good flavor. It was also stuffed full of lettuce tomato onions and cheese. My tostada was very crispy the beans tasted homemade and was one of the best tostadas I've ever had. Manuel's has one of the most tastiest salsas in the state. You can actually get full eating just chips and salsa with a beer and use your dinner as a partial appetizer and lunch for the next day. I miss the 32nd St. and Indian school location! But this one on 28th street has also been very good. Great service. Good food for the money. Get your taste buds over there and check out a great standard Mexican food restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Best salsa ever! I love that they give you two kinds, tastes great to mix them. *Awesome* crispy cheese crisps--I highly suggest getting one with green chilis & green onions on top, delicious beans, etc. If I were rating on food alone, they'd get 5 stars, hands down. 
However, although the service is typically good, tonight my experience with that was initially very poor. I asked to sit on the patio, which was recently remodeled (pretty nice albeit too brightly lit & really loud being right on Indian School). One of the two hostesses sat me at a table of my choice, and brought silverware, a plate, and placemat right away. Chips & salsa arrived shortly thereafter, which are SO GOOD. Hot chips, best salsa (I drove 10 miles from my house just for it)! Here's where my experience drastically went south: I sat for ten solid minutes with no acknowledgment. I *finished* my chips & salsa (quite voraciously & happily), and still had not been greeted, still had *no water,* etc. I was one of three tables outside. Servers/bussers/food runners went to the other 2 tables multiple times, and still I was ignored. Do not misunderstand: I do not believe anyone was doing this intentionally; rather it was that \"someone else probably went there already\" type situation. Bottom line, it was all due to a break down in communication. Neither hostess had told any servers that I was a new table. But the boy who brought my chips could have been proactive & alerted someone, just as the food runner could have, and the server. I finally had to go to the bar inside and ask politely if someone could come outside & bring me water, etc. Right away a server nearby offered to help & followed me outside. He was very kind and apologetic, wrote down my order, & brought my water right after that. **Melvin** is his name, and he turned my experience around! Thank you, Melvin. 
Now, for margaritas: *worst* mix I have ever tasted. It made me think of the smell of a diaper pail or sewage, no joke. So I ordered the same marg, with Corralejo Blanco, & asked for just agave/simple syrup and straight line juice (basically coin style). DRASTICALLY better. Only way to drink them here!!"}
{"text":"If I knew how to give 3 1/2 stars thats what I would give. Great staff. The food is good but not great. The drinks are good not great."}
