{"text":"My friends and I were walking down Yorkville on a Saturday night looking for something that would cater to all our needs, and this place was just what this neighborhood seemed to be missing! Great ambience, friendly staff and delicious food, along with a live show by a Brazilian musician followed by a dj filling the place with great beats and good vibes. Definitely a place I would recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were nearby on a weekday for dinner - starving and didn't want to go any further, so thought we'd take a chance. The patio is nice, our server (owner/manager?) was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the steak poutine, boyfriend ordered the veggie burger (which was okay, but kind of dry - maybe ask for mayo on the side next time). Mine was REALLY great! None of that thin crappy steak, this was a solid cut of meat, medium rare, on top of good gravy and cheese curds. Satisfying - good service, neat booths inside. I'd be curious to try other things on the menu. This place was surprisingly empty. I'd be willing to come back and try other things on the menu."}
