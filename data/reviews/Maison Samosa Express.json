{"text":"Best Indian food in St.Laurent !! 
I've been twice so far and everything has been great,The butter chicken and naan paneer are delicious & the onion bhaji is amazing.    
*Two thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything was delicious. The samosa was amazing...crunchy and light with generous stuffing and mildly sweet sauce that I can eat with just anything. The chicken korma was great and loved their palak paneer and mango lassi. This is a real hidden gem, my new place to go to whenever I'm craving authentic Indian food. I'm giving 4 not 5 stars because the place lacks character and they need to work harder on their service."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this little quiet place. Very basic decor but the food was delicious. They respected my lack of taste for food that is too spicy. Food came fast and waitress was very nice. Will definitely return and/or order! The paneer and naan bread was to die for!"}
{"text":"It is a good place to have great meal,the food  is terrfic the location is central,and service is excellent. So this is a perfect combo of nice atmosphere and quality food very quite and clean place try it on my recommendation and you wont be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Best Pakistani food in Montreal. Would love to come next time

Soup and Gulab jaman are best."}
{"text":"Mon endroit préféré de faire livrer de l'indien. Le poulet tandori et poulet au beurre sont tout simplement délicieux. 

Prendre note que c'est très épicé, un \"médium\" correspond facilement à un \"intense\" dans plusieurs autres endroits, donc le \"intense\" correspond plutôt à \"volcanique\" selon moi! Vous êtes avertis!

La bouffe est excellente, mais je mets 4 étoiles sur 5 parce que c'est franchement mieux de faire livrer que de manger sur place."}
{"text":"Great indian/pakistanese food for take out! A good selection of all your favorites including Thali, Curry and Byriani. Prices are also unbeatable for the CEGEP students or local businesses in need for a quick fix lunch. What stands out at Maison Samosa Express is... well you've guessed it their Samosa. Definitely try the Lamb or Chicken Samosa. Congratulations to the young chef/owner for opening this joint in ol' Ville St-Laurent."}
{"text":"By far the best briyani I've ever had it actually has a lot of flavor and kick to it, definitely authentic. It doesn't have that pale color and all you can taste is the fried onion like it has loads of spice I definitely recommend coming"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving Indian food a couple of weeks ago but didn't want to venture out too far because it was sooooo cold. We have had this little gem near by forever but never thought of trying it, perhaps it was the somewhat uninviting decor. 

We took it to go, wowsa it was delicious and was it ever hot !!! We both like our food hot and spicy and this did not disappoint. We had the butter chicken and the lamb vindaloo...would totally recommend the 

Was craving Indian again but since the last review meat was cut out of my diet so i went the vegetarian route. I had the Okra Masala, Aloo gobi and Chana Masala...we were given the choice of hotness and we took HOT again ....this comes with a warning  HOT is  in your mouth but you can still taste it... It was delicious and will def pick up food there again (10%) off on pick up orders, we live next door so we would never eat there anyways. The only dish i would not take again was Chana Masala, i will try something else next time..."}
{"text":"Though this place isn't very popular, it's a pretty good restaurant. It's like one of those awesome hidden gems. The food was amazing and the pricing was excellent! Very affordable delicious Indian food. Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has Tasty yummy so good food. I actually won a tablet from this place back in my cegep days. 
Samosas- if you buy in bulk, they will give you a deal. Great for club meetings, or generally any time you want to share good food with friends. 
Lunch deal- the naan sandwich is like, so friggin tasty. Worth the price and delicious. 
Great place. Such a lovely family as well."}
{"text":"I was literally forced to come here by a friend. It's near his place and he eats here alot so decided to give in and try Indian food for the first time. 

Ambiance : It's a little flat. Two Tvs on each wall and the place looks like a cheap dining hall. So don't come here expecting anything fancy. Note to owner. Put on a little ambiance music. 

Service : The lady was very friendly and the service is really good. No worries there. 

Food : AMAZING! If you're not sure about Indian food and want to try it for the first time, come here! It was really tasty and not too spicy (per our request). 

Overall great experience here!! 
Highly recommend. 

P.s. except for the lady behind us chewing with her mouth open making more noise than a horse and letting out an epic burp at the end of her meal. (For those thinking it was a cultural thing, she was Québécoise)"}
{"text":"Le tali royale était bon, le naan excellent. je recommande cette place puisqu'il n'y pas de grand choix en cuisine indienne dans le secteur"}
{"text":"I have tried at least 3 times to come to this place and always closed. But not this time. I ordered lamb with 2 types of nan, while the wife ordered a set lunch dish. Everything was excellent esp. the nan. Garlic and sesame were mouth watering and I could have had just that. We will definitely e back for more."}
