{"text":"We tried this place about a month at my suggestion... wrong choice, should have driven into TO to have brunch at The Senator as usual. Everything that could be wrong with the eggs Benedict, was: Hollandaise was thin, watery and flavourless, instead of buttery rich and sumptuous. They must use either old or discount eggs, because they were pretty flavourless too. Potatoes were mushy and tasted reheated, which is an insult to potatoes. My son's order of French toast and bacon arrived quickly, but the bacon was half burnt and half uncooked - how can you so mess up one order of bacon that not a single slice is properly cooked? They use plain white bread for the French toast, not challah.  I was close to asking for the manager and refusing to pay. $40 for three breakfasts and we left hungry, not one of us could eat more than a few bites. if you are looking for a good breakfast spot in Oakville, this is not it. The one star is for the fast service. That's all the positive I can come up with."}
{"text":"Yippee!  Another breakfast place in Oakville, who can resist?!  Nice variety on the menu and prices are reasonable too!  Ordered pancakes and eggs and the sunrise sensation.  Coffee is decent.  Initial service is friendly and quick and the food is what one expects at a breakfast/brunch spot.  They seem to be working out the kinks in both the kitchen and the wait staff.  We got half our pancakes up front and half after about 15 minutes.  Another table ordered smoothies and were asked if they really wanted them because they would take awhile to make.  The food took longer to arrive than one expects for a breakfast spot.    Went to pay up at the cash and there was a pot of coffee just sitting abandoned on the counter top.... Staff appear frazzled which seems unjustified given there were at least 3 servers and it's a small place.    Worth another attempt as I like to support local businesses...."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast place that isn't going to wow you.  It's not trendy, it's cheap and it's been dependable the couple of times I have been in there.  It's thrifty, but honestly... what are expecting for breakfast?  If you're expecting to go in there and get a decent breakfast with good portions, for a fantastic price, mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price. I got the breakfast special two eggs, home fries, and two slices of ham for $5.95. For that price the food was actually pretty darn good. I mean it could've used a little salt, maybe some pepper. I had to butter my own toast and my girlfriend had to put mayo on her own BLT which we both thought was odd. But we got what we paid for and the environment was great. Nice decor, friendly staff, regulars who would stop and chat with the servers. I'd come back it's a nice little quick cheap breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This is one of the better breakfast places IMO. I had the typical: bacon, eggs, sausages, homes fries, and french toast. Food was cooked perfectly, staff was very fast and friendly, and no long wait for my bill."}
