{"text":"This is the first cat cafe I've been to; I was visiting Montreal from Vancouver.  Although this place was packed on a weekday night, it had good reason to be, as there are few cat cafes around.  I did not mind waiting for a while for a table, because I understand that everyone wants to see the cats.  The prices are fair I say, even though others may think it is a bit pricey; a portion of the money goes to supporting cats in animal shelters, which was also where the cats in the cafe came from. It isn't that there are few cats around, it's just that there are lots of people who want to play with cats, so the cats may be busy - so kick back and relax in the friendly atmosphere in the mean time.  Tip: Seize a cat toy if possible - the cats love it. And you can't blame the cats for not coming to you -  be friendly and not too laid-back if you want a cat to be interested in you of course."}
{"text":"As long as you're ok with the fact (and here, it IS fact) that the cats are definitely in charge, you'll be great. They do walk on the tables, some folks let them eat from their plates, and you need to be careful when moving around so you don't inadvertently step on one. Clearly I'm not a cat lover- BUT, I still like the place. Food  was really good, no cat hair, reasonably priced, and the vibe was great. Strangers interacted a bit, as favorite cats wandered amongst their tables. The cat lovers in my group were over the moon! Would go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"La bouffe n'est pas très bonne. Le décor est horrible. Les chats sont cachés. C'est relativement cher. Heureusement le service est excellent. Je m'attendais à plus.."}
{"text":"Nice cafe for cat lovers! The menu has only few choices and is a bit pricey for what you get. I'd recommend the kitty paw-shaped marshmallow, the lemon-rasberry flavor makes it more delicious! Cho-pain perdu is also a good choice if you like caramel/chocolate sweets! :)"}
{"text":"I just couldn't wait for this place to open, as I found the idea to be fascinating (being myself a cat lover). 

The ambiance is nice (I like what they did to the place), pretty quiet despite the amount of people there, and with lots of natural light.

The menu was a little more pricey than what you'd expect a cafe to be! Smoothies $7.50 to $7.90 each! I decided to go for the banana pudding instead (it came to $6-7 with taxes) and...oh my! It's so delicious! Very sweet (it would have been nice if they had brought us a glass of water with it), but brilliant the accompaniment of salty caramel. 

The cats are lovely (of course!!), and they even have some kitties at the moment - so adorable!! They aren't however as into humans, as humans are into them. They sleep most of the time (like all cats), and one of the rules of the cafe is not to touch/wake up sleeping cats (kind of weird if you ask me, but also kind of understandable, I guess). That makes it so that the moment a cat wakes up EVERYONE runs to the waking cat to touch them/see them, and make all of those \"oooooh\", \"cuuuuuute\", high-pitched-noises. If you are a cat owner or someone who has had a fair share of interaction with cats you'll find it pretty annoying, especially if you happen to be sitting close to where the poor waking cat is sleeping, as within seconds you'll find yourself surrounded by a group of hormonal people.

I guess I was expecting more of a living room type of feeling, homey, where a cat jumps on your laps while reading a book and sipping a cup of tea. No, not really. 

On the bright side, the space is amazingly clean (it feels almost a bit too sterile at times), and there is NO smell whatsoever of cat litter, which is great of course. 

I find one thing very weird. Their rules, which are advertised both beside the door before entering, and on each table. Aside from the rule about not touching/waking up sleeping cats, the weirdest one is \"clean your hands before touching the cats\", and they even have sanitizer around for you. Perhaps I am missing something there, which is why I don't understand this rule, but in all my cat-loving ears this thought never even crossed my mind. First of all, they lick their own bits and then wash themselves with that same tongue. Do we really want to talk about who's cleaner now? Second, I don't think my hands could ever be as nasty as to make a cat dirty, are you kidding me? Again, perhaps I am not understanding why this rule is in place (it's not like there was a lot of explanation on it either), but I find it a bit insulting. I doubt that people working at the SPCA or at any cat shelter will wash their hands before touching each cat...

Oh! And keep in mind that they take cash only at the moment! ;)

Nice place overall."}
{"text":"Great place to observe cats while enjoying a coffee. I went around 12 on a Tuesday and the place was very busy - full of kids, toddlers, and families. The kids can be quite annoying- running at cats, scaring them back into their resting places on high beams and shelves. 

Several cats performed tricks with an attractive barista. The tiger cat wore a cute tie while riding a skateboard. 

The cappuccino was good and came in a nice glass. 

The couches and sofa-chairs smelled like cat, but the tables did not. 

Four stars because the place serves its purpose but  is hard to enjoy with kids running around."}
{"text":"This place was top on my list during my recent visit to Montreal. The food was fantastic and the cats were lively and adorable. You can tell that they are well cared for by the staff. I had some sort of vegetable concoction with extra goat cheese (yum!) on a deliciously crispy flaky dough that came with a huge side salad. I always say that a good vegetarian meal is one that does not make you miss meat...this was one such meal. The iced coffees are really good as well. I also liked that the tourists were not harassing the cats filming everything with their huge oversized cameras (you know who you are...do you not have cats where you come from?)."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance and concept, we were there at lunch (rush hour) and it's sad that the place is so small because everybody was sitting very close to eachother.. Also it took 1h before having our meal, I think they forgot ours because all the other tables that arrived after us were being served before. And sadly all the cats were sleeping so it wasn't that fun. The food was very good tho , really liked the soup of the day, it was spinach brocoli I think. The tea is very expensive (almost 4$ for a tea bag..)"}
{"text":"Super endroit.
Nous y avions passé un agréable moment
Les chats sont très mignons et la cuisine est bonne.
Un petit peu éloigné du centre de Montréal mais le détour en vaut la peine
Je recommande ce petit café pour les amoureux des chats."}
{"text":"Kitty cafe!  I took allergy meds just to come here - but who needs sinuses when you're surrounded by fluffy kitty cats? 

Came here after a heavy breakfast, so I can only comment on the drink I bought here as no food was ordered.  Got the chocolate banana smoothie, which wasn't bad.  I think it was chocolate syrup blended together with a banana and possibly some ice.  Not much to say on that beverage. 

But oh, the kitties!  In the cafe are several bistro tables typically seating tables of 2, but can be pushed together for larger groups.  There are a couple of homey sofas and armchairs with cushions and nearby living room tables close by to rest your food or drinks. 

Worried about the cat hairs or cats getting into your edibles?  This place was pleasantly free of cat smells, and the shop keep (cat keep) train cats to stay off of tables and away from the food & drinks.  The one and only time that I saw a cat on a table was when a couple of guests were leaving and the empty smoothie glasses were not yet picked up.  Even then, it was only a brand-new black & white kitten, 6-8 weeks old and had only been at the cafe for 7 days that dared to (cutely) drink from the straw before being promptly being gently shooed away by staff.  

Though there's a list of house rules on the entrance door which includes relinquishing liabilities should you be bitten or scratched by a cat, all the cats seemed very docile, so I doubt this is of any real concern.  There was a small family on the day I went which included a delighted 2-ish year old, who squealed \"Les chats!\" every time a new cat passed by and promptly took chase - and even then, some of the cats would stop to allow themselves to be petted or at worst, would keep on walking.  

Wonder if this is cruel to the cats?  As part of the house rules, guests are asked not to touch the cats while they are eating or sleeping.  There's also a partitioned area in the back of the room with empty boxes and kitty homes so if the cats feel the need for a bit of alone time, they are free to run to the back.  The partition wall has clear Plexiglas at the bottom halves, so you can still watch the cats if you'd like to do so.  

The walls are lined with empty shelves so they are free to jump, wander, and display their general cat-like behaviour. 

A glass display case of cat-shaped porcelain goods like teapots can be seen, and a small handful of cat toys and accessories can be purchased at the cash register as a memento of your visit.  I picked up a coin purse shaped and printed like a cat as a souvenir. 

The 12 or so cats available are adopted from an animal shelter, encouraging guests to do the same.  Are there any sayings about putting cats in your bag?  Hmm, maybe there should be one..."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to this cafe's opening for a while and wasn't disappointed! Even though it was busy when we arrived our wait time wasn't long. Seating is a bit close together, but not so bad that you're on your neighbour's lap. 

The food has a good variety, including vegetarian options and desserts. I got a panini sandwich and an amazing iced tea, both a bit on the expensive side but with the quality and taste I didn't resent it. 

Mostly I was impressed by the atmosphere they've set up for the cats. There are several food stations and an easily accessible water fountain, and there are toys for people to use so that they can play with the cats. A sign at the front door and on tables outlines guidelines - not feeding the cats from the cafe food, and leaving them alone when they're asleep among others - and except for an overenthusiastic child people were very respectful. There are also high walkways and platforms so that the cats can stay out of reach when they don't feel like getting attention

I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone who wants a bite to eat with the occasional cat within reach."}
{"text":"I'm a passionate advocate for cats in the dog vs. cat debate and somehow had never been to a Cat Cafe so I was super excited when we happened across this one. It was a lovely experience overall. My boyfriend got a basic coffee and I had a chai latte (which came with the most adorable little cinnamon paw prints!) but it was quite pricey. 

There were probably 5-7 cats roaming around and they were very friendly. Honestly, I couldn't stop laughing and smiling because the decor was so ridiculous. There were HUGE portraits of the cats on the walls and they had such adorable names (i.e. Mousse or Sheldon). Definitely a worthwhile experience but unless I was seriously deprived of cat company or was showing a friend around the city, I wouldn't go back for the food and drink."}
{"text":"This place is so great, I could hang out here all day. There about 10 cats that live here and they are all super friendly and affectionate. The entire cafe is totally made for them, with high walkways, cubbies and lots of cat friendly spaces. The cafe was clearly built with their needs in mind, and we as humans are allowed to be there, it was great. We just had coffee, but it was great and a very calm place to be."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Came on a Saturday afternoon so the place was almost packed but everyone was very respectful of the kitties (kitties everywhere!). Had a tasty mocha. Nice service. Recommended."}
{"text":"The place is kind of overpriced, but the cats were so cute, they definitely get mobbed with attention, which is probably why they tend to be aloof, but we had a few kittens cuddling with us. The cats are well taken care of though, they seem to have a good bond with the owners. Food wise everything was fresh."}
{"text":"Came for the cats, stayed for the food. It is really amusing to see them walking all over the place. A little bit on the pricey side but I think it's worth it for the whole experience.Ordered a sandwich and it came with a nice salad on the side, so its a nice way to try the both of them. I definitely recomend it and would come back again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed having a coffee and being surrounded by these peaceful animals.  All of them are very friendly.   The place is very clean and does not smell like cats.  Cats may jump on the table but we were fine with that!   The coffee and teas we had were not the best (the tea was way too sweet!) but that's not the point of going there..."}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine anything better for my first cat cafe experience.  Here is a list of all of the positives that changed my mind about cat cafes.
1) Super clean.  Even as a cat owner I was expecting it to smell like cats or have cat hair stuck to the chairs.
2) Very respectful of cats.  There are some important rules before you enter the cafe that ensure the cats are well cared for and respected.  I am relieved that they cultivate such a positive environment.
3) SO MANY CATS.  When we visited, there were 11 cats in total.  A few \"residents\" who definitely chilled out a lot and then a few kittens who were available for adoption.  The kittens provided endless entertainment while the grown cats were perfectly chill.
4) Tasty food and drinks.  I very much enjoyed my latte and grilled cheese.  The prices were higher than other cafes in the immediate area, but considering the well-being of so many cats, a price I'm happy to pay.

I would definitely go back and am already recommending to friends."}
{"text":"i like the prompt service in the wait staff in montreal. most of the kitty cats were asleep when we walked in the cafe. i ordered the veggie sandwich which i extremely enjoyed. the crusty bread was crispy as it was pan-fried. it was crunchy but not too tough to eat. Prior entering the dining room/eating area we need to remove our shoes in the foyer."}
{"text":"Um, two words: cat cafe. I am a cat lover and the second I walked into this cafe I was overwhelmed with joy. The cats are so soft and wonderful. I went to see the cats mostly however I did have a chai latte which was good. My girlfriend had the mousse smoothie which was pretty good. My main draw to go back would be to visit the cats"}
{"text":"I loved spending an evening here because I love cats! All the cats are super friendly. However they need to hire more staff since you will be waiting a long time to order and receive your food. I ordered the soup of the day and it was cold when I got it. Also since the cats roam completely free as in on the tables and counters I'm not sure how hygienic this is. Surprisingly there was no hair in my soup. Also they should cap the amount of time people can spend there during rush hour or something. Since there was a line outside to even go in. People order something small and then occupy a lot of seats for a long time. This prevents others from enjoying the experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in to see what it was all about. All the cats there were adopted, which for someone that used to work at an animal shelter, is really cool. Food was pricy, drinks were okay. You don't go there for the food.

Here's the thing. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed with kids and parents who were trying to find a way to keep their kids busy for an hour. Many of these kids were very young, around five or six years old, and the parents would sit back and act like they didn't see their kids disturbing sleeping cats or chasing them around the place. The staff did make a few comments to multiple guests about watching their children, but the parents didn't do a damn thing. 

They have to do something about implementing an age limit or somehow making sure the kids behave. Not for the other customers, but for the sake of the cats."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Gustav is my favorite cat there! Friendly social fat cat!!! It's a cat lovers paradise! It's clean and lively! Their bread budding is out of this world delicious!!! Their lemonade, latte are also great! I have no complains only i wish I live here I'd go there everyday!!! : )"}
{"text":"A merging of some of my favourite things: vegetarian food, warm beverages and cat friends!

I totally fell in love with some of the cats here, but especially enjoyed hanging out with an affectionate grey tabby named Milady. The prices of food/beverages, I suspect, are a little higher than is customary to account for the fact that they have employees to pay and resident kitties to care for. That's more than OK by me because I only see the cats enjoying the space and people enjoying the cats' company.

Why not write your visit off as therapy? It is so soothing to sit next to these cats and enjoy some conversation (with humans too, if that's your thing) as well. :3"}
{"text":"J'adore ce café, j'y vais souvent!
L'ambiance est très cozy, il y a des divans et fauteuils un peu partout, et assez de place pour accueillir beaucoup de monde, même si c'est souvent plein ou presque
Il y a beaucoup de chats et on sent qu'ils sont bien traités
Le propriétaire est très sympa, j'ai eu l'occasion de jaser avec lui plusieurs fois et on peut vraiment se rendre compte qu'il adore les animaux et ferait tout pour ses chats
Un bel exemple d'amour homme-animal!
Contrairement à d'autres cafés du genre, on ne peut pas y adopter les chats car le but est d'éduquer les gens avec les chats présents, qui deviennent familiers aux gens et à l'endroit, et entre eux
Les cafés, boissons et plats sont très bons; les desserts aussi
C'est un excellent choix de café si vous ne savez pas où aller, vous y passerez des heures sans vous rendre compte, tellement on s'y sent bien! :)"}
{"text":"We vacationed in Montreal in September and had heard that there were several cat cafes.  I LOVE cats but we had so much planned I didn't know when we would have time to fit a cat cafe into our schedule.  We happened upon this one when walking from dinner back to our Airbnb in the plateau neighborhood and I'm so glad we did!

The cafe was very clean and did not smell \"catty\" at all.  We ordered some coffee drinks since we had already eaten - my chai was delicious and adorable, with little cinnamon dust cat paws in the foam!

The cats were so friendly and sweet - one of the workers had taught a few of them tricks and was putting on a show of sorts.  We had so much fun and it was a great way to end our night!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here. This one is way better than the one in Toronto. The cats were very friendly and sweet and you can tell they are well cared for. Food was pretty good and the banana pudding was amazing! Love how the cats had free reign and some were even in the bathroom! I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not bad! Not bad at all. Pretty expensive coffees/smoothies and other drinks but overall a pleasant experience for me. My bf and I waited 10-15 min before we got a table, and that was good for an extremely busy Saturday morning. I really enjoyed my hot chocolate, it was rich and tasty. My bf's smoothie tasted non diluted, not overly sweet and fresh. And of course, there were the cats! We sat near Gustave, a cat that was lounging around near our table at the corner. I really liked the fact that this cat cafe had nooks and crannies/crevices for for the cats to hide and sleep in. 

My only complaint is that our food took FOREVER to get to your table. I think more than 45 min. It was crazy. I thought they forgot about us. However! My cat lady sandwich was excellent and the salad was tasty. It was a healthy menu and I appreciated that and the portion size not being too much. Nothing I hate more than huge huge portions.

I would visit again for sure! And I recommend visiting here just to try something new if you're in the plateau area. Service was of course pretty decent as well,"}
{"text":"As a cat owner and someone who just loves cats, this place was a blast.  Getting to enjoy a nice vanilla latte while playing with adorable cats and kittens was a great start to our evening.  The owner must have trained the cats because he showed us how can can make them spin around and give him high fives.  It was very cute.  Aside for getting to play with cats, they have coffees, teas even salads and sandwiches on the menu.  If you love cats, this cafe is perfect."}
{"text":"I've only visited this charming little café once, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. There were a number of cats, probably close to 10. Some were sleepy, some would look for attention, others would walk around the walls and ceiling beams to get away from people. I was sat next to a little trap door the cats can use to escape the touch of people, so I got to pet a number of them. It was quiet enough to talk to your companion, the London Fog I had was tasty, and my friend seemed to enjoy his food. I'm not the biggest fan of taking my boots off in winter to enter an establishment but I understand the need, especially with the cats. It was a touch cold in there, but improved as I sipped on my drink. The main attraction is the cats, a couple of them were able to ride an electric skateboard, and they were fun to pet, watch, and get a few kisses from.
I would definitely return when the weather is nicer, it's a bit of a walk from both Sherbrooke and Mount Royal metro stations."}
{"text":"C'est LE café qui ne rend PAS que les chats heureux, mais tous ceux qui y passent un petit moment... Pour ma part, je serais quasi restée à coucher si cela avait été possible, tant je mis sentais bien!
Tout tout tout est sympa à cet endroit et la nourriture maison, est absolument exquise! Une des meilleures places pour de succulents desserts."}
{"text":"La place est vraiment sympa : on se sent chez nous, dans un salon entouré de chats. Tout est fait pour eux ici, les divans, les jouets, les étagères. Les chats se promènent librement d'une table à une autre, accompagnés par les \"ooooh\" de toutes les filles réunies ici. On a craqué pour Luna, le bébé chat au poil tout ébouriffé, et pour Sheldon, qui a une ressemblance marquée avec mon chat.
A coté de ça, le menu est au top : la tartine Cat Lady et le brownie... un régal !! Du vrai pain bien grillé, du fromage fondant, des petits oignons mijotés... mmm !! Même la salade d'accompagnement est bonne et fraiche. J'en redemande !

Seul petit bémol : le thé. C'est du thé en sachet, alors que 2 rues plus loin il y a un magasin de thé en vrac... dommage"}
{"text":"Adorable café sur la rue Duluth. J'aime y aller pour bouquiner, tester un plat de leur carte et surtout câliner les chats qui s'y trouvent.
Gros +1 sur le fait que la carte soit végé avec pas mal d'options véganes."}
{"text":"I freakin' love cats and have always wanted to visit the cat cafe. I visited this one because I was waiting for a friend nearby and thought I'd go spend some time with the kitties.

The first thing I'll say is that there is no AC. But after 5-10mins, you get used to the temperature. Besides, the cats are a good distraction!

There were around 10 cats but I think it was nap time when I visited, as most of them were asleep. There was a sweet, fluffy black cat that likes to hang out in the women's bathroom lol and a cute kitten sleeping in a giant mug!

The lemonade I ordered to cool off was bland and overpriced. I only spent around 20 mins here so I'll have to go back and give these cats a proper visit :)"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Mont Royal, this kitty cafe is spacious and full of cuteness! I especially love the one cat on the skateboard - I believe her name was Milady(?) The staff were very friendly to the patrons and made the visit all the more enjoyable. I would suggest coming in to the cafe earlier during the day as they seemed really tired by the time we showed up (it was about 4 or so)."}
{"text":"SO BLOWN AWAY. FIVE STARS EASILY (and i DONT give five stars often)! I felt like I was in heaven for a couple of hours. Ottawa's new cat café was my first experience at a cat café, but this established café met and exceeded my expectations! I went after dinner, so probably around 7pm and stayed for a couple of hours.
 
Cats: there were almost 10 cats, and most of them were active! There was about half kitties (smaller cats) and half full-size cats. My favourite was Luna, she has a grey coat and green eyes, and her fur is SO SOFT!!! They all don't mind being touched; some will seem annoyed, but usually won't leave. There are little \"treat stations\" where the cats have to get treats out of cups, which is fun to watch. They fed the cats around 8pm which was so amusing to watch since they all became active, ran out, and settled down to a food bowl. One really cute part was when a male server put a cat on an electric skateboard, and the cat sat on it while he moved the skateboard with the remote back and forth! Then he would give the cat a high five and a treat. It was adorable, plus he put a mini tie collar on the cat. Everyone was taking pictures and aww-ing.
 
Food/drink: I had a black indian tea, and the teapot top had a cat's head which was cute! I had to ask for cream though. My friends got a cheesecake and pudding, and both were actually really well done, although I preferred the pudding. The chai latte has two cat paws shaped out of cocoa powder! I saw others getting savoury food too; the entire place was pretty packed the entire evening I was there, so I guess their food is well received!
 
Service: they are friendly, but somewhat slow as there are so many clients, so you may have to flag one down to order or to pay. However, you can tell they really care for the cats, and the cats' coats are all in great condition. The male server seemed to be the one to teach them tricks, and you could tell he loved cats.
 
Overall: exceeded my expectations, and will be back for sure! I will probably also try the other cat café in Montreal too, and hopefully the Toronto one next time as well!"}
{"text":"It's a cute idea, but poorly executed. Let me start off by saying, I'm a cat lover far and away. Opening the door, I was greeted with stale cat stench, a combination of wet fur and old food. That is not a place I want to be eating food. There were also very few cats around. You can't disturb sleeping cats, and the other ones were all either occupied or disinterested. I saw on the wall, heading back out after my very brief visit, they have seven cats and are looking for three more. I don't expect this place to last. It needs double the cats and more effective odor control. Or stop selling food and don't bother mitigating the cattery smell. I see none of these things happening."}
{"text":"Before I visited Montreal I was excited to check out a cat cafe because I love cats and thought it would be a cool concept. This cafe was high on my list of stuff to do in Montreal. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The concept is cute but the cats were very unfriendly. Everybody would try to get their attention by waving toys as they walked by but the cats were uninterested. Even when people would pet them they did not acknowledge anyone expect the employees who worked there. The service was nothing to write home about. We ordered a slice of vegan coconut lime dessert and it took forever for it to come. So we had to rush through eating it before our parking meter expired. It would've been a lot better of an experience had the cats been friendly. The cafe is cute looking and if you go get the coconut lime vegan pie."}
{"text":"The food is delicious (I recommend the Cat Lady) and SOMETIMES THE CATS RIDE SKATEBOARDS! My heart is so warm from my visit to this little cat cafe!"}
{"text":"We ordered drinks and a dessert but the dessert never came.  The waiters were very nice and polite but seemed very overwhelmed and unable to keep up with everything going on.  To be honest the entire atmostphere was crowded and chaotic.  The cafe was very small, yet there were probably close to 40 people all crammed in there.  I would highly suggest that they get rid of 1/3 of the tables in there to make things more comfortable and allow the staff to do their jobs. 

And of course the cats were adorable.  It is a great idea to have some permanent resident cats and some adoptable ones.  I think it would be better to have some adult cats that are adoptable since they are the ones that are difficult to adopt out."}
{"text":"Les plats sont EXCELLENTS (salades, smoothies, grilled-cheese... woah!), le service est agréable et il y a des CHATS. Plein de chats. C'est un peu le paradis. 

Par contre, ça manque un peu de discipline! Les règlements du Café sont clairs et certains clients ne les respectent pas... réveiller un chat qui dort pour faire un Vine et trouver ça drôle, c'est moyen. Je suggère l'installation d'un bûcher derrière le bâtiment pour les gens irrespectueux du cat-lifestyle (ou alors davantage d'interventions de la part des serveurs, même si c'est quelque chose de désagréable à faire). Parce que dormir, c'est bien, et les chats méritent le respect de leur sommeil!

Aussi, j'y suis allée 5-6 fois et chaque fois, il y avait l'album d'Ingrid St-Pierre qui jouait. Ingrid St-Pierre, c'est bien, mais \"La mousssse du café au laiiiit\" chaque fois, c'est moins bien. On veut du AC/DC (ou pas, en fait on veut surtout un peu de variété musicale) !

À bientôt, les chats!"}
{"text":"This is a great place and I have utmost respect for the idea and for the execution. The cats seem to be so happy. 

There is one downside, but I see this as only an issue in winter (which it is in Montreal for what, half the year or something?!): the foyer in which you need to remove your boots. We seemed to be there on the coldest day of the year and the foyer wasn't nearly heated enough. There was also snow outside. The rugs that you had to walk on in order to get in the cafe - after removing your boots - were wet. Since the foyer wasn't heated well, our socks were wet and our boots very cold. To make the problem worse, the cafe wasn't very warm and floors were not heated. Our feet never really warmed up. When we left and walked to our car about 4 blocks away our feet were in serious pain. It was -10 degrees F. I can't imagine the people who had to walk further than us. 

I understand the need to remove shoes entirely. I can't imagine how dirty the place would be for the cats if we didn't. However, the foyer should be in better shape with at least a space heater, and I think the cafe should be warmer.

Again - this is probably no issue in summer!"}
{"text":"This is the happiest place on earth. It has a lovely, warm, catified atmosphere with lots of visual interest in the form of video and art if the cats aren't very active. But, they usually are, with staff who can get them doing tricks sometimes. The food and drink are reasonably priced and the marshmallow paws are my fave. They have some great merch for sale and the staff are pleasant. But, mainly, sitting around with a cup of coffee watching kittens play is a huge serotonin releaser!"}
{"text":"Cats, Cats, Cats!!! ...and coffee. Did I mention cats?! Being a cat lover and cat owner, finding out there's a cafe full of cats was a must for Montreal. You enter the cafe to a spot to take off your shoes and read a set of rules. Basic rules such as don't pick up the cat when they're sleeping, don't hurt them, you get the point. You then walk into the actual cafe and as your eyes scan the room you see Cats! Everywhere! Walking around, sitting on tables, waking on their ledge near the ceilings. You have the option to sit at tables or couches. The cafe serves vegetarian food but being as I was only there for cats, my boyfriend and I ordered coffees. Yes, I ordered the chai latte solely for the paw prints on top of the whipped cream. After going around letting every cat I could, or that would allow me, I left with a happy heart. The cafe takes donations and the cats are all rescues so how much better can it get?"}
{"text":"I love this place, If I could, I would go everyday. Wonderful concept, greatly executed. There were about 10 resident cats living there when we visited, one sweeter than the other, and they all seem happy and healthy. The people who run the place seem to truly care about cat, there is a very nice vibe between staff and cats that we witnessed on both visits. The cats are not always in the mood to play with guests, and sometimes will be hiding in one of their many chill-out-spots, because that's what cats are like, they often like to chill and relax. But if you bring some patience you will get a lot out of your visit - the cats are extremely cute and friendly. Watch out for Mousse, a clumsy, grey kittie who loves to hang out in the giant cup on the counter...He's one of my favorites! And I almost forgot to mention: Service, food and drinks are good as well! Yummy salads, sandwiches and soups. Not too pricey given the experience it comes with."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Montreal. He loves cats but I am allergic so he was excited about getting his \"cat fix\" at this place. After ignoring me for a couple of minutes, I was finally asked if I was being helped. You obviously see me standing there. I gave a curt response that I was not. We finally sat down. The cats were cute but were reluctant to be pet. Maybe they are trained not to bother customers. I guess I get it. I thought that they would have been more responsive. My 3 star rating was more for the unwelcoming vibe upon entering and the expensive shake. It was ok but 7.50? Really? Not worth it. I don't get the hype honestly. Cool concept though."}
{"text":"Was obliged to visit stop here for coffee with a friend. To be honest i am kind of glad i did. I ended up ordering a cappuccino which was not bad at all. I cannot comment on the food as we did not eat, but i get the feeling it wouldn't have mattered as ppl come here for one reason. To eat/drink while watching cats lounge around and walk by you like they own the place. I thought it was a pretty funny concept. The owner seems to work with a lot of animal shelters in the city which is a plus.  I don't mind paying a dollar extra for a coffee to keep a few felines fed. This place seems to get busy quick, worth another visit to try the food."}
{"text":"This place got me really excited at first but it was very lacking in experience overrall.
- The food is very pricey for what it is.
- The cats were mostly nowhere to be seen. Either perched high up or hiding in the rooms can't access. Which I understand on their behalf. But the whole point is to see the cats.
- I went on a slower day and witnessed the cats climbing on the tables, which they're allowed to do (sort of unsanitary, don't you think?) and I also had cat hair in my drink..
- The decor is really lacking in style and the place looks awfully messy and dingy. Picture your old grandmother's house.

It's definitely overrated. I won't be returning, but I appreciate what they do for the cats."}
{"text":"I would only recommend getting drinks here as the food isn't so well, it's a nice place to go once in awhile but the cats really don't approach people, I spent more time watching the video of the cats playing than actually seeing them."}
{"text":"I will say that I was skeptical of the idea of a cat cafe, but Chat l'Heureux did a really nice job. The cafe is very clean and was relatively empty when we were there. There were probably 5 cats wandering around, they were all quite friendly. The cafe has a cool series of platforms and connecting walkways for the cats to traverse. The staff was very helpful, and the smoothies were very good. If you want to hang out with a bunch of cats and get a smoothie, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Wouldn't stop smiling throughout my time there! I brought my mom here since my own cat is too stubborn and keeps to herself! I was stunned at how friendly the cats were here.. The cats usually wake up around 5-6pm.. Get their food and then play! The people there are amazing and would show some tricks and also help you get friendlier with the cats! I managed to get few kittens on my shoulders and top of my head, too! Really a mood uplifting place :)

They have books and toys around the place for you to be busy!!! .. Interesting options on the menu.. Self service."}
{"text":"I did not pet the cats.

But I could see the ones who wanted attention were getting plenty.  

This is a lovely cafe that serves up a cool jar glass of lemonade on a hot hot day.  The double doors at the entrance facilitate the cats staying in and the staff are very friendly and welcoming to anyone coming in.  There were children and families at this cafe as well as couples and singles.  The couches and seating is comfortable and well worn.  The music is very relaxing.

This is a lovely place to hang out and have a cafe treat."}
{"text":"I would go for a coffee but not for the food as it was over priced and I left feeling unsatisfied but, it's a fun concept and I would go back. 
We did like the puréed veggie soup, not the grilled cheese of the day (guacamole, red onion and tomato) it was oozing cheese but felt like they used margarine to grill it. Just wasn't worth $45 for two vegetarian sandwiches and soup."}
{"text":"The purrrfect place to grab a delicious lunch and soak up some kitty love! Delicious food, fabulous cats! Just steps away from vibrant st-Laurent street."}
{"text":"This was the best cafe I've ever been to. Not only are you surrounded by absolutely adorable cats but the food was very, very good! I got the mexi-chat and my fiancé got the classic grilled cheese which both come with a side salad which was also amazing! I was very impressed with the food! The cafe was very nice and in a great location. It features many things for the cats to climb and play on and many places for them to sleep. And the employees clearly care very much about the cats whether it was consistently filling their water bowl, stopping to give them rubs, or making sure the customers aren't doing anything they shouldn't be with the cats. They also give you treats to give the cats. And the cats are clearly very attached to them as well. I saw one cat actually get onto one of the employees shoulders and perch himself there looking very comfy! I highly recommend this place and if you are visiting Montreal it is a must see!"}
{"text":"I'm cat crazy, friends had told me of cat cafe in other countries so I needed to check this place out. I have to say I was rather disappointed of how little cats they had. These cats were like what cats are known for, very unfriendly. They are missing few Ragdolls, they would have really perked up this place. This breed of cat are known to be very sociable. The food was nice, the service slow but we got a seating right away. Since I was vacationing and missing my cats very much, I would have love for one of these kitties to jump on my lap. I know mine would have on any strangers lap."}
{"text":"Lots of cute and friendly cats roaming around including some kittens (not super tiny, but older kittens maybe a few months old). We went early in the day not too long after they opened (maybe about 11:30) and it wasn't too busy yet. We had cappuccinos which were average. We did not eat anything. 

Note that you have to take off your shoes, so make sure you are wearing socks. They have some shared slippers or you can bring your own. If you have allergies or a sensitive nose you will notice mild cat smells. Take your allergy pills BEFORE you visit. I have mild allergies and got just a little stuffed up. Not bad at all though as they keep it very clean! The cats appear to be brushed regularly and I did not see any fur accumulation on the furniture. I was very impressed with the cleanliness. 

Some other reviewers have complained about the pricing, but I found it to be fair especially considering that there is no cover charge. Remember that they have to take care of the cats and that really adds up. They have all the costs of a traditional cafe then add in vet visits, vaccinations, food, litter, treats, toys, beds. 

This place is great! Definitely worth a visit to spend an hour and grab coffee and smoothies."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez les chats cet endroit est super. Les employés sont vraiment sympathiques, les boissons et collations proposés sont vraiment bon. Particulièrement le coco vegan. Je recommande !"}
{"text":"Friend who lived in Montreal took me here over the summer. It was a cute little place located near Mont Royal Park, but it was kinda overpriced. The cats were cute, and did their own thing. One was even chilling in the bathroom sink and refused to let me wash my hands, so I liked that aspect of the cafe. It can be a hit or a miss, and depends on the cats as well. Some days, they're playful and some days they just want to be lazy and be left alone. It kind of smells a bit inside, so be wary of that."}
{"text":"This is a must and a hidden gem if you're ever in Montreal! Cat cafes are far and few between in North America, especially ones you can walk into without a reservation. The cats are very well treated and there's a variety of couches, chairs, tables, furniture, cat toys available for cats and customers alike.
Yes, the food is a bit pricey but their homemade hot chocolate ($4.75) and banana pudding ($6) are not to be missed!!"}
{"text":"I had a purr-fect time. I give this place 5 Stars due to the experience. The cafe was inhabited by friendly felines that joined me for lunch. The menu is limited. It consisted mainly of grilled cheese sandwiches and salads. I had the Mexi-Chat and a Chai Latte. Everything was tasty."}
{"text":"J'ai vu grandir le café de sa campagne de financement jusqu'à maintenant. Quel joie de voir que tout semble aller pour le mieux! Si vous en avez l'occasion, allez discuter avec le propriétaire. Il suffit de quelques secondes pour se rendre compte d'à quel point il aime les chats. Le café organise aussi parfois des conférences. La nourriture est très bonne, autant les salades que les desserts. Par contre, l'endroit n'est pas très grand et, en fin de semaine, il n'y a souvent pas de place. Beaucoup de touristes et d'enfants, ce qui est un peu dommage (y compris pour les chats)."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour le lunch.
Très agréable et les chats sont très affectueux.
Café filtre  et plat à partager"}
{"text":"This neat cat café is a good place to meet with friends or do a little bit of work.
The menu is vegetarian but there are some good finds there too. The onion soup is awesome and I love the lemonade.
The most important reason, if you're a cat lover you will love it!"}
{"text":"This place is purrfect!  They have lots of cats running around!  It is so fun to watch them all play, especially since they have climbing steps all over so the cats really get to be little acrobats (or acrocats, if you will haha).  I had the chai latte which was topped with little pawprints!  Also, if you're there at the right time, you could see a couple of the cats riding a little skateboard around!"}
{"text":"Cool experience that I really wish we had in Toronto! I came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my family. The place was packed full and there were two other groups ahead of us waiting to be seated, so we had to wait about 15 or so minutes. My first impression of the place is that it is quite small and also pretty cramped. Tables are placed pretty close together and there is not that much room to walk around, unfortunately. I wish there was more space for us to actually play with the cats. 

All of the food we ordered was delicious. I had the Cat Lady, which is a gourmet sandwich with fig jam, honey, goat cheese, cheddar, and caramelized onions. It sounds so simple, but it was so tasty, and the perfect blend of sweet and salty flavours. It also came with a very refreshing and fresh tasting salad on the side. We also ordered La Jardiniere, which was basically fresh seasonal vegetables on a piece of crispy fried dough, and Tartine du Jardin, which was another sandwich loaded with lots of ricotta, vegetables, grilled nuts, and peaches. Although I didn't try either of the other items we ordered, the general consensus among my family was that the food was very fresh, very delicious, and very filling. Everything on their menu is vegetarian, and they also have some vegan and gluten free options too!

They own 7 cats, and on the day I went I managed to see 6 of them. The cat part is kind of hit or miss, because it's kind of luck of the draw depending on when you go. There were three cats awake when we first arrived, so we got a chance to play with them a little while we were waiting for our seats. However, later on they all fell asleep, so they weren't as lively and didn't walk around as much as I expected. It was a little disappointing for me, but what can you do. It is still a cool concept though and I enjoyed my experience.

The cafe is very bright and clean on the inside, so it's really nice to be in there. I read some reviews about odours, but I didn't smell anything unpleasant at all. Everything on their menu is pretty pricey - lunch for three ended up being about $60! Two of us ordered hot drinks (hot chocolate and chai latte), and while they were both good, they were $4+ dollars each. That being said, if you are a cat lover like I am, this is definitely something neat to check out! If you are lucky you might encounter the cats when they are actually awake."}
{"text":"I expected a feline frenzy in here, but a lot of the cats were comatose. You're not allowed to prod them awake and rightly so - how would you appreciate being roused that way? But without any of the kitty cat interaction this place loses its novelty pretty quickly.

The place is furnished quaintly with an assortment of seating including a long couch or dining chairs situated near a bright window and makeshift fireplace. 
The menu seems slightly overpriced but you're obviously paying for the experience. I got tea which came in a cat-themed teapot. While waiting for the tea to cool, we got a chance to play with one of the cats who decided to awake from his slumber. They had some toys to engage the cats. The fishing rod with catnip was a general crowd pleaser because it shows you how stealth cats can be. 

Overall, it was a wonderful place to spend an hour as long as you have a few cool cats to party with."}
{"text":"Cat lovers of the world unite. This is an incredible place, cats walking around, kids looking at the cats with big eyes, young people on dates trying to show their nicer sides, older people relaxing with a cat on their lap...Incredible.

This is also a Veterinarian-Vegan place and as such I love it even more. The coffee is good and the banana-chocolate pudding is out of this world. It is a little expensive but if you consider the fact you are paying also for the experience (\"Cat-therapy\")  it makes you feel a little better."}
{"text":"Cozy spot with cute cats along with a yummy vegetarian menu! The deserts were good the service was efficient and friendly.. Would recommend to all feline lovers"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Although a little bit rundown, the interior is really cute. It has a vintage feel to it all while being surrounded by cat furniture and accessories.

FOOD: Honestly, the food was pretty good! I came here for lunch and got a goat cheese sandwich with fig sauce (I forgot what the plate was called) but it was quite tasty. It also came with a light salad. It's a nice little relaxing place to come by if you wanna hang with some cats and have a light meal.

PRICE: Although it's a tad bit overpriced, it's still affordable. And besides, you're coming here for cats and they have to be financed somehow so the prices don't really come as a shock to me. 

SERVICE: The service here was pretty good. They explained to us about the different cats here and their personalities, feels like they were really connected to every feline which was nice."}
{"text":"Le café Chat l'heureux est l'endroit idéal pour les amateurs de chats. En plus de profiter de la compagnie de chats joueurs et affectueux, les plats proposés sont intéressants et diversifiés. J'ai essayé le Cat Lady, grilled-cheese au fromage de chèvre et à la figue et c'était délicieux !!! J'ai aussi essayé la Jardinière qui était très bonne. L'ambiance est agréable et la décoration est très bien choisi (sofas vintage, vieille théière etc.). Un must à Montréal pour tout ceux qui adorent les chats."}
{"text":"GO HERE. The cats are SO friendly (because they have such a great and relaxing life, which I'll explain later), the food is absolutely delicious (my girlfriend and I had the cat lady, which was best grilled cheese-style sandwich either of us had ever had), the cafe is delightful and super clean, and you can tell that the cats are so happy because of how well the cafe is set up (vertical space for them to get away from humans, signs put up to not disturb sleeping cats, etc.). But the manager really made it. He showed off how he'd trained one of the cats, and when I went up and asked him about it he went into a fantastic description of why he'd started the cafe, how important it can be to train cats for their wellbeing and how he'd designed it with the cats' and customers' happiness in mind."}
{"text":"Assiettes grilled cheese savoureux accompagnés de salade fraiche. Les chats sont un peu partout mais ne viennent pas necessairement se faire caresser et il y a de regles legitimes pour respecter les chats et on ne peut pas les prendre etc .... donc il faut pas trop rever de calins de chats ... Soyez satisfait avec l'odeur de litiere en rentrant ;)"}
