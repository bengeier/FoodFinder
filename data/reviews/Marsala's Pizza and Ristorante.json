{"text":"R. I. P Marsala's has been closed for over 3 months. If they were any good,Kolten, they would have been able to compete. They sucked. Really, Really Sucked! Chef Boyardee was more exciting."}
{"text":"I have only ever gotten pizza from Marsala's, by delivery, so my review is based on that.  Their pizza is absolutely amazing.  Perfect thin crust, tons of cheese, fresh toppings.  One of my husband's pet peeves is canned mushrooms on pizza.  That is NOT what you will get from Marsala's.  The only thing that might be bad about their pizza is it's a little too greesy with maybe a bit too much cheese, but it tastes GOOD.  They are open on Main Street in Stoughton, despite what other posts say.  They closed their other location, but have been on Main Street for at least a year..."}
{"text":"Don't listen to Dave. It is now Marsalas On Main and it is the best pizza you can find around. They also have great italian dishes. You won't be disappointed. It's now located downtown main St."}
