{"text":"Great place for the anime/manga fan! Two ways full of manga, all in English. In the back there's a games room with PS4s housed in arcade cabinets playing Street Fighter V and Overwatch, so you can actually use the arcade cabinets and arcade sticks for SF V. Also separate TVs hooked up to Wii U for Mario Kart and Smash, etc. Everything is available at a very reasonable $15 for the whole day or $20 with in and out access, both options include a drink. Or you can just go in as a cade and have the drinks and dessert and read manga."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Very relaxed environment where for $15 you can order a drink, read all the manga you want, play video games and even come back at a later time without extra charge! They also show anime on the big wall, have a variety of board games to play with and very tasty (and cute!) treat at extra charge. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to go and hangout with friends on a rainy or cold day, even better if you're an anime fan! Fun video games and endless manga with anime constantly playing in the wall. The owners did a great job!"}
{"text":"It was alright. I would say that the drinks are a bit overpriced. I came here to eat the Totoro sesame tartlette in particular (because it's adorable) but since i'm not a manga fan, I didn't really see the appeal of this place. I'm sure someone who actually came here to read the Manga would've enjoyed it more.   Tartlette was good but not life-changing."}
{"text":"If you're an anime/manga fan, it wouldn't hurt to visit this manga cafe.  Outside it looks kind of... sketchy? But when you get inside it's like \"oooo, ahhhh\"~ Anime on the wall, manga everywhere and a gaming theatre room. If it's your first time don't be scared to ask questions. I was suuuuper lost when I went but the person who helped me was friendly and helpful.  The desserts are super cute!!"}
{"text":"Akiba Kissa truly is one of a kind!   I think (keyword 'think') Akiba Kissa is the first manga/anime cafe here in Ontario!   I've been here 3 times, and I've enjoyed every single visit. Rows and rows of various mangas for you to choose from, tons of comfy seating for you and your friends to lounge in, a change room for you to change into cosplay, and an arcade style room.  From first entrance, you are welcomed by many tasteful anime posters (the shonen girls one is my fav) and then you are entered into the main room. The staff is always friendly with a welcoming smile on their face. There are different payment options to choose from. There's the $12 for an hour (i believe its $12), $15 for the whole day (no in and out privileges) and $20 for the whole day with in and out privileges. All price packages include a drink from their menu! I learned on my first visit here, that an hour is never enough for me, with or without company.   On my last visit I had purchased the $15 option, and ended up staying nearly 5 hours. Time just goes by so fast when you're at Akiba Kissa! My review will mainly be upon this most recent visit.  I came by, picked my drink and also a dessert. The last time around, I had gotten their hot chocolate with this super tasty marshmallow whipped cream and their coffee panna cotta. I'll admit, the hot chocolate isn't anything out of this world, but I don't really think food and drinks is the main focus of this place anyways, so I'll let it slide. Lounged around reading some mangas, whilst enjoying the anime they play on a huge projector in the main room too. After finishing up my drink and dessert, I wandered off into the game room where you have the choice to play Overwatch, Street Fighter V, various Wii U games and soooooo much more!  The owner (i believe he was the owner) also let my sister and I play in the next room on this huge projector. There's no better feeling than playing Super Smash Bros with friends while being surrounded by a great sound system, it was very generous of him to let us have this experience!  My next time around, I think I'll be soloing it here. I think it's just a nice place to get comfy, read a book or in my case, I'll most likely be on my laptop and let the hours pass. Mind you, this place is still fairly new, so there isn't exactly competition for the comfy arm chair/couch like Starbucks.  I will always recommend Akiba Kissa to friends and family, because honestly, I don't know any other place like this to be honest. Be sure to check their Facebook as they announce various events there (im personally waiting for a shonen event to kick in) and maybe even meet a new friend or two!   I can't wait for my next visit here."}
{"text":"Although I know nothing about manga or anime, I still had a great time here! I was kind of nervous considering it's a cafe geared towards manga & anime lovers which I am far from. Before even entering, we were greeted by one of the employees, who I believe is maybe the owner? Glad to know upon entering that the staff are friendly.   They explained to us that you could either pay $15 for access to their board games, wii, arcade games and manga along with a free drink, or, you could just pay for whatever you order, with no access to anything else.   We went for the $15 option which includes a drink. I got the Flavaccino since the menu says it's their signature drink. It was so good! Strawberry Vanilla is what I ordered, and it tasted exactly.. like strawberry and vanilla. It did get a little too sweet after a while though. I also had the Totoro Tart which was supposed to taste like black sesame. I could barely taste any black sesame, but overall I still enjoyed it and would order it again. We also got the Rilakkuma choco-mousse dome. It was good, but way too sweet for my liking.   Definitely would recommend coming with friends, theres lots of things to do here. For the price, $15 I think is reasonable. Considering most of their drinks are $5-7..paying $10 for access to so many board games.. arcade games, wii, manga and with no time limit, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Lots going on here at Akiba Kissa.  The 'admission' fee was $10 which includes a free drink which is pretty standard for a manga/board game place.  The available activities here include anime on the big screen, video games in a side room, board games, manga, and another media room which was playing UFC on a Saturday (maybe only for private and not business view)  At first glance there are two large walls of bookshelves full of manga (all in English) with a large sitting area filled with comfortable couches.  While the variety is there, it is best suited for someone beginning to read the series only.  For instance, there are only Bleach volume until volume 30 or so (can't remember the exact volume), so at one point you would be left hanging not knowing what happens next.  There are also some old manga (Ranma 1/2) which is a pleasant surprise, but i'd like to see some newer manga too.  There are only a few board games (they only have some very simple ones) available which is disappointing, as this would be a very decent hangout spot for playing board games.  They do allow you to bring your own board games.  There is a decently sized media room with arcade games and consoles plugged in, but they are pretty much occupied all the time, and in my whole time here i wasn't able to play on the console.  There are also other consoles around in the main lounge but are for display only.  Overall, Akiba Kissa has a lot going on visually but feels almost like it's got a bit of everything, but not enough of any one thing I want to do.  The amount of manga available needs to be at least 2x or 3x more for me to come back regularly."}
{"text":"It's a good place to hang out with manga theme.  They have a projector to put up anime for people to watch. There are also game rooms which you can pay to use and include a drink but not too sure if it includes food. I tried the tofu cheesecake (danboard) and sesame tart (totoro). The tart tastes good but the tofu cheesecake need sugar because it tastes like regular tofu but not a dessert.  I also order a matcha tea latte and hazelnut latte. Both tastes pretty good but if you don't like bitter than don't get the matcha tea latte since it is slightly bitter, but I think it goes well with the tart. Overall, it's a good place to hang out especially they open till late but may need more food choices."}
{"text":"It's right on Woodbine, by the same plaza where the Mandarin is located. The sign is a little small, but inside is huge!   You have a full lounge of seats for you to read manga, private room to watch anime or play video games and a small mini arcade room.   It was my first time and I really liked how the staff explained everything to me in terms of pricing and what's available to do.   If you pay around $15, you get a drink and pretty much stay as long as you can - with full access to their facilities.   My time there was limited, but I was able to enjoy a brand new season 2 episode of Attack on Titan, played a new board game, and enjoyed a session of Overcooked on PS4.   I would come back again to try their desserts and spend a bit more time reading some manga and trying other video games."}
{"text":"When we stumbled upon Akiba Kissa, we were looking to get some writing done at a local cafe. I was surprised there was an entrance fee but it is definitely worth it. It includes access to everything in the cafe (including the two rooms dedicated to video games, your controllers, and every game in their collection), and a drink! You just need to bring and ID to rent out their controllers. I believed this fee is waived during certain weekdays. This lovely cafe made me me miss Akihabara.  They have a medium-sized theatre room with more than 20 leather seats that were so comfortable, I almost didn't mind losing in Mario Kart. I was very impressed by their manga collection and I don't think you need to be very knowledgeable about the different titles to enjoy this place.Their espresso machine was broken when I came in, which limited their drinks menu. I did enjoy my tall glass of sweetened cold matcha latte and my adorable pikachu cake. This place is a hidden gem in Markham and if I didn't have deadlines to complete, I would have stayed the entire evening."}
{"text":"Gotta say this was a pretty cool spot! Its like a giant nerd cave, with everything you could want in one spot.   The area was quite large, with a huge lobby area. There was a lot of unused space at the front, but some cool posters hung up on the walls. The inside was quite nice, with comfortable seating everywhere and wall-to-wall shelves with manga! They had full sets of almost everything you could think of and more! In the back, they had areas for video games, with different consoles in the corners, and retro video game stations in the middle.   With such nice things to say, why would I give a lower rating? That's due to the sitting fee being $15, which made it quite a pricey visit. The fee included any drink from their menu, but that would mean you had to get a drink. For $20, they gave you the option to leave and come back, as they do not actually serve any food there. Other than some snacks and cute pastries, there wasn't really anything substantial to eat.   Service was very good though, as they girl there gave us a tour when we arrived and explained everything quite thoroughly.  As this place is catering to a very niche market, it is quite hard to see myself coming again. For me, the main reason I would be interested in coming would be for the manga library. However, since the price to stay and read is quite steep, I don't see myself coming back (especially considering the fact that everything you can do here, you could do at home for free). A super cool spot, but not worth the price in my opinion."}

{"text":"This place is permanently closed according to their Facebook page. Please update this"}
{"text":"Once I found this place, I immediately fell in love. The owners and staff is so friendly and helpful, it definitely feels like a safe and comfortable place.  It has huge spaces for different activities, there is something for everyone (no alcohol tho for your alcoholic bffs)   Your entrance fee includes a drink! Their Japanese bubble tea is honestly sooooo good. I recommend sencha with peach and passion fruit favoring and lychee jelly. It has a very refreshing but non overbearing flavor and the sencha adds a great tea taste as well. I love how it is never too sweet and artificial tasting, unlike most bubble teas.  I was told they have a special $12 pricing going on every Tuesday- Thursday, not sure when it will end tho. I wish they did half price entrance fee (maybe without inclusion of drink) after 7-8pm or so, since customers do not get the full day. My friends and I arrived at 10:30 and stayed till 1am with they closed. It was so much fun...Just let us live there ;-;   There's so much more positive things so say about this place but you should come discover them yourself"}
{"text":"One world. Totoro.  SO damn cute I almost didn't want to eat it!  Appearance aside I am surprised to say that the pastry was actually pretty good. It was made of black sesame, white vanilla, and chocolate ganache.  The tart texture was decent in that it wasn't super hard like many pastry shops in Toronto are.  The sesame, vanilla and chocolate worked quite well together.  I felt like the black sesame flavour could have been stronger but I feel like I always complain it isn't strong enough!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This place is definitely a place for hang out - either with a couple of friends to have some fun with video games and board game or by yourself to read some manga or comics...  I found this place accidentally after lunch at Zen and I guess this would be a place you can go to after lunch if u have nothing much to do in the afternoon... If i understand correctly, this is how it works: The entrance price is $15 and it included a drink. Once entered inside, you will have unlimited use of the arcade games/video games/manga/board game for the stay. It has my favourite game - Street Fighter! :) It also showing some Japanese anime on a projected big screens.  The place is quite spacious and clean. It has a common areas with lots of seats and sofas where the manga and board games are placed. It's the same area that show the Japanese anime which I mentioned earlier. Then there are two separate areas for arcade and video games. There is another section for washroom.. but just wanna mention it cracks me up when I see a sign saying \"no manga beyond this point\"! But make perfect sense though, Lol..  Once inside,  I ordered a Latte that is included as part of the $15 entrance fee. The Latte is ok, nothing special or nothing bad either. I also ordered a dessert, the Totoro tart- which is a sesame flavour tart. Again, as a dessert, the taste is ok but nothing extraordinary. but the presentation does look quite cute though, which fit the theme of this place perfectly.  I think they also offer food other than dessert.  I haven't start reading the manga in here today so I don't know how broad the selection would be but I did play the Street Fighter! The joystick is quite responsive and in good conditions... so if u cannot pull the special move out from the street fighter character, the problem is probably not from the joystick... it's probably you. :) I think I will be here again as this cafe offer many activities that I normally would do to kill time- play video games/arcade games, be a couch potato and watch movie/read manga, abit of eating and drinking, or just do nothing and day dreaming.  Oh one more note, there is no In/Out privilege.. I think the owner say if u pay another $5 before u leave the place, you can come back in whenever u want in the same day. But I am not 100% sure, maybe u can double check if u need In/Out.  In summary, as a place for food, I have to say it's between 2.5 stars to 3 stars max... but as a place for manga entertainment, it's 4 stars based on my current experience. So overall, about 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"My friend and I just visited Akiba Kissa manga cafe and we loved it! It's awesome to see one of these in Canada :) There is an impressive selection of English manga, yummy drinks, cute treats, a huge lounge area with projected anime playing in the background, large screens to play video games, and arcade games too. They even had a changing area for cosplayers. We could have spent hours here reading manga on the comfy couches. For $15 you stay as long as you want with a drink included. The staff were super friendly and helpful - they even gave us a free lanyard! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Basically if you pay an extra Fee of $10 you can have access to the video games and wii, and to read the manga while you are enjoying your your tea or beverage.  If you have a group of friends, I see they have some other games that a group can   The Japanese tea were all loose leaf but since they are loose leaf, they don't recommend refills. The tea all come with two pocky (chocolate coated stick biscuit) One in strawberry and one in chocolate. The desserts are amazing from flavours, cuteness and creativity.  The dragon ball is mango flavoured, not too sweet and perfect for photos. They don't have a lot per day. I loved the bear chocolate moose cake. Not too sweet, just right.   I've also order the Emi fry, the shrimps were a decent sized, not too oily and the sauce were nice and it has droplets of wasabi on it.  There's a screen that usually plays Japanese cartoon movies or someone playing video games. Will definitely come back to chill again.   Came back again today. I find the temperature a bit cold. And the tea is no longer have the pocky sticks. They said they ran out, but I still see boxes of it on the shelves. The Ebi fry was still good. But overall service and everything, I think reduced by 0.5 star."}
{"text":"Akiba Kissa is an awesome place for manga, anime, gaming fans, or for those looking for a place to chill and relax.   I have no problems at all with the $15 admittance fee, considering you get one free drink from the menu, which is around $5, $10 is a fair amount to just lounge around playing reading manga, watching anime, playing video or board games.   I went with the hojicha latte for my drink and while it wasn't special or anything, it hit the spot and was the perfect companion for reading manga. Speaking of manga, they literally have everything. I went with the original Gundam manga, and they had Miss Kobayashi's dragon maid on the projector (a hilarious anime btw). You could also request anime as they have subscriptions to crunchyroll and FUNimation.  They have both Street fighter IV and V ongoing with full cabinet setups which was awesome, as well as Overwatch. And if you're more into Nintendo, they have all those too! Smash Bros is on a big screen, and other consoles have Mario Kart and other games going on.   The guys here were so welcoming and friendly, and they explained everything very well, so a huge kudos to them."}
{"text":"Akiba Kissa is indeed an interesting place.  Saw some of my foodie IGer posted pictures of their desserts and I thought they were very cute, so on a weekend, I came here for a visit with a few friends.  You can either pay 15$ to sit in to enjoy the manga or games with a drink of your choice, or you can just pay for the desserts and/or drink and sit at one of the tables.  We opted for just buying a dessert and a drink and chilled for a bit.  Desserts are indeed very cute and IG worthy, drinks are okay but I am not sure if it's worth a total of $15 price tag.  Love the Japanese mange cafe concept with huge open space and to make it even better, they also got the Gundam Extreme Versus arcade game system which is very popular in Japan and I personally play it on PS3 as well; another bonus!  If you are a big fan of building or collecting gundams or Japanese figures in general, they also sell them at the store or they can order it for you at a very competitive price!  Overall I would give this place a 4.for cute great tasting desserts (Tortoro was amazing!) and a heaven for all mange/anime lovers or otaku in general!  My only recommendation is maybe offer some curry fishballs or small Japanese snacks on their menu?  I'm sure they would attract more gamers to stay there for an extended period of time instead of just ramen!"}
{"text":"Sorry had to say this place was disappointing.  Drinks were instant mixed drinks and the desserts were all just for looks. This place may be cool for people who loves manga, anime, video games, cosplay, but right when i walked inside the place looked quite empty, quite DIY I should say. We visited this place on a Friday night, we were not greeted at the entrance, nor at the cashier, nor there were signs indicating if we should wait to be seated or if the seats were reserved or not.  We ordered a few choices of desserts from the display case and their \"instant\" iced coffee ($4.75?),which we ended up waiting 30+minutes for, not to mention, we followed up on our order and the guy working there gave us attitude saying \"I'm making your order now, can't you see\"?.  Ok we understand it's Friday night, it got a lil busy and the workload was unexpected, but the customer shouldn't have to deal with your frustration when you've only got 1 person at the cashier on a Friday night and the waitress was on break enjoying her instant cup noodles witnessing all this chaos. I'm not sure if I want to come back again, maybe this is a place for younger crowds, but the servicing part of the place needs major improvement."}
{"text":"Akiba Kissa is a manga/anime cafe, first of it's kind in the GTA.  The desserts they offer are too cute and are so pretty to look at, so much that you don't want to eat them.  They have a few options.   At $15 per person that includes a drink, you get to have access to the whole facility for the whole day... From 2pm (or earlier) to 2am!  There is also the $20 per person (which also comes with a drink) where you can go in and out their facility and bring food from outside.  Whether it is playing board games, reading manga comics, playing video games or simply watching an anime movie, there is bound to be something for everyone.  I only tried the Tortoro cookie dessert and it was simply sublime.   You can taste the delightful black sesame and the dessert was not very sweet aka Chinese Asian style! . After reading a few reviews, I ordered the matcha latte as well with no sugar, not wanting it to be too sweet.  The matcha latte is very strong in flavor albeit I don't like the way it looks from the top.. maybe I got used to the pretty art latte from other places :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhh the world of Manga: Japanese comic books and graphic novels. This gaming cafe is artsy and nerdy cool, a great place to work during the day, play games into the night and chill till the wee hours of the morning.  Free WiFi and music that switched from lively to relaxing and back. Projected on the back wall was some anime cartoon with English subtitles. There were many shelves full of Manga books, games and even Cosplay masks.  The owner greeted us warmly, explained the concept of the cafe then went over the menu with us. If you're here to play, you pay $10 for unlimited access to the games and you get one free drink. Seat yourself because they have table service; you can pay on the way out. They were out of a few things at 9:30pm so we settled on:  Bubble tea with Lychee - hated the bubble tea but loved the lychee.  Hojica Tea Latte - watered down but it came with two yummy Pocky sticks: one chocolate and one strawberry.  Raindrop cake with kinako powder and black honey - the cake was just plain gelatin, the black honey was overpowering and the kinako powder made things gritty.   Rilakkuma (Chocolate mousse) Dome Cake had the cutest presentation but tasted meh.   Akiba fries (fries with Takoyaki toppings) could have been more crispy but the toppings made it deliciously addicting.   Would love to come back and hang out, sip some Japanese imported tea and munch on Takoyaki specially brought over from Osaka."}
{"text":"A great place to take a good read of any manga that you want to take a chance on (at your own risk).  They have a couple of board games too, but the main focus from what I can tell is the ambiance of the environment as well as the manga/anime experience that it provides.  Has a couple of unique cakes (which I did not partake in), but have to admit that even as a guy, I can admire the effort put into making the cakes into manga like characters.    From what I can tell so far, it is the one and only manga cafe's that I have heard of or maybe that I have tried (apologies if I am wrong) in Toronto or at least in Markham.  It is a place that is a must go for the experience, however, my friends and I went to Japan recently and fully immersed ourselves in the otaku experiences of different cafe's and hence maybe why I am not as fully impressed with this place.  Overall, I would have given this place 4 stars had the drinks come a bit faster than an hour after ordering as I believe the wait time for drinks was a big deterrent for me as while I do not expect the drinks to come fast........I do expect it to come eventually.  However, you have more than enough things to do while waiting for the beverage.    PS. have to admit, the Matcha Frappe was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be one of my go-to cafes! The atmosphere is relaxed and casual and there is something to do for everybody whether you love to read manga, watch anime, play arcade or video games, eat and drink cute food, and/or play board games! Definitely recommended and it's a perfect place to go on a rainy day!"}
{"text":"A one-of-a-kind anime-manga-videogame-board lgame-cosplay cafe! I've come here a couple of times and I really enjoyed hanging out here with friends. There's a little something for everyone. Their manga library is massively extensive, they project anime on the walls from Crunchyroll, there's a growing library of board games, they have street fighter styled arcade cabinets in the back that they can set up a handful of games on like Overwatch, and they have other fun consoles like Wii U, GameCube and the Switch.   One admission will come with a drink of your choice on the menu. I always got their Kinako frappe and it always had a stroke soybean taste. Their desserts are cute and all anime-themed, but a little on the expensive side for me. I've had the Pikachu tart and it was alright. They have lots of Japanese snacks like Pocky and cup noodles. Tons of seating area to read manga, play board games or whatever it is that you want, they also have free wifi.   In the back they have their Switch hooked up to a room that's set up theatre style. I brought my own Switch because I had different games on them and they let me use it. TIP: if you're borrowing equipment from them, expect them to temporarily exchange them for your ID as unfun people have stolen in the past. I've spoken with the co-owner a few times and he's very nice and attentive. The staff are generally nice as well, they get the job done, no complaints here.   I've had people say it's a bit expensive at 15/person but if you stay long enough and have the right friends with you, then I think it's money worth spent if you're into this kind of place. I really hope this place will stick around for a while."}
{"text":"The place is clean, nice, comfortable. A lot of Japanese Anime,  board game , video games and movie. Drink and food very special !"}
{"text":"Pros + Desserts: Really cute and not bad to taste. Rather photogenic pastries of pikachu, totoro, etc  + Drinks: the novelty of the ramune drinks...chilli oil, takoyaki, kimchi, curry. Theyre interesting though not good to taste (I tried takoyaki)  + Parking  + Ambiance: great selection of manga, game rooms and screenings. It was quite an experience."}
{"text":"This is my first experience at a manga cafe. They have multiple rooms that include a theatre room and a gaming room.  The main room has board games and a wide selection of manga along with a seating area. It is very clean and spacious, a great place to sit and talk with friends. They have a large projector that they play to air anime and it is a great cafe for entertainment. Upon entering, we were told that we would each need to make a minimum of one purchase of either food or drink.  They guys behind the counter were very patient and informative. They were friendly and were very thorough in explaining all the amenities that the cafe offered. I would definitely come back whenever I am looking for a place to just sit and relax with friends."}
{"text":"Akiba Kissa has quite an interesting concept going on. The first time I walked in I was pretty impressed at the bookshelves full of manga. I spent a few hours reading manga (which I had stopped reading years ago) and it was quite a nostalgic experience.  The way it works is that with $15 dollars you get a drink (regularly about 5-6 dollars) and you get to stay for a while and do what you want. You can read, watch something (they have movie nights with a really nice speaker system), game with others (they have arcade style machines as well as a wii), or just chill with friends. They also have board games.  There's quite a wide variety of unique drinks you can choose from - sodas, bubble teas, lattes (the kinako one was quite interesting) as well as absolutely adorable desserts. The desserts are not included and they are pricey (6-7 dollars) but they are adorable. I've had the Pikachu mango mousse, Totoro black sesame tart, and raindrop cake. My favorite (and probably cutest) is the tart! Taste wise it's nothing mind blowing but let's be honest - you're buying it because it's adorable.  Given the price point of everything, it's not a place you can go to very often (unless you're loaded) but it's a nice experience to have every once in a while. Service has been really friendly every time as well."}
{"text":"I have to say this is an interesting spot. Manga cafe with an assortment of cute desserts (what drew me in in the first place), drinks, Japanese snacks and instant noodles, sofas and chairs to chill and relax in, manga library, board games, and video games. Seriously, it's like the perfect place for an otaku to hangout with other otakus.   So anyways,, it's $15 for a drink and unlimited use of mangas, video games, and board games. Or if you're here for the drink and dessert, there is no cover charge.   I tried the mango mousse pikachu. The mango was fresh and fruity and quite good. Their latte is pretty good too and comes in a huge mug. Other members of our party had the Japanese iced tea and the instant noodles which they were also fans of. Overall, a chill vibe and good spot for groups or individuals to hang out. This place is family friendly too."}
{"text":"I was summoned by the black sesame totoro tart posted all over Instagram. Verdict: it was cute as it was delish. I'm not a Manga fan myself, but I felt comfortable in the setting. The staff was extremely polite and patient with answering all our questions."}
{"text":"If you like manga and games,this a place for you. If you are just looking to have a nice cup of coffee, this is not what you are looking for.   You order a drink and you can literally sit there for hours reading manga until your eyes hurt. They have a few board games that you can play with friends, too. There is a section for video games but that is extra payment or you can get the package deal.   A decent place to hang-out to pass time for people like me who are not really into these sort of things. Maybe it's your cup of tea, I'm sure it will be enjoyable for you."}
{"text":"I'm not into manga, and I'm not a huge anime fan. As much as I'm trying to be unbiased here, it's hard to not like this place.  The people working here are amazing, shoutout to the asian dude with a little goatie - he explained everything upon our arrival even though we had absolutely no idea what was going on.   $15 admin fee, which includes a free drink, any drink from the drinks menu. You pay when you get there, and then you get comfortable at a table/couch while they bring you some water. In the mean time, you can decide on your drink and/or read some manga, play some board games. You order your drinks at the cash, and you can also get a dessert or two at this time. You go back to your \"area\" and wait for them to bring you the drinks and food. Further inside, there are consoles and TV set ups for you to play Wii games. You can bring your food and drinks inside if you'd like.  It's totally worth just for the Pikachu cake!! But I also had an amazing time getting exposed to the anime world and playing super smash bros."}
{"text":"Found this place on social media, saw all the cute desserts so I decided to try it out. The place was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be a cute little cafe, but it's actually a manga cafe. Pretty unique. Probably the first in Toronto. The place is huge! It's filled with tons and tons of manga along the walls and a bunch of anime stuff. They also played animes projected on the wall. The place was clean and simple. They had a lot of seating. They also had a side area where you can order drinks, desserts and some snacks. Desserts were limited to a small selection about 5, I think.   I was reading other peoples reviews and they stated that there was a sitting fee but the day that I visited, I wasn't charged the sitting fee. I was only there for the desserts anyways though.  I had the totoro tart and the poo boy. Presentation wise, the dessert is adorable!! Tastes wise, it was meh.. okay I guess... not really my thing though. The poop boy was a little sour.  Overall, nice place if you like anime or manga! Didn't really appeal to me though."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a higher rating as I love the idea of this business. Just a few shortcomings. And i guess I'll list some pros and cons in my experience. Hopefully the feedback may help their business.  Cons; -No real snacks or food to eat. Especially when you pay for full amount and stay for a few hours -everyone wants to use the party room.  But it's such a large room and only limited to one group. Maybe they can split that into 2 or 4 rooms.  -coat hangers would be nice -front space not occupied for retail -not much board games -No subscription model Pros: -very cool place to hang out -decent monetization model to get all you can play -wii is very fun for groups -arcade style PS4 cabinates -love how they have anime in the background always -a great way to get your cosplay on! -Great manga selection"}
{"text":"After my friend told me about this place, I just HAD to visit right away (literally arrived 2 hours after she told me). If you're one of those people who buy a coffee from Starbucks and then sits in the manga corner of Chapters/Indigo, this is the place for you!   First of all, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. One of them gave me a tour of the place after finding out it was my first time too! They have a room to change into cosplay. Note: they suggest bringing the cosplay to the cafe and then changing into it instead of arriving fully clad in it. They have another (darker) room for games and then a brighter game room with what looks like an arcade set up. The general lounge area with all the manga also has an anime being projected on the wall. Note: you can also do requests!  On to the food/drink items. I decided to get their matcha tea latte after reading a review that it had a pretty strong matcha flavour. They do add a bit of sugar so I asked for no sugar and they complied with the request. I also decided to try each one of their dessert items on display and they include the following:  1. Matcha Tea Latte ($5.69): as a previous reviewer said, there is more matcha in this latte than your average matcha latte elsewhere. That being said, it was SUPER milky. There was way too much milk and it drowned out the matcha, no matter how much was in there. I have to say I was disappointed with this.  2. Rilakkuma choco-mousse dome ($7): when the servers brought it to my table, I noticed there was a fly on the ear. I wasn't sure if it was decoration at first but then I quickly realized that couldn't be possible so I brought it to their attention and they apologized and mentioned they've been trying to catch that one all day and they served me a new one. Yes, it was gross to have seen it there in the first place, but they handled it pretty well. I saw them give me a new one instead of just scraping off the fly and re-serving that same one. In terms of its taste, I think there was a Carmel layer in it aside from the chocolate and overall, it was too sweet. Cute to look at, but it was the sweetest treat there. Seeing as how I got NO sugar in my matcha latte, you can see how this wouldn't appeal to my specific taste buds.  3. Raindrop cake: comes in 3 and a black viscous sauce and some yellow powder. I've never had this before so the server explained to try one straight and then dip into the sides afterwards. Personally, not my favourite thing to eat and probably won't be ordering it again. It didn't have a taste to it and even after dipping it in the sides, the combination wasn't pleasant. However, it was refreshing. It was like a water ball.  4. Poop-Boy raspberry rose entremet ($7) texture is like whipped cream with a cookie at the bottom. I hate whipped cream so it wasn't my thing, but my friend LOVED it. It was her favourite dish. While I didn't like the texture, the flavours were impressive.  5. Totoro tart (6.50): if you like black sesame, this would be the treat for you. It's a black sesame and vanilla tart and I was blown away with the details (the leaf on totoro's head). Not too sweet and so adorable - I almost wanted another one. This was my 2nd favourite dessert there.  6. Dragon Ball: this looked like the real thing and I couldn't wait to try it! The texture is very much like the raindrop but instead of water, it has a slight citrus taste to it. I would've liked it more if said citrus taste was stronger however. Very refreshing as well!  7. Danboard rare tofu cheesecake ($7): hands down my favourite dessert at this cafe. The presentation was cute, the cake itself was firm and the tofu was very concentrated. If you were looking for more of a cheese taste however, you won't find that with this cake. The tofu is amazingly strong and it had just the right amount of sweetness to it!  I went on a weekday and the servers explained the special deal is $11, which includes using all the facilities (for example, reading manga) and a drink of your choice. If you go on the weekends for the same deal, it's $15. You can't read the manga without buying this deal, but I'm not sure about the games because I didn't inquire about that. Otherwise, you would just be paying for the food/drinks and the anime being projected. If you're going to a manga/anime cafe, I wouldn't do just that - get the package deal!  All in all, very satisfied with the service and atmosphere of the place and it will definitely become my new favourite spot. It loses a star because I was pretty hyped about the matcha tea latte, which fell short, and the fact that my friend almost fell at the door as we were leaving because there was no sign about there being a step down from the door (it's on a raised ledge). What are you all waiting for? Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place with so many Japanese anime stuff! I am not quiet into the whole anime stuff. But I don't mind to bring more fiends over sometimes and play boardgames and read some anime or watch it! It is like 15 dollars to get a free drink and get access to all the books and such. They have video games, board games... definitely a place to bring friends and chill!   Their drinks are pretty good and pretty unique matching the Japanese style.   I had one of their anime desert. I thought it only looked cute and photogenic. But I was surprised it actually tasted really good!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I rushed over as soon as I heard about this place and I'll tell you now, it's amazing - manga as far as the eye can see, delicious aroma as soon as you walk in, a large area of many seats and tables, and so many nice board games to play with. There's also a projector as soon as you walk in that plays anime. It gets better when you walk into the arcade room, a nice theatre awaits that I assume plays games and movies (they were playing some Hatsune Miku game and Overwatch), and into another room rows of arcade machines that offer street fighter and overwatch. They also have Wii U's scattered in corners with a small selection of games (Mario Party, Pokemon Tournament, SSB, etc.).  I didn't think I'd be there for more than two hours but lo and behold, thanks to Overwatch I stayed for a solid 5 hours. Wow!   The best part, all of this for $15, one drink included!   Talking about food though:  I basically got every item in their food display save for the raindrop cake (I've made it before and it's not that good (tasteless), and I'm going to assume they splatter syrup all over it so not worth the price you get it for). They also told us their desserts are made with natural ingredients so no artificial anything in anything.  - Rare tofu cheesecake: honestly, first bite in and my tastebuds were already confused. It's not that great, but somehow has an unusual taste the more you eat so it sort of gets better. I've never tried tofu cheesecake prior to this so I can't compare, but there's a smoother cheesecake texture to it, but also a little jello-y due to the tofu. If you take a bite out of regular tofu and a bite of Japanese cheesecake, that's what this tastes like.   - Rilakkuma chocolate mousse: oh man, this was the highlight of my starving afternoon. This stuff is so worth getting. Chocolate/hazelnut lovers, get it, no questions asked.    - Matcha Roll with Azuki cream: oh man, this stuff is good! It's not too sweet, and don't be put off by the red bean! I'm not much of a red bean fan but this took the cake, literally. I'm just sad that they're taking this off the menu.   - Sakura mochi: I didn't try this but my friend said it was pretty good; there's red bean filling on the inside. Only downside is the weird leaf wrap, didn't taste so good apparently. They're also removing this from the menu.   - Hojicha latte: at first taste, it's like a watered down green tea latte, but the more you drink it, the more flavourful it becomes. Strange, but definitely worth trying if you're new to it.   Games and manga-wise, I'd definitely give this place a 5/5, however, the food prices are really overpriced for the portions they give you. All in all, food is mediocre save for a few items, but for the price you pay, it's definitely not on par with places like Duo. A star off for that.  I'll definitely be back for their games and drinks though! $15 isn't bad, tax included, and great for get together with friends, I'd say."}
{"text":"This place is a great idea! A good place for anime/manga and video games geeks to hangout! And if you aren't into that stuff well, it's still fun to explore their amazingly huge manga collection. There are amazingly cute desserts, instant noodles, bubble tea and other snacks :) you won't need to leave to get food when your 1/2 way through your manga. They also have game rooms and  old style arcade consoles :) they also have a Wii corner and a PlayStation room. :) They hold many cool  events. This is definately a place to check out :) opens til 2am. You can just chill for free if your sure what you want to do yet, there is no minimum entrance fee, it's $15 to read/play (no time limit) and comes with a free drink of your choice ;)"}
