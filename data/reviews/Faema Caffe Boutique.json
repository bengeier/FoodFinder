{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. Although you can find a pretty good gelati the rest of the fair is pretty crap. The coffee is terrible and the service is complete crap. I tried it a few times and it stayed crap."}
{"text":"This is a rather odd retail outlet for Faema--it's half cafe, half espresso machine showroom. On the weekend, it's all zoo, since people trying to get coffees or some of the other light foodstuffs are jostling with gawkers looking at the big, shiny, expensive machines in the small space.

Another novelty is that in addition to the usual stuff you'd expect at a cafe, they have slices of pizza, too. Sure, they're both Italian cuisine, but pizza and espresso don't really go together (even in Italy, really)."}
{"text":"This is what I would say to my friends:
Run away from this place. 

 cappuccino tastes terrible. 

Terrible service."}
{"text":"Faema was my first espresso machine when I was teen and I've been drinking espresso before it was hip with non- Italians.  Walked into Faema at Sherway today, intending on a cup of espresso, observed bags of Segafredo coffee (just ok supermarket beans) and decided just a cup of brewed coffee would do.  Now what could possibly go wrong between cashier and the coffee within three steps and two other employees to help serve?  I waited so long after ordering and paying that I thought that they were brewing a fresh pot of coffee.  Three customers served later I realize that they've simply ignored my order or forgotten it.  Well done, Faema!  And not even one word of apology.  Cheers to you, not even nostalgia will have me coming back. ."}
{"text":"Bad service - teenage cashiers were more interested in talking to each other than attending or conversing with the customers."}
{"text":"Decent coffee, terrible service...the cashiers don't notice customers and if they do snicker and laugh...terrible attitude towards customers...just having good coffee is not going to be enough..."}
{"text":"mmmmm gourmet slice(s) of pizza are my favourite here. 5's because I've yet to be disappointed. 

Pizza, gelato, macarons, coffee, etc 

It's a nice change from the food court when stopping in at sherway."}
{"text":"I don't have lots to say about this place. 

The coffee boutique is located inside The West mall and despite it carries the same products of its sister on Dupont Ave, this location seems to be far from the quality and standard you can find there.

Overall the prices for what you get are a bit steep and as per quality goes, well, it doesn't satisfy my taste and standard. 

Had a slice of pizza and a little pastry along with the coffee:
- slice of pizza: a portion of dough, hard as my flip flop topped with cheese that seemed more like chewing mighty putty with some average No Frills pepperoni pieces fallen by accident on it;
- the little pastry: a failed simulation of a sfogliatella napoletana that is supposed to be crunchy in the outside but that turned out to be old and stale since the paste was soft and chewy. The cream inside? old enough that I could forecast the weather in Toronto for the next couple of days;
- the coffee: the only thing that can be saved even though it could have been done better.
Asked for a shorter than a short single shot and had seen my request entering from one ear and forcing the head of the server to nod in reply as of a \"yes, I got it\" and then witnessing the message escaping from the opposite ear because in the end, my coffee was of the length of a short cappuccino.

So, overall: horrible service for a poor quality food and an almost decent coffee.
I'm sure I won't come back."}
{"text":"Pizzas, Sandwiches, Coffee, Lattes, Espresso Shots, Muffins, Gelato, Tarts. As close as one can get to decent quality Italian goods in a mall. I come here after work and grab myself a latte before hitting my rounds in the mall."}
{"text":"Best latte you're going to get in a mall. The Bistro which is kind of a savoury danish is nice. I can understand the complaints about service. I found it neutral not friendly not rude. I'm glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, but, as usual, horrible service. I'd rather have an okay latte and great service then a great latte and service like this.  It's usually the same ladies working there so you would think they would have built some sort of repore with their customers but they ha
ve not.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the Sherway Gardens on a Sunday afternoon when I bumped into this place and decided to get some sweet sweet gelato to munch on. 

The gelato was $3.45 per scoop and you have to pay for them first before they allowed us to pick our flavours. There were about 14 flavours to choose from and they did allow us to sample some before we made our pick. I sampled around 4 of them and most either tasted just average or down right nasty (I'm looking at you, Peach flavour!). But I gotta make a decision we were had already paid, so I settled for the Cookies flavour which in my opinion was the only above average flavour that I tried that I otherwise couldn't find it from the grocery store. 

However...we were then informed that they ran out of the sugar cone :(((((((( like seriously on a Sunday afternoon and you run of the only good cone option and didn't inform us when we were paying. The other 2 choices were plain cone or just a paper cup. Well plain cone it was, and guess what, they took out something that I vaguely recognized as those cones that I bought from No Frills many years ago as a child. I'm totally positive that they had probably gotten their sugar cone from the grocery store as well. 

The gelato that we ended up getting weren't really that much (see picture), and honestly for the price of $3.45 I could have easily gotten a full bucket of ice cream from the grocery store. Ok ok I get it that I shouldn't compare grocery store prices to a store or restaurant, but for the exact same price I could have gotten better quality gelato in greater portion inside a freaking waffle cone at a lot of other gelato places.

TL:DR -- $3.45 per scoop, most flavours were nasty, tiny portion size, steer clear of their gelato section and your wallet will thank you later."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**

I need to rethink my rating for coffee because this place just blows my mind and all other chain places that I rated at 4 stars (Tim's, Starbucks, and Second Cup) pale in comparison.  I never heard of Faema before and it looked like a standard boring cafe in Sherway Gardens.  Little did I realize that this gem is not just a cafe but a high end producer of espresso machines.  This cafe is just a showroom for the hot, flavourful, and amazing espresso the machines can create.

On the right side of the store is where all the wonderful machines are... you have to keep your jaw intact because the price tags are nuts.  We're talking 1500++ easily for most models.  There are several that are made for casual users so you can find some for less than $300.  I didn't spend too long looking at the features but these machines seem much more durable than your standard machines you find at Bay or other similar stores.  For starters, the materials are much heavier.  No filmsy plastic or aluminium coating.  Lots of these components are heavy and durable.  

I ordered a medium double Americano and also a double espresso here.  I was really surprised by the taste and smoothness of this.  Both drinks had extremely bold flavour with practically zero bitterness and acidity.  It's really lovely.  The aroma was that deep coffee scent and the heat was REALLY hot.  It's rare to see mall coffee get this type of heat.  Most machines can't do it.  I really want to come back and try more espresso drinks.  This is possibly the best coffee I've had west of Highway 427.  

This cafe also has a decent array of gelato and pastries.  We didn't order any as only 3 pastries were indicated they were baked on site and I wasn't hungry for those.  The gelato looked tempting but it was too cold for me to dig into a cup of it.

The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was the service.  The young woman who did our order and did our espresso was great.  She was pleasant, nice, and polite.  She was also patient with other patrons.  I took off one star for the older lady who was really in a mood.  She was harping on the younger woman about her $2 tip and she wanted to get her $2 tip now out of the cashier.  She went on about this for at least a minute.  Her voice was irritating and her attitude really needed an adjustment.  Why on earth would you behave like that in front of customers?

Anyhow, GREAT espressos... detour away from the Starbucks and Second Cup and head this way to some of the best coffee in the GTA West."}
{"text":"It took me a while to find this cafe. The almond pretzel is not soft and yummy. Service is nice. But obviously I am not satisfied with the quality of my food/beverage."}
