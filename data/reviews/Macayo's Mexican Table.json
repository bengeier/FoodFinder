{"text":"Worst meal ever. Beans & rice had a sour taste. My husband ordered a plate w/a tostada, enchilada, & taco. They were sampler size at a price of $9.95. We told the waiter & they reduced our bill 20% but they really didn't care what was wrong. We could have eaten at Taci Bell & had better tasting food for a lot less and regular sized food insread of minis. Even the iced tea was small size. Never going back."}
{"text":"I always loved eating here over the years. Lately, it seems that the service has become lax, takeouts have become notoriously incorrect. Last night, my pollo asada had a piece of metal in it. The salsa seemed watered down. Chips tasted old and mostly scraps.  Not sure what is happening. Macayos has always been the reliable restaurant in Tempe/Ahwatuckee area that you take visitors to serve them good Mexican food.  Kind of bummed. Please, I hope management is reading this and save this once great restaurant."}
{"text":"Macayos has great Lunch time Specials! I had the Chicken Fajitas which comes with sour creme, guacamole and salsa and only 9.99! They were delicious! They also make very good Magaritas with different specials!The atmosphere is very Rocky Point and we love the decorations very festive!"}
{"text":"Macayo's used to be decent but over the years the food has gone downhill. I refuse to eat here and only went because we met friends there. The salsa taste like it comes from a can, the food is far from authentic. If you're in the area, Manuel's is a better alternative. If  you're looking for real mexican food, go to Tony's or Zamora's."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Wait staff Frannie was great as well!!! Was there for a friends birthday and place was packed but food and service came out fast. Thank you very much!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. If you like bad service then this is the place for you. If I could give zero stars I would! Never felt so unwelcome. The hostess was rude and acted like we were a bother to her and the server had a horrible attitude. As an experienced server I couldn't believe the way she was treating us! We left before ordering. Never again will I come here and will NEVER recommend anyone to come here as well."}
{"text":"The setup looks good but the food was okayish , actually a little over priced."}
{"text":"This is pretty decent Mexican food. You have to remember, this is a chain restaurant, so if you're looking for authentic Mexican (though I must say, most authentic stuff I have had wasn't anything to brag about), this isn't the place for you. But if you want to get a taco and beans and a margarita, stop on in. The back patio is nice when it's cooler out."}
{"text":"I had a big Margarita  novelty cup with only 3.99$ refills! I'm definitely coming back! The server was super nice, great service!"}
{"text":"I've come here for several years now and never walk away disappointed. The customer service is very attentive and friendly. The food is reasonably priced and is very tasty. The presentation of the food is great. I have not had a bad experience so far. If you want a good Mexican meal for a reasonable price, with a great atmosphere this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"This was the second time we have been to Macayo's since the management change. They brought in a D.J. and it was jumpin! Fast drinks,great food, friendly service and even danced with the Manager! These girls are a good change for this place."}
{"text":"Maya the waitress was amazing. Thanks for making my visit enjoyable shes friendly and had such great manners amazing service from her."}
{"text":"First time here. Saturday night... Terrible. Extremely understaffed. After 20 min I went to the bar to get my drinks.. Then another 20 min ordered my food.... Salsa isn't very good either. Would not recommend, will not come back... Ever... Ever ever ever..."}
{"text":"We went there last night, hoping that the reviews we read were wrong. We are new to the area and looking for a favorite Mexican place, it will definitely not be this place. The service was horrible, our waitress walked past us just sitting there 4-5 different times. The food was most certainly not worth what we paid. Bluntly putting it, horrible food and horrible service. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"With so many Mexican restaurants in this area, how can Macayo's stay in business?  This was our first time here and only because Babbo's had a 30 minute wait.  Instead of waiting, the 4 of us tried Macayo's.  Flavorless salsa to begin with.  My chicken fajita was undersized, not sizzling and so bland.  Certainly not worth $14!  Others had carnitas (overcooked), combo meals and nachos and all were underwhelming. The service was fine but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Macayo's location since it's grand opening in the 80's!  This continues to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley.  I now make my hubby drive me quite a distance just to go here 1-2 times a month to get my fix.  The food is always consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Macayo's is a not-very-authentic Mexican restaurant that is great for my family who likes not-very-authentic Mexican food.  I like going here when I visit Phoenix because they have a beef taco with shredded beef instead of ground beef which is found too frequently at other restaurants.  Also one time they accidentally deep fried my whole bean burro which turned out awesome and now I order it that way every time.  I was surprised how bad their house margarita was...I always see people returning with their Macayo's margarita mugs to party the night away.  I had a stomache after finishing that off.  Many years ago we'd visit for Sunday brunch which had a breakfast buffet with a huge selection of breakfast Mexican food."}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating a friend's birthday.  Food was fantastic. Service was good and enjoyed sitting outside in the patio.  Karen Sanders and Maddy our  waiters were wonderful"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Macayo's in Surprise for 8 years now, and we have never had a bad experience.  There is never a wait and the staff has always been wonderful.  Our kids love it there."}
{"text":"I only go to Macayo's for one thing- the green chile tamales. It's like a girl on her period's dream come true. The salty and sweet is amazing. I am always satisfied when I leave. My husband always orders the beef chimichanga which is always stuffed full of moist shredded beef. It's huge! Macayo's is your typical Americanized Mexican food; heavy on the cheese and enchilada sauce.   On the downside, I've never had a superior server. They've always seemed kind of distracted. I always blame it on the place being so busy."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened at the macayo's in Goodyear.  When you walk in there is an overwhelming sewer odor.  At one visit we just passed it off to possible plumbing problems at the time bit we have been back several more times and this gassy odor continues to be bad.  This used to be one of our favorites places to go, however until they fix this we won't be back.   We have also left the last few times with unhappy stomachs ... Don't know if the odor and the food are related ... But hard not to think that.   I hope the Macayo's management corrects this problem because we really do like the food, service, and atmosphere of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite macayo's. I really like this place been coming here for many years. I always have the baja chimi and a margarita. I know its run of the mill,  but they have this dish nailed down.  I worked at the one on central when I was a young muchacha and their chimi is good too. But Im always disappointed with the one on warner bummer cause its closer to me"}
{"text":"Macayo's patio is where it's at but our server Ashley made the experience so much better! She and the manager both made our experience there totally worth it after a long days work with a large group! Will definitely be regulars and ask to sit in Ashley's section! Thanks Macayos!"}
{"text":"Where to begin. I'm a native of Phoenix, and have been going to Macayo's since I can remember, my parents, and siblings have been going since they opened. I will NEVER set foot inside another Macayo's again. I flew in from Kentucky for a wedding in early December 2015. My treat to myself has always been a Green Chili Burro at Macayo's whenever I'm in town. My sister, and I went to the Macayo's at the West Thomas location. When our server came to take our order, we asked for Green Chili Burros. We were told by her that \"management\" had now changed, and they had decided to remove the Green Chili Burro from the menu. I was literally in shock. Macayo's is KNOWN for their Green Chili Burros, that's THE staple that made them famous in Arizona, and the southwest. My sister and I just sat there staring at each other, and in complete disbelief. It took my breath away, and I felt as a HUGE part of my childhood just died. The server, who was PHENOMENAL by the way, was JUST as upset as we were. She couldn't believe any \"management\" could delete a STAPLE ITEM on the famous menu. My sister, and I finished our ice tea, told the server we would NEVER be back, and as we began to leave, she told us that 4 of the new \"managers\" were sitting at a table not far from ours. SO as we walked out, I made a point to stop at their table, and in no uncertain terms, let them know that WHOEVER thought up this idea have no idea what they're doing to Macayo's. I'm actually moving back home to Phoenix the end of January 2016, and was SO looking forward to frequenting Macayo's. It's okay though, I found a NEW, OLD PLACE where the management understands NOT TO MESS WITH A GOOD THING, and is still has the original family owned feeling, because it is. That place is Poncho's on South Central. PHENOMENAL, PHENOMENAL Green Chili Burros, and Everything Else. Fantastic Food, and Staff.  GOODBYE MACAYO'S, YOU WILL BE MISSED. It's a SHAME that \"management\" stepped in and RUINED a good thing!"}
{"text":"The food was amazingly great. My son only eats certain meals and this is always a great place. Two days in a row I had a great server. Thank you so much Yadira!"}
{"text":"This place was awful! We have been to the one in Phoenix and that experience was great. On our way back home to California we saw this one and wanted to have a lil treat before we left, plus we had friends with us who have never eating here and wanted them to enjoy it like we did from the one Phoenix. They seated us quickly that was a plus. But it was the food and the service that was really bad. Our food was not tasty at all. The tortillas for the burritos were cold. We were asked if everything was okay but as she asked she kept walking and didn't notice we needed drinks. Our waitress would stand in the corner and twirl her hair. A big no-no in my book. It left a bad first impression on our friends they will never come back and now I am questioning wether we'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Just say no to Macayo. You may want to drive out of Glendale for food Mexican food"}
{"text":"I have decided that I hate this place. It was almost a hard decision because their baja sauce is awesome, but there are so many things to hate that I have to be the \"Paul Revere of Yelp\" and warn all of you good people.  They are sneaky little weasels and want to take your money. I ordered a baja burro and the server asked \"with guacamole and sour cream\"? While she was nodding her head. So I said yes. The bill came and I was being charged an extra $4.00 for sour cream and guacamole that I didn't even use. I know what you are thinking, \"that's your fault, she probably asked if you wanted to add it,\" but that is not the case. Same thing happened at dessert, we ordered the deep fried ice cream and we were asked if we wanted chocolate or regular, so we picked chocolate (the menu doesn't say anything about chocolate costing more money), but sure enough... A teaspoon of Hersheys is another $2.50. Fast forward a week later, the same thing happens to my coworker at the downtown location, they pay an additional $4.00 for sour cream and guac that they didn't even use. I am under the impression that the servers are actually trained to ask you in a way that implies that it is included to jack up your bill.  Look, their food is okay, but the prices are absurd. You can find much better Mexican food at half the price all throughout the Valley. Hell, you can go to Outback and have a steak, salad, bread, blah blah blah for less money.   The decor is old and tacky, the last server we had hit on my wife while I was in the restroom... Seriously, he said \"He left you? if I was your man I would never do that to you, I would treat you like a queen.\" Yeah, okay Macayos guy with your extra $4.00 that you stole, go on with your bad self."}
{"text":"Sat down, waited 15 minutes.  Never got served.  Asked who my server was, they said they didn't know but would check.  Still no service.  Walked out.  Waste of time."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Macayo's and it was just ok, nothing special. The menu states that all the locations are family owned and operated and the recipes are family created as well. I was expecting much better food for a family run restaurant, the carne asada burrito I had was bland, lacked flavor, the rice was greatly undercooked and still hard, you can tell it was made long ahead of time and not freshly made. We also had the enchiladas, which were good, but again, lacking flavor. In general, the food had a frozen, then microwaved, taste to it, I was expecting much more from a family recipe restaurant. As an appetizer we had the fried tamale bites, which were good, but super sweet almost to the point that they were not enjoyable. Overall, Macayo's is ok, I've had much better Mexican food in the valley, not somewhere I'd go again though."}
{"text":"We have been dining there once a week, this week we went in and our regular gal wasn't there. The new bartender was horrible with an attitude. We probably won't go back. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"We love this place! So peaceful at night by the lake! Unfortunately we had a horrible server named Danielle #7142. So horrible that I didn't even want to leave 2 or 3 percent tip let alone 15 percent! We needed refills for the kids and never got them before we left. We were halfway done with our meal and she brought us out the tab like we weren't welcome here anymore! We had to flag her down for everything! Not one time did she ask us if we needed anything or if everything was okay. We ended up leaving a 3 dollar tip and she's lucky she got that! Never again will I go to macayos I'd this is the kind of serice I'm gonna get."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other night.  We were amazed by the service.  Our waiter was outstanding! (Thanks Luis!)  You can tell it is managed extremely well.  The food was authentic and delicious.  Service was very fast and staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Good as always.  Brings back memories from the younger days for mini chimis happy hour."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food at this location because we never got served. We sat at the table with a 4 year old child for well over 10 minutes and were ignored the whole time. People who came in after us were served, but we didn't even get acknowledged. Epic fail."}
{"text":"This is a review of Macayo's in general.   This is a typical Mexican chain restaurant. These are way worse than authentic Mexican food which can be found all over the valley at a family owned restaurant. Prices are typical of any restaurant 8-15$ range. The margaritas are terrible. I had one with my girlfriend recently, and I did everything in my power just to choke it down. I think they poured sweet and sour mix in a cup and gave it to me. She couldn't even finish hers, and I noticed another table ordered margaritas that were left 3/4 full when they left.   The food is pretty bad. Last time I went with my girlfriend, she threw up an hour later and I had heartburn the entire night (probably because I finished my margarita). I would never go back to a Macayo's again."}
{"text":"I've taken to calling this place my new local! The staff are really lovely, and times I've chatted with managers, they've all been really great and friendly too. Make sure you don't miss the margaritas, or the sangria... and the live music is such a great asset to this place. There's also trivia and music bingo on Thursdays that is super fun. I feel so lucky to have a quality place like this nearby because places like this, with great service and great (and affordable) food and drink AND great entertainment, are hard to come by."}
{"text":"I go here at least 2 times a month.  Best chips and salsa in the valley.   Sometimes the food isn't hot enough for me, but taste and texture are 100% perfect."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a beer and some good food. Everyone has alway been nice and service attentive. Wednesdays are .99 tacos!"}
{"text":"This has by far been the worst experience at this establishment. my family has been eating here for years we love it. My wife and I even had our wedding luncheon here. it's usually pretty good. But tonight was horrendous. our server didn't greet us for probably 10 min. and after we ordered our food my drink needed refilled and I asked for a water for my son who is one. he came back and refilled our chips but forgot my son's refill and my son's water. another 10 minutes go by and still no drinks. I finally get  refill but no water so I ask again he said he would bring it right out. he didn't. our food came and then he finally got my son his water. My wife's burrito was cold and soggy. I told the waiter I would not be paying for her meal since it was so horrible. he tried to blame it on her saying that the dish she ordered gets soggy fast. that's a lie. then he ran out credit card twice and over charged us. after speaking with the manager we explained the situation  he then started getting rude with my wife. needless to say I didn't get my money back and I will never step foot in this restaurant again. the staff was so rude. Worst experience in my 10 years of dining here."}
{"text":"I have been going to 'Woody's Macayo's since the 60's. Went to Macayo's in Surprise last night,  had a red chili burrito enchalada style. It had a very small amount of Enchalada sauce & cheese right on top of the burrito but none on the plate...very dry. Had to ask for more sauce  (like the waitress couldn't see that it was dry) it was cool in temperature not warm or hot. The meat inside was so fatty and tough I had to spit most of it out, pretty disgusting actually...I quit going about 2 years ago because they discontinued the red & green burritos, heard they brought them back so gave them another try. The quality is way terrible. I WILL NEVER GO BACK. I gave 2 stars because the waitress was somewhat okay, not the best."}
{"text":"We really love the food, preparation and presentation. As a vegetarian, I love the vegetable enchiladas, he loves the chili rellenos. Great flan too!!!  Our favorite server is Manny!!! This gentleman is so observant we never have to ask for more chips, salsa or drinks, he is super on task!  Thank you Macayo's for such a great dining experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick mexican food fix, this place will work. The chips and salsa are great, the food is just average. Also, I found it really shady that they ask you if you want guac and sour cream when you order your entree but then charge you for it in the end. WTF?! They asked if I wanted it as if to suggest it just came on the side normally, like they were helping me out. But nope, they definitley will charge you for it. This may be partially on me to ask if an extra charge would be incurred but come on, how often do you really ask that when someone straight up offers you something?! Anyway, this place is ok. I'd rather go to Abuelo's by the mall but this place is closer."}
{"text":"Macayo's Mexican restaurant has been a favorite in our family for years. For some reason we were told when we stopped in today for lunch that they no longer serve red or green chili except on the weekend. I don't have any idea who thought this up but I think it's crazy. If you people have forgotten you serve Mexican food which includes red or green chili."}
{"text":"Our waitress HEATHER was horrible and terrible dining experience !! We were sat with the A/C & Fan blowing right on us 1st of all.WE asked if they could turn the fan off, no that never happened. Then we ordered simple chimichangas  with shredded beef. It took 45 minutes to get our food. This was on a Thursday & NOT busy, resturant was 1/2 empty. After getting our food so late, it was the wrong meal we ordered Shredded Beef and both of us got chicken ! The waitress never cleared any of our dirty plates from a appetizer we had ordered and ate, so we had all the dirty plates the entire time . The pepsi tasted flat, with no fizz. The manager never came over to ask or apologize about the wrong food & how long it took. After paying cash for my bill, the waitress kept my change !! We had asked for the manager after we walked up front to leave. Took forever for him to come out, then when he did, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL looking manager Looked like some bum off the street. He was not very caring or sincere to us after we explained how our dining experience was. All he said was I'll put you on a list in a book if you come back to get a free meal, YUCK !! I don't even want to come back ever to this location !!!!!"}
{"text":"Place sucked the food was bad no seasoning or flavor waitress was really  good  overall would never come back to this place giving 1 star"}
{"text":"I went this afternoon and had a great time. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was nice, and my lunch (the Baja pizza) was very good.   The only downside were the chips, which tasted bland and even a bit stale. The accompanying salsa mostly masked that, but not entirely."}
{"text":"The food here was great! I had received a recommendation for Macayo's from my hotel....everything was exactly as he raved about. The place is spacious and bright....the chips and salsa were plentiful and extremely addicting....the service was exceptional. I chose their recommendation (Macayo Chimichanga) which was excellent and I would definitely go back! If you love mexican food, this is a great pick!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Macayo's for many years and have never felt unwelcomed but after todays experience I am very upset with the service and how it was provided by Alejandro.  Today we were sat at 6:40pm and at 6:53pm server came to our table after attending a table that was just sat.  I advised server we were ready to order after we gave our drink order and asked for chips and salsa.  He rolled his eyes like he was in a rush then took our order.  He left and we did not see him until our food was brought out at 7:18pm I ordered a Baja Chimi with beans.  The server brought me a Baja Chimi with enchilada/relleno sauce with rice I advised him I did not order meal with enchilada/relleno sauce he proceeded to tell me how to order what I wanted and told me I did not know how to read the menu. I advised him I did not want the food and clarified what I wanted he continued to in his words \"educate me on how to read and order what I want including the difference between Baja burros and chimi's.\"  I became very upset my eyes watered because I was so furious he then asked if I wanted water since my cup was empty and lefted the glass and pushed it back on the table after I told him yes, and instead picked up the plate he had brought me and walked away grunting and rolling his eyes.  I told my husband I wanted to leave restaurant and began to  cry because he had made me feel like crap and had no customer service skills we did not pay for the water we had a the few chips I am willing to pay for it but did not get to make a complaint to management because I chose to walk away instead of act as this server and continue an unnecessary argument my hope from this is that this be used as a teaching tool to assist future servers to not argue or advise customers of what they want and attempt to educate a person on what they want I would hope that Alejandro would be trained in customer service skills as well as being less argumentative and working on skills with interaction with customers to become a better server as well as that others not follow in his foot steps.  I can be contacted by email at corinafsais623@yahoo.com if a payment is needed for items that were provided I would prefer not to deal with that particular server again."}
{"text":"Enchilada was good but the rice had almost no seasoning, and the refried beans had too much salt. I'd give this place one more try but that's about it."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for a late lunch the food was very fresh and delicious service was a little bit slow however the food was temperature hot so I know it was just made the waiter was friendly and accommodating to separate all our checks definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"Good food great gluten  free selection. Chips and hot sauce super. The most wonderful waiter aten. He should be nominated for best waiter of thebyear. He remembers what we order and gets it ready without us asking. Its worth eating here.to have him wait on us. A very good and reasonable lunch menu."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  Been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since moving from California.   Service was excellent and food was unique and very tasty.   My new favorite Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for us. The carne asada is my favorite in town, and the Baja sauce is yummy if you like spicy. We've always had really good service and fresh food. Delish!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot when I have a group of people to feed.  The prices are right and the food is good.  The service is good.  I like to sit in the patio area when the weather is good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for lunch as it's right by my office. The service is quick, the food is amazing, and the servers are always friendly. I've used Macayo's for catering a few times and have been extremely impressed."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican food restaurant whenever I have to meet the folks out in Mesa. I do not think I have ever had a problem out here except maybe for it taking a minute too long to get a margarita on a busy day but you can't really fault them for that.  The decor is bright and festive which is great for the tots and the mini-chimis always seem to put my girlfriend in a good mood when when she is blue (read:hungover)."}
{"text":"Hostess painting instead of seating us, but tables werent clean so had to wait 5 min to be seated.  My girlfriend said she could smell the paint, i couldnt believe they were doing this during business hours!  We finally got seated, but the table was Horrible filthy!  Soda all over the wall, was really bad, could see the dried up soda drips all over the walls! Seats and table were dirty and sticky.  After we recieved a couple waters, we each took a sip and relized it was tap water!  Really!!?  We eneded up taking our food 'ToGo' because the seating and table were so disgusting!  Once home(less than 5min) we ate and once again were dissatified!  Food was so bland, canned vegtables, no seasoning, salsa tasted like canned stewed tomotoes! what a joke...called to complain and was given a credit for another meal, you can have it!  I wont be back to claim it! Never EVER Ever going back."}
{"text":"One word WONDERFUL! Friday happy hour in the bar is amazing(1/2 off appetizers and 3 buck drinks!!! Can't beat it!!!!) Fridays can get pretty busy in the bar there BUT the friendly staff is always willing to help even when they are super busy! Plus, During football season they have their amazing happy hour prices from open to close!!! I can't wait to go back to this place!!! :)"}
{"text":"I recently got take out from Macayo's in Mesa.  I was so disappointed. My guess is that the food is not fresh as it use to be but is frozen.  The salsa which use to be the best I ever had was somewhere in the range of the jarred stuff I buy when in a hurry. And I would like to say that adding salt-too much salt-does not make up for mediocre."}
{"text":"Would recommend. Excellent food. And good service with only 10 mins waiting on Sunday night. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"1. Happy hour pricing is only available in the upstairs area where they don't allow anyone under 21 (even though there is family friendly table seating) or on the patio with the broken heater.   2. Food is not even that great.   3. The indoor decor is outdated and run down.   There are better spots in the area to eat. I recommend to skip this place all together."}
{"text":"Salsa was great, food was OK, service was slow, and I feel the manager could of made a better attempt to resolve the situation more quickly. We had a party of 8 people. The shrimp was still frozen at 1pm on Saturday. We waited 20 minutes for the waitress to comeback and tell us there will be no shrimp cocktails, and took the manager quite a bit longer to come by. This is one example of why I rated the way I did. This was one of the worst visits I have ever had at a restaurant. But again, the food was at least decent enough to eat."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with family and after reading all the other reviews, I decided to write mine. I have been coming to this location for a few years. Never have had a bad experience. After seeing the negative reviews it makes me wonder if the people had actually came here or they are just natural whiners who complain about everything.  1st. When we arrived we were promptly seated. Just like all the other times we have been here. Even when we come for a birthday celebration and have 15+ people we never wait more than 10 minutes.   After being seated we had chips and salsa brought to our table immediately and our drink orders were taken shortly thereafter. I can't say how long because I don't carry a stopwatch to time how long everything takes. Apparently others do reading other reviews where they say they sat for ten minutes, it took 10 minutes to get drinks, etc.   When our drink orders were taken, our server asked if we would like any appetizers to start. We ordered two cheese crisps.  The cheese crisps came out in a timely manner. (Again not timed.) They were very good. Definitely recommend the cheese crisp for an appetizer.   After bringing drinks the server took our order. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and helped us with our orders. I had the beef chimi with rice and sour cream and guacamole. Here's the only negative thing I have to say about this restaurant. The red sauce on top of the Chimi was a little sweet for me. My cousin ordered the same thing and made the comment that the sauce tasted like ketchup. That's not a bash on the food. I just didn't care for it. Next time I know order without the sauce on top.   We also went to the bar area. The bartender, Taylor, was very friendly. I have known Taylor since I started coming to Macayos and have never had an experience that was unpleasant. The guy is always smiling, friendly, and happy.   It was an overall good experience and I definitely recommend everyone try the food here."}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding!  We had no less than three people trying to attend to us throughout our visit.  It was great."}
{"text":"I am a bartender and server at Macayos Goodyear... I come from Desert sky serving our guests for many years....I started working there at 17 years old and I now am on my5th grandchild....I take much pride in myself my job and my restraunt....I'm asking if you're reading this please give us a chance to make you smile...feel free to ask for me...I'm in the bar most shifts...we have great food...the best margaritas...macayos Mexican restaurant has been a part of my family now come let us be a part of yours...Sincerely..Angelina"}
{"text":"Awful service. People that work there are strange.  Jacked up prices, won't ever step foot in a macayos again."}
{"text":"The food is average, the prices are a little high, the salsa is okay, the service, is mediocre, but the balloon guy is great!"}
{"text":"Avoid sitting in the bar.  Went to Macayos for dinner and wanted to sit in the bar to watch sports while we ate.  We sat down and there was sports on but no sound.  Instead it was like I was at a rock concert as the bar tender had alternative music playing and at a level that anyone in the bar area could hear.  Then on top of that we didn't get service unless we asked for it directly, no drink refills or chips.  I would avoid sitting at the bar as the bartender was more attentive with something other than being at the bar."}
{"text":"Wow, the worst service I have ever had.    Been coming here for years as a kid growing up in the area, looks like this will be my last visit to Macayos.  Got seated at 7:30 (for our 7:15 reservation). Got drinks served at 8 (yes, 30 minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress).  And still waiting on the food (it's 9 pm).    Can't comment on the food, since I haven't got any on the first 2 hours..."}
{"text":"Anything with baja sauce is AMAZING, although you really can't go wrong with anything off the menu. Resist the temptation to fill up on chips and yummy salsa because you're going to want to try the mini chocolate chimis. If you want the BEST service, ask for Aten, he's phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped at this place and checked it out. Good decision. The food was great. I had the carnitas dinner plate and it did not disappoint. The staff was super nice. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has become a real joke over the past couple years. Worse service anywhere. They just can't handle it anymore with the immigration crack down.. The food is hit and miss anyway...Never again."}
{"text":"The \"hot\" salsa is delicious! Great flavor with a kick at the end. Our server was great and the service was fast! Great atmosphere and delicious food! I had the \"chimi macayo\" with carnitas, sooooo good! You will not be disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place gets worse every time we come back here. This will probably be the last time. I will give 2 stars because it is a fun atmosphere for the kids, but that is about it. The last couple times the servers almost seem nervous... makes me question the management. Today the rice was actually crunchy, and the chicken was hard to chew... rubbery and dry. The salsa was gross as usual.. weird basil flavor and tastes like it came straight from a can. Also, they don't have fresh fruit options, just fruit cocktail... the kind with the syrup that comes from a can."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time we love sitting up in the bar but one time I got my food and there was three strands of hair in the one plate of food. After that experience I wouldn't go back for awhile but recently I went again and it wasn't bad. Not sure how I feel about it..."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. It's hard to find a good combo of these but this has it! They even have a happy hour at 4:30-6:30 that gives you a discounted for popular appetizers. My husband and I went and we ordered a grande chimichanga, we split it and were both full when we left. The staff is always very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I come here maybe once a month or so, I find that the wait staff is for the most part friendly, but two that stand out as what true customer service is about. They are Mike ( he's a new dad) and a young lady Ashley. Both work hard to cater to our needs without being bothersome. A rare combo in the food service world. Great food and if I were you ask for mike or Ashley's station."}
{"text":"I don't even think this place deserves one star. I am not usually a complainer, but this experience ruined what should have been a fun night. We were there to eat before a concert. We had a reservation...but they still made us wait 15 minutes to get our table. We never saw our server. He kept attending to the table next to us but never came to see us. Another 15 minutes goes by and we have no water and no service. Finally a manager comes over and takes our drink order. Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong. We didn't want to send them back in fear of waiting another 20 minutes for drinks. Still no server at this point. A different manager comes by and apologizes that they're just busy. Not a feasible excuse for a restaurant that gets tons of people every night. He finally takes our order but doesn't write it down, claiming to remember it all. Sure enough, another 30 minutes go by. We are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated. Finally the food comes, and of course, the order is wrong. We needed to eat quick so we just ate it anyway. My whole night was ruined because we missed part of our concert EVEN THOUGH we had a reservation and allotted for plenty of time. I have never had such terrible service, especially from management as well."}
{"text":"Ahh good ole Macayos. I've been coming here since I was just a little kiddo. I remember walking in and playing the gum ball machine so I can win a cheese crisp, they still have that machine too! And Galaga/Pacman. Oh man the good ole days. My mother would take me here on special occasions and now that I'm older I visit the bar for happy hour and they can have prices you can't just beat.  There is one gentleman server (forget his name) but every time my mother goes, he brings her a margarita and a big ole cheese crisp because he knows us oh so well. Great guy! I think he remember the margarita part because that is my mothers name.. haha but anyways, great place to take the kids and have a bite. Sitting on the patio is nice as well with the little lake and ducks, but smokers (ew) can really cough up your day"}
{"text":"Went here on a casual lunch out with my spouse.  Service was slow.  When we did order, we got our food right away and it was cold on the outside and steaming in the middle...which only means one thing...MICROWAVE!  The food was so greasy and mushy.   Food felt like glue going down.  Afterward, had leftovers taken home with us and then thrown out the next day when we felt sick just thinking about it!  A waste of money for sure."}
{"text":"Been eating here off and on for years. Today the food was less than fair. The server was catatonic. The hostess bent over backwards to make it right which was admirable.  The quality has been slipping, but today it hit rock bottom.  The meals I cook at home are better than todays meal.  Pick another chain or better yet, find a good food truck if you want good mexican food."}
{"text":"This is my 4th visit to this restaurant and it will be my last.  The service was slow.  Staff all seemed like they didn't like their jobs no smiles unfriendly. Waitress brings one plate and then about 5 minutes later brings a second plate.  Then I had to ask for silverware.  The enchiladas were cold but I guess I must give them credit at least the plate was hot.  Black beans were mixed with the enchiladas and of course we all know they have juice."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Maybe the waitress was just having a bad night but her whole demeanor made me feel like I was bothering her. We asked for a drink menu and were told that they were upstairs. ( we had been sat downstairs) We went to the front and asked for a drink menu, no problem.   The best part of our whole night was the guy who makes balloon animals.   The service was super slow. The waitress never checked to make sure out meals were correct or to see if we needed anything else.  It took forever to get refills.   She brought us boxes for our leftovers than disappeared, while we waited for our check. After about 10 minutes we went to the front to ask for our check. As we had 2 small children we were ready to leave.  We requested split checks. Our fault for not double checking, however the waitress had jumbled the whole thing. My card was charged, then voided ( will update on that), then charged for the correct amount.   Not once had the waitress apologized for her lousy service. Needless to say, we did not tip. I have never been so dissatisfied with a restaurant. Absolutely will NOT return in this lifetime.   After rating a few days (probably because of the credit card company) the original charge that was voided did not process through."}
{"text":"We LOVE Macayos! It's our family fav spot! Love the excellent service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"We had a decent size party and only one waiter was helping us, he definitely needed help. This was a reserved event that was understaffed."}
{"text":"Terrible service: took 20 minutes to get our drinks and 55 minutes to get our food. No apology or recognition of the poor service. When we finally did get our food it was wrong!"}
{"text":"this was my third time eating food from Macayo's. Two in the restaurant and one to go.  I have enjoyed the food and service my previous visits. This time was a disaster. My food was not prepared as ordered,my husbands carnitas was so dry he couldn't eat it and we were the ones that had to refill our water and ice tea 4 times to the servers 1 time. She acted bored and even asked if the food was pretty good. Pretty good? No, it wasn't. I was there as a guest for my birthday. It was a bummer- if it wasn't for the wonderful company it would have been a horrible evening. Macayo's step up your servers training and back of the house training. The front staff were great."}
{"text":"This place was Great when it first opened. The cealing has suspended vents, plants and decorations that are covered in a thick layer of dirt. So if you have alergies like my 2 young sons its hard to eat there. Food was alot better years ago also. Easy fixes but it hasnt been done as of last week."}
{"text":"Very good food at a good price. Our server was helpful with her suggestions. I had the beef enchilada with rice and refried beans and it was excellent. Our orders arrived very fast and the server returned several times to make sure we had everything we wanted."}
{"text":"Loved it - order a pitcher of Top Shelf Margaritas - you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Very disappointed  with the service, hostess and managers.  We have been dining here for years and have been treated well.  Last night service was sub par, manager was too busy and didn't care.  Hostess sat us down at a booth that was not allowed a high chair, when we specifically told her 3 and a high chair.  The twelve times before that,  they never cared about a high chair being at a booth, but after last night's event we will boycott this restaurant.   Food was cold and manager was rude and unprofessional. He advised me the rule has always been in place but not all managers follow that rule and he knows that.  There are much better establishments that will be getting our business."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a friend recommended it.  The food was good, the service was decent.  The diablo steak and their chimichangas are really good.  However, I didn't liked the fact though that in order for you to get anything off the happy hour menu, you have to sit upstairs in the bar area which I felt was inconvenient and inappropriate taking a small child to."}
{"text":"Great food and the best service. Joseph is a rock star. It is wonderful to know how this company provides for their employees. Keep up the great work Joseph and Macayo's!!"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere were great; however, for the price of the food vs quantity and taste... Not worth it and most likely not return unless brought by a friend again."}
{"text":"Just moved out here and this macayos is as good as all the other ones. Decent margs, great chips n salsa. Decent service and overall cant really go wrong with any of the food. Fajitas are perfect, quesadillas are great. Wife loves the burritos!"}
{"text":"Well tonight my girlfriend and I went back to Macayo's to give them another chance after are last dinner we had with them. This time the server was great on top of her game. Very nice and pleasant in addition to checking on us often.  The food was very good too.  Along with are drinks being good also.  Last but not least the management came to talk to us and tell us how sorry they where for the last time we where at the restaurant .  Which I found to be very big of them.  So glad we gave them a second chance will look forward to returning to dine with them again. Everyone does deserve a second chance. Which they make it right.  Thanks so much :)"}
{"text":"Love this Place.  Granted it's a chain restaurant so the menu is like a mexican Ihop (ihop a favorite comort stop too) but it's my neighborhood stop and the staff is great.  Love the food, and the Chips and Salsa.  And if you haven't had the frozen Margarita's then you gotta stop in and try them.  Upstairs is the Sports bar set up and outside it is set on one of the Dobson Ranch Lakes.  The Stand out appeal of this Macayo's is the Staff, the Lake, the upstairs set and the Margarita's.  Love this place and I'll always go back."}
{"text":"Was convinced by the awesome bartender John to try the Watermelon Jalapeno Margarita and to my surprise is was delicious however a little overpriced for the size.  Atmosphere was fun even had live music in the bar on a Tuesday night.  Had a bowl of red chili with a side of tortillas and it was excellent.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"When my family moved to Surprise 4 years ago I loved Macayo's! It was my favorite place to grab Mexican food in Surprise. Over the past 18 months it has really gone down. On my last visit the server told me she brought me what I ordered and I must have ordered wrong. What?!? Even if I did it would have been nice for the server to attempt to fix the problem.   I will continue to go to Macayo's with friends and sit in the bar for happy hour. As for a place to regularly go to meals with my family, not so much."}
{"text":"We've been to many Macayo's locations and are rarely disappointed, this was no different.  It's always good food but not great food.  We shared a cheese crisp and a shredded beef chimichanga.  The cheese crisp was good but a bit overpriced (almost $7) for a toasted tortilla with a THIN layer of cheese.  The chimicanga was good but was quite a bit smaller than I remember and was $12.  I don't mind paying for good food, and I don't have to be stuffed when I leave to be happy, but it does seem like the value could be adjusted a bit.  On a high note, I'm always happy when a Mexican restaurant carries a variety of Mexican beers.  Yay, Dos Equis lager on draught!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some quick take out on the road.  We called in an order and it was ready within 10 minutes.  Service was quick and easy.  Food was really good! I love that they offer veggies as a side (and they are pretty good too!)"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but service was horrid. Came in a big group and they lost one of our orders, didn't tell us for 45 minutes, when they finally brought our food an hour and a half after we got there, they forgot another persons order. All without a single apology. Then the waitress spilled a pitcher of water on my purse and just said \"sorry\" and walked away. No napkins or anything. It was one of the worst service experiences I've ever received."}
{"text":"They're shredded beef tacos on the mix and match are amazing! Tons of meat! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"M3 and my girlfriend frequent this establishment occasionally.  We always sit in the bar.  There is this one Hispanic lady that bartends  and she always makes our night!  Not only is she friendly and pleasant,  she is very helpful with the menu and ordering new drinks!  I wish I knew her name but we do go a lot on Thursdays and Fridays and she's usually there."}
{"text":"This Macayo's is only a mile or two from my home. Sadly this is the worst of the Macayo's. Still not a bad restaurant but it just does not hold up to the Macayo name. The servers are usually pleasant and the food is never bad. It just isn't great."}
{"text":"First and last time we will ever eat here. First off, we waited 15 minutes to be greeted on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty. That was the first sign we should have left. When we finally got our drinks, my water had an awful smell. We decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but I will not be drinking anything as the smell ruined it for me. The spinach dip came and the waitress left. The dip was presented on a nice plate with a spoon neatly placed on it. Picked up the spoon and it had old food caked all over the handle and the spoon part itself. The small plates on the table also had dried up food on them. We were disgusted. We waited about 20 minutes before the waitress came back so we can show here. She said \"well, I will let my bust girl know\", after scraping the food off with her fingernails. For some reason, we still decided to wait on the food to try it. It took over an hour for the food to come out. We ordered beef and shrimp fajitas , a beef quesadilla, and two sides of rice. The rice was HORRIBLE. It should be on Fear Factor. It smelled of dog food and tasted as if they cooked it with rotten water. Words cannot describe what we tasted. The beef fajitas consisted of 4 strips of meet that tasted like pure salt and nothing else. The rest of the plate had about 5lbs of veggies on it. The guac and lettuce were brown on both plates. We waited for a while to tell our waitress. Waited some more to tell someone else if we can speak to a manager. You guessed it, we waited again only to ask two more people for a manager. When he finally showed, he apologized and did not charge us. Despite how hungry we were, we lost our appetites for the day."}
{"text":"I have to update this to 5 stars for 2 reasons. First, the service has improved greatly the past few months. Props to management. Second, the Tinga Chicken Quesadilla is the bomb. Fresh out of the Scottsdale test kitchen, I was blown away by the freshness and flavor. I hope this becomes a permanent menu item. Great job."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. 20 minitues for a margarita in a empty restaurant on a saturday. I reserved a table for a set time for 15 ppl. One waitress with a bad attitude. I wasnt ready to order when every one else ordered thinking shell come back in a few moments to take my order or refill drinks... nope! Everyone got there food. Still no refill on drinks. Finally took my order and another guest at the table. When i got my food after 45 minutes of ordering in the not so busy place. She trys to explain to the other guest that they kitchen had no shrimp thawed. I had it at this point and asked to speak to a manager. He explained he didnt know what was goin on as he just got there and gave attitude. So i pulled him aside. And talked to him. He gave us 50 percent off our tab. Which still dont make up for a very poor staff attitude. To top ot all off, i ask for to go boxes and follwed the hostest to the bar. And stood there as she was talking to another employee and texting on thier cell phones.. i paid the tab and ran into another manager as i was leaving and explained to him how poor service was and i wouldnt ever return to this location. He shruged it off as he didnt care and said \"that sucks\"....  i didnt get my meal and only offerd one drink from the bar the two hours i was there. Note that they ran out of the liqure most was drinking and they couldnt atleast tell us sooner that the shrimp dish wouldnt be made.."}
{"text":"Was visiting the area....my friend chose this place.  I was going to order the fish tacos, until I asked the waiter what they put on the fish tacos and he was like: \"Uhhhhhhh....\" me: \"Do you put anything on the fish? White sauce? Red sauce? Salsa?\" waiter: \"Oh yeah. Salsa.\"  Uhhhhhh....nevermind. (I guess you can only get good fish tacos in Cali.) So I ordered the carne asada tacos. You can't mess that up, right? WRONG. It was the driest meat I have ever tasted. And then they loaded that dry ass meat with tons of cilantro. ugh. It was sort of like I was eating a cilantro salad with tiny pieces of meat mixed in.  The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because everyone I was with seemed to like their food. If I was basing the stars just on my food it would definitely be a ONE star joint."}
{"text":"My son and I are visiting the Phoenix area for the first time and went to Macayo's for dinner. He had a Baja Barro and I had a poblano chili stuffed with shredded chicken and lightly needed and fried. Portions were huge and hot!!!  Mine was spicy and delicious... the best stuffed poblano I have had. My son was barely able to finish his burrito, and loved it (said he should have ordered it with chicken rather than the shredded beef). Very clean and nice friendly, fast service. Chips and salsa included."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this Macayo's for a very long time. It used to be my favorite place to eat. I have since moved on to Caramba, because it is a much better value. Don't get me wrong. The food here is good, but not as good as it used to be. The prices are really high, as well. We ate here a few nights ago and it was almost $14 for my carnitas plate, and around $12 for my wife's chimichanga. The carnitas were good, but not $14 good. The chimichangas used to be what this place was renowned for. They were huge and relatively inexpensive (around $8). They seem to be more compact now and almost look like they're prepared off-site and then heated up when you order. The chips and salsa that they bring when you sit down are alright (although nothing can compare to Caramba's salsa).   There are some good reasons to eat here. The service is usually really good. The waiter was really attentive when we were there and kept my drink filled the whole time. They are one of the few places that still take reservations. They have a cool room with stars that the kids like sitting in.  We'll definitely eat here again, but I wish that it was a place I could rave about like I used to."}
{"text":"Hello,   I noticed a reply on my rating. I sent an email to the address they provided me and received an email saying I was restricted. If you wouldn't mind contacting me, my email is nat.allshouse@gmail.com"}
{"text":"My family and I went there recently for dinner as we haven't been to Macayos in a while. Got there around 5:30pm and had to put our name in. After about 5 minutes we were seated in a fairly empty dining area. We were given more than 20 minutes to look over our menus and ended up leaving without being served chips, salsa, water, or even being approached by the non-existent wait staff. Other reviews talk of how bad the food has become, so maybe we dodged a bullet. Took our business elsewhere because it was apparent that Macayos didn't want/need our business that evening."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We were quick to be seated, because it was super slow. We opted to sit in the bar area based off hostess recommendation, terrible idea. Our server took over ten minutes to get our drinks, and another almost ten minutes to to bring them over, didn't even taste the strawberry in margarita. Food was alright, a little over cooked. Upset about the terrible service, I'd understand if it was busy, but with all your employees standing around you think you would be a little quicker. I used to love this place, not anymore. Next time valley Luna. And salty rice, no thanks."}
{"text":"Alejandro wasn't our server but absolutely the reason this place gets a 5 star review! He made sure we were well taken care of when our server was no where to be found and made sure to check with us at the end of the night! Also loved the manager checked on us too! As a server that really makes a difference! Great food, outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I worked here for a total of 3 weeks and quit due to the abusive leadership of the managers. I gladly picked up my last check from them yesterday and filed a complaint with the head of HR at the corporate office. I hope at some point they learn that praise instead of criticism is much more effective in a workplace. Also, purposely overwhelming servers as well as treating them like crap and yelling at them for things out of there control is NOT okay. I was the second server in 3 days to lock them selves in the bathroom to cry their eyes out because of how mistreated they were. I will never step foot in this building again."}
{"text":"So.... I'm kind of a foodie/snob....grew up eating killer Tex-mex and authentic Mexican food. NEVER been to Phoenix but needed a good fix before the show at AK-Chin Pavilion. WOW!!! Best fix ever! Had the chicken poblano( relleno). Excellent! Hubby had carnitas enchiladas. Very good! Huge portions, great margaritas and nice selection of tequila. Definitely come here!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Where to start? In Tucson, Macayo's is fabulous.  Here, not so much.  The special tonight must have been shredded beef, because regardless of my husband ordering a chicken burro, and me ordering two ground beef tacos, we both got it.  Not only that, but my side of soup was warm, not even hot enough to need to be blown on.  Speaking of hot, the burro wasn't that either.  There was cheese, still in a clump, and nowhere near melted.  The plate was the only thing served hot.  Super.  My husband also ordered water with lime.  First time, small lime, second time, nothing.  Is it really that hard to remember a piece of fruit to make your tap water taste better?  Sadly, only about 1 time out of every 10 do we ever get decent service where we actually get attention as paying customers, and not forgotten regardless of how busy they are.  They sure were attentive to that manager still wearing his name badge that was sitting behind us though.  Thumbs down Macayo's."}
{"text":"Waiter was very nice gave us a free dip.  Decor is nice but looks like ur at the rain forest cafe lol. Im giving it 3 stars cuz the food was okey.. I wasnt really impressed. I prob wont go back."}
{"text":"My friends (who are from out of town) and myself came in for lunch. Our server Richard went over the menu with my friends and I and suggested some lunch favorites. We ordered the fajitas and a burrito topped off with the Baja sauce. My friends and I were so impressed with Richards professionalism and knowledge of the menu, he made us feel at home. I will continue to eat at this location, we love the food and people!"}
{"text":"Went with my kids last night for Taco Wednesday when shredded beef tacos are 99 cents. When the bill came, it was wrong but I didn't check it.  Just paid it.  Later saw the error and went back today.  The Director of Operations, Jeff, wiped out the whole bill.  What a nice guy.  Super tacos and made the bill right."}
{"text":"Macayo's is a valley classic. Best Mexican food in Phoenix! The Baja sauce is to die for and should be on every plate."}
{"text":"Went to this location with my husband for the first time tonight. The food was delicious, we love the Baja sauce!! The staff was very helpful. Our waitress Bonnie did a great job and took the time to answer our questions about the macayos on Central. We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Such a pretty atmosphere and food was absolutely delicious. Had a drink that was delicious as well. The only thing I was disappointed about was our appetizer coming after our food arrived. When we first sat down we had a waitress and then for some reason we had another waitress. Then ordered an appetizer. Waited for it and ordered our entree in the meantime. Dinner came out and then I asked the waitress we are waiting on the app still. She said ok be right back. At that point I'm not going to eat it. My food is already out. After that she never came to check on us. Maybe once. Didn't ask if we need any thing else. Also no manager came to the table to apologize for her mess up! Seemed like she was preoccupied with other tables but honestly it wasn't that busy when we were in. Overall food was so amazing and so was the atmosphere. But as far as the waitstaff you need to make sure they are more attentive to their tables."}
{"text":"We go here every now and again for the green corn tamales with baja sauce, ssssoooo good and tasty!  Prices are a lil' high, but the majority of the food is good.  They used to have a free buffet happy hour which was really good, but have since done away with it.  I ordered the mai mai plate one time, but sent it back cause it was disgusting and for 14 bucks, I expected food to be on that plate!  Anyhow, not too bad of a place, but I have heard that other locations are a lot better..."}
{"text":"We ordered some of their platters for a work function. Pretty standard Mexican food. Decent quality and freshly made. They also deliver which is awesome. Worth a try if you're trying to feed a lot of people Mexican for a decent price. $8-9 per person. Baja sauce was good."}
{"text":"We usually go to this location for \"Mexican\" food. It's suitable, we have been finding a foot Tex-Mex place and yet to do so. The chips and salsa seem pretty good. They queso however seemed to me like they used velveeta or something along the lines. The Baja sauce is good to me, I usually order a side to go with something. My kid likes dipping his quesadilla in it. I usually don't order alcoholic drinks here, I have before and wasn't very impressed. They seem to have good specials though if you not to worried about have drinks done a certain way. I would go again, I have recommended it to people who were looking for a quick place to go but not something very fancy, nor would I say authentic."}
{"text":"great waiters, and fun for kids. My daughter picks Macayo's over even Mc donolds on almost a weekly basis."}
{"text":"We came in to get dinner after eating here before. I have to say though this time the service was horrible the waiter never came by the table we had to ask somebody else to take our order the food was burnt it was just very unsatisfactory experience don't know if we'll come back"}
{"text":"We have been going to Macayos for many years.  Food has been ok to good for most of that time, but I was pleasantly surprised on this trip.  We ordered one of the specials that came with taquitos as appetizers.  They were great!  I had steak fajitas which arrived sizzling hot and were perfectly made.  The service started out a little slow, but once they got their act together, our waitress was very attentive.  We'll definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"My family and I where excited to try  Macayos Surprise Az. Out for some Mexican food for my wife's 45 th birthday . We decided to do take out and used the Macayos app and ordered online , when  we showed up to pick up our order sadly our order was not only not ready but they said they had not even received the order? I showed them our order and they went to there iPad to look for it , shockingly it was there!! You would think they would apologize and make it rite. Well the girls working the front desk acted unfazed and where unapologetic they called there manager who then blamed it on there new Grubhub app. Still no apology.. He finally said we will get it made and give me $20 off. He made me feel like he was doing me a favor . I told him that was not acceptable and that I wanted the entire bill comped. He said he would have to run that through his corporate office this was a $60.38 bill. I said okay and an hour after our order was suppose to be ready I finally received it , one of the young girls brought it out to our car and reassured us it was all there and still No Apology. Finally we got home and shockingly we where missing two items Spanish Rice & Queso dip. Here I am five days later still no refund and no apology. I will never go to Macayos Surprise az. EVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat. The chips and salsa were so good... The service and food was all just incredible!"}
{"text":"Good food and cute company :) lets first start off by saying that it took longer than 5 minutes to be sat. It was not packed and we had been noticed twice. While the food was adequate and our two alcoholic beverages were very good there was just one last thing that got me. We ordered a shot of tequila and it tasted watered down or not quite right. If it weren't for the adorable birds outside and my bf, there would be only 1 star."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to eat at Macayos every week but the service and food has gone down hill so quickly, especially at this location! We stopped eating there for 5-6 months. A few days ago we decided to give it one more try. Ernesto was our server and oh my goodness he was fantastic. He was prompt in service. Carried great conversation and really took care of us. 1 star for Macayos overall satisfaction. 5 stars for Ernesto. We will only be back when he is working from now on. There isn't much of a variety of restaurants on the west side so what we do have, I expect to be high quality. The food is too greasy and don't as authentic as it used to be. Keep up the great service and we might stick around long enough to see a change in the overall restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all those people who have given them 4-5 stars rating, We went in there for the 1st time, from San Diego where they know how to make Mexican Food. We waited 43 mins. before being waited on and served. The food was less then mediocre at best, and the service is below average. 1st and last time there."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Watery salsa, no queso. What Mexican restaurant doesn't have queso?!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had the most excellent margarita in a long time ! Service was great as well as the food !!! We'll definitely be coming back for more !!"}
{"text":"$2 FOR A TABLESPOON OF GUAC.?????  Four of us went to Macayos for dinner last Friday.  The $1.65 marg. were great. The $6.50 Chimi dinner was also good.  The chips and several varieties of Salsa were hot and fresh.  Whats the problem???  The sneeky way the servers get you to spend an extra $2.00 for the Guac.  They don't even mention a charge when they offer it to you.  It's like asking do you want salsa or cheese with your tacos.  The markup on a tablespoon of Guac. must be at least 300%.  I consider this a deceptive practice and share it with you only as a warning.  Otherwise the restaurant is fine. In this day and time, I personally don't have an extra $2 in my pocket to throw away."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. The menu has a variety of choices and the food is great. The happy hour is one of the best. The staff was friendly, professional and wanted to please. Loved the view of the water. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could choose no stars for the service received last night I would! My parents went to dinner last night with friends and family. I'm also in the industry so I was working. They took my one year old son with them. They ordered his food right away and then every one else ordered 20 minutes later. His food came out at the same time as theirs and was disgusting like it sat in the window forever! Then the incompetent server sets a plate of sizzling hot fajitas in front of my one year old!!! Seriously?! Also set refills and appetizer plates in front of him through the night as well. Half the food was cold or bland and the proportions were off. We've been here many times as a family and have never had any problems and the food is great. There is usually 10 or more of us that comes in. We will NEVER come back after this. Like I said I'm in the industry too. You never ever set things in front of children. Especially hot plates! Wow."}
{"text":"First, the waitress seemed less than pleased to be working at Macayo's. She didn't smile when she greeted us. Then, she didn't know if they could use the silver tequila in their margarita special in place of the reposado tequila that was in the on-table advertisement. (I'm a silver tequila fan, and I don't like gold, reposado, or añejo). She wrote down my question, kind of rolled her eyes, went away, and came back. She said, \"all we have is the 'reposado brand'\". If you work in a \"Mexican\" restaurant, supposedly serving Margaritas, shouldn't you know the difference between different types of tequila? Shouldn't you know that reposado is a type of tequila, not a brand, like lager or amber are kinds of beer and Dos Equis and Miller are brands of beer? I don't drink beer, and I know the difference. And certainly, if I served beer for a living, I'd make SURE to know the difference between the types beer offered. Then, as my husband and I continued to look at the menu, the waitress came back 2-3 times asking if we were ready to order. We still had our menus open and our heads down reading them. That should tell waitstaff that we're still deciding. She wasn't nice about it; it felt like she was rushing us. As for the food: It was just not good. I thought Macayo's was supposed to serve \"authentic\" Mexican food. That's what their ads say. Any time there's a chain serving Mexican food, it becomes mass produced and the quality suffers. The rice was dry, and you could tell it had been sitting in a huge pot for most of the day or longer. My cheese enchilada was boring, rubbery and tasteless. My husband said very similar things about his food. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We used to go to Macayo's at least 2 times a month, but since moving to a different area of the Valley, we have been going to different places when we went out to eat. Today we decided to go back...and were very disappointed. While the staff was friendly and helpful as usual, the food was a disappointment...it was bland, not very warm, and didn't live up to their previous standards. The menus we were given had dried food on them, the booth seats throughout were cracked and parched with tape, and the table tops were sticky. The interior is just dated, dusty and old looking. And restrooms....! While the toilets appeared clean, the walls and stalls looked like they had NEVER been cleaned-- streaks and drips of 'something' all over them.  Needless to say, the ENTIRE place needs a massive makeover and cleaning. I think others feel the same because there were only 3 other tables of people when we were there when they are usually 2/3 full. Doesn't look like we'll be going back unless they clean up their act!"}
{"text":"Met my sister after work for a few drinks. We sat at the bar. The bartender Rosalie, was attentive, professional and on point. She sure was busy as there was a large group outdoors, but she still was able to service us when needed. We'd go back knowing she'd be there. We had a cheese crisp, nothing fancy, but it sure did go well with their salsa."}
{"text":"Macayo's has gone down hill over the years, quality of food doesnt seam to be the same. Happy Hour is good along with the chips and salsa.   Howere this can be a good place to go with a large family."}
{"text":"Good beer good food love this location. Baja sauce is awesome"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Waited more than 15 mins to be seated even though our table was ready.  Hostess didn't bother to try to seat us until we asked how much longer.  Sat down, waited more than than 20 mins with no one taking our drink orders.  Asked the busboy if he could find our waitress, which he really tried.  One waitress said she didn't know and the other just blew him off, Unbelievable!  We decided to walk out but I made sure to tell the manager.  In his defense he did try to offer us appetizers and he did apologize but his wait staff needs some lessons in customer service."}
{"text":"Salsa has now become watered down tomato juice with huge tomato chucks and pieces of white something not an onion to be seen or anything else.  I've been a customer since 1976 and was always satisfied but something has changed for the worse, especially this year. 12/26/16 was most likely the last time I eat there.  I can't imagine how the long term people that are being fired feel and just before Christmas.  New CEO is a thumbs down."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  I ordered a lemonade and a burrito.  Waitress took 5 minutes to grasp I wanted lemonade and not pink lemonade, then couldn't tell me if they had Corona or Dos Equis (I couldn't think of a simpler beer request or I would have made it).  They brought me the wrong food twice and then everyone I was with was done eating, so I never did get my food.  I ended up driving thru Filbertos on the way home for my birthday dinner.  They were rude, inattentive, and incompetent.  I wouldn't recommend anyone go here for any reason.  There are better Mexican restaurants nearby like Arribas or Raul & Theresa's.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"Had a happy hour party tonight with 20 people. Super delicious food! Chimichangas, taquitos, cheese crisp, and tamales were super yummy. Alex was an amazing server! Great atmosphere! The employees were so accommodating and polite. Again, thank you Alex you were awesome! Someone give that girl a raise."}
{"text":"OMG this was the best customer service I received in a long time.  My order was wonderful.  We received our food quickly and it was nice and hot. Very yummy too.  I would definitely return and recommend them to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. Food and service were great. The only reason I am giving only three stars is because they are understaffed. We waited up front for about five minutes as no one was managing the hostess station. Finally getting a busboys attention, we were seated."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I was really hoping for more. Chips and salsa were good. Service was ok, I will try again and hope that next time will be better."}
{"text":"Awesome bartendar service from Mike! Very attentive & customer service orientated.  We come back to see him and the rest of the staff!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week and as usual was pleased with the food, service and cost of my visit.  Nothing beats the chips and salsa they put in front of you minutes after arriving followed by a margarita .... never disappointed and will always return !!"}
{"text":"Good mexican food, rice and beans taste very traditional.  I ordered the fish tacos, a little afraid that the fish would taste like freezer but it didnt, it was very fresh and delicious!!  Service is always good, they refill your drinks at the right time and bring more chips before the basket is empty.  THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE is that the salsa is HORRIBLE, worst salsa I have ever had!!!! Out of a can, mixed with old salsa and who knows what else!! I had to tell the lady to change the salsa for a different one because I was not enjoying my chips.  Other than that, food is delicious!!!!  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Food is bleh but I can live with that.   What I can't live with is an epic failure in customer service.   From a server who can't remember to bring napkins to a bartender calling a nearly 50 year old woman \"honey\".  We ordered margaritas in the special pink Cha Cha mugs.  We were brought yellow mugs with the excuse that they had to search for the pink.  Ok then, we get to keep the yellows too?  Oh no, don't forget to leave  those behind... we'll wrap the pink for you.  Ok.  Next,  bar ran out of happy hour sized glasses, so the rest of our party got 1/2 filled regular sized glasses.  Seriously?   Complaint to manager who came to us and asked how we were doing fell on deaf ears.  At end of meal server brought our wrapped mugs and reminded us to leave behind used mugs.  Kind of rude.  Just not a pleasant experience.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The 5 of us eat here nearly every friday evening. Great way to relax after a long week. Usually gets busy here around 6pm but worth the wait. Most times less than 20 minutes.  The strawberry smoothies are the favorites of the kids and the margaritas rock!"}
{"text":"Hi Macayo's... we've been back a few times since. Luckily I love the grilled chicken tacos and the portion is enough for dinner and a small lunch the next day. I sub out the green stuff that comes on the side for your pico. The pico de gallo is soooo good. I love the cucumber in it and actually now add cucumber to mine that I make at home. But still, I hate to tell you, the salsa still lacks flavor. It tastes like stewed tomatoes are just dumped into a bowl. Season season season it up!! Garlic, onion, salt, pepper, some jalapenos (but not too many). Oh and one more note, seriously, 12 french fries as a side for kids? C'mon, don't be scared, throw like 10 extra on there. We all know mac & cheese and fries cost like next to nothing to make."}
{"text":"The restaurant wasn't that busy Sunday a little after 6pm. We didn't get our food until 7pm. Then we waited for boxes for our food. We were there for almost 2 hours. Our server was nice but very worked. We ordered 3 fiesta salads which were huge. The problem was the steak was cold and the meat tough. Cute place for kids. Need more servers. The floor was littered with food and chips."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago and was very disappointed in the cleanliness, staff and ambiance. I mean what bar serves shots in small glasses vs shot glasses. My friend and I were discussing when a young man name Jeff asked how things were, he assured us if we come back in few weeks we would see a difference. Jeff must of been the manager cause the employees were really moving once he arrived. I am happy to report I returned for dinner and what a difference... We were greeted, the bar area was clean and I received my shot in a shot glass... I can't wait to see the other changes that are made, since the change in leadership is already evident."}
{"text":"Macayos used to be a go to favorite but with ask the menu changes it tastes they are raising the prices and lowering the quality of food, the service has never been great,  probably will choose a different mexican restaurant from now on:/"}
{"text":"I guess you guys agree with me, but if this place isn't good why are they ALWAYS packed?! I'm so confused. And during my 8 years of living in AZ people around me all seemed to love Macayo's, another thing I don't get, because I think the food is nasty. It's inauthentic and makes you feel like crap after you eat it.  I like the idea of the restaurant with all the bright colors and the cool patio, but the place is actually really dirty. Now they don't even have taco salads anymore! What kind of Mexican restaurant gets rid of their taco shells??  If you're looking for Mexican food go up the road to Si Senor, that place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Macayo's knows how to make a Chimichanga!  It's the only thing I get there and they are delicious! The atmosphere is wonderfully bright and open,and the staff is friendly.  The Ahwatukee location is where we usually go because it is convenient to our home. I don't like when a host sits everyone together in a section when there is a whole restaurant with open tables. If you don't have enough servers to cover the whole restaurant, then hire some.  The other thing that was a total turnoff was the amount of Flys buzzing around. We spent the whole meal swatting at a few annoying pests.  I don't know if they might need to move the dumpsters or keep doors closed, but something needs to be done.  I hope the next time we decide to go back this will be taken care of."}
{"text":"While service was decent, the food left much to be desired. We stopped in for a quick beer and appetizers. The chicken quesadilla should be renamed the cheese sog.  It was bad. The tiny amount of meat was soggy and smothered in cheese nestled between a barely cooked tortilla. You want sour cream with that? It'll cost you a $1.29."}
{"text":"Good food but make sure your take out order is correct before leaving. Half the time my take out order is wrong."}
{"text":"Best salsa in AZ!  And the chicken baja burrito is indescribable!  I'm a native and Macayo's is top 5 in the state."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Mexican food and drink, Filled the bill and more"}
{"text":"If you like AUTHENTIC Mexican food, don't bother.  If you don't know the difference you'll probably be ok.  My feeling is that it is totally \"sanitized\" with little to no soul.  It's overpriced as well."}
{"text":"First, the nearly empty restaurant at 4 pm prompted the hostess to make us wait 10 minutes for a booth.  There were tons of empty places.  High handed is how we read it.  Next, we had an average Mexican meal followed by dessert.  The person with me could not get flan since they were still making it so another dessert was done instead.  The bill came and we were charged for 3 desserts not two.  We pointed out the problem and the server was not surprised.  She just took the bill and redid it the right way.  It seemed practiced.  We will not be going back for a long time.  The whole experience left us wanting a new Mexican restaurant who wanted our business."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since it opened, usually get take out, usually spend $40-$50+. Until recently we've always been satisfied with portions and taste, one thing we've always loved is their Spinach Con Queso, in our opinion the best around and was worth going to Macayos just for that. Was a time when the $7.95 bowl was a Styrofoam container, not sure of size, maybe a pint....in any event, that container was filled to the top, almost bursting out and you'd get a big bag of fresh tortilla chips, two bags with a big order of food. For years that is how it was for take out.  The last few times we've not been 100% happy with this or that but overlooked it and went back. For instance the food just didn't taste like it used to, or the quantity of food wasn't what it once was. On a takeout order with 2 dinners, 2 ala carte burritos, order of Red Corn Chicken Taquitos and a bowl of Spinach Con Queso we get a couple handfuls of chips and the 'bowl' of Spinach Con Queso that was filled 1.5\" from top. The Con Queso shortage is really what made us take notice, like it said - favorite dish.  This last visit, on my birthday no less was the last straw. Another shortage, the Spinach Con Queso, the 'bowl' was about half full +/- and because the containers are smaller at the bottom, bigger at the top it was really a lot less than half full.   My wife noticed when she picked it up but since she didn't want to get a bowl full of spit, she didn't send it back. I did however go to the website and email them using their comment form, which says if they are going to get back to you it would be in a day or two. I haven't heard anything and at this point don't expect to. So if a representative from Macayo's want's me to 'reach out to them', be aware I've already tried and apparently no one really cares about customers, which by the number of recent complaints on Yelp now seems obvious.  Being in the Valley of the Sun, the choices for Mexican food are limitless - do yourself a favor, find a real family owned restaurant and enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband  and I went in yesterday for some mexican food we both got the chimichunga with rice lunch special. it was alright. we got home and got instantly sick. we go food poisoning from this place i recommend going to aho al's or a different resturant. worst experience ever. Macayos is not as good as i remembered."}
{"text":"Alayna was and is a wonderful server, she was always there with refills and a pleasure to have. She was great and helpful, food was wonderful as always and Alayna the best part of it.  Thanks"}
{"text":"The food is adequate. The restaurant is nice and good for groups. I don't care for it though and have a hard time justifying going here when you can easily get better Mexican American food elsewhere for the same price"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Macayo's for almost 30 years. We enjoy it every time we go, which is several times a month. In my opinion they have the best salsa in town. Last night I chose beef fajitas. They were fantastic. My husband almost always chooses the mini chimichangas. The ambience is fun and the waiters are kind and personable."}
{"text":"Ordered Tortilla soups to go.  Was told at pick up that they never have spoons. Why serve soup to go and not have spoons to go?  I cant tell you. Ended up over at Circle K raiding the Coffee section for spoons. Food was good but wont be back because of that. Petty on my part? Maybe...Just the truth though."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I wouldn't say its authentic Mexican food but it is still great tasting food."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come ever since I moved here  and let me tell you the people were nice then always stop by to check on us every 5 minutes but after a while it got annoying, it was good but it was not great that I won't go back there ever"}
{"text":"Always great food!!!!! Not expensive if you don't order drinks... clean, friendly, mostly really good service, there are a couple of servers who act like they don\"t want to be there, so my tip reflects that... other than that, really good!!!!! My wife and I go at least once a week..... have a nice day..."}
{"text":"the food - acceptable. The service - INEPT from start to finish. We only went here because The Burrito Company is closed Sunday evenings. Mistake!"}
{"text":"I visited Macayo's with a friend last night before a concert. The food was wonderful (love the half-price appetizer happy hour!) and we had great service. I was a little disappointed at the beer selection for happy hour. No Dos Equis Amber on draft but you have Corona Light? Bummer!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this location with my boyfriend. The food was fine but we were really disappointed with the service. Worst waiter EVER! He looked very young and seemed like it was the first time he'd ever waited tables. We sat down, 10 mins later ordered drinks, 10 mins later got the drinks & ordered food, then about 15-20 mins later we got the food. The waiter dropped our tortillas on the floor. Everything was really shaky and drinks spilled over as they were served. It took about 10 mins to replace the dropped tortillas. The waiter kept apologizing to our table and all the tables around us. At one point we overheard him say to other guests \"oops, I definitely just burned myself.\" In sum, it was a real shit show. I blame the restaurant management for employing that individual as a waiter without any training or experience."}
{"text":"Great service by Sonny! Quick and personable. Nice experience at the Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night and there was a pretty long wait. When we walked in the lady who appeared to be the hostesses asked how many there were two of us she said it would be just a minute. Well that minute turned into 15 mins. Ok so we sit down and got a waitress who was obviously overwhelmed. She didn't know who was sat first. We told her to take care of the other couple who was sitting next to us. She came back and got our drink order. We were ready to order by then but she didn't ask until after she brought our drinks. Now all if those things aren't necessarily horrible, but that and this made it a bad experience.  She came back to get our food order.  I ordered a cheese enchilada with GREEN saunce no onions. And my boyfriend ordered the sampler platter with NO GUACAMOLE.  Since he is VERY allergic which he told her. So of course we were upset when we received our food. I received a cheese enchilada with RED sauce that tasted old and not good. And my boyfriends food had guacamole.  She dropped iff our food quickly and when she came back and we told her, she said she told them no guacamole and asked if she could take just the item's with it in and remake them.  So she did that but when he got them back they were still cold. When it came to my order she again said I told them green sauce. She said she wrote it down correctly and that I could see her ticket. I don't care if you wrote it down correctly. It obviously wasn't right so why would you bring it? I was starving and we had to pick up our kid so I didn't have mine remade. But the food was just awful. When she came to give us the bill she told us the manger (who we never spoke to nor did they come to apologize) gave us 20% off???  No one apologize for what happened just made excuses. We quickly left and we will be extremely reluctant to return. We have been here multiple times and it's never been bad.  I understand somethings but the way things were handled were horrible"}
{"text":"I am sitting here after our meal was served. The food was terrible at best. My husband ordered a burrito with Baja sauce, a taco and a side of tortilla soup. The burrito was cold and the Baja sauce was curdled!!!! I ordered two cheese enchiladas and a side of rice. The rice was hard and overcooked. It stuck together in a large piece when I dug my fork into it. The enchiladas were cold and the flavor was off. I always see this place filled with people. My husband and I were very disappointed. For 12+ a meal... we expected some sort of quality. Please, do not come here!!!  Please! Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"This is an Arizona standard. They have many locations throughout the valley. Great place for good casual Mexican with your family. Very Catina looking interior decor, somewhat commercialized. Not your hole in the wall place. I eat here with my mom, dad and husband every time I'm back home. Good service, very neighbor friendly...prob. because I always run into someone from high school.   Great for groups too (I had my rehearsal dinner at the Ahwatukee location.)"}
{"text":"The food is basic and the service is not good.  The waiter did not tell us what food they were out of and the kitchen just replaced that food with something different or nothing at all.  It took a long time to get drinks and chips refilled.  We had no response to our complaints about the food.  Overall, you can get this kind of food anywhere, even the grocery store."}
{"text":"We ate at Macayo's three times while in Surprise.  Their food is tasty, not overly spiced (although personally we could stand a bit more \"heat\").  Our service has been attentive and our orders accurate (no dairy, as requested).  No problems whatsoever, just solid good food and service.  As a bonus, if you're a senior, you can join their senior club (free) and get 20% off most entrees (except lunch specials and alcohol)."}
{"text":"This place just sucks the service is not good at all! The chips were very good but the salsa was just watered down ketchup with very little tomatoes, peppers or cilantro. I had the grilled tacos and all I got was tortillas and a little bit of meat for $11. Wife ordered some nacho dish $9 and was the size of a cereal bowl.  I have been driving by here for years and wish I would have keep driving by today!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Macayo's food, and have to admit it is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I especially love this location.    They serve the best Margarita's, nice and strong!  They have their own sweet & sour mix, which I believe is the secret.  The sunset margarita is a must try.    Favorite foods: mini chimis, red corn taquitos and green corn tamale w/baja sauce. Oh and lots of chips & salsa!  They also have a very large patio with live music on Thursday's until 9pm.  The service is good and the bartenders are especially friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this Macayo's a few times and every time it has been very disappointing. Today will be the last time I visit this restaurant.   The service here is always slow and their attentiveness to the customer is non-existent.   Today I had to send my margarita back two times because it was horrible and nothing more than crushed ice. The cheese crisp came out (after a 30 minute wait) over cooked and tasting like cardboard.   I am being generous by giving them one star."}
{"text":"Our server Hope was aweful had to keep asking for items served our food and left us with no silverware. The margaritas were so watered down ordered shrimp enchiladas and maybe 2 cut up shrimp in each rice tasted funny this place has gone down hill since I came back in 2004 yuk beware"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  The Appetizers came with the meal, instead of before.  We waited a long time for the meal.  No refills on drinks (two of us had soda that should have been refilled).  Requested extra napkins and never got them.  Could see our server standing and chatting with other employees.  Poor customer service.   Have had better service elsewhere. In their defense they did give us credit on our bill towards the appetizers and the food was good, but the place wasn't that busy to have such bad service."}
{"text":"Our family has gone to the restaurant for many years but until service improves we will not go back. Whether eat in our take wait time is poor. Take out promised in 30 minutes took 60 and food was cold and dry. In restaurant it was only half full but wait just to get water and chips 20 minutes. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years. A few weeks ago my aunt went in to hold a table for us and the hostess was extremely rude. She advised us that we were in America and we should speak English. I'm sorry but 1) you're a MEXICAN restaurant. 2) you are BLASTING Mexican music and 3) half of the staff always speaks Spanish (like I said, I've been coming for years). We asked to speak to the manager and he pretended not to speak Spanish when a few moments later we saw him speaking with someone in Spanish. All I have to say at this point is that we won't be coming back. I'm an American citizen, we deserve the same respect any other customer gets whatever language we are speaking."}
{"text":"It took well over 30 minutes for our party to just get drinks from the bar.  The waiter had no concept of personal space and actually thought it was a good idea to poke my father and joke about it after he knew we were annoyed.  Then we asked for a manager and -get this - he says \"I am the manager.\"  I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank you to the team today for great personalized service from our initial greeting, to our waitress, Lorena, to the manger Victoria who stopped by to check in on the meal and us at the end. Overall the meal for the 3 of us was very enjoyable.  Just a couple of easy fixable items so it was a nice evening out.  I must state that the shrimp fajitas were hot, fresh and liked the new plating.  I also appreciate this extra effort as in the past not always so great. Hopefully a 5 star experience to come in the future."}
{"text":"Ernesto was the best bar tender that I've had at this location so far!! Love macayos and service is ok for the most part but Ernesto really gave a good impression in the bar area! He was always there right when I need anything and very respectful."}
{"text":"We - 11 of us with a reservation - went there Friday 2/25/2011 for dinner.  Had to wait over an hour, many additional chips and salsa, after we were served for the dinners to be served.  The wait staff was not the problem, management should have been living in the kitchen getting the orders out.  Fajitas were tasteless. Last time we go there and we have been there before."}
{"text":"Let's start with Jill the Hostess. Oh Jill, Jill, Jill. You have much to learn young padawan. We walked up to the hostess stand and Jill stated it would be 45 mins (it was Cinco de Mayo). We understood but asked if we could sit in the bar or patio, order drinks, then get a table when our name was called.  She said, and I quote,\" you will be taking up space, they have sections out there.\" #CustomerService! #Malarkey! BTW: Here over all attitude outside of that quote was mediocre at best.   Our experience progressed in a positive direction following our encounter with Jill.  Our server Erin was very friendly, had information about menu items, and great suggests for food/drink. She was honestly and enjoyable person to have around. Food/Drinks were good but the drinks were a bit pricey. Not terrible but shave $2 off a $10 Margarita you'd be in the right place. ;).  Thanks Erin!  We did see some issues other groups had that did not affect our experience though.  Here they are: - 1 group left due to a coupon issue which honestly the customer was right on. - Multiples time the servers came out to the patio not knowing what table the food went to and auctioned it off similar to bingo. B6, who has B6?Enchiladas, who had Cheese Enchiladas? Going once, twice...then, before you could look up, they would just be gone like Houdini. It was crazy!  Overall, Erin saved the experience here. Good food/drinks and a great waitress made the difference.  Overall, not to shabby Macayo's. You may want to consider reintroducing some bad apples to unemployment though. Hint Hint ;)"}
{"text":"Love!!! Love!!! Love Macayos!! Never a bad experience and the food is always amazing. The chips and salsa are always sooo good!! Best place evaaaa! Will always be my fave"}
{"text":"First time to Macayo's it's the typical Americanized  Mexican restaurant the food is Bland and very pricey I paid $5 for guacamole and sour cream they don't even have a hot sauce all they have is mild sauce and I had to ask twice there weren't that many people in the restaurant the couple behind us didn't even get their food. We paid $18 for two margaritas that were served in a small glass, I don't think I will ever go back there again the only reason I went I saw the commercials on TV I figured I'd give it a shot not very impressive."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to macayo's last night for dinner.  We went to the bar and sat down.  10 minutes later we still were not waited on.  There were 3 bartenders behind the bar.  They just totally ignored us. We then decided to eat in the dinning area.  Told the waitress what happened and all she said was it will be a few minutes.  We sat there for another 10 minutes.  Not many people waiting either. We decided to leave.  We won't be back.  Gave up and decided to eat Greek food!"}
{"text":"Well we had one great time, and one horrible time... I really need to go once more to do a proper review.  The drinks are priced well and so is the food. Happy hour was really great...  They need to update their bar and tvs. Do not go here to watch anything or to get a selection of beer/alcohol"}
{"text":"I got engaged after eating at Macayo's many, many, many moons ago (hubbie figured a fancy night out would tip his hand).  I used to dine at this location nearly every Friday in the mid 90s when I started at Intel.  Since then, I have been underwhelmed each time I have visited.  Last visit:  toilet had overflowed in the women's bathroom, living one stall availalble for an 'ick' experience.  Couple that with the out-dated, disheleved looking front lobby and I washed my hands of an old stand-by.  Adios Macayo's."}
{"text":"I want it to be known this review is for this location only! I ordered the baja chimi with my husband & when it came out it had a teaspoonfull of baja sauce & a ton of red sauce I told the waitress oh im sorry I wanted only baja sauce to which she said oh ok it comes this way I said ok well at the 59th & bell location theyve always made it only baja sauce, she argues for a minute to which I say can I please just have it remade with ony baja sauce? ok she says & leaves comes back with A lead server who starts to say the same thing to me maybe ive been ordering the burro for the last 10 years, umm noo the chimi is deep fried the burro is not , then she tells me oh they probably just knew knew how you wanted it cause you went there I said maybe it doesnt really matter to me why at this point I point to the plate the lady has brought back that still has the red sauce on it but now with more baja sauce & say like I told my waitress already I just want it remade with ONLY baja sauce at this point its been a good 35 mins we were there & guess what then the waitress comes out with a manager who begins to tell me that the baja chimichanga comes with the red sauce & baja sauce & I tell him the same thing I just wanted it remade with ONLY baja I get how it comes so he starts telling me about the burro I FINALLY raise my voice over his that had been talking over me for a good 5 minutes & say ya know what just fricking cancel the damn order & bring the check! I will NEVER go here again & thats saying alot since it is OUR family go to spot my husband & I met in a macayos  we had macayos food for our wedding reception  & we celebrate each & every special occasion there before now. The manager did say dont worry about the soda my husband had ordered & we even still gave the waitress a 5 when we left its a job & she did try to have it remade. This location should focus on trying to listen to a customer instead of arguing, I heard them the 10 times plus they said how it was made & everytime said ok I understand that can I just have it remade with no red sauce please.EDIT Oh I forgot to mention by the time that was all done we had to go home & make our own food because the backup places we tried were all closed after the 45 plus minutes not to get our food!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here a week ago, a bubbly and cheerful young lady server who made us feel special and who checked on us several times. Our party of four were impressed with our menu choices all of which were attractively plated and very tasty. The beers were ice cold and served with cold glasses.  One week later my wife and I returned with our son who was visiting from out of state. They suggested that we sit on the patio which turned out to be rather drab and the chairs were very uncomfortable. We then were seated in the dining room, ironically the same booth as the week before.  A server stopped immediately and asked if we were ready to order....we had not even opened our menus yet. My wife and son ordered beer which were brought with only one glass. My son requested a second glass which seemed to annoy her and it took several minutes for her to return with it. I had ordered a soda which she forgot so another wait while she retrieved that!  Our menu choices were served very quickly and each of us were very pleased with them.  But the server never returned to see if everything was all right, never asked if we wanted more beer or soda and did not suggest a dessert.   How different our impressions were of this restaurant on our second visit."}
{"text":"Food is terrible, generic and tasteless. I ordered sopapillas for dessert and ended up with 4 two bite dough squares and a cup of honey. I wanted some delicious fluffy air filled goodness. They cost $3 for that tiny dessert. That's highway robbery."}
{"text":"This is always my go to for Mexican food. You can count on the food always being delicious. Today for lunch though I was very disappointed. The service was lacking, very far from the regular service I have grown to expect here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm vegetarian and it's very hard to find places that give vegetarian options and they have a whole menu which makes it easier. Their prickly pear margaritas are amazing as well!! Val was also a wonderful server so if your lucky you'll get her!"}
{"text":"Went there today ate in and ordered a burrito to go for my son when we got home it was so soggy my my finger went straight threw it and that was 15 minutes after leaving! I called and spoke with the manager she said that is how it is supposed to be and would not give me a refund even tho i didn't take one bite of it!! Horrible service even worse people"}
{"text":"Updating my review and wishing that zero stars was an option. After the canned email response that I received from Macayos, I am certain that customer satisfaction ranks very low on their priority list. How sad. Thankfully, there are many other dining options in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"Seems like a typical chain restaurant but not the authentic or tex-mex I was hoping for and the chips were so stale we left it untouched. The food was just as expected, and tasted like everything was just heated in a microwave or something you'd get from the frozen food section.   Our waitor was amazing and even offered info on where we can find what we're looking for since we're new in town."}
{"text":"not sure what has happened to Macayo's but it's definitely not the restaurant it used to be. Food was gross. Not near as tasty as it used to be. stale chips no hot sauce. waitress was  terrible. Had a toddler at NO TIME did she ask if we needed a high chair. We had to chase her down to ask. she acted like she didn't want to be there. had a family member come in from out of state for some she always used to get there and the food just gross!!1"}
{"text":"When I saw the low reviews for this place... I thought, \"I'll still give it a try!\" I am so disappointed.... for several different reasons. And it breaks my heart because I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant to call home. Let's start with the chips and salsa. They were below average! I asked for salsa verde... it costs 1.30 extra! And it was disgusting! It tasted like pure sugar. I ordered a michelada... it came warm. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. But his charm wasn't enough to save this place from a bad review. All three salsas we tried were disappointing. I love margaritas... but theirs are over priced and not original at all. I'm seriously bummed. I was hoping this place would be our new regular spot! I miss the socal El Cholo."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio; dirty!  Asked the waitress for thier best margarita; terrible, watered down. Asked for an extra shot of tequila; watered down!!  Unbelievable. Food is ok. But not special enough to overcome dirty patio and awfull bar service!"}
{"text":"Haha, okay, I am obviously the odd one out here. I was both surprised but not at the same time when I saw how low the average reviews for this restaurant are. Surprised becasue this is my favorite sit down Mexican restaurant. Not surprised since I know usually half of the people I know don't care for the food here as they find it to be more of an American take on traditional Mexican dishes. I really like the food here. It is always consistent and super yummers! The three things very important to me in Mexican cuisine are the beans and rice and of course the chips & salsa. You usually get these as a side with every Mexican dish, so they better be good. Their beans are always piping hot and creamy and their rice is super flavorful and extremely moist! Their chips and salsa are delicioso! Chips are served hot and this salsa is very unique and has a garlicy flavor. May sound weird in writing but it is phenomenal when you're eating it (bring gum for afterwards if you're on a date) ;-)  I have liked every dish I have tried here. There combination plates are great because they actually give you a ton of choices! Sides and entrees. Most places will give you a small list of options, it makes it very limited for vegetarians too. When I used to eat meat, I loved their shredded beef tacos! I would get soft tacos, corn tortillas. Very moist and tender. I really like their burritos, all of their enchiladas, their green chile and corn tamale, and so so so much more! Their baja sauce is this creamy, cheesy, spicy sauce that you can get on your food or for your chips. Wowza! I have not had a bad food experience here...an occasional service experience or two when they were really swamped but I will remain a loyal customer. Thank you for your yummy food!"}
{"text":"This is the most consistent place my parents like in Surprise. While it's no Old Town San Diego Mexican fare, I think it deserves four stars for a good menu, excellent lunch specials, spot-on service, and consistency.  I guess it's a chain; I haven't been to any of the other locations. It has a little bit of the feel of a chain, but not excessively. Their branding and marketing is pretty good and if I were in another town and came upon a Macayo's, I'd probably go.  My favorite dish is probably the chicken chimichanga. The burritos are good and I like the enchiladas a lot, too. The food is never dry and the sauces are all really good.  The portions are generous, mostly. I don't think I have ever been able to finish a meal there. They also load you up with a bunch of chips and salsa (like any good Mexican restaurant should). Mmmm-mmmm.  The one time I ordered a margarita, I wasn't terribly impressed. Maybe that was a fluke, but I know that at restaurants like Macayo's, it's usually just a marg mix.   We've never had a problem with service. It's always been prompt and they're quick to fill your water glasses and make sure you have enough chips and salsa. Everyone has been nice on every one of the visits I've been there. The service is the biggest reason I give Macayo's four stars.  I have only one small gripe: why is it an up-charge to get beans *and* rice with a dish? That's the nice thing about the lunch specials - often they come with beans and rice - but most dishes, aside from many of the lunch specials, have either rice or beans. C'mon: rice and beans belong together! Like ketchup and mustard. Salt and pepper. Bonnie and Clyde. Harry and Sally. You get my point."}
{"text":"Great place to spend an evening with friends.  Tomale bites are to die for.  Food yummy.  Fannie our waitress was fabulous, Dario was entertaining and made us feel welcomed.  Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Great time with great friends. As soon as you walk into this place, there are no waitstaff, seating hostess, or a welcome crew for that matter. It's a sit down at any table you want type of  restaurant and the waiter/waitress will eventually see you in a hot minute.   I had the grilled ahi tuna tacos, which are tasteless without the avocado dip they come with, makes them all that much better. It does have a little kick (just a side warning to the folks who don't like spice)   Our waitress, AUDRA is AMAZING! She is VERY attentive and fast. Drinks were being refilled before we ever noticed they were empty. (Thanks for making us laugh Audra!)   After dinner we all went back downstairs and enjoyed the patio area. Which is a bit hard to find for the first time folks. Use the door by the restrooms to head to the patio. Our patio server was Colby, who was also VERY attentive and quick.   All around had a great time, will be back again and ask for AUDRA and COLBY."}
{"text":"Great food and always good service. The margaritas are perfect and they did an amazing job accommodating my large family and even a work christmas party."}
{"text":"Went Sunday with family and had steak and shrimp fajitas and the steak was horrible. The menu says 10 day aged Angus Beef, well I'm a chef and this was no Angus! The waiter was really polite when I told her about; however she said this was the third complaint and her shift just started! She said she told the manager so I thought I would get a visit from him..... On the way out I passed the manager and I can tell why the place is falling apart."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here in awhile, you're in for a treat. The new general manager has taken the food prep to a whole new level. To be truthful, I stopped being a regular a few years ago because (in my opinion) the quality had suffered a bit. A friend wanted to meet there so I went. So glad I did. I'm a regular once again and haven't been disappointed once. You're going to love the food!!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!! Our group of thirteen; two five, one seven, one 11, well behaved! Two star food, 2  1/2  star service. Food $160.71 tax $13.33 = $174.04 AND $29.00 (18%) tip, yikes! = $203.00. If the food and service is 4, 5, star, 18% is cheap. The worst thing, this dump was my idea, every one else wanted to go to Olive Garden. Never got a bad meal there. If you don't see anyone coming through the door, it'll be me."}
{"text":"I tried the steak which was cooked and seasoned just fine. The rice and beans were plain.  The cheese crisp kid meal was completely covered in cheese. I was half expecting it to be sparsely covered. They did a fine job. My kid was fussy and the server didn't make me feel rushed to get on my way.  The big win was that our server was on it. Good job with friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. We always drive by and decided to try something new and different. Big mistake. I can honestly say this is the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  The salsa was just okay and probably jarred, not fresh. We ordered bean dip, but only took one bite because it was so bad. It was cold, chunky and not even sure what all was in it. I ordered a combo with a cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco and rice. The rice had a very strange flavor, almost like I was chewing plastic. Not real sure how to describe it. The enchilada had zero flavor, and honestly I feel it's really hard to mess up a cheese enchilada...but they managed. The taco was okay. It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't too good either. It just had very little flavor. The only thing I could really taste was the cheese and grease from the taco shell. My husband ordered shrimp and steak fajitas and he said they were not too bad. He did like the steak. However, he was extremely sick about 20 minutes after we left.  One positive thing I can say, and the reason I gave one star, is that our waitress was very sweet. I believe her name was Christina. While we won't be returning, we were overall pleased with the service and thought that needed to be mentioned."}
{"text":"My spouse and I come here quite frequently and are pretty much considered regulars at this point. We come back for the food that is very good, the amazing margaritas and the super friendly staff. We bring all of our out of town family members here for a delicious Mexican meal while in AZ."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! But only 4 stars.... The food is great. But...the service. :-/ well.... just make sure you keep the waiters attention. Do as I do.... Make empty slurping sound with your drink straw, as you stair at your waiter, or try waving the empty chip bowl. Just what ever you do DON'T throw it. You'll never get service after that. Talking from experience here. Yeah well sorry Mr. Waiter. 15 minutes to get seated, another 20 minutes for you to ask me if I have ordered, then 15 more minutes for you to bring me a drink and chip/salsa. And yes 30 more minutes to bring the food and 1st refill. So, after an hour and 20 minute the food! Hallelujah!! It's worth the wait. Everything on the menu is very good. The chicken stuff poblano is my favorite. And try the spinach con queso dip.  Maybe the waiter was just having a bad day. I will definitely be going back with hopeful intentions."}
{"text":"Mom wanted to go back to Macayo's as we have been going for years.  I wasn't excited about it given our experience last year, but this year was great.  Fiesta salads were fresh, meaty and delicious.  My daughter had a sampler plate that included tortilla soup and she raved about it so much we ordered some to go.  My wife said her frozen margarita was \"killer\".  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"possibly the worst meal i have ever had.  server was wonderful.  i ordered the chicken mole which i always order at mexican restaurants if they have it.  it is sliced chicken with a distinctive mole sauce over it.  what i got here was dried cut up chicken stuffed inside an inedibly  hot poblano chile.  then the whole thing was deep fried like a relleno and covered with a tomato sauce.  nothing mole about it!!!  it was disgusting.  i have been burned by macayos before but this time never will i go back.  i forgot to mention the worst margarita ever.  sugary sickly sweet lemonade.  bleccchhh!"}
{"text":"Came to macayo tonight for dinner have come here since I was a kid.  Used to be favorite Mexican food, tonight very disappointed hot hot sauce very watered down sauce would not even stay on chip.  Was my favorite hot sauce.  Plus changed menu I orderd red chili chimi  wasn't fried came out very soggy told waiter she told me to get sauce on side next time"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order.  Was given the wrong order and charged more than double of what ours would have been.  In the order was nothing we had ordered.  I asked that the charge be taken off our charge card.  They said they would.  It has not happened.  Even if the correct people had received this order, I think they would have been disappointed, they included the salsa but no chips."}
{"text":"! Do not get tamales with Baja sauce...it's mush. Burritos were crap and on top of that they make you pay for meat?!?! What the faaaack who does that?!?!? Mango margarita was pretty bad. I think they just add liquor into a pre made smoothie which is way too sweet. I'll never come here again it was horrible"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and relaxed atmosphere. The prices are fair and portions are generous.  I been here many times and it's always been a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I usually get my meals to go but service is quick, pleasant, and the food is always good.  Chips and salsa are great too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Sat for 15 minutes without any service. One server came to the table beside us and walked away. I mentioned to the hostess what happened and she was like ok, what do you want me to do about it. We walked out."}
{"text":"Mediocre chips. Below average salsa (Pace?). Margaritas were clearly from a premix and very over priced. Fajitas were tasty but excessively chewy. Expect to be charged $2.29 for rice....   Lowest point was the service. Never experienced a ruder manager in my dining career! Erica talked back to multiple guests at my table and scoffed basic requests. Additionally, profanity could be heard coming from the kitchen.   There are WAAAY better options for Mexican in the west valley."}
{"text":"haven't been here in at least 10 years things haven't changed much food is okay for a big change nothing special like the fact that they have different options for the sides instead of just rice and beans I got the fajitas which are way too fatty not very flavorful should have got something with their Baja sauce witch is what my sob had next time but thus place Is better then Garcia's"}
{"text":"Jenny at the bar is great. Very friendly, outgoing and prompt. Service was fast. Reggie, was prompt with chips and salsa.     Well when my husband and I got home, we started feeling sick. Throughout the whole night, I was in the bathroom. This hasn't been the first time we've gotten sick from eating here. I just thought it might have been a fluke before. But we won't be eating here again. Not sure what has changed in the past few years. Except for poor management. And pathetic bar appearance. This place has really gone down hill. New servers every time you walk in. Not good."}
{"text":"Start with the worst margarita we have ever had. Did not taste at all right. Then the service was slow. The temperature of the dining area was cold. The food was the only thing that was close to the standard of this restaurant. Had looked forward to this for some time coming back to Arizona from Kentucky. Will quite frankly cross this off our list of places to go.  Summation:  awful experience."}
{"text":"Macayo's is one of my favorite places to get Mexican food from in Arizona. The chips and salsa are so addicting, and the tacos are excellent. The restaurant environment is great too. It's a place I almost always want to visit when I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Pretty good service and the carnitas dinner has the most tender pork ever, been going to macayos since 1987 and well over 1000 visits so I understand it has its bad days but it is still  the best of the chain Mexican restaurants in az.  plus if Mike the bartender is working at the 59th and bell location he is the best drink maker, awesome!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Mesa location -Mini-chimis on menu for about $8  Cons: -20 minute wait for 2 people. (it was a Friday night though) -Sitting in the bar area, it took awhile to get drinks and menus. -After we sat, it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and put into the kitchen.  I won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Lunch time at my favorite place with my favorite guy.  Love this place.  I had a yummy taco salad and my hubby had beef tacos.  Love thier tacos, but just felt like salad today."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past and always have a great experience. The salsa tastes great and love the fajitas. I would recommend coming here. So if in town check this place out you may like it."}
{"text":"So bad from start to finish. We asked to be seated in the bar but were told it was a 20 minute wait for anywhere in the restaurant. When we were finally sat in the nearly empty dining room (we were too hungry to argue) our drink orders were taken (would have been less expensive in the bar) and drinks came out pretty fast. My friend said it tasted like there was zero tequila in his margarita. The only redeeming value was the nice woman who brought out our food, she wasn't our waitress. The waitress was the one who slammed down the glasses of water and the bill. The food was OK at best. How the hell do you mess up a taco?? By not changing the oil the shell was fried in. Just gross. Please save your money and go elsewhere. I will say this was at about 1p on Superbowl Sunday but if the bar was reserved for that reason, why not just say something. We would have been long gone anyway. Ugh what a waste of money."}
{"text":"Stay far far away from here unless you like food that comes out of a can into the microwave and onto your plate. I couldn't eat my meal at all, I had a chicken chimichanga that came out soggy there was so much water left in the chicken. I tried to eat the chicken but it was nasty and fatty. The rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle. Even the booth we where set at was dirty and had holes in the vinyl.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Wow, super bland.    Can't really say more than that.  Just a weak showing.  Sorry, will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"We love, love, love Macayo's.  The margaritas are fantastic!  I prefer the strawberry ones but the regular mags are smooth too!  Bring your Senor Bob or Cha Cha mugg and they are even cheaper.  Yum!  Try their mini chimichangas.  Stay away from the free food during happy hour...looks a little sketchy."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite of ours. One of the best chips and salsa around. I always get the Baja Burrito. The Baja sauce is so good! (Cream cheese + Jalapeños blended). Our boys get the build your own tacos. They enjoy making them and eating them. If he weather is nice sit outside and enjoy the lake view."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on very many items but I can tell you that the Baja Chicken Pizza is delicious, the carne asada nachos are excellent and the spinach queso dip, well, let's just say that I would live on that stuff if I could. It is a combination of Velveeta, spinach enchilada filling and baja cream cheese that is nothing less than perfect. It has just the right amount of spice and is not too hot and not too mild. Just right in my opinion. I am on a budget so I cannot afford to eat there often but I go during happy hour and all 3 of the items I mentioned are 1/2 price during happy hour so I get one for eating there and I usually take home at least 2 of the spinach queso dips and eat them for the next few days. They give you a pretty large portion and a big bag of tortilla chips with each order so each appetizer is enough for me to eat 2 separate meals. It is a great deal for the money and the spinach queso warms up really well too.   The servers have always been really nice and taken good care of us. I would definitely recommend going during happy hour and trying the spinach queso."}
{"text":"Came here for National Margarita Day with my girlfriends. The host gave us the option to go up to the bar (upstairs) where it was self seating. There seems to have been maybe 2 or 3 waitresses for the whole area. The only available seating were the tables that needed to be cleaned. I was a little disappointed in the service. Our food took almost an hour to come out. Not all of our margarita flights were filled all the way.   The food, on the other hand, never fails! I ordered the beef chimichanga with all rice. Soooo good! Very flavorful and filling!  I appreciate there being a variety of margarita flavors to choose from.  All in all, I would still come back! Just hope there will be better service next time."}
{"text":"I have to say I haven't been to this location in a long time. This is right in the middle of my old neighborhood. I went here with my amazing girlfriend for lunch. I was wondering how it would be. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First off the place is very clean. They still have the same décor that was up 10 to 15 years ago but instead of having an inch of dust on it everything was sparkling clean. Now the booth we sat in had a small tear in the seat and the cushions sunk in a lot when you sit down but that wasn't a big deal. I realized while looking at the menu that I had never had one of their Chimis and they claim to have invented the dish so I guess I better try one. Have to have the specialty of the house because if that is their specialty and it is no good how can anything else be. Their salsa was really good. It had some different things added into it but it worked. I could have filled up on the chips and salsa. Good thing I didn't because the chimi was great. The sauce they put over the top of it was just great. I got the pork but next time I want to try the shredded beef. Even the rice and beans were good. Our server Christine did a great job too. My water and my girlfriend's iced tea glasses were never empty. Plus she was really nice. I don't know about the other locations but I will be back to this one for sure. It is nice to see an Arizona institution still going after all these years. Still making good food too. I was pleasantly surprised. I am happy that this was my 100th review on Yelp. Good place for that milestone."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Macayo's in years and this visit was my worst and I won't be back. Literally four people at the bar and you still get ignored by the bartender, he's not very friendly and outgoing at all. No chips or salsa offered!!!! Enchiladas barely had any sauce and rice tasted like it was microwaved. Made us feel like we bothered them for being here. What a shame!!"}
{"text":"The place was clean, the service was great, the food was nothing to woohoo about.  I have been there twice, the food is consistently the same bland and boring stuff.  The salsa is just a step above Pace picante, the beans are not good, and the rice was the same.  If you have never had 'good' Mexican food, then you will probably love this place."}
{"text":"Wow. They are now working with grub hub to delivery. I was happy, something different. Took forever for order then it came to me iced cold. I've noticed this for caring out too."}
{"text":"Extremely frustrated, we like to go and enjoy their Happy Hour food but got turned away tonight because we had our grandchildren with us!!!!!! They told us Happy Hour is only for upstairs and you can't go upstairs with children. Last time we went with our grandchildren they honored Happy Hour downstairs due to having the kids...WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I haven't had any of the bad experiences that some of the other reviewers here have had. Combo platters are big enough to share. The beer is cold and the margaritas are great."}
{"text":"I went to the mesa location a few months ago but don't remember ever coming to this location. We had an in-service day at work so we had an extra long lunch. So me and some coworkers decided to head over here. Great choice. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but their chimis are great. I got the shredded beef one this time. So good. I love them. There is a reason it is their specialty. If you go to a steak house you don't order the chicken or go to a sushi place and order a hamburger. So if it the specialty why get anything else. My girlfriend loves Macayo's too so we will definitely be back. So will my coworkers if we have another long lunch."}
{"text":"Love the food but just came from the bar and Macayos HH is now over at 6PM. That is too early and disappointing after enjoying HH there for many years."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we thought this place was wonderful! Our server Matt C. was such a delight. He answered all of our questions about the menu and told us about some cool places to check out in town. He was so personable and took time out of his busy Saturday night to chat with us. Awesome guy!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. Sat in bar with my family. Took about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged.  Another 10 to get drinks. They had one woman serving tables and most tables were taken. Got our food after awhile but there were no utensils to eat with. That took another 10 or so.  I've eaten at Macayos before never had this happen. I will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Hate to give places one star but, I ordered the carne asada burrito which came with meat and cheese rolled in a tortilla, a side of hard rice and over cooked refried beans, and a pinch of lettuce with a couple tomatoes. For $11.99. Highly regret this meal."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of Macayo's so I decided to finally write a review for them. I came here last Friday (7/29/11) for a Birthday dinner and as usual the service and food were stellar. It was really packed on Friday night yet the team still manage to efficiently serve my party of 8 as well as bring out our orders in a timely fashion. My favorites here are the Taquitos enchilada style and if you don't mind calories the Baja Chimi is delicious (one of my favorite guilty pleasures!).  Everything comes with free chips and salsa (there are two or three different salsas, make sure to ask for the spicy one if you're into heat!). Really good Happy Hour too! I haven't been to any other Macayo's location so I am only speaking on behalf of this Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"Food quality borders on average and below average.  It's gotten to be that I really don't like coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in this restaurant. First off the restaurant was empty when we walked in... we are bigger people we asked for a table and the manager gave us attitude because of it....  Second we asked for a side of sour cream.... sour cream!!!! And they said \"we will have to charge you extra for that\" really it's sour cream?!?!  3rd we have been sitting here for 10 minutes with empty drinks and our waitress has not brought us drinks.  The service has been horrible the restaurant isn't packed at all and we haven't even gotten our food yet!  I guess there is a reason they are closing a couple of their restaurants.  We will NOT BE COMING BACK!! Not to mention the manager (who sat us) acted like it was a chore to help us.   We are from out of state and have come here before and this place is a dumpster fire I would not recommend anyone coming here because of their service alone."}
{"text":"I wish you could give no stars.... but I'm ok with giving one because the hostess seemed nice.  Anyway, I will probably never go back to this restaurant. Which is really unfortunate because I loved Macayo's back in the day! Everyone at my table ordered margaritas and it took FOREVER for the waitress to bring them to the table. And then my husband margarita tasted like it was just syrup as ice. Every time she came to our table for something we felt as if we had to ask for everything we needed at once. If we would have forgotten something we were screwed. Once she went to the back she wouldn't come back out for at least 15 minutes. There was another table who had sat down about 30 minutes after us and got their food before us. Why it takes 10 minutes to get a soda refill is beyond me. She treated us as we were an inconvenience to her. This is your job lady. We didn't order anything special. Also, I didn't appreciate the dirty look I got when I asked for an extra salsa. And don't even get me started on that rice. I'll just quote my husband \"this rice tastes like a zoo smells.\" Yup, I think I'll just make the drive out to Peoria next time if I am craving macayos. See you never again!"}
{"text":"Get the Fajita Quesadillas.  Sorry, had to get that out first.  Seriously though, imagine everything you wished you'd put in your quesadillas, and they actually do that.  Steak or chicken, cheese, perfectly cooked peppers & onions, served up with guac, sour cream and their always fresh & flavorful salsa.    Not only is this Ah-mazin, but they also make a killer table guac, margarita flight & the chips never disappoint.  We've always had awesome waitresses and a positive experience.  Highly recommend this location over all the others."}
{"text":"The staff are very sweet and kind. The food, not so good. The prices, not so great for the food you're getting. It's over-rated in my opinion."}
{"text":"Their green chile tamale with baja sauce is probably the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Chips and salsa are alright.  Also try their mini chimi-s.  So good.  Great service."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service we received this weekend. We were seated for 20 minutes and, despite flagging down the bus boy, could even get a glass of water. The server finally acknowledged us but didn't return for our drink order for another 10 minutes. I'm deeply disappointed and won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight and was greeted promptly And seated very quickly. My waiter was awesome, took our order, got the drinks out and brought us the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh but what in the hell happened to the salsa?!?    The salsa looked and tasted like it was 90% tomato paste, 5% chopped veggies, 5% liquid.  The salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless. I inquired about the flavor and texture and he mentioned they recently changed the recipe. He asked if we'd like to try the spicier salsa, said it might be better.   The spicier salsa was brought out and it wasn't much better. Instead of tomato paste it tasted like a chipotle BBQ sauce.   The food was super quick coming out which was awesome, however the awesome ended there.  The chicken tortilla soup was more like a salty stew, the trio enchilada plate looked good but the rice was mushy and flavorless, the cheese in top if the Baja sauce was dried out and the pork was chewy and included pieces of fat and tendon. About the best thing in that plate was the black beans   The carnitas chimmy was so so, the meat was flavorless like it was boiled.   The chicken in the chicken cilantro lime Caesar salad tasted like it was boiled then lightly grilled.  The lettuce and dressing were pretty good though.   The tamale bites tasted like deep fried Mac and cheese bite with green chili in them.   We have our waiter out feedback and again he mentioned the kitchen changed the menu and recipes. We asked for the manager and Maria came out and we gave her the same feedback. She too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes. She apologized for the quality and taste if the food and comp'd half if the meals.   I understand adding new things to the menu to stay current but why change recipes?    The 1 star given was only because of the great service and attitude of our waiter and manager.  Can't say I'll be back again, at least not until they fix the recipes and go back to using quality ingredients and improve in their food qualities."}
{"text":"They make a great queso dip.  Most of the time the wait staff is ubber friendly too.  I think the food overall is pretty decent, but admittedly I mainly go for the queso dip!!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken burrito lunch special. Filling consisted of 90% cooked onions, 10% chicken.  Good service and good chips and salsa but serving the worst burrito I've ever had in my life is an automatic fail. The fact that this abomination of a recipe somehow made it on menu of a restaurant is pretty shocking. Even if there had been more chicken, the flavor was just horrible..."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Phoenix this weekend to attend a friends wedding. We both grew up here, but now reside in San Diego. My wife insisted that we have dinner at this location, because she has fond memories of going here as a child w her parents (30yrs ago). The food was AMAZING!!! Our server April was the very friendly and attentive. We never had to wait or look for her. She always had a smile. My wife even shared her childhood memory w her. Thank you April and Machayo's for helping us make new memories. We look forward to seeing again soon!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love macayos restaurant we used to have one in Prescott and my family and I  really miss it we used to eat there all the time now we have to drive down to phx to get it."}
{"text":"Bleach. The salsa tastes like they opened a can of stewed tomatoes and threw in a pinch of parsley. The food was greasy (not fried) and left my stomach unhappy.  My plate looked like they just slopped the food on it.  The hostess was friendly and attentive unfortunately the waitress was one of the worst I have encountered. If you want good Americanized Mexican food, go to On The Border."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican food restaurant anywhere! They have the best spinach con queso dip! the chimi's are also always very good. service is great, salsa is yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm SO disappointed with what this location has done with their remodel!  This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant but they've changed the colorful decor so much that it looks like any other restaurant now.  The food is still great so I continue to go but I REALLY miss the \"old\" Macayos!  Most surprising is the large stained glass \"macayo\" (macaw) for which the place was named - they removed it with the remodel!!  They no longer have the mints that I always enjoyed after the meal.  Bring back the old Macayos - or at least the big stained glass art!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. We picked the only restaurant in Phoenix not honoring veterans today."}
{"text":"Walked in place, and it's filthy. Front seating area needs good cleaning/ or fresh paint. Cushioned seats need refreshing/ cleaning. Look up, and see thick layer of dust all over vents/ decor. Floors had dirt, debris, and look like it had been weeks since swept or moped. ( we called in order for pick up, and it's been years since we have been inside that place, so I was really surprised). Made me wonder about the kitchen..."}
{"text":"This is the toughest review that I have had to write up.    The service was good the waiter did a great job.  The other problem was the food was not really that good.  I wish yelp had a star selector for service and one for food.      I talked with a employee when waiting to leave.  I told her what changed the food was different the last few times I was there.  She expressed that they have a new chef now.  I am not going to critique the food because that is not me.  Others might like it, but not me.    I will give the service 5 stars.   I will give the food for my taste 2 stars. Like I said it did not appeal to me."}
{"text":"this place makes all there food at a commonsary  this place sucks no need for conversation!"}
{"text":"Great food and our server, Carissa, was lovely, friendly and went out of her way to ensure our graduation party was perfect."}
{"text":"Very over priced for generic mexican food.  The salsa is like seasoned ketchup.  I asked for something spicier and got roasted habenero.  It wasn't bad.  The margaritas were decent.   We had two burrito dinners and a fajita plate.  Also 1 beer and 1 margarita.  The bill was $66.  $ 45 would be more than fair for what we got.  (The service was good.)"}
{"text":"Late night dining with friends and on a budget, Macayo's sure hits the spot.  I have to say, I do not eat Mexican food often, unless it is homemade by my friends, so I tend to rank places lower.  I will say that the atmosphere, prices, and general service of Macayo's, coupled with their good food, qualifies it for a decent rating. We had a huge group and were seated pretty quickly.  They organized our check splits from the beginning, which saved us a ton of hassle at the end.  Chips & Salsa rating is decent: chips are good and not too salty, and the salsa is a good balance of chunky and not too thick, which has you eating probably way more than you should.  I had a shredded beef enchilada with albondigas soup...I think the total was about $7 before taxes & tip, which wasn't bad, considering the giant enchilada that I got.  there was a good level of cheesy, which balanced out the slightly dry quality of the beef.  However, I did like the albondigas soup...well flavored!  Customer service was fantastic.  With the good crowd & timely delivery of the food, it was an overall good experience!"}
{"text":"When we come to Surprise to visit our daughter we always go here.  It is the only Mexican food in the area that we like.  The servers have always been friendly to our group.  We usually have about 12 of us.  We will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"No margarita specials.  On cinco De mayo. Really . Won't go there again.  Food not that great. Chicken pablanio was ok.  Need dessert. On our way"}
{"text":"Our recent lunch visit to Macayo's was a great experience. This place has been open in Mesa for a long time and as we entered I was impressed with how nice the place was! I am thinking this location has been open for over 30 yrs. Our server was Rueben and he was top notch! Our food came fast and was hot. I had carne enchiladas and my wife had cheese enchiladas. Both were great and we were very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Hummm... Where do I start.. Waitress: 0 stars  Manager: 5 stars  Bartender: 5 stars   Before I start my yelp I want to say thank you to Kim the manager and our favorite Bartender!!! We will return because of them! Not our unbelievable, unprofessional immature rude waitress!!  My husband and I have been going here for the last 4 years we lived a block from there and now we live in south Gilbert (20 mins away) we have always had amazing service in return we leave amazing tips and always positive feedback! But... Tonight was a different story! We took our kids for dinner.. It started with me going to get our own menus... Waitress passed us 5 times we sat there waiting for someone to stop 10 mins later our waitress came over put salas on our table and said sorry no chips right now.... Finally 10 mins later she came back to take our drink order... Time goes by and still no drinks no chips no waitress. Grrrr! Finally she comes back, she sets out drinks down with all the time we waiting I asked her to just take our order.... We got our chips... Our food was brought out 20 mins later. My was okay kids were just Mac and cheese can't mess that up too much my husbands meal was ice cold. When the waitress finally came back I asked her if we could get a hot dish she looked at me and asked ok so you want me to re heat it for you? I said no I would like a new hot one, not microwaved. She rolled her eyes and took the plate from me. She came back and told us that one someone took the plate that was ours. My kids and I were all done eating when she came out and told us that my husbands would be out soon. My husband said forget it! She said whelp it's too late I will have them box it up for you to eat at home. If we waited to eat at home we would have ordered pizza. She said she was taking it off the bill. When we got the bill she charged us twice for the same plate and yes did take one off but charged us an extra one! Unbelievable!! The waitress did not even bring us our ticket!   Kim and the bartender were amazing and made a bad experience a positive experience! Thank you we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"BEWARE if you use a credit card. I used my credit card with chip. My total was about $22 the total charge or theft I should say was over $150. When I used my card at this location it rang up as I used it twice at this location and one in Scottsdale. I got my money back from my bank. SCAMMERS!'"}
{"text":"Wow..there has been a  reason why we've not been to Macayo's since we moved  here. The food: Bad. Yes, it's a chain and not authentic . We both ordered the cheese enchiladas. Mine with black beans on the side I found the  the tortillas were hard and stale. Yuck. I thought it was just mine but my husband made the comment so I knew it wasn't me.. The rice was a salty so I used some sour cream to take the edge off. That by the way is a side item, extra cost. It helped. The waitress asked how it was. I spilled the beans and waited for the manager or a remake. Didn't happen.  The drinks: We sat in the bar to wait for our table to be ready. She was overwhelmed and there was a wait..our table was ready before the drinks. Waited and got them to the table. Pricey for a drink in a soda glass not a Margarita glass. No, we didn't have the ones in the mariachi guy's head..lol. So, I caught the manager. Told him about the food and the waitress and how there was no remake , etc. He apologized and took the bill. We got a small discount. Will we be back? The husband has spoken...No. He didn't feel it was worth it even just for drinks. I agree."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Server Carissa was amazing and she's really good at what she does. Cheese crisps are always so delicious. I really like their retried beans. Mini chimis and red corn taquitos yummmmm"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a very long time, and I really enjoy it. It is not \"traditional\" Mexican food but its still good. I like to go after a long hard day of work, some times with my co-worker. Its a fun environment, great place to sit and to grab some food and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, \"not too long.\" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began.   Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours.   After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time.   I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."}
{"text":"Service here is horrible!!! We keep coming back in hopes it was just a bad night but it is the exact same no matter where you sit or what day it is!! Perfect example ....been here 15 + mins, still no drinks, no order has been taken !! Please Macayos....get some staff that actually cares about their service!!!"}
{"text":"$40 for beef nachos that we couldn't chew, chicken wedge salad that was also bad quality meat and guacamole that was mediocre at best. I gave one star for the wait staff fixing my messed up order and another star for decor. We didn't have alcohol so I'm not sure why the bill was so expensive. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Yuck. Food came out on hot plates but it was cold. Long wait only to be seated and wait longer. Wait staff was mediocre. Hit the chipotle next door. Way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio. And the margaritas are decent. However, the food is definitely Americanized and only ok at that.   Maybe for a happy hour on some nice Summer day, but other than that, there are plenty of other places closer and better."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Macayo's for happy hour.  The food is always fresh.  We usually sit at the bar and the service is fast and friendly.  We will return many times in the future."}
{"text":"I must be hungry... I keep writing reviews for Restaurants! I love this place for their Taquitos with baja sauce and a good old fashion Margarita. But I do think their prices are a little high...."}
{"text":"Mexican food is my favorite food. As a result, I'm a bit more discerning when it comes to finding a really delicious Mexican restaurant. Macayo's is #1 on my go-to list. It has all the right ingredients to make it a good choice. Of course, that means the food is out of this world. I have not had a meal here that has been anything other than exceptional.  My personal favorite is the Tres Rellenos. The dish is three stuffed ancho/poblano peppers. One is cheese-stuffed; another, chicken and cheese; and the third, pork and cheese. Unreal. They aren't cheap with the cheese, either. That's fine by me! The cheese they use is different for each pepper. That's probably my favorite part of this meal. The meat is tender and full of flavor. It comes with a bit of rice and some black beans, as well.   If you like salads, Macayo's has you covered. Many of the other Mexican restaurants I have visited have either had a basic taco salad or no salad at all on their menu. That's not necessarily a knock on them. When it comes to Mexican food, I'm thinking cheese and meat - in that order. However, it is nice to be able to get a salad if you don't want to go to town with your meal. For that reason, I appreciate Macayo's menu. Their BBQ chicken salad with cilantro lime dressing is outstanding. They have a few others, but this is my favorite.  Although the food is the most important thing to rate at a restaurant, it doesn't hurt when it also has a friendly, attentive waitstaff. It's a casual, relaxed atmosphere. Great for families or if you just want to get some great food. The menu prices are also very reasonable. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account just to tell other people how terrible this place is!  Worst dining experience in Phoenix yet! We moved here four months ago and noted that we hadn't really had a poor dining experience in this city... but Macao's was able to take that trophy.  We arrive at 5:40 PM on a Friday. Parking lot is completely full, so we had to park across the street in the mall parking lot. This isn't a big deal. We dined as my wife and I, plus two friends who showed up a bit later.  On entering, I am assaulted by the extreme levels of noise on the inside of the restaurant. To the point where I could not hear the woman at the podium. And she's yelling. Eventually I get the understanding that there's a wait for inside seating (although she doesn't know how long, and who would want to eat in this noise anyway!!??!) and that the patio is open seating. I see sprayers, so I choose patio.  Most of the patio was full, but I found a table that wasn't covered in water from the sprayers and sat down. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. And no one came to take my drink order at all. Tables around us received drinks. Tables around us received drinks many times. Tables around us received drink refills. This was after being stared at hardcore by the woman at the \"bar\" outside, and being stared at by the security guard by the patio entrance. After 30 minutes of this, I went inside and asked for the manager, and after a few minutes someone finally showed up to take our drink order.  While we're dying of thirst, three waitress stop by with a plate of taquitos with some kind of sauce on them. They ask us, each time, if the taquitos are ours. My wife says no, and we haven't gotten menus or had anyone take a drink order. The waitresses attempt to feign concern and inform us that they will find someone for us, but the doesn't seem to have actually occurred.  We should have left at the 30 minute mark instead.  Eventually we receive our drinks. My wife is served the tiniest margarita ever. It was served in a cup approximately the size of those paper cups you put in your bathroom. For four dollars. We learn later that there's a \"large\" and a \"small\" size available. We were not offered a choice.  Our friends join us a bit later, and we look over the menu. I order the steak cortez, medium rare. It arrives after a reasonable amount of time. The waitress informs us our plates are very hot, and my refried beans are starting to crack. Heat lamp much? We dig in and I notice every bite of my steak cortez is fatty. I push the spinach con queso off the top of my steak cortez and notice that there's large chunks of fat attached to my steak. The beans and rice were nothing special, leaving me only to really enjoy the spinach con queso, which was interesting. Not the best $16 plate I've had in my life.  While we were eating, I drain my tiny beer, and our waitress continues to be invisible. My wife drains her tiny water, starts drinking my tiny water, and, you guessed it, still no waitress. After awhile our waitress reappears and refills our water. With seltzer water, or soda water, or otherwise carbonated water. She had a pitcher with her, so she filled a pitcher with carbonated water, then comes out and fills our tiny water cups with carbonated water. How in the world does this even happen? Is it normal for Macayo's to have cloudy water? Ew.   The rest of the meal completes without issue.  When it comes time to pay, waitress asks us how we want to split the check. We indicate that we want it split per couple, and receive our checks that are split correctly. Each couple puts their card in their respective folios, and gives them back to the waitress when she returns.  After a few minutes, our friends get two text messages from their bank, one for the price of their food, and one for the price of our food. Both receipts have the name of our friends. We have to find a manager again to correct this.  I'm really not sure how this was able to happen. Our card is dark blue, friends' card is bright white/silver. How can you mix that up?  Go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"On the plus side:  service was over the top and the place is very cool (has an upstairs seating area).  Chips and salsa were fantastic.  Prices were reasonable.  On the minus side:  my chile relleno was mostly dough - not at all what I expected.  I would go back, but I would definitely try another dish the next time."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The service is horrible it took 20 min to get my two young kids water. Just ridiculous we walked out and will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice Amazing restaurant. This was also my first time at this location. I went to the other ones but not this one.  I was Amaze how cool the inside was, it felt a little like I was in the Cabin in the mountains and what really caught my attention was the mad made lake in the back, eating your meals and looking at this Amazing view is just speechless.  We also had a great waitress by the name Mckenzie she has great customer service skills always carrying that smiling face while serving everyone and it was very busy time but she kept coming back making sure everything was ok. And the food of course was so delicious"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a little over a year now with family and friends and for me it's a very good Mexican restaurant. Good food,prices and workers."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan a restaurant chains, but this macayos is amazing, from the food to the service, to the atmosphere. Came with some friends and were seated immediately, and was greeted promptly by our server candy. She was attentive, personable, and very cheerful. Ordered The baja chimi, and was everything I could have hoped for. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Loved our experience! Attentive waitress, friendly staff all around, good food and excellent drinks. We have been trying to find a good Mexican place around here and this fits the bill. We will definitely be returning and hope our next experience will be just as good"}
{"text":"So it's been awhile since I've been here. But being Cinco de Mayo what better day to visit. Initially surprised they were not too busy, I soon found out why. Seated almost immediately was the most customer service we received.  Our waitress seemed stressed or just not wanting to be there. Didn't not  mentioned any Cinco de Mayo specials. When asked if there was  lunch specials, we were told not on Cinco de Mayo. Sooooo.....we asked asked what the Cinco de Mayo specials were she said \"the  just margaritas.\" She  barely stop by to take our order and then to give receipt. Never an offer to refill drinks or chips & salsa. Truly not the service I remembered. We ordered one drink a refreshing Sherbet Victoria  or so it sounded on the menu. Vanilla ice cream, orange liqueur and vodka ( maybe something else). $7.99 served in the same glass we got our waters in. Tasted odd at first but once the vodka kicked in it was able to be finished.  We ordered cheese crisp with chicken, Baja Pizza with side of guacamole. It was all just ok. Cheese crisp had a surprise tomato dropping that had to be picked off and the guacamole had CHUNKS of unmashed avocado. Baja Pizza was ok but was not hot ....probably sat around a bit too long before brought to us.  The remodeling looked very nice just wished the food and service matched the new look. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Sadly, Macayo is no longer on my Faves list.  I have put up with the non existent customer service at each restaurant through the years, always moving on to another location.  But, today, alas, was the last time I will go to Macayo.  The issues are restaurant wide, so this is not necessarily just about the Ahwatukee restaurant.  I have frequented, on a regular basis, the stores in Mesa, the Depot Cantina, Prescott, Central, Tucson (both), Glendale, Scottsdale and Thunderbird.    1.  Today I went for a late lunch, and arrived at 2:40 pm (lunch menu ends at 3 pm) Had to track down a hostess to seat us;  Was told that lunch was over even though it was still before 3 pm.  When I inquired, \"sorry...\" 2.  Was seated and sat and sat and sat...one of the other guests actually mentioned that they too had waited and waited for service.  There were other guests in the restaurant, but the employees seemed to be missing.  We left after waiting15 minutes to be acknowledged.    Now these issues don't seem bad enough to give up my weekly trek to Macayo's, but after having a Manager regularly park in the \" take out\" spot because \"I'm the manager;\" being given the check when we never received our food after a very long wait for our order to be taken; being served beef that was definitely bad and then being told that I must be new to the Valley, since that's how it 'always' tastes; receiving someone else's to-go order, after checking the order, I was told that I must be incorrect about the order that I placed and so on and on and on.  Believe me, I tried to share some of these things with the management, but they were patronizing and had lots and lots of excuses.  The food has slowly declined, the service (obviously) is not what it should be, the seasoned staff seem tired.    I wonder what Woody would say???  There is so much competition out there, I hope they are reading these types of reviews and making changes."}
{"text":"My friend had her bachelorette dinner here and it was the best night ever! Service was over the top and the manager and server did their best to come around to all of us for anything we needed.   We were a party of 15 and we were all provided great service! The food was so good! Mmmm that queso dip though.... drink cups were never less then empty because their refill game was strong!   The mini chimis were delicious and ugh those taquitos, the BEST! Everything turned out great and there attentiveness made our experience that much better!   I will definitely be back to have dinner as I saw so many yummy dishes as we were walking around! I can't believe this was my first time here?!! Where have I been?!!  Thank you Macayos!"}
{"text":"Been here 3x in the last month, consistently average service, average food, and... NO SOPAPILLAS.  Cue sad music!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Justin our server really made our visit pleasant. Great customer service Justin!!! Our wait was not as long as they said. Hostess did not seemed out of place. Think he was covering for a call in maybe. Noticed all other staff were working together and getting the customers taken care of. This was on 4th of July so I think they were busier then they anticipated! !!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered a burrito which looked like a prepackaged frozen burrito you buy at a store and just heat up and serve. I ordered taquitos at first but was told that there was no beef for the taquitos yet I was able to order shredded beef tacos, which didn't make sense. That indicated to me that the taquitos must have been frozen as well and they had just ran out. If you do decide to try this place bring your cholula or tapatio.The service was good. This is not our to go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My very first impression was negative, just b/c of the flatware. When I picked them up, they were the \"cheapest\" utensils I've used in a restaurant in a long time.  The Baja sauce was very tasty, but the rest of my meal was just OK.  I had the Verde Carnitas Enchiladas with rice and black beans.  I ate it all, but not once did I \"hum\" while downing it.  The second star is for the service...it was fast.  I doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a  while.  Was told 35 min wait which turned into almost 60 mins.  Short staffed and very, very busy for a Sunday night.  Server was very nice and apologized for food taking so long.  We totally understood his dilemma and told him it was fine.  Food is worth the wait but I totally miss the \"old\" Macayo's.  The ambiance is so different, environment is so different.  Miss the old Macayo's we've known and loved for almost 30 years.   Good thing the food is still so good!!!"}
{"text":"I was here to celebrate the birthday of a friend and can't say enough about our server, Carlos and the manager, Jordan. I have some funky food allergies and after I asked Carlos about them, he made sure to check on everything, even grabbing Jordan for clarification. I could not have asked for more. I didn't feel the worry I normally do at a new restaurant and totally enjoyed my dinner.  Thank you so much for having these two employees, I will be sure to stop  and eat here again, when I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago, the food sucked for the price and they took a tip out without asking me first. Don't go here ever. So many better places."}
{"text":"I go to the Macayo's in downtown Phoenix hot sauce is awesome I go to the Macayo's in Avondale again hot sauce is awesome for some reason they're hot sauce here is always always constantly watered down by far the worst Macayo's, service is good, the manager was good about it, and give us credit if there ever is a problem one thing they are good about is replacing it."}
{"text":"Excellent service throughout meal with great tacos and house margaritas.  Free chips and salsa ( although the salsa is more liquid than most) and our meals were served hot and quick. Great flan for dessert."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Mexican Restaurants in the area.  I truly enjoy their food and our service was very nice and prompt.  Nice drinks also and clean.  I'm not fond of the weekend breakfast but will probably go a couple of times a month."}
{"text":"I've been going to macayos for the last 15 years and the quality of their food is excellent.  A few of the items that have been taken off the menu are available for special order like their mexican pizza with guacamole and ground beef.  It's amazing!  Try the happy hour in the cantina for great drink and appetizer specials."}
{"text":"I've lived in surprise for 12 years now and I went to Macayo's for the first time last month and it was AMAZING! I had chips and salsa, we ordered their spinach con queso dip for an appetizer, then we ordered two steak chimichangas.  Simple, cheap, delicious.  The second time we went was last week; horrible food, horrible service, just an all around horrible experience. They delivered our chips and salsa, appetizer, and entrees all at the same time. And if there's one thing I hate it's having to rush through eating my appetizer so I can eat my entree before it gets cold. So they took the entrees back to the kitchen and gave us time to eat our appetizer, then they brought us our ice cold entrees, we send them back to have them remade and then the third time they came to the table they were under cooked, raw in the middle of some things and still frozen in the middle of others. The servers were less than apologetic, even giving off a bit of attitude. We didn't say another word. We left our frozen food on the table, paid our bill, and left. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and by far this one was probably one of my least favorite visits. We came for dinner and the restaurant was practically empty. We got to sit in the bird room which is our favorite spot with the starry ceiling.  They offer complimentary chips and salsa but our chips were cold and stale. They were nice enough to replace it with a new basket. We didn't get our drinks until the food almost came out. We ordered a chicken chimichanga, grilled fish tacos and mini chimichangas. We were told the mini chimichangas were frozen. I liked the fish tacos, the flavor was good. I was able to choose two sides, I opted for vegetables and rice. The chicken chimichanga was good and very filling. They have big portions here.   As much as we use to like this restaurant, I don't think we'll be coming back again. Plus everyone that went that night got sick afterwards."}
{"text":"They were horribly understaffed when we ate there. One waiter had the entire patio. It took us 20 minutes to get a drink order, 30 minutes to order food and 50 minutes before we ever got food. Their problems clearly fall on management for poor staffing and poor training, as other staff did little to assist. To top things off one of our guests ended up in the ER with FOOD POISONING. We will not come back."}
{"text":"I am telling you I don't think I ever really have a bad experience here. They took the Pollo Espinaca Enchilada off the menu, but there is one girl there, who usually works the drive through, who knows what it is. The chips are thin and warm, and I love the hotter salsa. Salmon was awesome and if you wanna go fattie style, the Pollo Fundito (I think I may have spelled that wrong) is AWESOME! I also have the girl and guy margarita cups, those suckers are HUGE and make my face go numb half way through. Keep in mind, I am a light weight though!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Very attentive and kind. My husband absolutely loves his burrito. I only got cheese enchiladas. They were a'ight. I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner - ordered deep fried burro - dripping in sour cream and totally tasteless. I thought it came with rice and beans but nothing but a spoonful of lettuce and tomatoes.  My son had the combination plate of tamale, taco rice and beans and he said it was very good.  I just won't order the burro next time.  I think a little overpriced - $10 for a burro!  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff; quick service. Don't know abut the tv - we didn't go in the bar.  Good parking. ther review said mild and spicy salsa?  We only got mild."}
{"text":"Only reason I come to this place is for my wife. She enjoys their beef fiesta salad. Chips and salsa are pretty good. Otherwise it's your typical food chain. The takeout area is dirty and so are the main doors exiting the restaurant where people place their hands to open. Sounds like a nice job for the hostess when she's standing around doing not much. Food otherwise is average. Won't become a favorite."}
{"text":"A decent place, but I don't plan to return here. - Plain ol' margarita: alright, though tasted super sweet and very weak. - Veggie enchiladas: errr, was any seasoning at all used in this? These were literally vegetables in a tough tortilla tube.  - Side of black beans: also no seasoning that I could detect?? Pretty sure these were straight from the can and warmed up.  I stole some refried beans from my companion, and those were pretty durn good, so I suspect that this is one of those places that flings up its hands in resignation at the possibility of vegetarians, and assumes a lack of meat means a lack of flavor. Although I stole a bite of my companion's beef taco, and that also had no flavor, so..."}
{"text":"My first and last time to Macayo's. I was so disappointed to experience such horrible customer service! We waited at a table for a good 20 minutes before we had to chase down a waitress with a major attitude. I understand it was a busy Cinco de Mayo night but there is no reason to treat customers this way. Never going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"It's disappointing to have to write this review, as Macayo's used to be my favorite place to go for a Mexican food craving. We went 2 weekends ago. It was busy and we sat for about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there to take our drink order. We finally got our food and it's not the same quality I remember. The rice tasted like it was from a box. It was gross. My kids had the make your own taco platter and the ground beef was cold and bland. I wish we had just gone to Federicos. Spent $80 on food we didn't even enjoy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends today. They were doing construction inside the restaurant. Very loud hammering with tile floors that made it echo. Have the decency to close for a few hours rather subjecting customers to this obnoxious noise! Food was o.k. but waitress (Chelsea) did not tell me about charge for sauce on burro; just added it on.   Been here a few times but Will not be back! Much better choices for Mexican food and drinks in our state. Will be using my \"Bob\" margarita glass as a planter."}
{"text":"Last time for chances on this restaurant.  This was the fourth time there.  The first 3 experiences weren't the greatest but just so so.  Last night at approximately 6:35 we went in for dinner with a friend we hadn't seen in a couple years.  We new we were in trouble when the sloppy looking waitress with the dirty shirt and dirty towel hanging from the back pocket of her jeans showed up.  I guess they no longer wear uniforms there because seriously I thought she was the dishwasher.  But anyway we ordered an ice tea, ice water and diet pepsi and a cheese crisp.  After eating some chips while waiting we did have a crowded table so she just plops the tray holder over the chips and placed the cheese crisp.  Kinda tacky in my opinion but....so we ordered each One taco so 3 total.  she brought them and had to ask our friend to move his dirty dishes out of the way.  All and all the bill was $30.00 plus some for 3 tacos, cheese crisp two soft drinks and LOUSY service.  Oh and forgot to mention the tacos had no real taste.  Nope never will go there again and will never recommend it to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and now I remember why....bland food served at room temperature. Yuck is the best word to describe this place."}
{"text":"Good food and service....$1.50 for a side of sour cream is a little over the top. Chips were thin and warm which were excellent."}
{"text":"My kids love this place because they have a build your own taco platter for kids. I like that it's a reasonable price for kids meals. I tried some of the seasonal specials and was pleasantly surprised. Normally I'm not a huge fan of this place but the lighter summer specials are a great change. Just make sure to ask prices on all alcohol drinks as they can be very outrageous. The service is good and if you like spicy ask for the off the menu hot hot salsa. It cost .99 but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The table was sticky and gross. The food was freezing cold. The bar area was filthy and the staff totally ignored everyone and let a customer get extremely intoxicated and become obnoxious!"}
{"text":"It's always a bad sign when the salsa tastes like chunky ketchup. With that said, I kept an open mind and hoped the entrees would prove otherwise.  The food from all 4 plates we ordered was marginal at best. My guess is the refried beans were from a can and the rice was downright scary - a sad conglomerate of yellow mush. All in all just a very shameful effort by the kitchen.    The staff at the hostess stand was friendly, but our server seemed to suffering from a previous night of heavy drinking - not horrible, but providing the precise minimal amount of service required to get us our food and out the door.     Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually come here during happy hour and sit in the Cantina upstairs. In the past, we have experienced great service and last night we were craving chips and salsa so decided to take our children along. We opted to sit outside on the back patio since there was a wait and it was a nice evening. There was a banquet going on in the area with string lights so we were seated off to the side which was fine, until we realized how dark it was. Our server explained they had changed out the normal bulbs for led and that was why it was so dark. Our server huffed and puffed when I mentioned she had forgotten our side of beans and needed more water. When I said \"thank you\" she did not reply...and I said it numerous times. She clearly did not want to be there and was annoyed by any request or question. Our experience last night was a complete let-down."}
{"text":"Martin was my server. He was excellent. He was friendly. Cheese crisp before is way to go. Chips and salsa are really good. Baha chimmi is excellent"}
{"text":"I've always loved coming here whenever my fiancé and I visit Arizona. I have recently become vegan so going out can sometimes be a challenge. When I asked my server if the beans and rice were vegan she said the rice is but beans were not. (I usually get a pretty simple burrito with rice and beans.) She brought her manager over and he was very helpful to let me know I could have whole black beans, rice, and vegetables without the oil made into a burrito. It was still really flavorful and I'm so glad I know what I can order next time we visit!"}
{"text":"My waiter was awesome and my food was.delicious i.got.chicken fajita tacos. Mmmm love it"}
{"text":"So far one of the best Mexican food in Arizona I would say.... they have some good shredded beef hardshell tacos  yum. The chips are light and crispy and salsa is so on point. Great atmosphere too. I would totally recommend to try this place out!!!"}
{"text":"For Phoenix Mexican it's pretty standard fare, and it is the icon.   The food was decent and as expected.  I like they offer calibacis as a side vs. standard refried beans and rice.  Our server was great.  We usually have good service here.  Negatives.  The restaurant is loud.  The music should be toned down.  The menu is limited, I was surprised by this.  This is new for Macayo's.  Finally, the price.  OTD with tip for 2 Mexican dinners, and no drinks $35 is a bit steep."}
{"text":"I can't understand all the negative reviews for Macayos in Goodyear. YES, for those that don't already know this, Macayos is a chain. It's a family owned chain and as far as I know, they're only here in Arizona, centered around the Phoenix area. They've been in business many years.  My family loves Macayos, and we've been to several. I just ate at the one in Goodyear today for lunch - I had a colleague in from out of town and he was up for some Mexican food, and he said he enjoyed it. We both had the Chimi Macayos, with shredded beef, rice and beans (lunch comes with one or the other but you can add the other for a buck or two).   Their chips are good, the salsa is good (not great, I admit, but good) and they serve portions large enough to satisfy any hunger. Seriously, if you eat here and leave hungry, you're one in a thousand.  They have a nice bar area, and on Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty busy. The dining room is good sized and they can accommodate large groups. Which is good, because we often go there with a dozen or more family members.  They also have a very good line of margaritas, by the way."}
{"text":"Back to try this Mexican Restaurant as it's been a couple years and very pleased with the addition of more tasty menu items. Had a steak as well as a chicken taco with a side of black beans and a new spicy mix of grilled veggies called calabacitas, both healthy and yummy. They've changed up the old shredded lettuce on the tacos for a mildly spicy mix of peppers and fresh grated red cabbage, what a major improvement. Very pleased, and priced about $10. My friend had the Shrimp Fajitas and he too was please with both the presentation and taste (a lot of food for just one person btw). Our server Cortney was on point and made the entire meal a real pleasure. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lunch with the bogo this week was a bargain. Skinny margarita was excellent. My green chili pork stew was very good. Wife's beef tacos lacked seasoning and she is a wimp on spiciness. Alexis did an excellent job."}
{"text":"My husband and I had date night and chose to come here. We were greated with a very friendly hostess and sat us in a booth like we requested, we sat for a good 5mins before anyone came to our table and it was only to drop our chips and salsa off. We then waited another 5 mins we were already to order we looked around to see if anyone would come before we chocked on our chips, finally our server came took our order. Our server brought us our cheese crip pretty quick and then brought out our dinner all good. After our server dropped off our food we never saw her again till my husband was done with his food and I was almost done, we would've like to have more salsa and some extra sour cream, my husband wanted another margarita but no one came by so we couldn't ask. The chip girl came by right before our server did and she's the one who took my husband's plate asked if we were ok we said yes but of course we had already finished by this time. Our server came dropped off our check said have a good night that was it, thank goodness we had the exact amount, including tip, yes we still gave a decent tip, (we aren't those kind of people to stiff our server we normally are VERY GOOD tippers), but shoot if we were paying with a card or needed change who knows how long we would've waited. Just disappointed with our service, we did speak to a manager on our way out so hopefully he follows up with his server and the problem will be resolved."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location a few times. The atmosphere is festive, like you would expect. The hosts greet you upon entering and are quick to take your name on the list. I have been for lunch and dinner and there has always been a wait even when it is pretty empty, although they get through the list quickly so no real complaints there.  The cleanliness could use some work, every time I have been there has been debris on the bathroom floor and the sinks/ floor under the sinks somehow look as if someone has had a water fight right there. Last two times the tables we were sat at were sticky to the touch. Luckily, we didn't get a rocking table but a lot of neighboring parties were asking to move or stuffing sugar packets under table legs.   The service is in and out, server dependent. They have an excellent menu, with a lot of choices. But not so many that you may be overwhelmed. Great combo choices. Only Mexican restaurant I have been to where I can get an enchilada, tostada, rice and beans, and a taco on one entree for $8.99. They also have \"pick two\" or \"pick three\" options for slightly more. I like mixing it up so this is perfect. Food quality is what you would expect in cheap Mexican food: greasy and delicious.   Knocked a star for cleanliness, and let's face it: it's good but it's not fresh. But would still recommend giving it a go. It's the best I have found yet on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars from me mostly because of how bland all the food and the salsas are. Even the so called \"hot\" salsa was unimpressive. Taste reminded me of Taco Bell \"hot\". (Hot...  Not fire. Not diablo). Guacamole was unimpressive. The chips are good and seem fresh.   The meals themselves are ok but for the prices I would expect better. The combo I had was one ground beef taco and one chicken enchilada with a side of rice. $11.99. I also had ice tea for $2.99 that tasted a little too much like dishwater.   The server was excellent but it did take over 45 minutes for our food to come out.   I would probably go back for happy hour but that's about it."}
{"text":"ok. i love macayo's, i always have. the food is pretty darn consistent and when i'm going to a chain restaurant, that is what i expect and actually what i want. as per usual, the food was exactly what i had anticipated.  i would have loved to give a 4 or 5 star review on the food, but that's not what this review is really about. THIS is a service review.   Matthew and i went to dinner with my parents last night (Sunday) around 645 and Paul was our server. now, i don't know if he was new or one of those older, jaded servers who think they know everything. sometimes they're hard to tell apart. this guy seemed like he didn't want us or anyone else to be there, like he had better things to be doing than his JOB. if you don't like people, DO NOT BE A SERVER. seriously.  had to ask for refills two separate times after near empty drinks (1\" left in glass) sat for 10 minutes, had to ask for more chips twice, and he dropped Matthew's plate on the way out of the kitchen and said \"did you hear that crash? that was your taco, they're making you another one.\" which took another 10 minutes. oh and my favorite...my dad ordered shrimp fajitas.  the food comes (minus Matthew's) and what kind of fajitas do we receive? beef. i said to my dad, \"didn't you order SHRIMP fajitas?\" he replied that he did in fact do so and stated such to the server. Paul said that was incorrect, that he wrote down beef. my dad said that wasn't what he ordered and that he would indeed like shrimp. so i don't know how you get beef from shrimp, or even steak from shrimp. yes, they're all monosyllabic. but they've got differing vowel sounds and one of those words starts with a different letter even!  he was totally rude and when i go back (it's inevitable, i like their generic food occasionally) i will specifically request to not sit in Paul's section."}
{"text":"I cannot lie. I am in love with their pork enchiladas, but that's pretty much where I draw the line. I think their decor is obnoxious, and the salsa sucks, even though for some godawful reason it was voted best in Phx for 2008... I do not agree, I also think their uniforms are possibly the ugliest I have ever seen. I'm not sure you could pay me enough to wear those bright ass parrot themed button ups. Although the food is decent this place has never been my first choice for Mexican cuisine.. I only came here because the Garcia's across the street was closed down, which upset me to no end because their bean dip is fucking amazing, well was... stupid economy. I had a margarita, and an hour later still have a decent buzz so cheers to the bartender.. The portions are big enough for two dudes, so I always have leftovers.. their service is suffice, but about as boring as this review is.   I am now in a food coma, from the food baby they served me. Time for a nap."}
{"text":"I love the patio here.  the food was not too bad my last visit.  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"My co workers and I have been going to Macayo's for years . The food is exceptional and the service is the best I have ever had . Management has gone above a beyond to help with our teacher appreciation week. Thank you Macayo's"}
{"text":"There was 9 of us in our group. We went here after our weekly Thursday meeting, Normally we go (when we go) for Mexican food to another restaurant but we all wanted a different Mexican food establishment this time around. If you have read my reviews about Mexican food restaurants I always start with how the salsa tasted to me and then go from there. The salsa was a combo of other places hot and mild chunky salsa so it was OK but the chips were served hot and added that \"little\" extra that marked their salsa & chips right there with some of the best.  Now to the food: My dish was the Fajitas de Macayo. A flavorful treat of steak Fajitas grilled to perfection on top of  a bed of grilled onions and green chiles. Served with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and refried beans. I asked our server (waitress who's name  I didn't  get) if I could get a side of grilled vegetables instead of the  refried beans. She said no problem so I substituted the  refried beans for a side if grilled vegetables. I expected I would be getting grilled onions, and the other grilled vegetable that came with the meal but instead got grilled zucchini, squash, broccoli and some other grilled veggies. But it was all good just not what I expected.  My wife got a como plate of Shredded Beef Enchilada &  a Shredded Beef Taco served with refried beans  she really liked the Taco and next time wouldn't get the Shredded Beef Enchilada. all in all she liked what she picked out.  FOOD: Everyone in our party liked what they ordered. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: typical modern Mexican restaurant décor .clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Especially considering every had something different . they provided excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a Mexican food restaurant. I'm sure we will be back RETURN FACTOR: 100%   ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH  ."}
{"text":"A lot of folks bag on chain restaurant and generally, I AM one of those folks, but Macayo's remains consistent and tasty.  It's kind of like a friend-with-benefits.  You're never getting married but every time you hook up, you know exactly what you're going to get."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here last night, we had never been to this location before. The service was great, the food was even better. For appetizer we ordered the guacamole, it was perfectly made. Our entrees were carnitas and the Baja burro, both were absolutely delicious!!   I don't normally give 5 stars on my reviews of a place but in this case it's definitely well deserved! Needless to say, we will be back."}
{"text":"We had our family dinner there last night, Easter.  There were 7 of us.  It started with the rude host who scolded me when my 80year old grandmother was able to come so the count was off by 1.  When we were seated we were happy to see our favorite waitress Val.  We were lucky to get her the 2nd Sunday in a row.  She is such a great and attentive waitress and you can tell she truly cares.  Anyway, we ordered a couple of cheese crisps, tamales bites, a burrito and one dinner (tostada and taco).  Our food took nearly an hour to come out and when it did it had been obviously not prepared at the same time and the food wasn't right.  Cheese crisps were so old and hard you couldnt cut them,  burrito tortilla was the same and the garnish was wilted from sitting under the lamps, other food was missing ingrediants, and beans had a hard layer on top.  Val had said she told the kitchen manager the quality was poor and food was wrong (new cook) but was FORCED by the manager to bring it out.  It was all sent back with the exception of the taco and tostada because I had to feed the kids. (We ended up leaving the tostada because the meat tasted off).  By this time poor Val was in tears.  She said she talked with the manager and she (Val) would be taking care of the meal as the manager would not.  As a matter of fact, when we asked for the manager, she left our table when we were speaking with her, DURING the conversation.  We insisted Val would not be personally responsible for the meal as it was in no way her fault at all.  My husband went to speak with the manager again who basically gave him lip service.  Needles to say, we took care of Val and made sure she personally wouldn't be out of money because of the kitchen and horrible management.  We are more upset about the way Val was treated then the horrible food.  What kind of place outs their front line customer service staff in that position?  This server is a mom, working on a holiday to provide for her children.  She did NOT deserve the way she was treated.  Absolutely disgusting and we will NEVER EVER go back."}
{"text":"My most favorite Mexican food place in Arizona. It's right down the street from my house and I come here all the time. Always get good service whether it's the bar or the restaurant. Even went in tonight as they were closing and the staff and server and bus person were overly polite and kind and willing to make sure we had a good dining experience. Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Perfect Combination!  Margaritas, salty chips, and fresh salsa . . . what could be better than that?  Add in 1/2 price appetizers for happy hour and you might have an answer.  The Beef Taquitos were the perfect combination of crispy and soft and the baja pizza was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to typically share a negative review as everyone has their own opinion and yelp ratings are so important to restaurant owners... but this one just requires some feedback.  My wife and I came here based on the many five star reviews and found the food quality to be way below average.  She got the shrimp tacos and had to send then back and didn't want anything else.  The waitress told us the fish is frozen and the end result definitely proved it.  Even though she nibbled on my dinner we still didn't finish it between the two of us.  Happy hour drink specials were great but the food was so bad that we will not be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend took me here for lunch & the ambiance was a treat itself being seated at a booth where we have an unobstructed view of the lake...the food was good, the server was attentive with our needs. My boyfriend ordered the guacamole dip, it's heaven! Avocado mixing w the citrusy taste of lemon & cilantro, the best! I ordered for the steak fajitas and they're soooo good! Next time I visit him in Phoenix, I'll ask him to take me here again...we are coming back:)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long long time.  We had nicole tonight as a server.  Worst service ever!  Not only did she get my order wrong twice but she tried to come over ask me if my order was better than tried to show me on the menu how I was wrong.  When i showed her she was wrong she stomped off. Then came back to the table to fill water and did not fill mine but others mine was empty.  I'm not sure we will be returning anytime soon.  Sad cause I really love their Baja sauce."}
{"text":"Is Macayo's a foodie's dream?  Not even close.  But it's always quality food.  I've been to Macayo's all over the valley and have never had a bad meal.  Sometimes the service can be hit or miss (this past visit, it was great) but that seems to be the only variable."}
{"text":"Love this location! We eat there regularly and the service and food is always great. If there is ever a mistake it is promptly fixed with a friendly visit from the management. It is definitely one of my family's favs!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some nachos and a drink. The hostess and bartender were both friendly and helpful. We sat in the bar area and the tv's weren't working but the bartender explained to us and he was trying everything to try to get them back on. Not a big deal to us, we came for the nachos.  We had the margarita flight (house, prickly pear, peach, mango) and the nachos supreme! They were great and they came out really quickly. We asked for the extra hot salsa and he brought that right out as well. We'll definitely be back soon. They were having Happy Hour specials all day today so beers were only $3!"}
{"text":"You did away with the red chili burro and you lost a customer.  Why did you mess with something that has worked for 30 years?"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner tonight and we were told it would be an hour wait (expected, as it is Cinco De Mayo) but our table was ready much sooner than that.  10/10 would recommend getting the flight of margaritas! You get to choose 4 flavors for $9.99- it's a steal! Within my friend and I, we got the house, peach, mango, strawberry, and wild berry. All amazing.  Service was great. Our waitress Tessa was very kind and we got our food and drinks very fast. Another worker, I believe her name was Ashley, saw that we got the flight and asked if we got her favorite, prickly pear. Unfortunately, we didn't. Not too long after, another worker, Karen, came up and asked us the same. At this point we knew we had to be back to try it out - everyone loves it clearly! And it was to our surprise, Karen came back with a glass for us to try. So incredibly thoughtful for her to do so. And yes, we loved it too!  TLDR; amazing food and plus one service!"}
{"text":"Really wish I had read the reviews first.  Such a waste of time and money. Stood up front and didn't get greeted for 5-7 minutes. They tried revamping their menu and now it just sucks.  Changing the menu and type of napkins doesn't mean anything if you can cook worth a ****.  Food was greasy, soggy and room temperature.  Not sure how you F up a quesadilla considering I used to make them myself when I was 10 in a toaster oven. They are frying everything else, have chicken on hand for other dishes, breading on hand for other dishes.... And kids meal has ridiculous fake chicken tenders.  I took one bite of my dish, server knew it was terrible and didn't ask me why I didn't eat my lunch. She knew it sucked and probably did not want to lose gratuity.    #fail    #noeffort    #closingsoon"}
{"text":"You don't get a a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression. The rating is for the service, not the food. We never made it that far. After getting there we were seated decently quickly, and then waited.  And then we waited some more. We waited for over 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table.  We were tired of the wait, so we as we were leaving the waitress came up and apologized for the long wait, something to do with them being unusually busy because of the whole Red for Ed thing, a group teachers meeting or celebrating or some other nonsense.  But we told her that we were on our way out.   Nothing worse than hearing excuses after a long wait, I could be extra peaved due to having a customer service background and having actually developed and taught customer service classes.  Just apologize and move on.  No one wants to hear all of that.  I had high hopes and expectations, they were not close to being met.  The food could be amazing, I'll never know.   Response to owner, no thank you .  Please see first line about first impressions/second chances."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great atmosphere but the best reason to come here is the service. Everyone took customer service very seriously but Severa made us feel like we were hanging out with a dear friend. She treated each of her customers like they were guests in her home. If you're craving good food and outstanding service, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"We LOVE coming here!! Every time my daughter and I want to go out to eat, we go here! It's sooooo good!!! The employees are always super nice! Our number 1 for sure!!"}
{"text":"eh, no thanks!  It is just american-ized Mexican food and there is something in their cooking (spice/oils) that tends to not agree with me later so we have stopped going."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to this formerly tasty and satisfying restaurant, but things definitely seem to have fallen way below par in terms of taste, quality, and price. I ordered the cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and beans combination plate and was very disappointed to see that the beans were microwaved while the rest of the food lacked flavor. The staff is usually always nice at this location, but the food just isn't worth it anymore. Maybe it's different at different locations, but the only tasty food still left here are the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"My office made a reservation to celebrate the retirement of teachers from our department. The wait staff made this such a special event. We used the \"Jungle Room.\" They made sure that we all had our drink orders and plenty of appetizers. I HIGHLY recommend Macayo's on Bell Rd for any celebration."}
{"text":"The last time I went the service was horrible, complained to the manager so they can make improvements. Well tonight I sat at the bar thinking I would give them another chance. Oh no it was worse. Walked out and spoke with Manager and told her I wouldn't be back and she said I am sorry to hear that, would you like a coupon. Are you kidding me, are you freaking serious! Ah that's a hell NO!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are regulars here.  We usually split the Baja Chimi and relax with margaritas or cold beer.  Generally a laid back atmosphere and never over crowded.  When the weather is not scorching we like to sit out on the patio with refreshing views of the Dobson Ranch Community Lake."}
{"text":"Always great food and impeccable service. Try the Carne assada chimi you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Warning. Happy hour is only recognized in the bar, not the restaurant. That's pretty bogus. Food is very average but pretty consistent. Service is usually decent. Not my favorite Mexican restaurant but better than some."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not excellent. Went for lunch and ordered 2 a la carte beef tacos. No sides. $11.99!!!  $5.99 a taco. TACO. No sour cream no guac no sides. When I asked the server her response was \"our prices have gone up\". Well they can charge someone else $5.99 per taco, I won't be back"}
{"text":"Where do I start? We waited at our table a good five minutes before we were ever greeted. Food came fast but the soup was luke warm, black beans were hard and the shredded beef was more like baby food (mushy). Server was nice enough after he finally came but not very keen.  Let's just say we couldn't get out of here fast enough."}
{"text":"The servers and staff do what they can to make this place what it is. Not impressed with anything beyond the chips, food is stale and a bit on the low end. Food is food I guess. Better off going in the mall to the food court."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience tonight at Macayo's. The manager Erica was amazing! The service was perfect. Food was excellent as always. Thank you for accommodating our large party."}
{"text":"I'm just giving it two stars, the hostess was rude, my waitress although nice, forgot a couple of our items. The food was good and the salsa is yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to Mexican food. Beans & rice were obviously microwaved & my flautas weren't even flautas, they were taquitos. Let's not forget the salsa that was basically watered down Pace salsa."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving Fajitas, and we had a pretty decent experience with Macayo's a few months back so we thought we'd give it a try again.  We went this past Friday (early afternoon) and the place was pretty quiet.  We were seated right away (plenty of available seating) and our waiter came to our table very quickly.  In order to spare you all of the unnecessary details, I'll separate this into \"Positive, and Negative\" paragraphs:   POSITIVE: - the staff was very nice, in particular our waiter Corey James was awesome!  This young man had a great demeanor, was incredibly friendly and attentive.  He approached our table, introduced himself, asked what beverages we would like (with a couple of great suggestions) and asked if we wanted chips/salsa.  We said yes, ordered our drinks and he was back before we could look at the menu.  He made some suggestions with regard to appetizers, took our order and came back with our apps (see the \"negative\" below\").  He took care of our appetizer challenges without a problem and was very empathetic.  He was an excellent waiter!   NEGATIVE - We ordered the queso, and when it came out it looked awesome.  the plate was hot, the queso looked good and we dug in.  First bite, was the last.  The Queso was literally ice cold in the center!  We waited for Corey to come back and he immediately took it away, and we ordered a cheese crisp instead.  When that came out a few minutes later, the cheese crisp was almost burned, but it was good regardless.  The Fajitas came out, and they didn't look all that great to be honest with you.  The plate looked like strips of dry chicken, beef and cooked onions.  The refried beans looked cold, and the side order of black beans looked drier than the meat if that's possible (I hope to be able to attach two photos).  The presentation on the side order was actually laughable...again, very dry looking beans, and the lettuce/tomato was pretty sad looking.  The beans looked so bad we didn't try them.  The tortillas were hard and almost translucent around the edges (not good at all), and the mead definitely tasted like it looked.....very dry.  There really wasn't much flavor to it al all.    We did eat the meat though....paid our check and were on our way.  Again, the staff was great, the decor was very nice, and the place was clean.  It's just that this time around, the food was definitely a miss....I feel like we got the leftovers from the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Moved into the area about 5 months ago this Macayo's is super close to where we live now but we were just like there's so many new (to us) cool places to go and we've been to Macayo's a million times so we'll get to it when we get to it. So we finally go in today the weather was perfect so we sat on the patio which is super great being right on the golf corse! Then Sonny comes out, this guy was funny straight away! Sonny was not only hilarious but so efficient we never had to ask for a thing he anticipated our every need! The food was what we expected from Macayo's which is consistently good. Been to a couple Mexican places in Ahwatukee and while they were all very good the service we received today can not be beat! Thank you to sonny and the other servers that came out to check on us even tho we were not their table, exceptional teamwork!"}
{"text":"When we went in, we asked to go in to the bar area so we could watch the football game, but were informed that they were't seating anyone there as they had just seated a large party in there and they only had one wait person. REALLY on the last Sunday of regular football they only had one person working in the area where the tv's were?  Poor planning on management's part.  Every year we are given a gift card to Macayo's and we always look forward to going and having a good meal, unfortunately tonight we had a really poor meal, I do think part of it was a language barrier, our waitress was very sweet but she obviously did not understand what we were saying, no salt on a margarita didn't seem to be that hard. When I asked what Relleno Sauce was she could really only tell me it had tomatoes in it, when I told her I didn't like tomatoes could I get  green chile with baja sauce she said so you just want Baja sauce, I had to explain three times that I wanted the baja as well as the green chile.  When our food came out, a man brought the food and said he would tell someone we needed a refill on our drinks.  My meal was totally garnished with tomatoes, as if I had told her I LOVED tomatoes.  I scraped them off and cut into my chimi, which is when I realized that I hadn't specified what kind of meat I wanted (chicken), out rolled some of the largest chunks of onion and chiles I have ever seen, and little tiny chunks of beef, not even shredded.  So my meal consisted of some pretty sticky rice, which I mixed the baja sauce into for some flavor, and about 10 chunks of beef about the size of dice...I left hungry. We had to actually stand up and flag down someone for a refill when our meal was almost done.    The salsa was not up to its normal standard either, our thought was that perhaps the kitchen had run low and someone was just chunking up tomatoes and onion as fast as they could because when my husband dug in (see above...I don't do tomatoes) he literally had tomatoes the size of his chips...he said it tasted fine but the salsa didn't go far as the bowls were full of big chunks instead of lots of small flavorful items.  We will go again, as we have been here and had good meals, but this one tonight was just so disappointing.  Also, when the waitress took our plates, which had almost as much food on them as when they were set out, she should have asked if there was a problem, my husband tried to tell her that the meal was not up to the normal standards, but she just gathered the plates and rushed off to get our bill. Tip was not our usual generous +20%."}
{"text":"Check in and seating was quick. Fast and caring service by our waitress!  The food was very tasty and there was plenty to choose from with a reasonably priced menu!  I will come back again!"}
{"text":"Macayo's has been central dinning location for my family over the years. Celebrations or just welcoming family members from out of town, we will usually come here. Their decorations in the restaurant have a Mexican theme. The \"bird room\" we call it is decorated in a tropical theme and has a few big birds places throughout it. This is the room we usually dine as with a large party of 12 plus people. The place has a homely feel to it. They keep the place pretty clean.  Their food is really good! And is very consistent between locations. They have recently simplified their menu. It was a good idea to do so and makes the ordering process much simpler. This is good for those who are new to the restaurant and it's veterans. The Baja sauce is a staple of Macayo's. I can put that stuff on everything!  Service is decent. On some occasions it feels like they forget your there but they are more often pretty good.  Tons of parking around but you may have to walk a ways depending how busy the area is.  Overall, this is a great restaurant with a long history and great food. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"My family used to come to Macayo's for years and it was always delicious! Then about 4-5 years ago, they started to change; the chips tasted like bag chips, the salsa tasted like it came out a jar, then the food started to change. Some Macayo's shut down... It was sad. We quit going and tried to find another good Mexican rest. But all of them taste the same and are just ok. Then yesterday my family wanted to go there, so I thought I would give them one more try and if it was bad, I would never go back. I ordered the Green pork(used to be green beef, and they describe it as \"green,pork stew\") which is odd. I kept picturing potatoes and peas and was a little leery of ordering it, but I did.  The others ordered green chili  pork burritos with red and green sauce. We had sour cream and guacamole on the side; 2.00 each. I am very happy to say everyone's food was DELICIOUS!! We all loved it!! The portions are big too! I should add the salsa is better and so are the chips. I will def. be back!!!"}
{"text":"Gave them another Try. 100% Turn around from my last experience. Our Waitress Was amazing and we were well taken care of. Seems like what ever caused the horrible service was fixed and I will recommend to others."}
{"text":"It is truly sick that my boyfriend knows where all the Macayo's are located in the valley and has visited all but one.   Before I started dating him, I had visited the Depot Cantina in 1997 (yes I remember the year, it was a traumatic event) and HATED the food. I ordered tacos (how can you go wrong, oh you can) and they tasted horrible. I vowed to never visit Macayo's again. I had stayed true to my promise for a good 10 years before my boyfriend informed me that this was one of his favorite restaurants (I think he was testing our relationship) and invited me to dinner here. Well I came back and it wasn't as bad as I remembered it. I pretty much always order the shredded beef Baja Chimi, the sauce give it just a small kick. I can't take much. Sometimes I'll get the mini chimi appetizer plate and that's good too. I can't remember if it comes with 6 or 8 chimis. With their Chimi Fiesta going on I get the mini chimi sampler which comes with 6 chimis . There are 2 of three different kinds: chicken, beef, and pork each with it's own sauce on top. And it's only $6! The margaritas here are also pretty good. My favorite it the frozen strawberry. It hits the spot on a warm (ok scorching hot) AZ day.   I've never sat in the restaurant area in this location. The bar has plenty of booths and the servers know us now and are always on top of our order.   I do like patio at the Dobson and Baseline location better because it's \"lakeview\" dining. :p But the service at the Ahwatukee location can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place has just gone down hill, we keep going back in hopes the \"traditional Macayos\" is back.... No such luck. Drinks took 20min, fish taco was burnt and came out 10min after the rest of the meals. Lots of items forgotten on the dishes we ordered. The manager didn't seem to be concerned at all. The food is just not good. I would suggest Rio Mirage if your looking for good Mexican food in Surprise."}
{"text":"We usually go at lunchtime and it is always very good.  They have the best chips and salsa, great service and great prices on lunch specials.  This is one place I really never get tired of going to again and again."}
{"text":"Always great food & awesome service. Been to several locations and they are all great!! Highly recommend for excellent Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Macayo's has great food but a poor happy hour. I was expecting kind of mediocre food based on the fact that it's a chain, but I was quite impressed with how fresh and flavorful the food was. I got the taco salad which was a lot bigger and healthier than most other place's taco salad. My boyfriend got the enchilada sampler which was amazing! The sour cream like enchilada sauce is really unique and delicious.   The only negative thing were the happy hour margaritas. After 4 margaritas in about an hour (which normally would produce quite a nice buzz) all I had was a very full belly of liquid. I would recommend ordering regular drinks instead of the HH margaritas as a far more cost effective method of getting your tipsy on."}
{"text":"This place I have been to for about 28 years and they were my top place for Mexican food . But lately not sure what's going on. May had a change in ownership. But food and service at bar has gone down hill. Last few times I have been there chips have been stale and cold. And food burnt. I have given them 3 more times (strikes) and they have failed me. I haven't been back ."}
{"text":"They might have been understaffed this evening giving them the benefit of the doubt, anywho... food was good nothing exciting but their food is good. The wait staff is very busy so I get they can't really talk but he walked up and didn't introduce himself kind of just started. Eh no biggie. Restaurant is somewhat clean. Chips and salsa are always bomb.com"}
{"text":"Decent service, but as a vegetarian, I expect the vegetarian menu do be just that. The rice isn't vegetarian nor is the sour cream."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the service we received today here.  We were a group of  20 teachers , and they treated us so well!  The food and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mother's birthday with my sister and dad. The restaurant is nicely decorated but that's the only thing it has going for itself.   Our waiter was alright, not friendly and did the bare minimum.   The food was a D grade overall. I had the Verde Shrimp Enchiladas that came with black beans and dry rice. I like to deconstruct my food, odd habit of mine. So when I opened up my enchiladas one of my enchiladas had 3 medium sized shrimp and the second enchilada had one shrimp chopped into 4 tiny pieces! I literally pieced them together and made one shrimp. It was such a disappointment!   My dad and sister had refried beans in their entrées and they tasted like canned beans.   My sister told our waitress that it was my mother's birthday so all the waiters gathered and sang only problem was that all of them looked annoyed and as soon as they finished singing they ran away looking fed up.   This place needs a lot of customer service training and better food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  I kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down Mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  Vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....Right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  It's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  I ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a Mexican pizza.  Food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  Pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  Margarita was weak also.  I usually get a little buzz going on when I order a large one, but I didn't get anything from that one.  As always the food at Macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....I think it's time to try something else even if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We came here because some local folks recommended this place for a group dinner with my husbands students.  Our reservation was for 7:00pm on a Friday night and we were prepared for them to be busy but the service and the quality of food were both really sub-par.   Our server greeted the 6 of us who came first and took drink orders and all seemed to be fine until the rest of our group showed up (about 20 in total).  Then about 15 minutes went by before we saw our server to take our drink order.  Another 10 before he came back.  Okay, no worries, that was a lot of drinks and chips to get going.  The server comes back and takes our order - an involved process for so many folks.    Then 15-20 minutes.  We'd been there nearly an hour and no food.  My husband asks for our server (who we hadn't seen in a while)... and he comes out to explain that the cooks decided they weren't going to show up that night?!  WHAT? And the managers were back there along with our server trying to make the food?  Wow. Okay.  So he hurries away - and at this point I have to get our toddler home to bed because still we have no food and as I get up to leave here it all comes.    I ordered a salad.  It was bad. It had been sitting for some time - the lettuce was wilted and there was little to no flavor.  I'm also fairly certain the ingredients didn't match what was on the menu but I had to leave so I didn't bother complaining.  I asked the others in our party how the food was and no one seemed impressed, just glad to be finally eating.  Can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The waitress Kelly tonight was spectacular! There was seven in our party, and she was extremely attentive to each of us.  My food was hot and delicious, exactly as I ordered, and I would go back in a heartbeat. We sat in the patio area, it was warm and homey. It was a really wonderful visit with great friends and food."}
{"text":"amazing food and always quick and courteous servers. try the happy hour!"}
{"text":"This location in Goodyear is the only location I will eat from. The people are always friendly and the service is good. It is clean as far as I can see. The food is decent enough that we do go on occasion.  I have been to other locations and found them to be awful but Goodyear is spiffy doodle with me."}
{"text":"It was ok. They had this option for a three course, which saves you a bunch of money. I got a visit with a friend. The waiter wasn't the friendliest. He was efficient. We were there quite some time and no one asked us to get out. It's a huge space though. I did have a hard time finding it. It was rather hidden."}
{"text":"Is has been a very long since I have visited this Macayo's.  Parking is shared with a few other business's but, still amble parking. Very colorful inside, but, some places here are a bit worn out and could use a bit of sparkle.   We came about 5:20 and had about a 15 min wait. They were quite busy for a Tuesday night. We checked it out upstairs, but it was freezing a cold up there. So we were glad we ate downstairs. We got a nice booth. we had a sweet server. She was very busy, but did her best to keep checking on us. She refilled our salsa and drinks several times. The food was just so so. Not the kind of Macayos we know and love. I had a steak Quesadilla which was a little light on the steak.  Lots of Onions though. T got shrimp enchililadas. She said they were good but, both of us the rice and beans were a little flavorless. All in all good food though, service was great! Thank you Nora!"}
{"text":"After a 6 month hiatus, I had family in town and we wanted Mexican food.  On Black Friday, we knew restaurants could be packed because of hungry shoppers taking a break from their door buster deals.  I reluctantly went back to Macayo's and I'm glad I did.  Whatever beef they were using before is back to the original and the menu items tasted just like I remembered it.  This time I ordered the shredded beef Macayo Chimi with rice and beans and oh was it good!  I barely finished my plate and I was relieved the quality of food had returned.  Our server tonight was Ken and he rocked it.  He made sure our glasses were full and he served our food real quick and we had everything we wanted.  Even at the end he noticed my Father-In-Law's name on the credit card (he paid the bill) and said \"Thank You Mr. Rausin for dining with us tonight.\"  That was a nice added touch.  He really seemed like he cared about his customers.  We've never had bad service at this location.  My faith in Macayo's is restored and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Mexican food in Arizona. Try the fabulous green corn tamales with Baja sauce for a one of a kind treat!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Macayo's quite a bit. The enchilada sampler is probably my favorite item on the menu, but don't expect too much. For being an Americanized version of an already inaccurate cuisine, this place is pretty good.  I do, however, very much enjoy the refillable Senor Bob margarita mug."}
{"text":"We ordered Macayo's through DoorDash for a working lunch last Friday and let me tell you: I'm in love. I am always searching for a delicious, authentic, shredded chicken burrito. I'm obsessed with finding the best version of that pulled white meat goodness. The verdict is- dare I say it- better than my own, better than Cafe Rio (prior victor) and better than any other hole-in-the-wall place I've tried (and those hidden mom & pop gems can be super hard to beat)!!!   Let me explain. My burrito was sizable; shouldn't have eaten the whole thing but I did. Came drenched enchilada style in their house sauce. (Insert biggest white gurl UGH here.) Inside the burrito was more than just delicious, moist (sorry, that word is necessary) shredded chicken; there was a cheesy ooey goodness (resembling the consistency of cream cheese) along with hella rice and beans. On the side was a fresh pico slaw that helped give a fresh crunch. Chips and salsa for days, literally; I hardly made a dent in the amazing fresh salsa (full of cilantro and garlic, more runny than chunky, just the way I like it).   Great, now my mouth is watering at 9:30am for a burrito, people. Guess I know what I'm having for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with the customer service tonight.   I ordered takeout and when I arrived the hostess was on the phone taking an order. After hanging up, she immediately apologized for the wait and went to the kitchen to grab my order. It took her a few minutes before returning. When she returned she apologized again for the wait and explained that, \"Your spinach queso wasn't quite right and we remade it for you.\" I really appreciated the courtesy and attention to detail. Even the plating within the styrofoam box was thoughtful and pretty! While it was a quick experience, it was a memorable one. Well done, hostess with the mostest. :) I only wish I would've caught her name so that I could give her full credit. I'll definitely return for takeout when I'm feeling lazy about cooking."}
{"text":"This was our second time at this Macayo's in Mesa. This time I ordered the fish tacos. You can order them grilled or breaded. They come with a helping of purple cabbage and pick de gallo. With a side of sour cream, guacamole, salsa, and salsa with jalapeños. They were tasty but, now I realize why a lot of these New Mexican restaurants use two corn tortillas instead of one. The corn tortilla doesn't hold it together as well as two. I can only give them a three star. Maybe next time I will try other items."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! My son picked this for his 18th Birthday dinner and it was awful!! Haven't been here for awhile and service has seriously gone way down hill. First off our waitress April could barely speak English or maybe because we were Hispanic she assumed we could speak Spanish but we don't,  I understand some my kids and husband none. So that was our first challenge she seemed annoyed we wouldn't speak Spanish back to her. Drink refills had to be asked for multiple times. She brought our food but not my husbands and then asked if he even ordered anything WTF!! Finally he has to repeat the order she doesn't say sorry I forgot to put it in  or at least lie to us she just walks away then a gentleman helping her who I kind of assume is the manager asks us halfway through out meal if everything is OK and I say no he never got his food and my husband has to repeat his order for the 3rd time. Finally he gets his food as the rest of us are finishing up our meals,  no apologies no nothing. She started to ignore us because she could sense we were irritated again we asked multiple times for chip and drink refills. The whole time she was speaking to us in Spanish she had other  non spanish speaking customers she did not do this too. She finally drops off the check and never comes back the other guy grabs it and finally comes back and says I took $8 off big whoop our bill was over $100 for the worst time I have ever had at a restaurant and I eat out a lot. The so called manager was in jeans I thought he was a customer at first, he had no name tag he had a regular shirt, jeans and a long key chain not professional in any way. They are in serious need of major training for management and staff at this location.  I will never be back again!!!!!!! Wish I could leave no stars and thanks for a memorable 18th  Birthday dinner for my son and not in a good way at all. I would have complained more about this but I didn't want to ruin his dinner any more and the so called manager wasn't going to help this situation!!!"}
{"text":"Trying out a bunch of Mexican while living in the area for the next few months. Really liked this place! Good service and good food! I had the carne chimichanga and it was so good! Salsa is great too!"}
{"text":"Came here for a large bday party and was sorely disappointed. I never been a big fan of the food but, this time it was really the manager that was not good at all. Jose. I knew him from way back when when he was a manager of another Macayo's and we had a pretty good relationship, but seeing him at this one, he was just not in a good mood at all. My thought was, on a Tuesday night, over 40 people loaded into your tables. How much revenue is that going to make you?  Wouldn't you be happy to see everybody?  It seemed like it was absolute  drudgery for him to see us, serve us, and when we were running out of room in the Jungle Room, we requested to be moved to a larger area and he seemed annoyed at the request, and did not want to move us into a larger area, even after the servers  serving us agree that would probably be the best choice. The service was actually ok but, the real reason that we go to restaurants is for good food right? Well the food is really not that tasty compared to other Mexican restaurants within the same area. The drinks were merely okay but at 10 bucks a pop I think I can probably find another place to get just OK margaritas. The atmosphere is really not that great either, the patio doesn't have any misters and The Vibes are pretty neutral. Not a lot of energy. For a night out I would definitely recommend somewhere else"}
{"text":"I have been going to Macayo's for years. However, the one in Goodyear is terrible. I will never go there again. My husband and I took some friends there who came in from out of town and were sat down pretty much immediately. It was early on a Wednesday night so they weren't busy, but there was only one waitress working. The busser brought us our salsa and chips immediately and told us our server would get us drinks. Well, it took our server TWENTY MINUTES to even acknowledge our existence. I had to walk up to her and literally ask if we should go somewhere else. The service just went on being AWFUL the whole time we were there. She mixed up our food, didn't bring us water until she brought the food out, and at the end of it all when we spoke to the manager about the fact that it had taken us an hour to get served any kind of drink at all--he proceeded to tell us that the waitress was new. REALLY?? Then why was she the only person working?? To make matters worse our food was cold when we finally got it. This girl only had three tables and they were not large parties. I will NEVER go to this location EVER again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The bar tender was soooo rude. It's not my business if you enjoy your job, but the least you can do is fake it! Cold food, rude service... With so many choices in the area I will go else where for sure."}
{"text":"Initial impression was very poor as the restaurant was half empty and patio was completely empty, yet the hostess said it would be an hour wait.  Obvious poor hostess (Nicole) duty and awareness of tables available.  Pointed out empty table and she was oblivious. Actually got seated in 20 mins due to me pointing out empty tables.  Then as we were being seated a do different hostess (Jason) set someone else at our table as we are standing there at the table and told the hostess to set us on other end of restaurant. Complete chaos.   I have been going to Macayo's since 1998 and it's typically my go to place.  This is not typically the location I go to, but was on East side of Valley so thought we would try it.   The waitress (a different Nicole who was pregnant) was prompt to get out drink orders, was very personable, and attentive.    The food:  sonoran style Mexican food.  90% of the menu is under $12.00.  The food was hot and delicious. No complaints on the food."}
{"text":"Went to Macayos in Mesa last night and let me tell you. The greatest waitress/ hostess by far is Fannie. My family has eaten there lots of times, they have all been pretty good, But Fannie is pure perfection. She can anticipate What you need before you need it.Her attention to detail so impeccable I had to tell her manager Mark,I believe his name was. Thumbs up to Fannie.. The stars for Fannie. The restaurant gets a 4 star.."}
{"text":"We visited this place the night of the color run and had a BLAST. It was like eating in my Nana ' s kitchen. Food was well prepared and had flavor you don't expect from a chain restaurant. I asked about it and our waitress mentioned that most of her family worked there. She took pride in how long she had worked at the restaurant and treated us like family. We were tired, hungry and she knew exactly what would hit the spot. Can't wait to go back again soon."}
{"text":"Food was under par Spanish rice had a chemical taste to it the shredded beef taco was very dry and over cooked, the one plus was the chili Colorado burrito it was actually really good however is was very small for the price and the black beans that came with it tasted like they dumped them out of a can. The beer from the tap was flat and stale and when we informed the waiter of our issue he was like that's a ongoing problem some days it has to much carbonation and other days it's stale....  The price was another thing 34.79 for 2 people less tip definitely will not return !"}
{"text":"I found the food here very tasty and reasonably priced. The service was impeccable and they allowed me a quiet space so I could work and enjoy lunch. Guacamole is exceptional and the chimichanga chicken is delicious. I would recommend others to go there who are from out of town as it gives an authentic feel for Mexican food."}
{"text":"My food was served to the table next to me. The customer chatting away on her cell phone put her finger in my green corn tamale a few times complaining 'this isn't my food' and when she finally decided to quick playing with my food, told the server it wasn't her order the server attempted to then serve it to me! I told the server that the other lady put her finger in it a few times so I couldn't accept my food. She took it to the kitchen to be remade. My order came out on same red plate that was originally presented to me. The plate itself was piping hot with extra sauce on the tamale than the last one but food was room temperature. My boyfriend's food was also room temperature and his side of french fries a total of 13 were soggy. The server even noticed there were very few french fries on the plate and said she'd bring out another order. We were starving at this point so I ate around the end of the tamale that I felt to be still compromised and my boyfriend ate his room temperature overcooked steak but left the 13 soggy french fries. The second order of fries never made it out to our table...may have gone to another table and we were just ready for our check. While waiting we called a manager over to inform him (Brian) what had happened so it wouldn't happen to another customer in the future. Brian swore up and down he personally threw my food out and the food I now had was all freshly prepared. He apologized profusely about the second order of fries never arriving and the entire experience. Brian removed both our meals and my second untouched Patron margarita from our bill. I've come to this location several times and it has never been like this. We shall return after their remodel and give them another chance!"}
{"text":"Macayo's has never been one of my go-to Mexican restaurants. It's always been just OK but not exceptional. My wife swears by the Margaritas and they do have Negra Modelo on draft. But the food is, as I've already said, just OK. They have recently added al pastor tacos to the menu. These are pretty good. I've also tried the carne asada burrito, which is decent."}
{"text":"The salsa was okay. The fajitas, nothing to write home about. Overall, for a place that always has a long line....the food was not very good."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst Macayo's we have been to. To start, we sat for over 10 minutes with nobody coming to the table for chips or a drink order. The hostess finally came over and brought a bowl of the bottom of the bucket, broken up chip. Our waiter finally came, took our drink and cheese crips order. When drinks came, spilled all over and wrong drinks. Then when the \"cheese crisp\" came, it was a folded quessadilla. Waiter brought more water and spilled it all over the table and left for us to clean. He came over with food, only to say \"wrong table\" and walked away. Our food came, missing sides.. asked if I wanted more water, I said no. He decided to pour anyway and again, spilled all over the table. Came to ask if we wanted dessert, tossed a menu out on the table that landed in our food. Got the bill, asked for a refill for my son. Bill came, no pen, no refill. He was nowhere to be found.. Went to the bar to get a refill, no service down at the end I was standing. My wife was up front, manager asked how dinner was. Wife responds \"interesting\" and manager says oh.. Wife explained what I was doing, she looked over, say me waiting and did nothing. Comedy of errors to say the least. Thankfully we have a Macayos closer to us. As we were leaving, we heard another table say \"guess we're drinking our dinner tonight.\" There were several tables complaining of service so I know we weren't the only lucky ones. Good luck and I hope you have a better experience!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. I got the green chili burro and a chili relleno  and they were horrible. The green chili burro taste like cat food and relleno was frozen. The only thing that was ok was the salsa and the service. I will never go to macayos again."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly staff, Amazing food, if they make a mistake they correct it right away. My go to for Mexican food. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife went there a couple weeks ago around 3:30 in the afternoon there was 2 other people there, the waitress was very nice thats why im giving 2 stars the food was horrible i ordered steak and chicken and shrimp fajitas it tasted terrible like microwave food chicken was like rubber the shrimp had no flavor and again it was like microwaved. My wife ordered a enchilada sampler the cheese was good but other than that rice and beans were old. I work hard for my money and when i pay over 50 dollars for a meal and get bland and rubber food i will make sure i go out of my way to write a review. If you work hard for your money please do not go here the place was empty i thought we would get very good service and very good food. O well i would hate to eat there at a busy time. I do not recommended this place ever."}
{"text":"The server was attentive today.  Refilled drinks with a quickness.  Been a little while since we have been here.  Seems that the prices may have stayed the same but the quantity went down.  We both had Fajitas but only 2 tortillas?  I thought it used to be 3.  I could be wrong but we only got 6 mini chimis in our order and I thought it used to be 8.  Po Pos gives you 8 for the same price as Macayos.    The restaurant needs to be cleaned.  The light fixtures above the tables were nasty.  A deep cleaning and dusting needs to be done in here.  Hire an outside service to do so.   I am curious what the kitchen looks like if the dinning room is like this."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out and dined in. Nothing horrible or super exciting about this place. The restaurant is kinda dark... and your not always sure if it's clean or just dark. I always want to like it but it's just been pedestrian. I have to many Latino friends who still have big dinners at home I guess."}
{"text":"we were here for a friend's birthday (my fabulous maid of honor actually) .... the food is very tasty and there are plenty of options.  Good prices ..... the best thing?  They have these amazingly cheesy margarita mugs (you can buy them in either male or female ... I recommend one of each) that you can buy for about $10 but then you get $3.99 margarita refill!! Only $0.89 for flavors :) Limit two but they are strong :) It's a fun place, especially when you embarass your friends during their birthday with a singing staff! (bring your own sombrero for when they bust out the song .... the one thing they lack)"}
{"text":"Won't be back. The parking lot use to be packed. No I know why it isn't.  Not sure what happened. Food below par service very slow.  Rice way over seasoned.  Perhaps the manager will read this and make corrections."}
{"text":"High quality service is the first thing I noticed, a place that the staff remember the drinks you order.   Chips and salsa come standard with your meal, which almost serve as an appetizer.  Carne asada tacos were OK, doesn't come close to more authentic restaurants in terms of flavor. Baja sauce definitely makes it enjoyable, but it's par for the course compared to the competition."}
{"text":"We decided to stop for a bite to eat my husband and my 17 year old son, it happened to be Happy hour, we don't drink, but we sat out on the patio, really nice outside. We ordered appetizers as they were $3 off. All the food we order was just as good as always, the waitress was really nice and helpful. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30 on Thursday, December 29th. Was sat during rush hour pretty much instantly, so points for that. Our waiter, Kate, was working very hard running between the kitchen and the many tables she was waiting. After a somewhat long wait, and two baskets of chips & salsa later, we were served the Relleno Chimichanga w/ rice & 2 Shredded Beef Tacos.   If you could imagine the way an exotic pet store smells, that is exactly how the rice and the beef tacos tasted.   Can't imagine the state of their storage and kitchen if this was the case. Kate was very helpful in the refund but, please, stay away from this location's rice."}
{"text":"Great Mexican comfort food! My server, Callie made the experience top notch. Service was quick and friendly, and the food was great! I will definitely be back the next time I'm craving Mexican, and I'll make sure to ask for Callie!"}
{"text":"I might give it another star after I have been there a few times to see if the food/service are consistently good.  Went last night and were seated promptly.  The place is probably the most well lit restaurant I have been in in a while and I kind of like that.  The service was really good, save that our server spoke very loudly, even though there was not a high level of ambient noise.  I almost asked her to soften her voice a bit.  That being said she was appropriately attentive throughout the meal.  The food, while not strictly authentic is really good.  I had the Baja chimichanga because I had read a Yelp review saying that it was really nicely spiced and I like my food fairly hot.  It was not, but it was mostly meat, fillings and sauce instead of tortilla, which I like.  The black beans were really good as well and my wife's shrimp street tacos were killer!  They have a few good draft beers.  When you get your chips and salsa you may want to ask for the extra hot salsa.  It is not that hot, but has a bit more bite than the usual one.  The usual one has a better flavor, however.  Mix the two together and you'll be set."}
{"text":"Never ever eat here. Took my family for a last night of vacation treat of fresh Mexican food. Total fail. We thought it's a beautiful Az February evening lets eat on the patio. Filthy cluttered and a view of Bell Rd. Traffic. 15 minutes for a server, 30 minutes for our drinks. 60 minutes for our order. 4 of the 7 entrees were wrong. No second round of drinks. First round margaritas were all melted and separated as they sat to long on the bar. Over priced and the food when it came to our table had been sitting under the warmers for way to one. Manager was not any help. Steer clear. Plenty of other yummy options with great service in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time at this Macayo's. Been to several others. Arrived at 1 on a Saturday afternoon and it was 1/4 full. I was a bit nervous seeing it had 3 stars. Now I get it.   My wife ordered a make your own combo with a chicken enchilada, beef taco, rice and tortilla soup while I got the enchilada sampler, which comes with one beef, one cheese and one chicken enchilada. We shared a margarita and it came to $38.   The flavors overall were somewhat forgettable. Seems they're cutting some corners. Cheaper silverware, lame salsa, etcetera, that are telltale signs that they're struggling to make profits.   Two highlights: the soup and the service. Both were outstanding and worthy of a shout out. I'll order the tortilla soup for myself next time, even tho it was a very small portion.   C'mon Macayo's, quit cutting corners."}
{"text":"Weird service and food was alright.  Loved the drinks  Loved the Margaritas, thought the food was a little too salty for my taste. Chips were airy and delicious so was the salsa. Loved the Mexican red rice the best and their beef tacos were yummy and unique.     Our server lacked confidence and spilled my grandma's soup on my mom. Then after she spilled it she still served it to my grandma! Took her until after we got our food and had to tell her we needed utensils.  I wish ALL the staff knew about the menu because she said the soup wasn't spicy but it was"}
{"text":"First ket me say our hostess Rebecca greeted us with a smile and showed us to our booth. Then came back to make sure we had been greeted by our server. We hadn't so she took it upon herself to bring chips and salsa and asked J.L. to help our table. He took our drink orders and appetizers. They came immdiately. Might I say it's St. Patrick's day. He didn't skip a beat with filling water glasses and chips. Food arrived hot snd drlicious. I recommend coming here for a great meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal, but happy hour was unfair.  They listed $3 house margaritas of which I got 2.  Served in a large martini style glass.  Then I watched a guy order one after happy hour and the drink was served in a regular large drinking glass.  Not the much smaller glass I got.  So basically I paid $3 for a much smaller drink. A happy hour drink should be a special price on their regular priced drink."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews on yelp because I don't believe in passing judgement when, as a customer you don't actually know all the circumstances involved. But what I saw today was absolutely appalling.  As we were waiting for our food from our server Autumn who is absolutely the sweetest girl (5 stars) we had to witness another waitress being belittled and torn down by Miles Johnson the supposed Vice President in the MIDDLE of the resturant floor @ around 2pm today. I felt so embarrassed for this waitress. I watched as she tried to stick up for herself in a professional manner but he would keep interrupting her. He cut her off every chance he got. This went on for about 10 min until finally he stood up, pointed his finger about 6 inches from her face and yelled \"i don't work for you, I don't have to listen to you!!!\" He said this in such a violent manner I thought he was about to hit her. He stormed off before the waitress or what seemed to be other manager could even get up from their chairs. #1 to do this in the middle of the resturant is ridiculous #2 to speak to ANY employee that way is horrendous #3 that behavior from someone in his position is unheard of.  The food was adequate and our service was phenomenal but I would be uncomfortable returning to any of this chains resturants if this \"man\" was anywhere in the vicentity."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and had Ashley B as our server and she was excellent. She gave us suggestions and was very knowledgeable with the menu items. We will definitely come back and request to be seated in Ashley B section."}
{"text":"My second time at Macayo's, menu seems to be hit-or-miss. I ordered the lunch special chicken taco, chicken enchelada, and beans. Enchelada was fine, but the taco was deep fried with too much cheese. Last visit was better, but can't remember the entree."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very fun looking, with a nice chaotic layout that has lots of nooks and areas.  There is an interesting fan and a display of colorful jungle animal figures.  Inside and out, this restaurant says \"Fun!\"  Our server was friendly.  But the food was so so, and the food and check service were a little slow.  I am rating the restaurant mainly based on the food and the fact that my first visit was a serious let-down after a lifetime of curiosity about Macayo's.  Oh, and it's not cheap.  $30 for 2."}
{"text":"HMMMM......still no option for zero stars??? well I wish i could give a better review, but it's hard to when you NEVER get greeted!!! LOL So i'll try.....this was the first time i've ever gotten up and walked out of a restaurant. My wife wanted to stay and complain, but we were both pretty hungry already and didnt really want to wait around to talk to some 'Joe Shmoe' Manager, who obviously doesn't give a crap about service and hospitality.  We walked in at about 8:15-8:20pm lastnight, no hostess, nobody there to greet us. Stood there for about 4-5min, finally a girl walks by and asks, \"oh do you need a table?\"  So at this point, a little annoyed, but oh well they must have cut the hostess early that night? Start looking at the menu, a couple minutes go by, still no server. We see a couple different servers walk by our table and glance at us but just ignored us. So i guess those servers were all cut? or it wasnt their turn?   We both knew that they didnt have the full staff of servers on still, but you'd think somebody would eventually greet us.  So we finish looking at the menu, sat there for another couple minutes. Saw another 2 different servers walk by us and talk to the two booths on both sides of us to ask how things were, and both walked away without talking to us.  I could understand maybe miscommunication, or if we had beverage napkins down already, or if we had walked over from the bar and already had drinks, maybe everyone who walked by us just assumed we had already been helped.... but NO!! nothing! we had nothing infront of us, other than 2 folded up menus that we both had read over almost 4 times!! LOL  Then there was one busser that walked by and kind of glanced at us after we had been there for 5 mintues and he could tell something was up. But still nothing.  Then i turned to my wife and said, \"ok lets just go, this is garbage.\" we were both kind of hesitant about walking about, because we had never done it, but this was a joke! she asked are you sure? should we say something? i said, \"to who? nobody is stopping at our table to greet us, just get up, follow me, lets go.\"  So as we were sliding out of the booth, we left the menus on the table, nobody tried to stop us or ask us what was wrong, obviously nobody cared. Headed to the exit, right past the host stand. Noticed there were 3 girl servers just hanging out kind of off to the side of the host stand, but still in front for everyone to see. Just chatting with themselves, all of them messing with their phones, one girl had her purse on so she must have been leaving soon. All 3 girls were oblivious and watched us walk out.  Now i've been going to Macayo's since i was 12, back when there was only one location over in mesa, then the one in downtown tempe, and been coming to this location since it opened back when i was in high school. Now the tempe location is great, still go there, the patio is cool, never had a problem there.   But here, this garbage ahwatukee location, yea its gotten to that point now, garbage. It started off good when it first opened about 10 years ago. But over the years this location has reeeeaaallly dropped off. Not so much the food, dont get me wrong the food has still been consistantly good, but the service over the years! BLEH!!! just like the 17 different times they've re-painted the outside of the restaurant!!!  LOL  I know management and staffs change over the years, but you can really tell that they dont care anymore.  So anyone in the ahwatukee area if you're in the mood for mexican food dont even consider Macayo's on 48th & Warner. You'd be better off going to the Taco Bell right there for better service. Or just down 48th street to chandler for Arriba's(which is where we ended uo going)."}
{"text":"Not my favorite chain but they do have the bestest salsa. :) Service is a bit lax and the food can be touch and go but can't miss with the salsa."}
{"text":"Macayo's has been one of my faves for over 30 years. I was served a green corn tamale with the Baja sauce by mistake 25 years ago and it has been an addiction ever since.  Dine in or take out, it's good food. Give the Baja sauce a try."}
{"text":"I am sure just about everyone has been to a Macayos.. it is your typical Mexican fare.  I come here for lunch a lot and I like it because it is fast for a sit down lunch... you are out of there in under a hour.  I always get their original Mexican pizza (not the baja one)... it is good and something like $6.00.  So while I am not going to rave about Macayos to my friends and tell them they need to try this place it is a good lunch destination."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food chains! The salsa is delicious, except it stays with you hours after your meal.   The patio area is spacious and private. The portions are good; you either leave stuffed or you take home leftovers. I ordered a basic bean and cheese burro with a side of sauteed veggies. It was flavorful and just what I needed.  This location is conveniently located off Bell Rd. just west of Reems."}
{"text":"I live in the area and never thought about this place. My husband and I stopped by with a limited amount of time for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised by the quick service and friendly staff. We ordered the lunch special and food was great and affordable. Our server was very attentive although I dont remember her name. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I find a restaurant that does not change it's taste and menu over the years. Macayo's must know a good thing when they have it, I have never had a meal that has been removed from the menu and if you need something changed about it they are more then willing to fix it to your liking. The endless chips and salsa are always great but their sauces make their entrees better then ever! Yay for baja sauce! I will continue to go back for years to come!"}
{"text":"I went to Macayo's before the Def Leppard concert the other night. I ordered 4 drinks for my friend and me and that was it. The next day I checked my bank account & had been charged twice. I waited another day to see if the incorrect charge would drop off and it didn't. I had to call my bank to have the charge removed. Be careful, as this has happened to a friend of mine at the same Macayo's. If you don't check your account, they will continue to get away with this fraud."}
{"text":"The one star is for our server who was very nice and professional. She did her job very well so kuddos there. The food gets zero stars! The food is bland, lacks flavor, and is over priced. The salsa is tomato water with a little cilantro and green onion. My husband ordered two tacos with a side of rice. The taco meat had no flavor and would have been lucky to taste it in the taco because the portion was so small. He ended up sending them back and didn't even bother ordered anything else but a beer. The rice is bland and even salt didn't help. I ordered a salad with no dressing and guess what it had on it when it came out...dressing! The server had the manager come out to address the tacos and all he said was \"no bueno\", took the plate and walked off. He obviously doesn't care to improve since he didn't ask why we didn't like the food. Don't waste your money or your appetite here."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice family lunch and ordered fruit as our daughters side, wasn't expecting to get canned fruit cocktail! It used to be fresh grapes, very disappointing to see. Rest lunch was decent, but made me wonder how much wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"I like this place, it's good American Mexican food in a corporate chain atmosphere, and given the crowds that mill about on the weekends waiting for tables when this is a little off the beaten path compared to the national chain restaurants located down the road.  The bar mixes great drinks.  My biggest issue is that the wait can be really long, but I can understand why."}
{"text":"I go to all local Mexican food places in the valley. I've been going to Macayo's for the last 20 years, mostly the downtown location. The salsa has really gone downhill. Its used to be full of quality ingredients, but now it's just tomatoes and a little onion. The salsa is what makes a Mexican food place and I can confidently say that the salsa at Macayo's is horrible. It's time for them to be less corporate and go back to their old recipes."}
{"text":"Tried Happy Hour at this location (in the bar area only).  It was busy at the time we visited ~ 5pm.    It was what we have come to expect from Macayo's.   We had house margaritas and ice tea, mini chimi's, carne asada tacos, corn and the chips/salsa.     We always like the mini chimi's for an appetizer when we eat in the dining room.  The carne asada tacos were just ok for both flavor and HH price.  Everything else was good for a HH meal."}
{"text":"I want to thank the staff at Macayos for making my Moms birthday special. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Just stooped in for lunch and oredered the Baja pizza.  The pizza was amazing.  We had Scott as our server and he did an awesome job.  I Can't wait to come back to have an awesome meal and cold cerveza."}
{"text":"After a morning hike, I was really looking forward to quenching my thirst and feeding my hunger. The perk of this location was that the patio overlooked the golf course and that service is friendly and attentive. It's a given that we are in the southwest and that Mexican food should be easy breezy.  With that said, you still couldn't get me to return. I got persuaded to try the Grand Marnier margarita priced normally at $12 on special for $8. There was nothing grand about this drink. I think a bottled version from the grocery store would have tasted much better than the concoction prepared. While I was told that the salsa was prepared in-house, a jar of Pace Picante salsa would beat the watery tomato sauce that accompanied my chips. I was hoping the chicken & bean tostada and chicken enchilada would rescue the subpar introduction of our meal. Unfortunately, I left hungry and headed for beer and wings to rescue my stomach from disappointment."}
{"text":"Decent service,  decent food. Our table bought plenty of beer and margaritas, but we were still charged  $2.99 for soda water from the fountain.  We've  NEVER been charged for designated driver's plain ( not bottled) carbonated water.  They even charged it as \"Cocktail Beverage\" not soda water. When asked,  bartender replied,  \"well it is carbonated.\" We paid it, but very Disappointed about this happy hour downer. Try the Hub or Doc & Eddie's for fun Happy Hour."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now. The food was very good. Atmosphere and service was very good.  The prices are rather high and they suggest a 20% tip. Otherwise I would give it a 5.  This is the Macayo's on Bell Road."}
{"text":"We eat out 3x per week and I can't remember the last time we weren't satisfied with our meals. The house margaritas tasted like just sweet and sour mix so we got dos exis drafts next.  The fish in my fish tacos was grilled so much it was as dry as jerky. The rice was super dry as well. We had eaten here once before and it was fine. Our server, Ryan, was a nice kid and a good server. I guess Macayos is a crap shoot. Good luck."}
{"text":"The atmosphere had a nice outdoor festive ambience.  The food looked great! It tasted very good and enjoyable! The service was pretty good too. The manager came to our table and chatted with us. The desserts were delicious!!! We would come back!"}
{"text":"Packed on a weekend night for dinner.  The service was great though, very intuitive.  Chips and salsa are okay.  The steak dinner I had smothered in spinach queso was delicious and plenty for two people to share."}
{"text":"It's always a good time and great location for Macayo's!  Love the lake views while enjoying our delicious dinner and great company!"}
{"text":"I have been to Macayo's before, and last time seemed fine.   This time was at the Dobson location in Mesa.  PROS - We were seated immediately, even while it was busy - The server was nice and friendly - The food was hot, and cooked fresh - awesome - Normally priced - BALLON ANIMALS FOR THE KIDS!  CONS - The music seemed very loud, maybe it was just where we were sitting - The server did not write any of our orders down, which worried me, and rightfully so, since she got 2 of the 3 orders wrong =/ - She told us the food was not spicy and was kid friendly - IT WAS SO SPICY!! - She tried to charge us additional for the extra food she brought out, due to her taking the order completely wrong - LOL!!! - She refilled mine and my wifes drinks with the wrong beverages  Macayo's itself was ok, but the server - not so much.. She was also very young and maybe inexperienced?   Either way, I will probably still return, just hope for a different server"}
{"text":"My family and I love Macayos, we eat at the Tempe location all to time. We came her for a quick lunch and ended up staying much longer than anticipated. The food was delicious like usual, the fried ice cream is great! But the service was terrible. We waited forever to get our food, even though there were only a few people there. We will not be eating at this location again."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were disappointing as were the \"sunset\"  and \"Texas\" margaritas. The classic margarita and the 3 meals we ordered were good. Service was efficient but not super friendly."}
{"text":"So the truth is that as a youngster I ate with the family at Macayo's elsewhere in Phoenix so on this trip I was out by this one and made a bee line there the first night.  I was not disappointed, in fact I went there twice the week I was there.  I love the carnitas and it never fails to impress.  I also like the rellenos and they were excellent as well.  Both servers were quite attentive as well despite being busy.  And truthfully I have found many places do not really take good care of a single diner in restaurants of this size.  After all the restaurant does not that much money for the table being occupied and the server does not make as good a tip as they would if there were two to four people.  But this place was NOT like that.  The servers were happy to attend to my needs and the staff was attentive and responsive on both occasions.  That is the mark of a professional establishment - both the staff and management.  Salsa ad chips arrived promptly, my drink order was taken and the food arrived promptly.  And I like the salsa here even if it is a bit gringo for my taste buds.  I realize that most people do like the fire hot salsas one might find in some places.  But this salsa has a good flavor and I like the oregano flavor in it."}
{"text":"It was my dads 74th birthday and we really enjoyed the dinner :) Miguel was a great server and very attentive to our table! He did everything asked prior to the dinner :) was a very special night for my dad and great service and food! I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I usually love Maccayos but I have been to this location twice and have not had great experience. I ordered a margarita and the amount of salt that was mixed into the drink was unbareable, gave me heartburn."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Came here with my grandma and asked for the waiters favorite dish, it was a beef chimichanga. The portions were huge and we thought we would be taking our meals home, but ended up eating it all because it was so delicious. Also, thank you to the waiter who split a margarita between me and my grandma because she was afraid she would get too drunk off a full one to herself! Great service, great food. She loved it."}
{"text":"2 visits in 1 week and we had 2 very different experiences.  1st visit was a Saturday afternoon. Very quiet not busy at all. But for some reason it literally took 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. No drinks. No chips. No hello. Once we did order our drinks and they were delivered we didn't see her again for 10 minutes. We ordered a cheese crisp appetizer and asked for hotter salsa. We wait and wait and wait. Can't even find her to ask for our appetizer. Our food comes. Delivered by the manager. We complain and he says he will make sure to remove the charge for the mix up. Well since the appetizer was never brought out we'd hope so. He brings our hot salsa and we get refills. So we eat our food and after the waiting and the lack of service, our food was surprisingly DELICIOUS! I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga with green sauce over it. OMG it was worth it. I did order the guacamole for $1 and it was literally a teaspoon serving. Seriously macayos? we ate and left. That was a 3 star visit due to the horrible service.   2nd visit was a Friday afternoon. Great service. Ordered the same dish. NOT the same flavor. Not sure why or what happened but I didn't even finish it. It was way off on flavor. I will say we did order the appetizer of \"green tamale bites\" holy mother of God those were DELICIOUS! I told my sis next time that's all I'm getting. I was amazed at how scrumptious those little suckers were. Worth any wait, screw up, or service. 4 stars for the tamale bites and service. We will be back. It's worth it just speak up when we get a bad server."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. We did feel like the waiter was rushing us. Male named Barney. He did a great job as far as drinks and refills. The Cinco de Mayo margarita was ok. Food was all delicious. Ask for the patio by the water if you can get one."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favorites to go when the family gets together. Their margaritas are so delicious. I've had different things from their menu and I've loved each one of them."}
{"text":"Yosha is awesome! We sat in the bar and I swear the food came out before we ordered it. On a Friday night no less?! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The location is my favorite the service tonight was great just like every other time I go here. Thanks to the whole staff tonight for taking such great care of my family and I. Recommend highly perfect place for your next stop for family dinner."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. We waited for over 30 minutes to have a waiter come over. When I asked the hostess if we were ever going to get served she said she would let the waiter know but instead she took a to go order. I will not be going back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Love sitting on their patio by the water! Great service, excellent food ! One of my favorite places to eat! Becky was friendly and brought us our food promptly"}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant as a family numerous times. We particularly enjoyed the big booths and the kids buffet on Sundays which has sadly gone away. I hate to say we will stop going. The quality has continued to go down and down. The menu has become limited with less and less items on the menu. Some of the favs are still there but I feel more like Chef Mic(rowave) is doing the cooking with what surely is canned sauces and beans with CostCo pre-made rotisserie chicken. The kids menu (and I know it's a kids menu, so it's limited) has boxed macaroni and cheese with canned fruit. Sadly, they had a better meal than we did. The server was nice but she wasn't very available even though the restaurant was nearly empty. The food took long as well. Again, the restaurant was empty-ish so I don't understand the lack of attention and speed. As we left, a large party was coming in so the staff got tables together but left the excess chairs simply in the aisles where they pulled them back to move the associated tables. Fundamentally, it was clean and the food was average but we should have gone elsewhere and will from now on."}
{"text":"Good food. A little pricey for what you get. Terrible service. Was there yesterday in the bar area for the happy hour menu and the bartender was our waitress. She was horrible and acted as if we were a inconvenience to her. It wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 1 extra star since I love the sauce that they sell at stores for enchiladas. So I decided to go here and give the real thing a try. Man was I surprised....they dont even use their own sauce they sell. The sauce that landed on my tongue was gross, I tried to start over in my head thinking maybe I was expecting to much but the meat inside was not any better. To top all this off the sewer was over flowing outside and was stinking up the night air. Even though my wife said she liked what she ate this is my review and I would never return. Learn from this review and use the sauce that you sell at Walmart and things will start to get better."}
{"text":"Service is good and so are the cheese crisps. But, the tacos have so much cabbage you are drowing in it. If you like cabbage, eat the tacos. They undercooked my friends fish taco, but, the waiter handled it well and assessed the situation. Anyway, Macayo's is an OK place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was good as always,  but the customer service was crap. The happy hour posted every where is not valid anywhere other than the bar upstairs. I got no discount on the appetizer after seeing multiple signs stating half price appetizers and drinks. A bill for almost $60.00, for poor customer service, and on top of it all I was practically sharing my chips and salsa with the pigeons.  I will not be back. Check your bill if you choose to eat here, they are on the hustle ;)"}
{"text":"where to begin? how about a capitol T for terrible. I have been going to Macayo's off and on over the years....  Last night I took a friend from out of town there for dinner.  I felt confident that the food and service would be pretty good.  Well, not so.  Besides the presentation of our meals being amateurish and unappealing the food was tired and dried up.  Laughing as I write these words but, it's the truth.  The waitress was sweet and tried to do her best but, we sat there for 1/2 hour before they took our order.  Then to the food. Honestly,  I had a beef tostada and the flavor was unrecognizable and the beans were like paste.  The bean tostada that my friend was attempting to eat was completely unacceptable.  Now, how hard is it to pull off something as simple as a Bean Tostada... really?  The waitress offered to get us more food, different food etc.  What we really should have recieved was a refund and an apology."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Macayo's for years since it opened in the 1980's. This last time was disappointing. We ate in the bar area and the music was way louder than it needed to be. Also our waitress (April) could barely speak English and would get visibly frustrated at us because we couldn't understand her especially over the loud music playing. Her service was OK and the food was good. We live closer to the Litchfield restaurant but made the 13 mile drive to this location because the food and the service have really gone down at the Litchfield location.  It's sad to see this valley institution in such decline. I hope they can turn it around."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Macayo's in town. We went for my wifes birthday she had carne asada chimi and I had carnitas enchilada and it was all great! The meat was tender and flavorful. Our server was on the ball making sure we had napkins, hot salsa and most importantly margarita refills. Even the owner came up tho talk with us for a bit because my wife has a 25 year old collectable Macayos mug we had a great time. Dependable food quality and service each time we go. We were happy and already plan on going next weekend."}
{"text":"My fave Mexican Restaurant in AZ, love the cheese crisps :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always ate at Macayos. Enchiladas with Baja sauce, side of refried beans. (Don't care too much for the rice) Last night Chose to get a different Enchilada so I got a cheese one. Just Cheese? No onions inside, no flavor whatsoever. Our Waitress was nice and got our drinks when they got low. Salsa and chips are always good. What I don't understand is, why does it look like we're eating out of a silver dog dish bowl that the chips come in?! Put some paper in there or something! Here's some negatives about the place in general. Dirty! Tables and Booths are nasty, food stuck in the Booth where we were sitting. Table is old and could use a good paint job. They have fake plants hanging from the ceiling that have dust all over them and blowing around near the vents and over customers food! Way too much Decor. Smells like crap when you walk in cause the Men & Womens Restroom is right there as you walk in near the waiting area. Never have Splenda for Iced Tea, C'mon really? You have all the other sugars. I love Macayos food, but they sure do need to keep up with the place. It needs a deep cleaning bad! Play some music too. It sucks to hear everyone's conversations and babies crying around you. Other than all that I mentioned. I'll still come to have lunch or dinner there. :)"}
{"text":"This was the worse Mexican food I've had in years (and I eat at a lot of little stands, random bertos, and all level of restaurant). I had been to the old central location. This experience reminded me why I had not gone there in so long.  The food was gross. I got the carne asada chimmi. The meat was like they boiled the steak, and not good quality steak at that. The rice was dry and oddly cooked. The beans looked all crusted across the top like they had sat on the plate for hours. My husband got a shredded beef chimmi. He said it was gross and it made him need a restroom. My daughter got a burger. It was a crappy, preformed party with over grassy fries. My son had the kids taco platter. He loves tacos usually but only ended up eating the beans because the taco meat was icky. It tasted like corned beef from a can or some other random meat... ew. Also, as I left, I noticed trash and food under all the tables, including the \"clean\" ones.  The one star is for the waitress, she was just fine."}
{"text":"The food was less than average at best. To top it off, the check came and they overcharge me. The Mgr came by and made the correction. I Checked my bank and it still shows the overcharged amount.  The Mgr said it takes 48 hrs to clear. He was not even sincere about it.  Hmmmm seems like this could be the norm. There are other places around that seem like they would want you business.  No Bien."}
{"text":"Whenever my boyfriend is in town and we are nearby we always go here for the fajita bowl. Great service amazing food. Would recommend anyone to go here"}
{"text":"The Chicken Maximillion is a dish they had on the men a couple decades ago.... Now resurrected and updated... It was a burst of flavored that my taste buds were not expecting. Great house margarita and great wait staff."}
{"text":"Hands down best cheese crisp in town. Mmm mmm. Service is average, hubby loves the steak as well. We've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"I had made reservations for our group of 20.  When we arrived, our table was ready.  (Our group has been places where this has not happened.)  Richard was our waiter, the only one for all of us.  He was excellent!  Our food all came out at the same time!  (again, this is rare)  The food was hot and freshly made.  When it was time for checks, he had everyone of us on separate checks without any problems.  There was not one mistake anywhere.  He gave the correct checks to each person without asking who got what.  Even people needing change got the correct folder back.  Thank you, Macayo's, for a very good experience today,"}
{"text":"Came to get food...... Was waiting for about 15 mins, no any server showed up. I asked hostess about server. She acted as didn't care. Wait more????? Kidding ??? Just LEFT! I can put money to different restaurant who cares!"}
{"text":"I am a fan.  Aside from the tacky decor.  Me and my mom can come here for a casual lunch.  Spend $6.99 for an order of mini chimichangas, split it!, and then leave full. (Always get a side of the delicious Baja sauce... mmm.... clogged arteries....)  Their portions are GIGANTIC, but it seems like they're working on that and may have improved.  I do love you Macayos.  You're easy, consistent, cheap, and tasty."}
{"text":"Just okay mexican food. When visiting Arizona I went to 10 New Mexican food places and Macayos was about my 5th favorite. A little overpriced!"}
{"text":"Cleary a one star Mexican restaurant.  Wow, food is very blah.  That may explain why this place is not very busy on a Sunday evening while other places you have to wait 30 minutes.   Very disappointed in the quality of the food.  It's been about 3 years since I tried this place again and now I remember why I don't come here even though we live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ever get hungry but don't have a taste for anything in particular? Wanna eat but don't want to cook, drive very far, or wait a long time? This is how we ended up at Macayo Mexican Kitchen. And I must admit, when I left, I was full, so it definitely got the job done, albeit without any fanfare or fuss.   This place is typical restaurant Mexican...loud tropical-ish decor, standard chips and salsa (which was actually fresh tasting) despite looking like it was out of a jar. I think margaritas are a big part of the draw, but I stuck with Dos Equis. So I got the carne asada burrito, which looked pretty gargantuan, but after I dumped it out of the tortilla it wasn't a ton of meat, quite unlike my friend's carnitas which was a GINORMOUS portion. Either way, the carne asada was tasty and tender, beans and rice that came with were pretty basic but definitely edible, especially when jazzed up with a bit of pico de gallo. The guacamole, was a ginormous portion, more than two piglets could handle and that rarely happens. All in all, this place is good in a pinch, but I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! Worst place ever! It was dirty, loud, obnoxious and just plain gross. My tortilla soup was not even real tortilla soup it came with cabbage, celery and beef broth which is so weird. The fajitas came with green chilies instead of green peppers...maybe they ran out or something but that was bizarre. The lettuce was brown, tomatoes were old, my avocado and guacamole were brown too. So so so terrible. I can't believe we paid to eat there and I really don't know why we stayed. As soon as I walked in and saw the cheesy decor and the balloon man pestering patrons for tips, we should have ran for the door!   Risa if this is an Arizona standard then I'm never eating Mexican in AZ again :)"}
{"text":"MACAYOS IS ALWAYS GOOD SERVICE AND the food on the most part is always great. Hate their cheese- they use a spread type of cheese in their cheese enchiladas and i isn't firm...awful enchilada sauce...but chimis... tacos ..burros are all good! Tthe management runs everything smooth and the pricing is comparable to what is in the area. A must go to if u haven't been to a Macayos!!!"}
{"text":"Chips were stale. Salsa was mediocre. The beans had a weird aftertaste in the lettuce smelled strange. Poor quality food."}
{"text":"The honorable Mister Barack Obama came here to eat and quite frankly I don't see why.  Hopefully he was just in the area and this wasn't actually on his agenda.  The food was not all that great and the service wasn't up to par either.  The funniest thing about it was we were the only ones there on this particular evening.  Anyhow, I think there are probably better places to eat in the area.  The building is very large and multi colored.  The bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable."}
{"text":"Not very happy with the recent changes from the \"new CEO\". I was told last night that the red chili and green chili burros have been REMOVED from their menu effective 9/1. Really? Why? That's a staple in any mexican food restaurant! I will give credit to the staff for helping me find something close to a red chili burro, but it's just not the same. I took my order to go and when I got home I also noticed that we only received MAYBE a 1/4 bag of chips when we used to get a full one AND the plasticware was so flimsy I had to throw it out - I can find better product at a dollar store. Where is this guy from? New York City? I won't be going back. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED...and I've been frequenting this restaurant for YEARS!"}
{"text":"We went here for my Daughter-in law's birthday last Saturday.  Our family are either vegetarians or vegans and some places you go, the server gives the eye roll when you order things without cheese or whatever.  Not in this case.  Great attentive server (I asked her name and it is Karen Sanders) and the beer and pop were kept filled.  I brought a cake and forgot candles and plates and no problem, they took it in the back and set it all up and sang to my daughter in law.  It's really nice to go out with a group and have everyone satisfied.  (and the cherry on top - Orange Blossom beer on draft...."}
{"text":"I have been to this Macayo's restaurant several times since my family and I have lived in Surprise and every time we have been to this restaurant it's a nightmare. The food is always served on the cold side or so bland with no flavor it's gross, not to mention the service every time is terrible. I officially hate this restaurant and I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a great time, dinner was great and our server Ashley was a rock star managing our large party keeping a smile on her face, great conversation while also who managing a lot of other tables"}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa and awesome cucumber and cilantro margaritas. We had excellent customer service. Thanks Melinda"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty bland for the most part - but they are always wonderful at accommodating our large family group (and special order requests to fit our dietary restrictions). We've been coming for years and the quality is consistent.  I've found the service to be pleasant and warm - ditto the food. It's a place the whole family enjoys going to - so I'm guessing we'll continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Get the queso dip with chips for sure. I had the Baja Burro and was delish! Chicken was better than the shredded beef if you are having trouble deciding"}
{"text":"We stopped here for supper after a friend recommended this as she's been there before, Im actually visiting from the north east so not familiar with this place at all. I'm hoping my experience tonight was a fluke.....  Let's start with the decor its almost typical, really bright pastel colors, older building. It actually looked like it was going to be fun. We told the hostess we were in for dinner and she asked if we wanted to sit upstairs or down, I didn't know it was two different areas etc. She said there were Tvs upstairs and we could seat ourselves or if we wanted to be seated to sit downstairs, we sat downstairs and that was probably our mistake. The odd thing with the decor is the loft of creepy animals... Hippos, giraffes, zebras etc.. Looked more like an African Safari than a Mexican joint...   The server came over realized she forgot her pen, or someone stole it so she would  be back.. We got a story on how many pens she goes through etc, it was mildly amusing actually. She failed to come back for a bit. We looked up and she was dropping off checks etc. Finally got a beverage and chips and she disappeared again. It was slightly busy so we were understanding for a bit. The manager walked through the dining room looking at the floor instead of the tables so we couldn't even grab him to say we hadn't ordered yet.  Another 5-10 minutes our server noticed us and ran over and wouldn't ya know she still didn't have a pen and couldn't take our order, she went to get a pen or so we thought. We were all slightly annoyed but understanding since the party of 9 behind asked for separate checks.   We finally asked if she was going to take our order and the server actually got another server to wait on us and she said, I won't be able to give you good service so she passed us off to the new server who was definitely a lot better but at this point it's already been a while.  We placed our order and food was out in minutes, my soup had a huge chicken breast in it which was great had I been able to get it on the spoon lol. See pic. It was like half the cup, it was really tasty though so I was pretty stoked. I had the stuffed pablano, which was awesome. My friends had the shrimp chi I which were also awesome.  End of the day the food was good but customer service kinda sucked. I'd go back next time I'm in AZ to give it another shot because of the food"}
{"text":"I want to be nice, but seriously this place sucks.  It has reheated food and is definitely not authentic.  If you want Mexican food, go literally anywhere else.  Chipotle is a much better choice!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed we ate and everything was bad from poor slow service to food coming out wrong. Then when asked for a manager no one ever came over. So I sent a very detailed email without a response, call or any kind of contact at all. With all the other nice Mexican restaurants around you would think they would try to make customers happy. I really wish I had read the reviews before coming in."}
{"text":"Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about..."}
{"text":"Tried it yesterday, because Los Dos Molinos was closed and I wanted to try a new Mexican place.  The service was good.  The margarita was decent.  I tried the carnitas.  Bland.  The beans were terrible.  The food was subpar."}
{"text":"Always great food but today we had an even better waitress (Tessa) she was prompt, courteous, and friendly. Thanks Tessa for being what ever waiter or waitress should be!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Mexican food restaurants that I've been too. I have been there twice once for carry out and once for sit down service. The food tasted OK portions were very small for the carry out order and the cost was more expensive than I expected. We went to dinner to try again, but we were disappointed again. The total was over 50.00, we had one beer one soda and one cheese crisp appetizer that had been sitting somewhere because it came out cold, two cheese enchiladas and one burrito. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is not that great. I've only been here twice and each time the food was bland. My kids did love the scenery inside because its decorated with a jungle theme. Prices are a bit high and the wait for the actual food was long. I probably wont return because I prefer a more authentic taste."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and great food.  Little to no wait.  Free chips and salsa.  Very friendly staff.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went to diner tonight because my family and I were craving Mexican food so we chose maycos not only was the food bad but the service was horrible the only good service we received was from the buss boy and he wasn't even our waiter. We had order a plate of fries they weren't cooked all the way there was about 15 fries for 3.99 there should be more we told the manager about it what does he do takes the same fries and microwaves them comes back with the same amount of fries but a new plate why not just make a new order instead over cooking the fries to where none of my family members could eat them I work with food and I know my manager would have made me make a new batch of fries and also our cheese crisp was burnt, worst service and food never going back! Never again!"}
{"text":"Sat at a table yesterday 6:30 pm to have dinner out with my son. Sat there for 25 minutes being completely ignored ! No chips/salsa, no drinks, just ignored us. Tried to get attention of server but they all ignored us so we walked out BAD"}
{"text":"Went to Macayo 's order the Baja pizza. Worst ever no longer a fan of there food. All it had on it was some spicy cheesy sauce and I ordered it with pork instead of chicken.  To my dismay the amount of pork could fit on a teaspoon. They used to have a happy hour that was not present @ happy hour. Also found out there well tequila was piss poor. So order a premium Margarita. Good luck on quality of food!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had dinner at Macayo's last night.  Since it's winter time in Arizona, the snowbirds are flocking to the warm weather and all the restaurants are really busy...including Macayo's.  The service was slow, but adequate...we eat here all year long and the service is much quicker in the summer.  The food was about average."}
{"text":"Very good food, huge portions. Great service! Waitress was very friendly.  Nice beverage menu too."}
{"text":"Oh Macayo.... You are a part of my youth, and I am destine to return to you .... The food is predictably decent, drinks are reasonable, service is good."}
{"text":"The best way I can talk about Macayo's is by talking about Applebees.   If you love Applebees,  skip my review and read someone's else,  because you won't get anything from mine.   Applebees is like a super-standardized generic nationwide culinary equivalent of elevator music.     They will sell you food,  it will be OK,  nothing will offend you nor amaze you.    Applebees could disappear from the universe and a year later nobody would remember it ever existed.     And that is how Macayo's would be...    a forgettable yet inoffensive food place that will feed you for money and send you on your way..    EXCEPT the food is actually quite good!       Every few months I head in here,  and every time I expect to just buy some whatever food and shove it in my face and not be hungry any more blah blah blah...  but then right there in the middle of my meal I realize I'm really enjoying myself,  and the food is really tasty!        Mexican comfort food.. mmmmm     OK if that didn't make any sense to you,  I'm sorry.   Read another review and forget I said anything..."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to this restaurant.  Went on a Monday night so it wasn't crowded so of course we were greeted and seated right away. Our waiter was polite. My husband and I both thought the food was great. He also ordered an Arizona Sunset margarita which we thought was amazing as well.  We are relocating to the Goodyear area this summer and hope this will be our new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a belated Valentine's dinner. We arrived about 5:30PM and were promptly greeted as we entered.   There was no wait and were seated right away.    My wife had a chimichanga special and I ordered the \"mex and match\" with two enchiladas (one chicken and one shredded beef). The chips and salsa \"appetizer\" was less than good. Half of the chips were crumbled small pieces of chips. Also, some the chips were soft, so they we either stale or under cooked.  The salsa was good.  Our meals were ok. My wife enjoyed her chimichanga, rice & beans. My enchiladas and rice were ok, nothing special.  Our waitress was nice. We ordered water with NO lemon when we sat down and she brought us water WITH lemon. No big deal.   My wife wanted to order sopapillas after dinner, but the waitress didn't even ask about dessert, she just bright us the check and walked away. I know we could have asked, but we decided to just go somewhere else.  I suppose we might go back someday, but not soon. Plenty of other Mexican restaurants to try."}
{"text":"It's a Valley staple. It's not the best, but it could be much, much worse. I make it here about once a year. The place is usually packed. The decor is bizarre. The margaritas are good. The chips and salsa are pretty damn good. The food is meh. The service is always friendly."}
{"text":"#macayos. Every Wednesday .99 cent tacos only allows each customer 2.  That's right 2, had I known that I wouldn't have come in here.  Even with a side my tummy is still hungry.  My waiter tells me there the big ones they will fill you up... Wait so there are 2 sizes of hard shell tacos???  He tried it!!!!  If I'm paying for it why can't I order it... (grumble grumble) yes that's my tummy you hear!!!  Thanks for nothing #Macayos"}
{"text":"I guess I'm all done now. We went last Friday for a family dinner (6 adults, one 11 yr old), and our server was nowhere to be found through much of the meal.  Our food was brought by someone else (normal) but then we asked other servers and bussers for soda and water refills. ***When the bill came, the charge for soda for us (two people, our son only wanted water) was $18.00*** When she finally can back to pick up the cards, REEEEEEEKING Of cigarette smoke -aha! That's why she was gone the whole night-  I asked very nicely if perhaps all six of the adult's sodas had been added to our bill?  And the server, a young woman, replied that the soda refills are not free.  So every time we had asked someone else to get us a soda, they added it to our bill without mentioning that in a Mexican food restaurant with hot spicy food, the refills are NOW suddenly a charge (been going for more than 20 years so this is recent).  I gently and politely offered that perhaps they should mention that to guests, as this could really be a problem for someone.  We paid our $88 bill for three meals and $18 worth of soda and we left.   It's just... After all the problems we've had in multiple occasions... I just can't. I'm al done."}
{"text":"The worst service..it was not busy at all and server messed up friends order, on the 3rd try the manager came over and asked \"do you want me to make it right?\" \"3rd times the charm\"."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had in my life. The bratty waitress with the nose ring was literally making me feel embarrassed and ashamed for even setting foot in that horrible excuse for a restaurant. Anything we asked her such as \"hey can I get a refill on my cup?\" Or \"hey can I get more salsa?\" she must have taken it as a complaint or perceived it as we were being rude? I have no clue but she was unbelievable by how bad she really was. I understand having a bad day or not feeling enthusiastic 24/7 and especially at work but it honestly felt like the waitress was trying to be the rudest she could be. The managers need to do a better job hiring people that provide a good experience to the customer rather than these rude kids. I was disgusted when I left and I don't think I will ever go here again."}
{"text":"We had the best service on Friday night.  Our server Ciara was excellent and was so helpful with menu suggestions and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is sloooowwwww. Our waitress just disappears completely and is no where to be found.  Better service would have given 4 -5 stars."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years! We took a colleague for a birthday lunch and it was a great idea to visit this spot.  The service was excellent and the food was great. I think they remodelled recently but it could still use a little updating upstairs. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Macayos is one of my favorite restaurants for mexican food and drinks, I was over there last Friday with a girlfriend, for happy hour, Ernesto one of the bartender was very attentive, courteous and made some great margaritas, I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"We  ordered a vegetarian  chimi changa grande and confirmed 3 -4 times about refried beans and they still  served food with beef and screwed our dinner .  Service was very bad."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I start.  When  we first walked in, we waited about five minutes before the waitress came around.  She took our order and it took about another five to ten minutes before she brought our drinks.  I could understand if the place was busy but that wasn't the case here.   when they brought out the tortia's, they were not cooked, do we had to send them back, then the waitress forgot the rice on my wife's order.  To top it all of the place wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Working my way through my Phoenix trip, my next dinner out was to meet yet another \"old\" friend from high school. This one, I hadn't seen in almost 21 years and thanks to FB we got reconnected.   MacAyo's is another local Mexican chain restaurant. This location is the newest probably open about 8 or 9 years now. Long ago, the location on Central Avenue was all the rage, but like any chain, sometimes growth does not necessarily equate to great.  My friend and I shared a cheese crisp. I like the one here better than the one at Garcia's. I also had a shredded beef taco and black beans and rice. The taco had much better flavor than Garcia's and the beans were good. We each had a house margarita and I only drank half. Not because I was getting sauced, but because it was kind of nasty.   All in all decent, but not blow me away good. Might come back but there are several other great Mexican food restaurants in the Valley that I will have to visit next time. Sadly with mom living in Sun City West, the schlep to get to some of these places is a bit too great.  The waiter again was nice and accommodating. My friend and I had such a great time getting reconnected we also closed down this restaurant and then sat in front chatting till around midnight. This became the second night I did the tip toe walk through my mom's house hoping not to wake anyone up..."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick bite and drink after a not so good day. I was greeted by Becky; she hands down turned my mood around with her cheerful genuine personality. she went above and beyond to meet my needs. I will definitely be back and ask for her personally. If you come to this location, I highly recommend her for an outstanding experience. loved her!! oh & the cheese crisp was good too..."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. However went there a few days ago and paid a prett good amount. That being said the food just didnt seem like it wasnt worth the price. I can honestly say that i could have spent way less at a better mexican place."}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix and used to go to Macayo's on Central a lot  for special occasions.  it was an event back then. So I was excited when they built one out in Surprise.  We used to eat there a lot when they first opened.  However, over time, the service, cleanliness and quality of the meal decreased.  We haven't been back in more than a year now."}
{"text":"Well we ended up trying this place again since our daughter and friends wanted to eat here. I do have to say! It was a lot better than our first visit? Daughter and I shared a combo platter. I enjoyed their ground beef burrito. Daughter had their beef taco. Wife shared a appetizer platter with mother. They thought it was awesome. Because of our second visit, we will give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"Macayo's is a trustworthy source for exceptional Mexican food. Why else would the company be around since the mid 50's? The food is really great-it doesn't matter what you order really. And their salsa...oh man, their salsa is SO fresh and cold and delicious! I honestly think I go through four bowls of salsa per visit...NO joke.   The chicken tacos are the best I've ever had so that is my staple when I go there. And of course, on a hot summer day there is nothing better than a frosty frozen margarita.   In my estimation, you can't go wrong with this valley favorite. Although there are times when the service is less than exceptional, these occassions are few and far between. If you haven't tried Macayo's yet, do yourself a favor and experience first hand what great Mexican is all about!   There's a reason its been a valley favorite for over fifty years!"}
{"text":"Our family had loved Macayo's for decades. Unfortunately, we are extremely disappointed in what they have become. It must have changed owners or management in the Mesa location.  The renovation turned out horrible and makes the atmosphere so bland and depressing. We witnessed 2 guests and 3 separate staff members hitting their heads on the new lamps. Just seems to be an upward, uncomfortable environment now. More importantly, the menu selections, taste and salsa have changed.  Just as bland as the decor. Why did they mess with it? We certainly will not be going back."}
{"text":"We used to live right around the corner from this location. In the years it's been there they seemed to have lost their cleaning crew. This visit the bathrooms were dark, perhaps to hide the filth or perhaps they weren't turned up from last nights dinner. I hope it was the latter. The rug seemed in need of a good cleaning too. Our server was new, she struggled to find her groove waiting on us for lunch. She didn't know her menu when we asked questions. It was slow so info was easily obtained by a server in the next station. It's not authentic Mexican but decent food none the less. I do love that if you buy their glass you do get cheap refills for margaritas."}
{"text":"... I've been to this particular Macayo's multiple times without any issue. I'm basing this review off our last visit on Saturday. The waitress was so amazing that she drained my wallet of any and all remaining dollars! Haha!  I ordered the chicken California burro which is a staple whenever I visit and my husband had the variety sampler of the enchiladas! He never finishes his food (ever) and he gobbled it all up! I love my CA burro because it tastes fresh and it's big enough to take half home.. But I normally push myself a little too hard to finish it all in one sitting! Ha!  Last visit was 5 stars, but giving a 4 because we normally visit in a larger group and it can be difficult for staff to accommodate 10 or more."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free and vegan menus. Food was outstanding as well as the service. Nothing bad out this resturant."}
{"text":"Chimis were delish. I like this place because it might be one of the few Mexican restaurants that I know of that has a great atmosphere. I love the lake view. We'd go back!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner and drinks the food is always amazing and drinks are good, Richard our bartender makes great drinks and very good customer relation! Just wish the hours were open longer being amongst  the younger adults in surprise it would be nice to have a good spot for great food and drinks that doesn't close at 10pm.."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous but the service is terrible! Went there two weeks ago and had to wait over an hour for our food and total time there was two hours! Then went there Thursday night and once again the service was very slow and had to go find a waitress to refill our drinks because ours was MIA!! Will go back for the food but will make sure we have two hours to waste!!"}
{"text":"Took the kids here lastnight for dinner.  I woke up, that is a good sign.  I am bummed to see that in 2 years we were away, this place really took a dive.  The prices went up, thequality of the food went down and got smaller, the service was awful,  our order was all jacked up.  I could go on and on. Just because my son and I ask for no sauce doesn't mean we don't want the sour cream.  The shit was dry and we had to power down our food with soda shots like we were on Fear Factor.  No refills... Chips sucked. Ok, thats right I was trying to stop the \"compliment\" train.   We used to love coming here, now we will add it to the don't eat at list with Carrapas.  Even our server looked like he would have rather been anywhere but there.  Sad thing is, I remember him from when we used to dine here all of the time.  Poor guy used to be so chipper and happy.  Place sucked the life right out of him.  My one complaint is about paying.  I used to be a server, I know how this works.  All I had on me was a $100.  Dinner came to roughly $40.00.  All large bills when he gave me change.  Yes, I know they aren't a bank.  And I did not take off stars because of this gripe.  But just because I pay like a high roller doesnt mean I am one, and I am not going to over tip because all of the sudden once you saw my loot you thought you could save the last 90 minutes of torture we endured.  A $5 and 5 ones would have been nice. There was NO way I was about to spot a $20!   When a customer sits at your station why don't you treat them like a friend, not a bastard step child and maybe, just maybe I would have spotted you a few extra bones for making the most of the crappy night."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Hadn't been in over a year because of the same problem the last time.   Sat for 20 minutes before a waiter came by, then didn't get our drinks for another 15 minutes.  Patio area was filthy.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place used to concern me with its service, but that has greatly increase! One of the fastest services in town. Great Mexican food. I love their salsa."}
{"text":"I've never written a negative review in my entire life. I ordered Macayo 's for my daughters bridal shower.  This was her request.  The food was to arrive at 1:45pm.  At 2pm no food and we called. No answer. At 2:15 no food so we called again and again no one answered. Finally around 2:30pm Macayo 's answered. The lady told me that their catering guy left an hour ago.  She said she would call him. We called back and they said they could not get ahold of him but they would make new food and send it right over.  She also said we certainly would not be charged. At 4pm the food arrived (all the guests had left). He said that Macayo's sent him to a \"vacant lot\" and he was very sorry. I didn't ask him if he was driver #1 or driver # 2 nor did I ask him what he was doing in the vacant lot for an hour. Nevertheless the food was soggy and cold and even though we were told we would not be charged, we certainly were....the entire amount.  I called again with my concerns and was told the manager would call me. Guess who never called.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Won't go back again.  It been over a year since I visited Macayo's.  I use to go to Macayo's often but stopped when the service and quality of food started to decline.  However, today, I thought I would give Macayo's another chance.   The quality of food and service is worse then I remembered.  Macayo's has competitive pricing for a typical Mexican restaurant in the area, however, the food just isn't good and the service borders on teribble.  So, lets start with the service. The service at this Macayo's location  has always been ridiculously slow.  Today, I anticipated slow service due to large crowds on Valentines Day.  What I did not expect was having to wait 20 minutes for a refill on soda, then having a to ask a bus person for a refill, and once I received the refill finding something floating on top, and waiting another 10 minutes for a drink. I waited once again over 10 minutes, for a to go box, and another 20 minutes after our server took my credit card for payment.     Let's move onto the food.  The entrees themselves are not good.  It seems that I have always had an issue with one thing or another on my past few visits.  Today, we had a cheese crisp, which was served on a stale tortilla with very little cheese.  In fact the cheese peeled off from the tortilla.  My nephew had the kids taco plate, which he did not like.  He mentioned the meat tasted \"funny\". I tried one of tacos and agreed the taco meat was greasy and tasteless. I had the tamale bites with Baja Sauce and although the tamale bites were good the Baja sauce tasted old and had a thick \"skim\" layer on top that I discarded. Once again our server was no where to be found.   All in all a horrible dining experience.  We were at Macayo's for over an hour forty minutes because we waited for chips, waited for drink, waited for bill, waited for to go containers, waited for server to return my credit card."}
{"text":"Brought my dad here for dinner, as we were craving Mexican food and am glad we did! Not only did we receive top-notch service (Many thanks to our amazing waiter, Ken), but our food was so good and served in a matter of minutes from when we ordered it. And you thought only Jimmy John's served your food to you lightning fast?!   Ken made sure our glasses were filled, checked in on us to see how we liked our meals, and was very efficient. He also pronounced my dad's last name correctly when giving him back his credit card after dad paid the bill. That deserves kudos in my eyes right there as my family last name is hard to pronounce and hard to spell for many people, despite it only being 6 letters.   I had the Baja Chimi and it was so good and filling! I will definitely order that again!   Great service + great food + great company=An outstanding experience!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great food. Awesome service. Perfect venue for parties.   Enough said."}
{"text":"3* Macayo's 6012 W. Bell Glendale Mexican Happy Hour; liked the Dos Equis Lager on tap Friendly service by Giovanna The fish tacos were okay Good carnitas Liked the chipotle BBQ chicken salad"}
{"text":"I am not much of a Mexican food eater so I will go by what my kids and wife ate. I will address the service part of it though myself. The kids said that their cheese tortilla and carne asada chimichanga were ok. Not the best though and I asked them why and they said not much taste to it. The beans and rice were overcooked was another comment. The wife was not impressed with her meal as well. I had a regular burger and it was ok.   The service though was awful. The server was slow, served us the wrong drinks, spilled sauces on me and didn't even say sorry. He did bring me 1 napkin to clean up. We paid 55 bucks for the 4 of us and with service and food it was awful and this place deserved a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation for spring training at the reccomendation of my Mom and Sister. The food was spot on, and friendly service at a great price, good size portions too!"}
{"text":"Most recent experiences: Have had some hiccups with pick ups, but that was largely the fault of the app and not this restaurant's fault or the staff. Furthermore, some of the employees are genuinely friendly and were working hard to get me my order as quick as they could. Thanks."}
{"text":"Every time we order at Macayo's the food is wonderful all the staff is awesome. Today Caitlyn took our order and she was so sweet, patient and extremely thoughtful. She took her time, and she also went back over the order just to be sure that I hadn't missed anything. I also spoke to Benny the manager he was also very pleasant and kind. Our food was excellent, and everyone loved it. Caitlyn thank you for making our get together so much fun! We love Macayo's and all her staff!!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, at a glance it's obvious that the restaurant has not been taken care of.  It's old, worn out looking, really needs some TLC to be sure.  But once you get past that, everything else is great.  Very friendly and fast service, free hot and fresh unlimited nacho chips with salsa to start and the menu is pretty good in terms of options.  I tried the Chimichanga!  And it was great!  There are a few versions of the chimichanga, and variations on that between a regular dish and a full dinner portion.  Overall I was very pleased with the meal and the service.  Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Came here for some Mexican food ( the best comfort food) from a day of packing and moving. Was a great atmosphere, the staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. We had Linda S. As our server and she was amazing!!!!  Linda thank you so much for great service and a great time!   Our food was delicious and was received very quickly. Our drinks would hit bottom as a new glass of drink would be there without asking! The best part was the manager went in on our prank to trick our server for some fun!   Great place to go and unwind. Casual crowd, great food and friendly staff all earn it FIVE big ones!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this has such bad reviews. Our server was great and very attentive. Our food was good, our son loved the enchiladas. My chicken tacos were good, a smidge on the dry side but still good. Satisfied our craving for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance. Restaurant is a modern Mexican decor. Lots of tables.   Service is pretty good. Chips and salsa brought to your table quickly.  Order the guacamole is pretty good Service was fast and efficient. Waiter was friendly and polite.   Food is decent. Not bad food. We ordered several plates. Fajitas, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and couple of salads. We were not disappointed with the food. Food have a nice trendy presentation.  Percepción is everything and they do a good job with food presentation.  Only complain / observation , meat was cold on the steak salad  Ice lagoon behind restaurante beware of the geese. They may chase you down, if you bother them.  Overall good visit. I would comeback to this place. Good for a couple lunch or dinner or a family lunch lunch r dinner."}
{"text":"I am rating their take out service. I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea, but the \"take out\" area is crappy. You feel like you're in a closet. I know I'm getting it to go, but do we really have to come in the back door and stand in an area that could fit 3 people max? It just really turned me off. Anyway, the price for the food you get is great. I had a chicken burrito enchilada style with rice and beans. It's \"eh\". I've had a lot better, have had worse. It's mediocre. The enchilada sauce on the burrito doesn't really taste like much, the rice has a nasty flavor, and the beans are bland. Favorite thing about the meal? The salsa. That's about it."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this location for over 10 years. I can honestly say I've never had a complaint that's yelp worthy of writing about.    The food has always come out piping hot and fresh. My order is always correct. The place is always busy and imo they handle it well. The staff hustles. My service is always just fine or better, sometimes fantastic! Another thing I love is there is always a friendly hostess to greet you.  My  favorite menu items are: Green corn tamales with baja sauce! (worth every calorie, but don't eat this daily!) Fajita quesadilla Baja chicken quesadilla Mixed mini chimis, no sour cream and guac, with baja sauce Red corn chicken taquitos Chicken poblano (stuffed poblano pepper of chicken goodness! like chile rellenos but with meat!) Baja pizza (but Ajo Al's is even better) Steak Cortez Grilled chicken caesar salad (the chicken is so good!) Tortilla soup Cheeseburger (at least if you have picky kids!) Baja burro (if you haven't noticed by now, you can not go wrong with baja sauce. this is not a place for diets!) Grilled chicken tacos (which I think used to be called the beach tacos) Baja Chimi Sopapillas  I like the rice and beans but never have room for them!   Also, the margaritas are awesome! I don't know if they always have it, but especially prickly pear!! Or original on the rocks,  strawberry blended.  I haven't experienced any of the negative things people wrote in other reviews."}
{"text":"I normally really enjoy eating here but this last experience bothered me. I went for lunch with my sister and son. My sister and I got an app to share and were going to split a lunch entree. My son only wanted a cheese crisp and the kids combo (which isn't much of a combo only one side and no drink included) was 4.75 and when I asked the price for just a Kids cheese crisp the waiter said it was going to 5.95. He said that there is no option to have the kids crisp by itself, they give you the adult size app crisp instead and charge full price. It's only a dollar difference but still, less food for more money."}
{"text":"I'm sad to think that everyone got this $10.00 an hr rises and then they take away there Milatry discount  from us all ,that  pay there $ 10.00 an hr pay increase have to say we waited quite a while for the food to hit the table as well, and I love this place Can't say I'll be back with the Family cause that little bit always helped out. Way did you take it away we fought  for you to have a free country and you go and do this to us not fair not far at all                        K C"}
{"text":"HH is fantastic! $3 Margaritas are what Happy Hour should be about after all! They also offer select appetizers for $3 & $5. A few of my favorites include: tamale bites, red corn chicken taquitos, baja pizza, and large cheese crisp. I've heard the queso dips are pretty fabulous as well.   You can get 1/2 pint of Baja sauce for $2.99 now! If you have ever had the pleasure of eating a Baja Chimi, you know that this is a marvelous announcement. I would swim in that stuff if I could. Though, that is probably highly unrecommended for numerous reasons and I bet it would take A LOT of sauce to fill up a whole pool. That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so.   In my opinion, the best tables in the place are the booths by the windows. Don't forget to watch your step as you are walking up or down the stairs. This has become a bit of a joke between my friends but surely you'll receive the same warning. Just one more example of the great Macayo's customer service. Making sure I do not face plant in a crowded restaurant is rather high on my list so thank you.   No matter when you dine you will receive unlimited chips and salsa and you will get plenty of drink refills. Typically, the food is out fast and pipping hot. On my last visit, food was out in under 10 mins! (We weren't even on our second bowl of chips yet). In the past few years, the menu has been adapting to various dietary needs so they offer gluten free items and (to my delight) calabacitas (their version has corn, zucchini, poblano pepper) have been added to the menu options as well. (Yay!)"}
{"text":"Walked in and had to wait 15 minutes with a dining room half empty.  Hostess said the kitchen was backed up. Then received a horrible margarita that I had to send back. Tasted like frozen ice. Once dinner arrived my entire plate had to be sent back. Rice tasted like a farm smells, beans had a hint of sweet to them and tasted bad. Not sure how you mess up rice and beans but they certainly surprised me.  Needless to say our experience was not good and well not be going back.  Try another place first."}
{"text":"It's good food. Service is slow, friendly, people, nice amphisphere. Good taco Salad they really feed you well. Nachos are constitent refill nachos"}
{"text":"Overpriced wanna be Mexican food. Never again! First and last visit. Tasteless overpriced food. I guess.my famiIy prefers authentic and this is not that. If you enjoy Americanized flavorless food, this place may be for you.    They had a guy making ballon animals and he kept making eye contact with my children yet never made his way to our table.  For aSaturday evening we were seated rather quickly and the place was crowded. Seating way too tight. Felt we were dining with the group next to us   Food bland no seasoning. Chips stale and cold with meh salsa. Margarita was good tho, only good thing about that visit   Rather hit up Raul and Theresas"}
{"text":"Came here on November 6th with my boyfriend. Asked for one taco which was cheaper as I wasn't very hungry and my boyfriend ordered two tacos. We both got two tacos. Boyfriend ordered a lemonade which the waitress forgot about. When he asked for the second time, it came. Paid the bill but did not tip as well since she messed up the order and didn't bring the drink right away. On the 16th I checked my bank account and found that the waitress tipped herself an extra $2.00. Not happy. Normally the food and service are okay,but taking my money is not okay."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the food and the atmosphere. Very friendly staff and the manager does come around to talk to you.  I love their tacos, chimichangas and chips!  They always fill the chips up and I have a huge party when I go there.    With the Mexican food restaurants out there, this one is the best one.  I love the food and the atmosphere they provide. I have always had a friendly waiter, the manager has come to talk to us and even help serve drinks.  They are always aware of when the chip bowl is empty.  I think the only two things that annoy me from there is their rice is not good and their green corn tamales are too smooshy. Other then that I love this place and until I can find a place that wows me with their mexican food, this is it.   If anyone orders a burger from here they really shouldn't be posting a review, wtf is up with that? It's a mexican restaurant not McDonalds."}
{"text":"Holy crap the wildberry margarita is so good!!! I could eat the shrimp and chorizo taquitos all day!! Baja sauce is awesome!! Service is always good!!"}
{"text":"I felt I needed to update my review after my experience this past week at lunchtime with friends. We were seated, per our request, on the patio. I wish I remembered our servers name, she was absolutely the best! She was very attentive but not overly so. If it was guaranteed that she would be our server every time, we would be there every week! Btw, we are the group that we had her take our picture, which she gladly did without complaint."}
{"text":"I've been trying different Mexican food restaurants in the 25 years we've lived in AZ and have decided to NEVER return to macayos, it's so gross. Dell taco makes a better taco, my daughter had a three dollar blue moon, I got to pay 2.86 for an Arnold Palmer. Combo platter is gone, no offer to make one, food prepared at another location, tonight it wasn't even warm. Used to go for sunset margaritas, they keep changing the recipe and now it's 9.00, not even close to being worth it. Adios Macayos"}
{"text":"Macayo's used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant!  I ordered dinner for the whole family to be delivered (they use GrubHub).  They didn't deliver the sopapillas (the restaurant was completely out of sopapillas...that would have been nice to know when I ordered it instead of finding out once it was delivered, sort of makes it hard to change the order at that time.  They also completely forgot the tacos I ordered (an oversight that the girl at Macayo's front desk admitted to).  To top it off, I over paid (8 bucks) for guacamole that barely covered 6 chips (see picture).   Food was decent otherwise, but there are too many other good alternatives in the area so I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"if i could give zero stars i would. our server was the WORST! I am a server and I have never been somewhere with a server that took 15+ minutes to get refills. Never checked on our food. Asked about what specials were for national margarita day and he lied straight to our faces and said there were no specials. waitress at the next table over was explaining the specials to her table. Both mine and my fiances enchiladas were cold and dry as could be. we could barely cut them. couldnt send them back for our server never once checked on our food nor did a manager do a table check. poor service, shitty food, and screaming children to make an overall night completly wasted. we were both still hungry we had to go get dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ill start with why the food is a one star then explain why the service is as well.   First off I judge a Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa. Your food and service can be sub par but if you have amazing chips and salsa I will love it!  Not sure if ours was an old batch, but half our chips were wet and oily and the salsa was just tomato sauce with some canned diced tomatoes. Nothing special or tasty.   I ordered a margarita just the house on the rocks no salt. We were sitting at a cocktail table so I watched the bartender grab a pint glass dump some ice in it then reach for a blender pitcher full of old pre made margarita and pour it in my pint glass. The server brought it out to me I explained that I really wanted a fresh made margarita. After a little discussion I just said no thanks I don't want a margarita anymore ill stick with water.  We finally ordered and then our food arrived and I cut open my chicken chimichanga to find it was beef. And my husbands chile con carne was supposed to come with tortillas. When the waitress came by again I explained that my chimichanga  was wrong and told her I thought my husbands came with tortillas. No apology offered for the mistakes. She just said oh ya  I can get you a side of tortillas if you want, as if she was doing us a favor. When mine finally came out corrected (my husband was done with his food by this point) it was correct but not really good. The chimichanga wasn't crispy (it's fried so it should be crispy, it was pretty soggy) and the black beans were just okay nothing special or flavorful.   Service wise - terrible. Once I sent back the margarita the server was cold, inattentive and refused to speak to me only looking and speaking to my husband. The manager did come by to address \"my question about the margarita\" offering no apologies for their methods just saying that they go through 60 gallons per week of margaritas. So what?!? I want a fresh made margarita not some warm pitcher of old margarita that has been sitting out on the counter for who knows how long. (By the way shouldn't margarita mix be refrigerated?) also after both our orders had issues we never received an apology or a manager visit or a comp or discount. Not expected but still nothing done about the problems.   After all that I have no reason to come back. My husband liked his chile con carne but that's honestly the only positive of the experience.   I guess our search for passable Mexican food continues"}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed this time with the food.  Our last visit the fajitas were \"better\" .. so much more!! See the pic with 5 itsy bitsy pieces of steak meat. The shrimp were small but plentiful for a mixed plate. I did like the finer shredded veggies that had a great char to them. The highlight of my visit was our waiter KYLE!!!!  He was nice and friendly.. made sure our drinks were kept replenished.  Answered all our questions and accommodated our request. We probably wont be back."}
{"text":"I live really close to this location and have to say that it seems to be getting worse and worse on the service. I understand that the servers are busy and they have full sections most of the time but when you wait five minutes to get a drink order and ten minutes before the chips and salsa arrive it is kinda bothersome. I can see if the place was completely packed but every time i come here it seems to get worse not better. oh and dont try to order anything ala carte cause just one chicken enchillada will run you over five dollars, are you fricken kiding me must be made of gold."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito is as good as any, drinks are fairly spendy but good service to offset that. We've been back a couple of times and sat outside. Very safe place at night but where in Surprise Az isn't"}
{"text":"This is my husband & I's favorite Mexican food in town. It's vegetarian friendly. I order the Cheese enchilada w/onions most of the time or Bean and Cheese Burro (burrito) with or without sauce and have never been disappointed. We always choose to eat in the bar, there is never a wait there and service is fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever return to this Macayo's. It is not what it used to be. The service was so-so, when there were only a few other tables being occupied while we were there. Chips and salsa were good, but that's where it ended. My taco was barely warm and was not tasty. My daughter had chicken strips and fries which I sampled. They tasted like the grease has not been changed in a very long time. I was disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. Our waitress kept talking to someone at another table that was obviously a friend. Our food came out looking like it was sitting under a heat lamp forever"}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me to eat at this place. The enchiladas are disgusting. The salsa tastes like cheap store brand salsa. The tortilla chips were cold and sate. I prefer Cantina Laredo in Scottsdale for real Mexican Food Their tortilla chips are hot, their salsa is home made. The fajitas for two are amazing. I'd never step foot in a Macayo's ever again. Just plain nasty chain restaurant garbage."}
{"text":"I love Macayos.  Traditional authentic Mexican food yet still very unique.  Love all the bright colors and atmosphere.  THE BAJA CHIMI!  For that matter anything on their menu with the Baja sauce is to die for.  Really like the salsa.  Good margaritas too."}
{"text":"I love macayo's and this is a great location. Went here for Mother's Day and they gave all the women a single pink or red rose as we were seated. That was nice and thoughtful. The manager came by our table to ensure our service was good. Great menu options."}
{"text":"OK but would not choose it over other great restaurants in the area. Portions are good, but the food did not taste fresh the taquitos, were dripping from lard just not appealing."}
{"text":"So far I have been here 4 times and at all different times of the day. I have no complaints except the wait at times. I have sat at the bar and at a table, food always seems pretty great... not as great and authentic as others but no gripes on taste. The service once seated is very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was subpar and drinks were worse.  How do you not make a patron margarita drinkable?  First time around there was no patron in the drink, then the manager added patron to the already watered down so-called margarita, followed by being charged for all drinks despite other mishaps happening, needless to say it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"It's ok. I used to enjoy coming to this place. It's just plain now. I don't know... The food is ok. atmosphere is also ok for the theme that they are trying to express. I have had better."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last 11 years! You really cannot go wrong on the menu.   I usually order the baja chicken chimichanga. Very very delicious! And it also comes with rice and beans!  Speaking of Baja... The baja sauce they have here is epic!! I have been trying to recreate it at home and I've failed EVERY time! Ugh!! I usually get a side of this deliciousness of a sauce for dipping my chips in.  I really love the atmosphere at this location. Especially since they have a starry night room. Where they have installed fiber optics into the ceiling to give the appearance of stars above you! You really have to check this place out, just to experience it!  This place can get rather busy on the weekend nights, so I suggest getting there some what early, unless you don't mind a short wait.   Okay... Now on to my favorite topic for this restaurant... The Margaritas.. You have to try the ultimate margarita here at least once in your life! After putting about 4 of these puppies down, I feel like a million dollars!  I cannot wait to visit this place again for a good time, and great food!"}
{"text":"Food was good, waiter was a n00b though, messed up our checks and didn't really check on us.  I'd put a two star, but the food was good."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that I have been a FAITHFUL Macayo's customer for over 20 YEARS and something has changed in recent times. I can not pin down an exact date but the last 3 times I have gone to dine....the food is NOT what is once was. I used to CRAVE Macayo's but I no longer do, the flavor I once craved is no more. I was in love with the salsa, now it tastes like nasty ole Pace Picante Sauce. The cheese enchilada's used to be stuffed with so much ooey gooey wonderful cheese...yeah, no more. My shredded beef taco just lacked the wonderful Macayo's flavor, what happened? Then to top everything off...the prices have increased. Now I understand prices need to increase but I'll pay increased prices for the Good Ole Macayo's not what I have experienced the last 3 times I have gone. My daughter and I would go frequently but we won't be back. Sometimes change is not good."}
{"text":"I didn't come here for authentic mexican food, so I was pretty satisfied with my meal. I like hitting up Macayo's everyone once in a while because they have a decent lunch special. It's nice to be able to spend under $10 and have a sit down lunch with friends or coworkers.  I really liked the lunch burro and cisco wrap - I had them at two different times, not all in one sitting...but it's enough to keep me coming back. Ugh, this review is making hungry. I'm done."}
{"text":"When we arrived, the place was nearly empty, but no hostess in sight and took a long time to be seated. Once we were finally seated, service was decent, but food was very bland and mediocre."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy but had to wait a little. Food was a little cold on my fiance and son's plate but was discounted. My food came out awesome."}
{"text":"Expensive mediocre food and i had terrible service. Mexican food should not be expensive. The best thing was the raspberry hibiscus tea."}
{"text":"My friends and I love Macayos. When they come to town we have to come here-it's tradition. This is my favorite location in the northwest area. I have been to every Macayos (even the one in Vegas)! I have been coming to Macayos since I was a kid and they are still the same good flavors since then.   Our favorites are the salsa (Mari D told the waitress that I drink the stuff so she brought me a bowl of it...let's say I was in heaven) and the Baja sauce (drool)!! Our usual order is the mex and match of 2 Baja chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. It's not a choice on the menu-you just order it that way and trust me you will love it!!   Also, when I'm sick my mom brings me Macayos chicken tortilla soup (this happened last week). I swear this makes everything better. It helps me to breathe (the spices) and it tastes delicious! They have a special area for to go areas in the back which makes it nice to get in and out fast.   I've always had great service at this location! Of course I will be back!"}
{"text":"Would like to see that the handicap parking revised. Currently you have to walk the entire length of the restaurant to the park your car. It's quite far.   Service was extremely slow,  granted it was a bit busy,  but there was lots of staff walking by.  Salsa was okay and the chips were okay,  nothing great.  Something to eat while passing the long wait for our lunch.   I ordered a cheese crisp with shredded beef,  it was disgusting the way it was presented.  The meat was so wet that the crisp was no longer crispy.  It was very unappetizing.  Blah! We couldn't get our bill fast enough to get out of there. .. definitely won't return.  There is way better Mexican around town."}
{"text":"Seated immediately at 7 pm on a Friday night. Yay. Took about 10 minutes for a server to come over, she said that it was unclear whose table we were so she'd take us. How gracious. We order our meals. Food comes out fairly fast. My 3 year old ordered chicken strips & fries, it came out to 3 good size strips and about 8 fries scattered across the plate. I guess they don't care about presentation for the littlest customers. Seriously, had I not known better the plate looked picked thru and re-served.  My boyfriend had some burrito, no complaints but also nothing positive. I ordered the veggie fajitas. They had zucchini, squash, broccoli, red bell pepper served on one of the sizzling fajita plates, but they were definetly not sizzling. The vegetables were over steamed and incredibly mushy. Once guac, sour cream & pico were added to the mix all you had was mush wrapped in a tortilla. I guess their cooks must moonlight in a nursing home kitchen as chewing was not required with this dish.  Refills were not offered on chips, salsa, drinks until the end of our meal and the waitress never really came back to check on us so we could ask for them either until she came offering dessert. Oh well.  The saving grace of this meal was the mandarina margarita. I'd return for drinks, but that's it."}
{"text":"Always great fast service. We were there just last night and had an excellent attentive server. The food is always great. Typically we never have to wait for seating."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have stated, this is not true, authentic Mexican food. Macayo's, along with Top Shelf, serves the white people's version of Mexican food. Nothing too scary or spicy to freak us out, right? That being said...it's Macayo's! Native Arizonans at least know about the chain, if not having been raised on their food. Yes, the decor is loud and obnoxious with bright colors and enormous parrot statues, but it's awesomely bad. Appreciate the eccentricity, people! The food is decent. It's a bit on the greasy side, but if you came in here expecting something healthy and easy on your stomach, that's your problem. I will say that the wait staff is unpredictable; they have a high turnover rate of employees except for the tiny woman who brings the chips and salsa who has been there for years. You could end up waiting a long time; my personal experience is that our food usually comes so damn fast that it startles me. One last thing: if you like your margaritas sweet, you won't like theirs. Always very tart. They're drinkable, but sour. They say they put triple sec in there but I'm calling shenanigans on that."}
{"text":"Went down the street to Macayos specifically for cheese crisp with my daughter but, they no longer have regular cheese crisps or beef taquitos on the menu.  Both were favorites!  The waitress and manager today were very kind and made us a regular cheese crisp \"just this once\".  The baja burrito is good and the hot sauce is a favorite.  Margaritas are always good at Macayos.  Sadly we won't be back though because the menu has changed.  I mean what Mexican food place doesn't offer plain cheese crisps?!  We had excellent service today.  Macayos has been part of Phoenix for as long as I can remember.  I will miss it."}
{"text":"We have frequented this particular Macayo's many times over the past several years with our kids and grand-kids. My granddaughters loved this place. We decided to stop by after not visiting for about 2 years.  In a nut shell this establishment was aweful. The hostess greeted a couple before us and was gone for at least 5 minutes. After returning she showed us to a table and gave us menus. Right of the bat I notice my left leg was stuck to something on my chair.  Don't know what it was but I used my napkin to wipe up some nasty gunk from the chair and my leg.  Next my wife could barely open her menu because it was stuck together.  I mean our table, chairs and menu's were dirty, sticky and nasty. A waiter or waitress never even came to our table. After approximately 10 more minutes we decided this filthy establishment with non-existent customer service wasn't worthy of dining at and we promptly left. Not sure who manages this place, but they should be concerned with the lack of cleanliness and horrible customer service.  We will never return."}
{"text":"A solid Mexican food restaurant and honestly, very surprised that finding good Mexican food in Phoenix can be challenging.    Location is in a large shopping plaza with lots of parking.  Very easy to find so you should have no problem getting there.  Food is not bad at all with standard items like burritos, tacos, and chimichangas.  More of an Americanized version of Mexican food but what I value here is the consistency.  We have been coming to Macayo's quite often now and the food is never bad and our experience is always pleasant.  I like getting their combo items of tacos/burritos/enchiladas.   Price is very reasonable and you can bring your whole family without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"After going to this place for my whole life, today was a terrible experience. Was sat at a table and waited 30 mins only to receive water, chips and salsa. Ordered a cheese crisp when we finally flagged down our waiter. Was not asked once if we were ready to order, he kept walking by the table and was blatantly ignoring us. After waiting for the half hour we decided to get up and just order to go. Went over and was greeted by such a friendly guy, Miguel. He was amazing and shocked by our experience. He took care of us and got us out of there in 10 mins max! We will definitely request Miguel when we decide to return!"}
{"text":"Went to Macayos with my SBL(sexy bearded lover) and we just wanted to chill. We were busy all day and we're looking for a nice relaxing dinner. We opted sit in the bar because of the crowd, and we were able to seat ourselves immediately. A server named Lily busted her buns to make sure we had everything we needed before we realized we needed to ask for something. Thank you girlfriend for working so hard because you alone made the difference for us coming back again.  We ordered the carnitas dinner and SBL ordered the chicken fajitas. It was all plated super pretty, but everything was sooo dry it was like we were hiking thru the Sahara without chopstick. No juice at all in any of the meat and even the rice was like shriveled and funky dry. The beans had a crusty protective layer on top and it was definitely missing LOVE.  We also noticed that the bar staff hustle way harder than the dining room staff it's like night and day.   SBL and I did enjoy ourselves... despite our desert stroll."}
{"text":"So, went here to give it a try for a second time. I had a bad experience in January and gave them another shot here last weekend. I would say the biggest complaint I have is the margarita! The server, of course, does the \"upsell\" on the Don Julio Tequila. The drink is over $10. The drink is watery, and bland. I didn't even finish it. I tried to get the attention of the manager, but he was pre-occupied with another table, in which he had a lengthy conversation at. (Must be friends with these people), because he even bent down to have the conversation, which I would say lasted well over 10 minutes. I had the same server I had in January. In January, we were told the wait would only be 30-40 minutes. Well, 30-40 minutes later we were still waiting. I realize we had 6 people with our party, but no mention of other accommodations were made, i.e., patio, or upstairs. Once the wait continued to be 50 minutes +, I asked about outside and we were then told there was seating available out there. Once outside, we were only given menus, chips and salsa and water. The waiter took our drink order but did not return for a lengthy period of time. We had another person we were waiting for, so the waiter returned with the drinks. He did not ask us if we wanted any appetizers or to order, in fact, he \"assumed\" that we were just going to wait and put the order in when our last guest arrived. Since that was NOT the case, I could not find him to tell him. I had to go inside and find the manager. The manager came out and handled the issue- I will give him that, but when the server came back, he complained that \"he was going to get a spanking\" from the manager as now he would be in trouble. He also put the blame on US, saying that we had not communicated to him that we were fine to order without our friend being there. The only thing \"comp'd\" that night were the cheese crisps. So, based on all of that, I did try Macayo's again last weekend. I unfortunately, got the same server. I did not see any improvement to his service, lack of attention to detail, and as I already mentioned, the margarita's sucked. It was the worst margarita I have had in my life. I will NOT be returning to Macayo's, especially when the Valley has so many other great Mexican restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Visited here on Valentine's day for dinner.  I got the pork carnitas meal. The meat was steaming but the rice and beans were on the cold side. My date got the shredded beef chimi de macayo. She said it was delicious abd everything on her plate was warm or hot. Although our margaritas were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently insisted on going to Macayo's for dinner.  She's in love with the Baja burrito.  I'll give her that the Baja sauce is pretty good, but everything else wasn't.  I tried both the beef burrito and the chicken burrito and they were both awful.  Plus, they didn't sit well in my stomach later either.  The others in our group said their meals were okay, but there was nothing to write home about.  The service was terrible.  Our waitress was a nice woman, but everything took so long.  We waited a long time to be helped, long for the food, and then a few things were forgotten, and then we waited almost an hour to get the bill and then pay it.  It was excruiciatingly painful.  I'd say my last visit to Macayo's was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had, and it will be the last."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all let's talk about the atmosphere!  Really bright colors, fun decor and a super feel of the Spanish culture to it.    We were visiting from out of town and turned once again to Yelp to help us out.  We were anything but let down!  We got there about an hour before they closed on a Friday night, so the place was pretty dead.  Our server was helpful and friendly.    I tried the Brava Burro with the Baja sauce (a suggestion by our server).  My wife went with Chicken Pablano with beans and rice.  The food portion sizes were huge, but it matched the price.  We ordered some extra spicy salsa that was really good and spicy.  The chips and salsa they have is some of the best I've ever had!  Really fresh tasting and the right amount of spice.    I asked some of locals about this place and most of them say it's their favorite.  We left painfully stuffed, but it was so good not to finish it all!  Also a huge variety of margaritas that were20 oz, nice and strong and good flavor!   An easy 5 star place... don't believe me, go and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy their food.  If you love hot salsa ask be sure to ask for it!  The regular salsa is always so fresh and yummy!  They had a new cook that misread several of the entrees.  The waiter brought me the wrong kind of beans on my plate and my friend had a chicken enchilada when she wanted a cheese.  I will definitely be back!  I'm sure the new guy will have it perfected by then."}
{"text":"Obviously I'm one of the few who likes this place, but I just judge it for it is.  I don't come here expecting authentic Mexican food or a fine dining experience.  I do come here for tasty margaritas and the poblano chicken dinner, which is the only food I've ever ordered from here.  It's a chicken and cheese stuffed poblano pepper, breaded and fried and covered with their bajai sauce.  Now I know the bajai sauce is nothing more than cream (sour cream?), cream cheese and jalapeno juice, but it sure is yummy!  Quite addictive and no way it's good for you, but I just can't help myself.  The chips and salsa they serve when you sit down are good, they offer a mild and a hotter sauce and I like them both just fine.  I love the patio they have overlooking a small \"lake\".  It's a great place to hang out and drink margarita's.  I have always had good service here.  I've been here many times over the years and I'm sure I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Mexican restaurants.  Sometimes we love 'em, sometimes not.  That's why I gave this Macayo's a 3-star rating.  Love the baja sauce and particular items, but other times the food is just enh. I love tamales, but not here. Sometimes the portions are huge, other times, such as the lunch specials, they are what one would expect for $7.99.    The last time we went, my son loved the nachos supreme, and my \"flauta de Mexico\" was particularly tasty.  The dessert flan deserves 4 stars, a light custard flavor with plenty of caramel sauce.    The setting for this particular Macayo's gets 5 stars.  Not only is the inside colorful and visually interesting, but there is a large man-made lake with patio seating.  A very pretty and relaxing setting."}
{"text":"Happy Hour.  That's the only reason I will go to Macayo's.  The food is sub par.  I have no idea how it can be called authentic.   I do have friends who love this place and of course, to each their own.  I just can't.    Service is dependent upon the mood of your server.  You will either get prompt service with a smile, or the slowest service with a side of attitude!  If you're lucky you'll get the ever popular \"eye roll\"."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food is way average. If you're looking for good Mexican food this is not the place. This is a large chain that bastardizes Mexican food."}
{"text":"I seriously believe that we ordered the wrong things. Let's start with the good things about our experience here. Restaurant looks clean, we requested to sit out at the patio since the weather was nice. Scott our server greeted us, put down the complimentary chips and salsa (which was alright - not bad not good). Service was okay. Scott checked us frequently and made sure our drinks were filled. We didn't really talk much, no how are you today/is this your first time here etc. But he wasn't rude. He was alright. Anyway we ordered the Chile Verde Shrimp Enchilada, Spicy hot wings, Jalapeño Burger and a pumpkin flan for dessert. We had the green tamales to go as well. For drinks my bf had dos equis and I had a raspberry hibiscus lemonade.  The pumpkin flan and the tamales were outstanding. The rest however, wasn't memorable.   Bad parts:  Ordered hot wings and it seemed we got buffalo flavored wings that was sprinkled by dried chili peppers. (See the picture) Nope, not even hot at all. It was a tad bit overcooked too so it was dry and wasnt juicy/succulent. My shrimp enchilada had the tiny shrimps inside, I know that shrimps are up this season since I work at a restaurant as well so I didn't really mind but the flavor was just lacking. The Mexican rice tasted like it was mixed with 3 cups of butter. I wasn't happy at all. Didn't finish it. My bf had their jalapeño burger and as Ive said in the description of my photo, it tasted like burger king with just salsa on top. The fries though were pretty decent. He didn't finish either. And we were starving when the food arrived.   All in all, sitting on the patio was a major plus but watch out what you order. If it's your first time, better ask what's popular first and probably stick with that. Would come back maybe weeks or a month from now but not so soon. My hope for chain restaurants are seriously dying."}
{"text":"This is probably the best chain Mexican restaurant in Arizona. Inside, the decor is classic. Bright colors with a Southwestern feel. They have a large inside area as well as a patio off of the bar, when it's not 100 plus degrees.   Having grown up in AZ, I always have to return here when I visit, since there is no good Mexican food in the Midwest.  The waiter was average, as is usually the case here. Nothing bad, but nothing that really says wow either. They do a good job of refilling water though.   To start...their legendary chips and salsa. Both are homemade. The chips are light as air and not greasy. The mild salsa is okay, but I always ask for the hot. It's amazing and has a good kick that makes your nose run a bit.  For my entree, I had the Baja chimi. It's filled with seasoned barbacoa (very lean and juicy), deep fried, and coated in a white Baja sauce. The sauce has a great amount of heat, which is cut down by the homemade guacamole and sour cream. This thing is huge!!!  It's served with homemade refried beans and Spanish rice, both of which were excellent.  This place brings back great memories of my youth."}
{"text":"Fantastic service large portions. The Baja sauce and margaritas were excellent, this will be a regular place for me now"}
{"text":"We just had the worst possible experience at Macayos. We sat for 40 min and never had a server. We even asked the manager for help after 20 min of waiting and he brought us chips and salsa but never showed up to take our order. This restaurant was so poorly managed and run. We finally just got up and walked out. Still hungry. We will never go here again."}
{"text":"\"If you buy a cha cha mug, you know it is refillable for cheap?\" SCORE! I have my mug in my car just in case I happen to go to another Macayo's just so that I if I happen to go to one, I know my drink will be around $3.99 tops lol. The chips and salsa are always hot and fresh. The service was great and the food has never disappointed. Our bartender was great and made sure to check on us often and kept our drinks refilled.. alot. I will definitely visit this location when I come back to the West side to visit friends!"}
{"text":"I go to this location every other week for Happy Hour with one of my BFFs. We love it because they know us the moment we walk in and the server puts in our drink and food order the moment she sees us (she knows it by heart!)   We also get out of there for under $10 each! It's our go to place for sure. I'm super picky about Mexican food if I want an actual meal but for Happy Hour appetizers and drinks you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Macayo's has changed their menu. My wife and I went there last for \"Beef Taquitos\". The best Taquitos in the valley. Well, they are not available on the new menu. I have been eating their Taquitos since 1983. No more! So disappointing. Adios Macayo. Adios old friend."}
{"text":"I've never done a bad review but this place was the worst food ever. Macayos used to be so good I don't know how u can go wrong with rice. We were looking forward to amazing mexican food and left totally disappointed."}
{"text":"If i could give half a star I would. Aside from the tacos I had which wasn't  filling and mildly tasteful. It is clear here there is no such thing as service. This is the first and probably the last time I even speak of Macayos when it comes to food."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we'd be able to have a nice little dinner at a Mexican restaurant, but it turns out it's party central. We saw girls walking in with slutty dresses and heels, and saw people in the back partying. If that's your thing, go for it. Looking for douchebag central instead of a restaurant? Drink away. This is for you."}
{"text":"Good food, slow service. Waited 55 minutes for two entrees at the lunch hour. Complementary chips & salsa made the wait bearable."}
{"text":"These guys.. man it is frustrating.  They are right by a concert venue, so they should be used to crowds on concert nights.  You'd think it was their first time.  It takes waaaay too long to wait for a drink, and unfortunately, our bill was messed up.  Booo... however, they are close to the venue, so I will return."}
{"text":"Finally...a Mexican chain restaurant that I really like! I was weary about trying macayos at first (I can't stand arribas or on the border and thought this would be the same), but I'm so glad I gave it a shot. The food is really good and the drinks are strong, so you feel like you are getting your moneys worth. However it is 2$ for a small side of sour cream and I find that a little insane. The waiters were all really nice and we all enjoyed our food, this is now one of our regular dining places."}
{"text":"My family and I go to the Macayos in Mesa all the time and even did our rehearsal dinner there over 20 years ago. Never had a bad experience. But the one in Ahwatukee...honestly I can't figure out what is wrong we with this location. The last 3 times I've been there, the food was awful. I kept going back thinking it was just a bad night or something, but no more. Done with this location. The server was nice. I had the fried fish tacos, and the breading was crisp on the outside, but complete goo on the inside. The texture was like dough. The server apologized and comped it. Thankfully. My son had carne asada tacos which were bland and overcooked. My son is nuts about tacos and he refused to finish them. In fact, he was ready to just leave. My wife's baha burro was good, but the rice and beans were nowhere near the quality and flavor we are used to with Macayos. We'll just stick to the Mesa location from now on."}
{"text":"I will just hit the highlights:   Ordered the carne asada chimichanga with rice & beans. All of my food was room temperature when it came out. As a side note, I've never seen carne asada meat cut so big. They were each sized like pieces you'd cut off a steak.   After forcing down half of the chimi I sent the entire plate back to the kitchen. Ultimately it was removed from our bill.   The waitress brought one of their regular heavy-bottomed glasses to the table for my 6-year old. She also filled my drink so full that it dribbled all over the table as she was handing it across to me instead of walking to my side and setting it down.   The sopapillas were flat, thick, and very bubbly like fry bread, not light and thin with one big pocket on the inside."}
{"text":"Great Saturday night out! Friendly and helpful staff, great food and good friends. The steak fajitas are amazing."}
{"text":"I'm came here on recommendation from a friend who raved about the food and margaritas.  I love Mexican, so I was pretty excited.    Overall, I was underwhelmed.  The chips and salsa were absolutely delicious and probably the best part of the meal.  My margarita was over priced and the weakest I've EVER had anywhere.  It was all mix- a huge waste of money and empty calories.  Please do do not waste your calories or money on their drinks.    I also ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were okay. Meh. Nothing to write home about.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service waiter was annoying and rude 30 minutes to get drinks been 50 minutes no food asked for manager 20 minutes ago I'm very disappointed"}
{"text":"This is one of my families favorite Mexican resturants. My daughter loves the baja pizza. The appeitizers are large enough to eat as meal within itself. I also love the Grande Chimmi dinner either chicken or pork. I've also tried out the salmon which was really tasty. All in all a great place to have Mexican food."}
{"text":"ALWAYS GREAT!!! Went there for just drinks and decided to eat too.  Bar is quick and convenient.  Leslie our server was as sharp as it gets.  She was quick with our delicious chips and salsa and kept them coming.  Everything was spot on.  Macayos is consistent and reasonably priced.  My wife tried their new Texas Margarita and loved it...yum!!! Another great time at Macayos!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to various Macayo's locations since I was child. The food is tasty abs my favorite is anything with Baja sauce on it. Occasionally the sauce comes cold and I ask them to heat it. Lately it's been great though. My family is a regular at this location and usually have good service and have never had to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I hate you. Really hate you. I hate you even more because I have to pass by you every day to get to the grocery store.  I hate you so much I make sure to flip you off everytime I pass by you.  I hate you because I love mexican food and instead of you being Rosa's you're Macayo's.  Why can't you be more like Rosa's? Why do you have to so close to me? Why must your fugly parrot be so obnoxiously bright at night, a welcoming beacon of mexican food for unsuspecting first timers?  You lured me in. Made me think you could have been authentic; the real thing.  You're not.  Dross. That's what you are. Dross...yet people still like going to you.  May you burn in hell for trying to pass off that slop that I ordered as a chimichanga.  I hate you.  PS No, I'm not kidding - I really hate you."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! To the bald waiter who seems to ignore Hispanic families this review is for you! Your service is trash, my wife and I recently visited and got two burritos one red chili and one green. Not only did you not bring us chips you didn't take the time to check in on us or even serve our table. You seemed too busy with the other people and didn't bother to pay attention. You were rude from the beginning and it was nice to see that you took our money and gave us change out of your own pocket rather than the cash register. DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION, this is the reason this chain is dying is because of horrible service and ignorant employees. If I could give you no stars I would since your service doesn't even deserve one! TO MANAGEMENT, if you keep this trash employee be prepared for more bad reviews from other people who agree!"}
{"text":"In town on business and was skeptical to try based the 3 stars review.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas along with a side order of Queso with spinach.  My business partner had the cup of tortilla soup and grilled tacos both which he found exceeded his expectations!  Bottom line the food was really, really good and highly recommend dining here!  Angelica was our server and she was fun and attentive with a huge, warm smile!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour had a couple of their famous margaritas, mini chimis and their flavorful chips and salsa. The waitress was super nice and made sure we had what we needed. It was the night of the Rascal Flatts concert so after a while it got pretty packed. Overall it was a good experience so I can't complain and will be back for another happy hour with Co workers"}
{"text":"Consistently good service.   Food is always good too.  We stop here on our way to and from Tucson several times a year.   They serve Sonoran style food,  as is typical in Arizona,  and they do it right!  Their salsa is the BEST!!!  I mean it, best I've had in 40 years of eating out in the southwest.  I just love the right amount of onion and cilantro,  and Macayo's is perfect!  Beware though,  if you purchase the bottled stuff they have for sale, it is NOT the same and not any better than any other store bought salsa (which none of,  in my opinion, are worth buying).  It's a great small chain of restaurants."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H this past Wednesday.  Arriving before the lunch rush about 11:30 they worked with us old folks to find seating we would both be comfortable with.  The service stayed great throughout the meal.  Our server knew the answer to our questions.  Macayo's is not the only Arizona chain to have done well with Americanized Mexican food.  It is prepared well, tasty and presented well.  I would suggest if you order steamed veggies as one of your sides you ask for it in a separate dish as the water will drift in to your other items."}
{"text":"Finally got to this place tonight, after it being recommended to us from a number of people, and we have to say it was a fun night.  Nice looking place, very roomy, and the waiter John made a positive impression from the beginning, when we asked him what was popular on the menu and what was his favorite.  We ended up getting their deal --- two of their entrees for $20 - me, the tacos, and my hubby the Carnitas.  The Carnitas was the biggest hit at our table.  We both had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow.  Then, John surprised us with a sopapillo on the house for being at this restaurant for  our very first time.   The bill was cheaper than our breakfast the other day, and we were more full (with another meal to boot).  So we recommend the place, and we  hope john is your waiter, too."}
{"text":"Love the food but we are freezing our butt off. Need to do something about the fireplace not working and turn up the heat."}
{"text":"My friend and I picked here as a lunch date. No hostess in the front during a weekday lunch hour no less. Restaurant did not appear terribly busy.  A line of people began to form behind us talking about the wait.  Eventually the bartender came over complaining \"he didn't know where the hostess was\" and seated us himself. The server was mediocre. The food had good flavor but the lunch menu portion size was for kids. When my friend payed our tab with a $50 bill, the server proceeded to lean over our table under the lamp above us to check the bill, then pointed out the correct marking to my friend. Neither my friend nor I were amused by her actions.  Crossing this off our lunch spots even though its conveniently located."}
{"text":"It has been YEARs since I have been to this Macayo's!  Service was good and food was ok.  I remember the food was much tastier before.  We shared the cheese crisp for appetizer.  That tasted the same.  I got the shredded beef chimi and the sauce was a little bland.  The kitchen made a mistake and give one of my fellow eaters chicken instead of beef on her salad, instead of taking the dish back and make my friend sit was watch the rest of us eat.  So bought a side of beef for her.  That was nice."}
{"text":"I have not been in forever.  I had to come over this location for a retirement party.  We use to have HH at this location all the time with I was working in Tempe.  I see why the group does not come here anymore.  Service is awful and slow.  I had to get me order drink order inside at the bar."}
{"text":"Love the food and the happy hour on Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"Not my favorite!  I was really disappointed with my meal and service.  We waited a while for our waitress to come over to our table.  Then I got my food...I ordered the Steak Cortez and it was so tough that I couldn't even chew it.  I told my waitress, she said she would send the manager over but he/she never came over.  It took forever for our bill to come and for her to bring my card back.  I was getting a little worried that she ran off with my card.  After all of this, I wasn't surprised that they weren't very busy."}
{"text":"First time I went to Macayo's I had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We went in this evening to have dinner for my birthday, were sitting down for ten minutes before my boyfriend had to go back up to the hostess to ask if someone could come take our order. The \"manager\" came up to us 2 minutes later with chips and salsa when my boyfriend let him know we were just going to take off from the lack of attentiveness, he proceeded with \"okay bud, take it easy\" in the most unprofessional and unpleasant tone. I would not recommend this location to anyone. They are rude and aimlessly wander the restaurant instead of taking customers orders."}
{"text":"Ugh, what a waste.  I know that this place is beloved by many, but really and truly this is straight up, flavorless Mexican chain food with some hatch chilies arbitrarily thrown in at times.  It's a total study in mediocrity, from the bland salsa to the weak margaritas.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos all left me snoozing.  They get a star for their commemorative mugs (hilarious!) and another for their exceptionally wonderful servers (very sweet and attentive) but that's where it ends.  I can't believe this was the place that the President ate at when he came to visit - I'm joining the throngs of people in the valley that swear against this place.  Like Tim Meadows in Dewey Cox \"You don't want no part of this!\""}
{"text":"When it first opened I loved coming here. Know the service is super slow  and the food is not good. I don't know if management has changed or what, but it needs new management again if that's the case. We have given it many chances to see if service and quality improves but it has not. I'm sad to say I will not be coming here anymore and do not recommend it to anyone looking for true Mexican food."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go to Macayo's for our girls night out. So it being Friday we decided to go around 3pm so it wouldn't be to packed. When we go there we were seated right away, and us being there so early there were maybe 5 other tables there. We waited a good 20 minutes before we even got a server when it was not even busy. A waiter walked by our table and asked if we have been helped and was very irritated when we told him no, and he looked at the other waitress across the room. We got our drinks and food pretty quick. Sadly though the nachos my friend got were soggy when we got them. It's a hit or miss with Macayo's."}
{"text":"Just wanted to take a moment to compliment the service we receive from Destiny she is fantastic! Our family is a weekly customer and she always goes over and above make sure that we have great service and food. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love Macayo's as the food is always great. I stopped into the Mesa location for the first time off of Dobson and the only complaint I have is that the food service was really really slow. We had four people and we were seated right away and our server was amazing. Kept Our drinks filled etc. but it took over 35 minutes to receive our order. We arrived a little before 4pm And they did not appear to be overly busy. 3/4 of our order was salads so I am not sure what took so long. When we finally received our meal we asked for the check at the same time. As we had an event to reach by 5."}
{"text":"Came in really quick for a bite while on break for work. I stood at the host stand for a few minutes. They were busy, so that's okay. Servers came up to me and smiled. Maybe only the hostess could seat, so that's okay. An elderly couple walked in and stood right next to me. Finally an older woman approached us and only spoke to the elderly couple and took them right back. I am 18, I look young but that doesn't mean to directly avoid someone. I waited some more. A large party was sat. FINALLY, a hostess came up. She didn't address me at first till I just put up my finger to say 1. Then she spoke to me. I know that this wasn't done to be directly avoidant but it was so rude. I was tempted to leave but didn't want that to sway me. My server Luis, was amazing and took really good care of me so it ended up okay."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food in Arizona, do NOT go to Macayo's. It's a standard chain restaurant which has decent food - but not representative of the true pizzazz that Mexican food has to offer. If you MUST go to Macayo's, go for some margaritas during happy hour - and then kick it over to a better, local place like Valle Luna."}
{"text":"I came to this location at Makaio's last night with my parents. Immediately when entering the restaurant we were nicely greeted by the hostess and someone who seem to be the manager. We were seated right away! Our server, Luis, was awesome! He was on top of everything! He answered our questions and kept up the refills of drinks and chips. He was very attentive and wanted to make sure that everything was going well with us. In the middle of dinner we even had a manager stop by to make sure our meal was good. Service here was all around great! Food was really good as well! I got the vegetable tacos. I will say that they were very spicy! I didn't mind that, but I also wasn't prepared for it either. The menu did not indicate how spicy they really were.  Glad to see that this neighborhood Mexican restaurant is still going strong!"}
{"text":"Love to eat cheese enchiladas and have a margarita here. I used to live in Tucson, so when I visit family in Phoenix I try to get a visit here. One time my enchiladas were cold and I ate the beans and rice which were piping hot. I brought it to the wait staff attention and they brought me a whole new plate!!!"}
{"text":"Your typical Mexican chain restaurant in the suburbs.  It's good when you need your chips and salsa fix, but don't take the date here if you want to impress.  The back patio is the place to be especially when you're sneaking in a margarita at lunch.  It's got misters, shade, and a view of a playa lake.  It almost makes you forget you're in the burbs."}
{"text":"Food is always good and reasonably priced. The tamale bites are off the hook! Always busy by 5 but wait is not very long. Sit in the bar area for quick seating."}
{"text":"Mex N' Match  is always my go to. Rice is always dry for some reason  Still a good go to spot!"}
{"text":"Never got drink refills had pregnant daughter with me told server it was her bday wasn't asked about buying a dessert then paid bill and waitress tried to short change me will never go back    And then I contact the site owner said and haven't heard a word"}
{"text":"For the longest time this has been my favorite place to go. They had a great staff that was efficient and friendly and it didn't take long for our orders to be served. The only thing I did not like at all is that they take your glass to refill your drink. Here is why I don't like that; they take multiple glasses at once, even from different tables with straws and everything. How am I aware the glass that was originally mine came back to me and I am not putting someone else's straw in my mouth?? Just gross. Deal with the dishes and bring new glasses!  I don't know what happened! I don't know if the management changed or what but there is only one familiar face in the place now. The bussers are not good at cleaning off the tables, chairs or booths anymore, and when asked to clean act as though they are so inconvenienced and still don't do well, the wait for food has increased, the order mistakes, forgotten sides a regular, long wait for chips/salsa, drinks and refills has become incredibly annoying. When sitting in the bar area ordering drinks is best done by you instead of a waiter/waitress, who knows what they do, but they don't serve customers, they may stop by every 45 minutes. This place has gone down hill bad! Unless they get their act together they are going to loose lots of regulars. Thank goodness the chips and salsa (when you finally get them) are still great, too bad your drinks still have not arrived by the time you have finished the chips and salsa and really could use a drink and their cut back on Baja sauce was a bad idea."}
{"text":"Party platters buyers beware....side of sauces are minimal. Can't get more without paying for it. Can't exchange or substitute either. Not accommodating for the prices charged either! Will be a while before I go back"}
{"text":"Our waiter Michael was very sweet and attentive that's why I even gave 2 stars! The food was disgusting. I ordered two taco meal and they were over cooked & hard as a rock and were told try come pre-made so I could not get a lighter fried shell!! What?? Pre-made? Ok well the meat wasn't good the beans and rice were a disappointment also! No wonder why they got 2-3 stars! Thought if Jude for myself. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there to eat lunch on my wife's bday and they didn't disappoint us food was super fresh super fast and the server guy was very nice ,we will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I've never been a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. My sister loves Macayo's for some mysterious reason, and I decided to play along since we had relatives visiting from out of state.  The decor is nauseating. It feels like they took the most obnoxious colors they could find and ratcheted it up on the scale of tacky. However, we came to eat, so who cares what color the walls are?  The salsa is thin, but tolerable. Nothing special, but I'm always a fan of bottomless chips, so I'll take it.  Everyone else seemed to like their food. I ordered tamales with green sauce. Unfortunately, the first time it came with their \"Baja sauce,\" which our waitress informed us is cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and jalapeño juice. She quickly took it back and brought out my correct order. Much to my surprise, green sauce is just red sauce with green chiles in it. At this point, I had fallen behind enough that I scraped most of the sauce to the side and ate my lunch. The tamales had a nice fluffy texture, but the sauce was not what I had in mind.  Our waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss. She was gracious and attentive, so for that I'm adding in an extra star."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Macayo's! Margaritas & Burritos.  Heck Yeah!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Place smells like grease. Food tastes bad.  Rude hostess. Manager was not helpful."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food. The Tortillas taste like they come from a Safeway.  Ordered 2 items/2 sides for my meal and was given 2 items/1 side."}
{"text":"When planning our weekly Saturday night date my husband and I wanted to try Macayos in Mesa mainly for the location on the water, a chance to enjoy the view and some good food and one another's company after a long week. I had been to the restaurant before and he had not so we were excited to give it a try. We sat outside off to the west side. There was a large party to the left and right of us. The party to the left were only there for a short time but the party to the right, that had numerous children, literally took over our dinner and ruined our entire night. First of all three of the children sat directly between the water and our table screaming at the ducks, ruining our view and distrubing our dinner. And that was only the beginning. Shortly thereafter 6 other children from the party began to climb on the stairway rail that was literally 3 feet  from our table. We were in the middle of a jungle gym and they were running and screaming all around us. Now I understand this was the fault of their very rude parents for not caring that their unruly children were ruining our night along with every other diner outside. But what makes me mad is the employee response. They knew what was going on and simply didn't care. Our waiter said and did nothing even after he obviously saw how annoying the situation was and how aggravated we were when we asked for our check right away and handed him our card so we could get out of there immediately. I went up to the hostess station on the way out and told all four of the employees up there that they shouldn't seat anyone else outside since there were unruly children climbing all over the back area and that they had ruined our night and our dinner. Even though I was obviously visibly upset the main hostess said \"there was only so much they could say\" (to the other party) and she didn't offer an apology nor an opportunity to speak to a manager about our unhappiness. Talk about poor customer service! Thank you for ruining our night and wasting $60 of our hard earned dollars!"}
{"text":"Always come back for Javier's great service and Karaoke night!  Look forward to it every week!"}
{"text":"The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldn't say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesn't have to be. A good time was had by all :)"}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing fancy, but always tastes good. Large menu, lots to choose from. Fun decor."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the margaritas were great! The service was slow as can be, Everytime we go the service is slow. They need to hire 4 more waiters/waitresses. Waited 10 min before they greeted us and asked for drink order. They gave us chips and salsa with no drinks and by the time we did get our drinks which was 15 minutes later the chips and salsa were gone. The waiter never came back to ask how our food was and if we needed any refills on our drinks I ended up asking another waitress walking by and she took care of everything."}
{"text":"Well Beloved n I haven't been to a Macayo's in quite a bit. Now I know why.  Friday night thought we done at different restaurant than the usual.   Macayo's had a no wait so we scooted right in. Waiter was ok. I ordered a carne asada chimi Beloved ordered a carnitas plate. The wait for food was reasonable, however the beans were overcooked both rice n beans super dry the chimi has a sauce that seen better days Beloved didn't fare much better same issue with beans n rice The carnitas were large chunks of beef that I could see from across the table that they were very dry. Carnitas could have greatly benefited from a sauce to make them platable.    My two cents No Mas"}
{"text":"From the outside and the ads I would have thought this place would have been great...service was good...food and beverages were lacking. My glass of sangria was a fail...the smallest glass of sangria I ever had. It was almost like a small glass of red wine with a piece of fruit thrown in as an after thought. My chili rellano was a fail. The pablano pepper wasn't even cooked all the way and the cheese wasn't melted. We will not return again."}
{"text":"Good deal on the house marg with the loyalty mugs. Great service every time we are here"}
{"text":"I have to say I am one that isn't too quick to give a bad review after just one visit but this place will not have my business again.  5 of us coworkers went for lunch and were seated by 1205 our food never came we had to order boxes to go before it even came out.  This after the waitress stated that it was already \"plated\".  By 1250 we were running out the door with food not eaten and late to find out one of the orders was missing.  The chips are stale.  I know I'll never be back.  There's too many Mexican restaurants out here to have to revisit a bad one.  Pretty sure my coworkers won't be back either.  The reason for one star is the place was clean."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Friends had been telling me that we should try Macayo's. They said it was good Mexican food. I finally tried it. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler and I'm not kidding, the sauce tasted like the crap they used to give us at elementary school and call enchiladas. That is EXACTLY what it reminded me of. Blech. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. How have they been in business for so long?"}
{"text":"The food is OK but is 'gringo-Mexican' food. If your parents are in town and you need a safe place to go, this would do the job. Bring your antacids with you, maybe some Gas-X too as high winds will blow after eating here!"}
{"text":"First time to Macayos and I was not disappointed! I ordered the tamales with the Baja sauce and my goodness they were good. Now I don't typically order tamales because my mom makes them and of course hers are they best with everything made from scratch... Anyway these tamales are great with the Baja sauce, the rice, and beans are good too, the only thing they need to work on is having some hot salsa for the chips..."}
{"text":"This place can get seriously loud but I still love the food. Baja sauce is soooo good. Mini chimi's and tamales are to die for. The drinks are excellent and the Sunset is highly recommended. The meals are a good size and healthy servings. My only complaints are the noise level can get out of hand here and  the staff can sometimes go missing, especially in the bar area."}
{"text":"This place was fire i ordered a a burrito and it was so good!!!! although the menu said it would come with rice and beans but i never received the rice and beans. i came here with a large group and several of our orders were messed up. The food was absolutely great though! Also some dude spilled water on my friend and he never gave her a napkin. people were nice though!"}
{"text":"We usually call in to go ordrs as we did today. Speaker for pickup doesnt work, u just have to hope they see u on camera or youll be waiting.. hannah had wrong price so i couldnt contact on speaker- had to run in cause i forgot my cell. They gave me correct price, and my order. I get back to my van n check my bags. Hannah had forgotten half my ordr. No cheese crisp, xtra chips n salsa, and my entire carne asada chimi meal with rice and beans were no where to be found. So now, im making my second trip in cause again, speaker doesnt work. Mind u, hannah has only been out to my vehicle once and that was to get my name for my order and my credit card. I had already given her a $10 tip for my $37 order when i paid.  AND ive gone in and out twice cause she didnt properly check my bags. I shoulda asked her for change since i paid her tip cash. By the time i got back to my vehicle, my initial food brought out first was cold. Hub and I, as much as we like the food, have now sworn off this place for good. Customr service on to go is zero stars the only reason for two stars is the cooks know what theyre doing. Let me make a point of saying I always tip good rght away and normally this gets me good srvice. I pay cash tip even if i use cc just so i know they get it right away, and recognize it...like i said, they appreciate the consideration normally and i get good service.  I'll know better next time i guess. I checked my bags, i made sure ordr and pricng on receipt was correct, i did all the legwork...shoulda tipped myself!"}
{"text":"Macayos is excellent. The service was great, the atmosphere is very eye catching and the food is the best. I took my wife and two kids and we all enjoyed our experience there. They even had a guy making balloons for the kids. He was nice and talkative. You can go dressed up or dressed casual. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"07/20/2014  My waitress \"Severa\" was polite and prompt.   They offered mild & spicy salsa. The only difference between the two was the \"spicy\" one was more watery. Not chunky like a poco de gallo. They did have a nice flavor. The chips were just chips nothing special.  I ordered the Prickly Pear Margarita. It had a great flavor.  I ordered the Achiote Pork Street Tacos. They tasted great bit were very small. They tasted great. They were served on what looks like a \"wonton\" stand. That tasted good as well. The quantity of meat is half what is pictured in the photos. I'll include both.  The black beans were just normal black beans. There was a pile of cabbage larger than the tacos. I ate some, as I was still hungry after eating everything else.  It looks like i would be leaving hungry, so I decided to order a flan.  The flan was ok. It was not a five dollar flan to match its price, but it was ok."}
{"text":"i've been raised on macayo's so i maaaayyyy be a little biased, but i really enjoy their chips and salsa and anything they put the baja sauce on.  the enchiladas are also really good and the cheese crisp is (usually) perfect.  i've never had an issue with service at this location that was noticeable one way or another.  my favorite macayos is still the one on 19th ave and thunderbird, but this one is a close second."}
{"text":"Finally tried the Macayo's in my area and it didn't disappoint!  We usually go to the one off 59th and Bell, but I'm glad we tried this one.   We stopped in at about 4:30pm. It wasn't crowded at all, which is nice. We were seated right away by a very pleasant hostess. Our server (so sad that I forget his name!) was super nice and very attentive!   Our food arrived quickly and it was great, as always. I tried one of the new items on the menu (Diablo Steak). It was a delicious steak with a yummy salsa/chipotle type topping. It came with poblano mashed potatoes (so good!) and cheesy black beans.  I would definitely order it again! We had a coupon for a bogo entree, so we only ended up paying 20 something for both of our meals.  Great job, Macayo's!"}
{"text":"Update: happy to report that Macayo's has redeemed themselves. After speaking with the manager we were treated to a second chance. The food was hot and tasty and the service was miles better. I am impressed by the good customer service and willingness to fix s mistake. Thank you.   I'm a huge Macayo's fan but I went there tonight and both the food and service were sub par. The chips that were brought out were broken and stale. Our waiter Brandon kept telling us how bad his night was due to the party of 20 he had to serve. Our food took forever and when he finally brought it out, it was cold. He then proceeded to tell us how he provided bad service to the party of 20 but it was okay because they left him a good tip.  We were not offered any compensation or apology for our cold food.  Needless to say I will think twice about going back to this location!"}
{"text":"They really would have gotten a 4 or 5 because the food was great and so was the service. AT FIRST!  Ok, I take my son and daughter-in-law out to eat for her birthday yesterday. Instead of saying in front of daughter-in-law do you do birthdays? I went to the hostess station and asked the hostess because I wanted it more a surprise and not be so obvious. The hostess said sure she will tell my waitress. Ok we are done eating, sitting around waiting and the waitress brings the check. I am stumped, I'm thinking \"what happened to the little birthday surprise\"? So I go back up and talked to the hostess, she told me she told the waitress and would tell her again. At this point I said never mind I will just ask her. So I ask the waitress if the hostess told her and she said no, and I believe her by her reaction. She said but we can. I said \"please\". After like 20 minutes we are like did they have to bake the cake or what? She finally brings out this pathetic little desert. 2 little air puffed things with whip cream and honey. And she lit the candle in front of her. I was very disappointed. I wish I would have been told what it was and next time I will ask where ever I go. Because I would have rather have paid for something like Fried Ice cream. Nice place to eat - Not so great in trying to make it a little more special for the birthday guest. Spent a lot of money and just disappointed yesterday. I will go back as their food is good. But don't ask for the birthday special - Pathetic, hassle, waste of time."}
{"text":"Food was great, love the chips and salsa super fresh. Our server Fernanda was great and super attentive, very  friendly.  Got a free cheese crisp (which is delicous) for checking in before dinner. All and all great Mexican food, and a relaxed beautiful view ! We will definitely come back. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"My favorite local Mexican food. My family and I are regulars and have been for years. The pricing is perfect for the quality of the food. It's easy to order to much here as the plates are bountiful.   The Mex-n-Match option on the menu comes in very handy when I can't decide between items.   Also, a major plus compared to most restaurants, they have a separate Vegetarian menu which is definitely worth highlighting.   If you haven't had Macayo's you are missing out. Try it ASAP."}
{"text":"I like the location and the bar area and the little patio, it's relaxing.  Service was very good.  Now for the food yikes:  Chips and salsa, chips are good and light and thin.  Salsa is watery and has no flavor, the hotter salsa was a bit thicker and tasted better.  Ordered like someone else mentioned, the carna asada chimi.  It was huge but I also got the thick chunks of meat inside, I've never seen carne asada look like that.  The worst part is the chimi was very salty.  The rice had no flavor either, so overall it was horrible, and it was expensive.  I'm hard pressed to order any food again, possibly just drinks and hang out."}
{"text":"An update to my previous review. We gave them a second chance and everyone from the Manager to the waitress to the hostess were great. We had an outstanding waitress in Ally. She made sure we were well taken care of and you could see she was taking good care of her other tables as well. She was personable and friendly and made the entire experience well worth it.  The food was great. The food was well seasoned and everyone enjoyed their meal. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse. The dust is literally hanging off of the ceiling beams and light fixtures. The wall in the booth we sat at was filthy with some liquid running down the wall. We were given dirty plates, and I swear my rice tasted like soap. It had a soapy aftertaste that made me worried to consume it.  We have over looked the lack of housekeeping before, but it's just getting worse and that makes it a difficult atmosphere to eat in."}
{"text":"great place, family style restaurant.   staff is great as well....have been going here for decades."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about six months the first time It wasn't too good the second time was last night smaller portions and the quality and quantity of food is lousy tasteless, I ordered a margarita and got it served in an ice tea glass !! The ice was not all crushed!! Will never go here again?? You serve a margarita in a margarita glass!!  not an iced tea glass And wasn't even done right!!!"}
{"text":"I love Macayo's food.  I've been to a dozen different locations.  But this location, by far, has THE WORST service.  Wait staff brings wrong orders, charge wrong amounts, and disappear for long stretches of time.  After two visits with identical experiences, I'm done with this location.    This goes beyond bad employees on the floor, but is evident of incompetence from management to create an environment families will remember with fondness."}
{"text":"First of all I am a Macayo's lover. My mother and I went to the one in Surprise. We wanted to sit in the bar and do a take out order. The hostess at the front said the take out lady was not answering the phone so we had to walk all the way around to the side (My mother is handicapped) to do our order because it seems she was lazy and did not want to go get the girl. So we walked all the way around. She shows up and not very apologetic about s having to walk all the way around. So we place our order and walk all the way back around so we could sit in the bar and have a drink. Bar tender very nice. The lady brings our food to the bar. Very nice. We take the food home and I got to say it was not very good. The taco had very little meat in it. My mother would not even eat hers. The enchilada was so tiny and not very much. Beans in all the orders were small. My daughter's chimi has enchilada sauce on it, which I never asked for. Made the chimi shaggy. Not very happy with our experience with take out. Probably will not do that again."}
{"text":"Had family come into town and we were so excited to go to Macayos as it has been a tradition. We were SO disappointed. The service was terrible. We had 2 margaritas that came out with no tequila. It was just simple syrup. They apologized  and brought out new drinks. Our food came out cold and some of our meals weren't even what we ordered. No one refilled our chips and salsa or cleared our dirty dishes. We have been coming here for years but after tonight, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very expensive for run of the mill chain Mexican food. 5 of us went in for lunch and after seeing only about 5 tables occupied we should have left. The food is not bad, good salsa & chips, some of our meals looked really good and my guests commented they enjoyed their choice. Spending $100 for 5 for lunch is not OK when there's no alcohol or appetizers.  I was shocked to pay $14 for two small soft tacos with beans and rice. That's not acceptable. Another got the Taco lunch special, he got 1 taco with a small plate of beans &rice, $9.   The lunch specials are so small you have to go to the main menu where the prices are out of touch with what you receive. Too many places to eat to do this again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Every time I go back home I have to stop by.  I usually am only a fan of cheap fast Mexican food but this place is definitely special.  The fajitas are especially great, try the shrimp.    The drinks are awesome and they have some of the best collector cups ever.  I have the coconut carved to look like a monkey (a drink cup goes on the inside, even has a hole in the lid for a straw) and my husband/brother/dad all have the ChaCha Margarita cup (they like to call her ChiChi because she is anatomically correct).  I think you get a discount if you bring the cups back.  The sopapillas are to die for.  So soft and covered in honey and powdered sugar.  I always end up getting it all over myself but it is OK because then I get to lick it off later.  The interior is pretty cool, looks like a feisty Mexican cantina, including wooden birds and mariachi mannequins.  There is usually a balloon guy wandering around who will make you a seriously cool balloon animal/hat/whatever you want for a few bucks."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa and incredible customer service. The cheese crisp and fajitas are my favorites. I've been here at least 20 times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Good place for Mexican comparatively speaking.  They have a unique variety of out of the ordinary dishes.  I most recently had the spinach mahi tacos.  Very good.  Portion size for the price left a little to be desired and service wasn't very prompt.  If you're looking for a good Mexican place and a meal price of around $30, Macayo's is it.  I will certainly eat their again, but I think I will try to make it during their lunch hour when they have specials for $5.99."}
{"text":"I'm probably being generous with two stars. Service was so slow! Our server would take our order and would not be seen until he came back several minutes later to deliver said item. I am definitely a Mexican food snob and this sadly doesn't meet my standards. I did live in Pilsen in Chicago, so don't take it personal Mr. Macayo. I wish I could articulate better what I mean but the food was just generic and pretty bland. Kinda mushy...stuff. I will say the stuffed pepper looked amazing. Salsa seemed to be jar salsa but I wasn't in the kitchen so who am I to say :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Rosa the General Manager is amazing! Only problem is the hostess Veronica is very rude but I won't let 1 bad apple ruin my whole experience!!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Well, I Never thought I would say this but..... this is now a Mexican food restaurant that no longer has Sopapillas.  Guess hell will freeze over tomorrow.....food was ok, service a bit slow."}
{"text":"We had the best service here.  Our waitress was so good.  I think her name was lorena.   She went the extra mile to make our meal and experience great"}
{"text":"So disappointing. This place was recommended as it was close to the hotel. Warning:  don't do it. I had a margarita that I think they forgot to ad Tequila. My Fiesta salad certainly had lettuce but only 12 black beans, a few sprinkles of cheese and maybe 1/4 of a chicken breast. Without the lettuce filler, I would have needed to order more food. My husband had a Chile verde burrito which had great sauce but the Chile was fatty, tough and the peppers were not cooked - maybe microwaved. Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on a hopping Friday night. There was a short wait because a big party was being seated. That's normal- the hostess and support staff handled it very well. I'm writing this to counter the negative comments I read on Yelp that kept us from trying this place out sooner. The waitress was VERY helpful. The food was okay... We loved the cheese enchiladas, and we'll be back to try out more from the grill! The patio bar looks like fun- yet be patient if they are slammed."}
{"text":"While I was in Arizona, we had reservations for a graduation dinner here. We were seated as soon as we got there with no wait. The place is beautiful and the servers were great, they helped us quickly and came by to see if we were good. The food was delicious and their margaritas were perfect. I only gave it four stars because I felt like there wasn't enough food choices to choose from like other Mexican restaurants, but overall I highly recommend this place if you're ever in this area."}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand what people think is so great about this place.  Maybe because it's been around forever and they're the kind of people that won't ever branch out and try something new.  This place was okay back in the day but has suffered a serious decline.  PEOPLE!  We live close to the border.  There are plenty of excellent, authentic Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Macayos is to Mexican as Olive Garden is to Italian: a bland, Americanized, chain restaurant version of international food.  The food is nothing special.  When asked what ingredients were in the salsa a waiter responded, \"I don't know, the salsa comes from a can.\"  I can never say that I've had great service here.  One waitress in the bar broke my friend's older \"Senor Bob\" margarita glass, didn't apologize and just gave him a new one.  When he pointed out that the new ones are much smaller her response was, \"You get the same amount of tequila in both.\"  Which is not true and leads to another point.  The margaritas here have become downright horrible.  I watched the bartender fill margarita glasses with a pre-made pitcher of watered down sweet and sour mix lightly spiked with cheap tequila.  It's sad that I can't even force myself to come here, given that it's walking distance from my house and they have a nice patio on the lake.  But after many worsening experiences I have given up on this place and won't return."}
{"text":"Seriously dude, its Macayo's! How can you not like Macayo's?! I normally won't eat much of \"Mexican\" food any place else. Its always just so delicious here, nachos, tacos, chimis, enchiladas, tamales, you name it its great and filled with all the grease that your little heart cant take...the lunch menu prices are out of this world for the amount of food that you get! And if you have little ones, they have a special going on where they can eat free, and its A LOT of food, that the tyke can take home and eat later.  Plus the Margaritas are to die for! A bit pricey, yes, but they make you feel magical. Like magical enough to be able to break all traffic laws by cutting across the road from one parking lot to another on the other side to go sober up at a T-mobile store...That was just an example, I'm not saying I actually did that. (I just have a vivid imagination!)  Service is great and just the right amount of friendly. Yea, the decor is kind of on the loud side, the wonderful old Vegas casino carpet is spectacular if you ask me, but it just wouldn't be a Macayo's without it. I've been dying for them to sit me in the 'Night Jungle' section, but every time I go I end up outside of it. I know it sounds 5 year old-ish, but dammit I want to sit in the nighttime area next time! I will demand it. Please feel free to visit this location on that day as I'm sure the hissy fit I'll put up if they don't sit me there will be a riot."}
{"text":"$2.00 for a side of sour cream, on a cold burrito. Kept pushing alcohol even though we said we didn't drink. Too bad this place has beautiful interior decorations."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would... went in last night for Mother's Day to have poor service, cold food and the restaurant area in the bar was dirty!  When I told the the server the food was cold she said oh ok what do u want me to do?? Really? Not happy and do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice place, decor etc. Table sticky silverware not clean. Service was ,good in the bar - hard up sell. no bottled water."}
{"text":"I went to Macayo's with my brother in law and nephew.  The restaurant was selected by my bother-in-law.  We arrived at about 2:00, after the lunch rush, and the restaurant was mostly empty.  But that didn't mean we got our choice of tables.  All the booths were empty and un-bussed, so we ended up sitting at a table.  The waitress came by quickly to get our drink orders, but it took longer than expected to get the drinks to our table.  Chips and salsa was delivered.  Two salsas; one somewhat chunky, but rather mild, and the second one spicier, but very runny.  The chips were good though.    I ordered the red chili burro, enchilada style.  The burrito was one of the worst burritos I've had.  It was salty, and without any sense of seasoning.  I guess this is what I should expect when I allow my brother-in-law select a restaurant.  He dislikes any sense of spice.  Service was a bit slow for drinks, but the food did arrive quickly.  Overall, I would never recommend this Macayo's.  Too bland and tasteless like too many chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at Macayo's in years so my family decided to recently and had a wonderful experience. The waiter was so polite and attentive. The food was delicious. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Service was awesome! My wife and I have ate at a  few different Macayo locations and this was the best service hands down! We had the appetizer guacamole which was huge. We shared the Baja Burro and our server Kristina was so kind to split it for us before bringing it to the table. We finished with fried ice cream and that never disappoints. Would recommend this place and ask for Kristina, she was so attentive and took really good care of us!"}
{"text":"A good Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. Food was very good and tasted freshly made. Staff was very friendly and would have been 5 stars for the review except service was kind of slow (even though the restaurant was only about half full). Would recommend trying for good Mexican food if you're in the Glendale, AZ area."}
{"text":"The food here was great and the service was perfect. My girlfriend and I came in on a Saturday afternoon and there was a huge party next to us. Our waitress was really attentive and nice, we never felt ignored for the larger party. We got the Bob and Cha Cha margaritas which were good, but the real winner is the mug they came in. We also ordered the cheese crisp as an appetizer which was a nice surprise. A crispy tortilla covered in cheese, what's not to love? For our entrees we ordered the triple enchiladas but those were outshown by the outstanding carne asada chimichanga. We were looking for a sit down Mexican restaurant that wasn't too far from home and we found it in Macayos. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food is always sooo good! This place is a family favorite from as far back as I can remember! This was the first place we ate after moving back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty versed in Mexican and have tried it in just about every state. This was just...well, so so. Nothing stood out to me. I love chips and salsa or pico de Gallo but this wasn't amazing. Service was great after I finally got seated (lunchtime during the week) which took a while! I don't think I'll go back when I visit again. There's too many other great places to try!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Macayo's with my family for many years! It was once our family staple for get gatherings.  So it was great to be back after some time.   The food is always great and dependable.  The actually physic of this establishment is in much need of renovation.  The booth cushions gave no support and sank in, some were torn.  It is apparent that the wear and tear of has taken it toll.  Also, the service took a bit of a dive on our last occasion.  The server wasn't to pleasant and didn't seem to happy to be at work.  Long story short.  Old building, solid food, hit or miss service."}
{"text":"Great food!  Consistent, nice staff, great catering, and did I mention great food!  Love their chips and salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Food average, price a little high, service good, Freezing cold up at the bar"}
{"text":"best salsa ever!  also a fan of the mini chimi's... as well as regular-sized."}
{"text":"Where I live there's not a lot of variety for Mexican food, but Macayos is always my first choice from the very few! Their food and service is always great! You always leave satisfied with the price, the quality of the food and the service!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 10 on a Friday evening . Service was bizarre . We had 2 waiters ? Yet no refills of drinks or chips unless requested .. Soup was served room temperature, I sent it back to be heated which returned to me warmer but no where near hot . I gave up and ate it anyway . Food was ok , service was sketchy & men's restroom is under construction so if you are a boy you must potty in a trailer next to the side of the building .. Update -  Came back for a family dinner (i didn't get a say in the restaurant they chose) we were a table of 14. One waitress to serve us plus her other 3 tables.  Needless to say refills of drinks or chips were non existent. Poor kiddos ran out of their one and only cup of soda and that's all they had for the 2 hours it took to ensure the drama that was dinner. Get it together macayos!! And for the love of god I will not be back!  P.s canned fruit cocktail was served as the \"fruit\" side dish on the kids menu!?! Disgusting!! You don't have a single stitch of fresh fruit? Are you kidding ? And they were out of ice cream .. how the heck does this place keep attracting customers ?"}
{"text":"Was served raw fish tacos and got no recognition or apology from management who claimed our waitress lied having told us she requested a manager to come to our table. Instead we found all the management on our way out laughing and chit chatting amongst one another rather than providing customer service. Never going back since their management is obviously unaccountable and they did not fully cook fish items. Also just look around and you'll find dust everywhere, gross."}
{"text":"I came in just for the chili rellenos... And they are amazing... Our server Ingred was very attentive and was a just a pleasure to have...  I will definitely be back...Especially when i can have a drink or two..."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great Customer Service. Had a wonderful time with my son and friends. We are from California.. Everytime we visit we will be sure to enjoy a wonderful meal here. I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"I love Macayo's we come often. This time was by far the worst service and food I've ever had here."}
{"text":"We don't normally go to this location but we were meeting friends in a central location for all day happy hour specials.   First off the happy hour deals are pretty good. I ordered a large cheese crisp with chilis for $3 and my husband got the $5 taquitos. The drinks $5 each and a good size. They had a good selection on the menu.   The service was kind of slow but as I looked around I could see our server was also the bartender so that explained it. Israel did a great job, very friendly and efficient. We will definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"So I would love to give then 3.5 but there is no half option.   Setting: typical mexican restaurant theme.   Service: My server was friendly, quick with refills, and helpful with menu questions. 5 out of 5 Also the lady that brought me chips was super cheerful  Tea: I known it is weird that I rate ice tea but I like unsweetened tea and I can't stand old and bitter.  There's was perfect  Food: 3.5 out of 5 nothing was bad but nothing knocked my socks off. It did scratch the itch or tex mex for me.  Prices: I think they are very fairly priced at lunch.   Overall I would go back and enjoy it I am sure."}
{"text":"Don't get carry out much better eating at the restaurant. The harvest menu was great nice flavor and the hatch chili's were great!"}
{"text":"Macao's is a great restaurant. The staff is always friendly and the Mexican food is great. I have been going for years since I was a kid"}
{"text":"Food was acceptable but the prices, even for lunch, were a bit much (the total check was $90 for 2 people, and we only had 2 drinks each). I enjoyed the margaritas, however I learned later (not by my server) that they had a \"mug\" price of less than $5 each! If you're going for a casual atmosphere, excellent margaritas and an acceptable meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"We will not be coming back.  Tamales had way too much sugar in the masa. Fajitas had no seasoning. Churros were undercooked and doughy.  Awful. :("}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Food is great, and service is amazing!! We went there Friday night, they brought our food our in less than 15 minutes!! It was delicious!! I have also bought party trays a few time from here, and they are ALWAYS A HIT!! Definitely would recommend this place!! I am very very happy with Macayos!!"}
{"text":"So I order a large order to go and I show up to Macayo's 25 minutes later and they can't find my order.  So I tell the young lady it was a guy that took the order she said that's strange we don't have any men hostesses right now. Well she checked and yes he took my order but failed to turn it in to the hostess   So she said do you want your order I replied do you think they can get it right she answered yes ok another 20 minutes. There was NO IM SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. Then they wonder why they're going bankrupt REALLY YOU NEED BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. love the food but the service sucks.   So this post was right after I was told 20 minutes more. So I went back in for my order and the manager came out and apologized it was him that took my order I got to give him correct and he took care of some items that I had order it take a great person to admit that they made a mistake. So we will be and continue to eat at Macayo's"}
{"text":"Wait wasn't to bad for a Friday. Server was pretty good but seemed overwhelmed. I love the new $10.99 3 course meal deals. Appetizer,entree and dessert. Fried ice cream was delicious. I love me some chips and salsa!!! Overall descent dining experience."}
{"text":"If you want real Mexican food, DO NOT COME HERE. This is the second time I try this place and if it wasn't for my coworkers making the loooooong wait times bearable, I would have walked out. The service is horrible, margaritas are mostly mixer, and the food is meh. Not to forget they charge extra for every little thing. You want sour cream with that? That's going to be $1.49 more. Guacamole? $2.99 more. And the sneaky thing is, that they don't even tell you it's extra. They act like it comes part of the meal.   My coworkers and I have come here twice for a nice night out and both times we've waited long times for service, food, and to pay. They always seem short staffed and the workers look unhappy to be here. If you want real delicious Mexican food and serves margaritas, go to Chipotle that's within walking distance of this place. You'll save A LOT of money and the service is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Usually decent mexican food here, but ate there recently and had the green corn tamale with green sauce and baja chicken enchiladas. Only ate half of meal. When I got home I had the worst stomach pains and ending up throwing this all up. Got food poisioning!!! Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"\"Back-yard Boogie Oogie Oogie....Straight from Ingle-wood, to the Ari-zo-na hood, Macayo's FOOD was real-ly good, DANCE all day!!!\" This is the RE-MIX! Hahaha! Our company catered Macayo's at our job today for our end of the year Christmas Party! We had so much FUN!#all kinds of FUN games, photo booth, Gigantic Chair & the list goes on & on!!! The music was bumpin' & we were Dancin'!!!#Loved it!!! Having Macayo's made it that much more FUN!!! The food was so flavorful! Everything was delicious! From the different types of enchiladas, flauntas, tostadas, salads, chips taco mixins' & fixins', you name it we claim it#We had it!#Enjoyed it!!!  The different meats were soo tender & delicious!

After one bite I had to grab a couple more!!! Bombness! I would definitely recommend Macayo's for catering FABULOUS parties!#Like our FABULOUS Company did today!!! FUN TIMES!!! :)"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. The hot sauce is really good. The chips where warm! The food came out quick even though they where busy. Our waitress was amazing. She kept our drinks full, checked on us often and always brought what we asked for as far as napkins and salsa very quickly."}
{"text":"We go to macayos a lot. Tonight was horrible! The chips tasted like old oil and had that dark color also. We had a table of 5 we got one basket of chips. The waiter was not friendly at all. He never smiled, every time I would ask for something or tell him something his response was OK as he was walking away. My food was only luke warm, the enchilada was the size of my pinky. My taco looked like a kids meal taco. My husband bean and cheese burrito was half the normal size. The waiter never even came back to see if everything was good or check on us.  I am not sure we will ever go back. What would be the point."}
{"text":"A friend took me here when I was in Phoenix and my first impression was of a Mexican TGI Fridays. It wasn't a bad thing. and since I'm a truck driver ANYTHING but the truckstop fast food would have been good.   We arrive just as they seat a party of eight, and with no hesitation were greeted by a friendly hostess and taken to a table. The table arrangement was a little cramped for me (but then again I'm just under 6' and a couple tortillas shy of 280) and my buddy is in the same range. After a while it felt cozy enough.   Our waiter, I want to say his name is Ernesto, was quick to present himself and ask if we wanted drinks. Now, I'm a trickdriver and like to play the part, I made  a comment about my Corona with no fruit and take it like a man-straight and he responded with something to the fact that he hasn't quite made it there yet and needed a few more years to season himself to man status. Ok, this guy's got personality I thought. My buddy and I are a bit rambunctious and Ernesto didn't shy away from it. He joined in on our fun. His service was spot-on in my opinion to the point that I mentioned it to my buddy. Ernesto was very attentive to our needs. The beer was half-empty \"another beer?\" or \"more chips?\". He even brought all three levels of salsa.   Now on to our food. The menu was simple and efficient, only 4 pages if I remember correctly, and I decided on the chimichangas de Macayo (carnitas). I'm such a sucker for carnitas, I freely admit, but these were top notch. I would go so far as to say better than grandmas back in California. The molé was good, not overpowering, and a great sauce for this plate. The beans and rice were simple and complimenting as they should be. Oh, and the actual chimichanga itself was huge, pushing upwards of 20oz maybe more and my fork was sufficient enough to cut through; no knife needed. The food was also hot all the way through and not just the outer layer.   The cost was a bit pricey as our bill was $37 and change for two dinners and two beers, but I would say worth the price. The service and food made the 25% tip an easy choice. I'd be happy to goback"}
{"text":"I have been to Macayo's restaurant before but this time, I feel that I must comment.  The food was excellent at the Ahwatukee setting but it was provided by an even greater asset, the server Rafael.   He was courteous, attentive and respectful.  It was a great pleasure to have him at our table."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful service! And the margarita was perfect. Took my 3 year old, they gave us a booth, and didn't say anything when he decided it was time to take laps around the empty dining room."}
{"text":"We went to Macayo's for the first time tonight, not sure what to expect because of the mixed bag of reviews. Service was very good, people were friendly and food and drinks came quickly. My husband had two tamales plate and I had Chicken Poblano. We were both very happy with our choices. We also had a margarita flight which was good, except they were warm. We expect to eat here again"}
{"text":"It's ok...not really good but passable Mexican or, to be honest, what they called when I lived in Texas:  TexMex.  To translate:  watered down mediocre Mexican. If this is your gig then go for it.  If you want really great Mexican go somewhere else. How this chain has been around since 1945 beats me, but they've been in Phoenix that long looks like.  Well, as Grandma said, there's no accounting for taste...just not my taste if I have a choice."}
{"text":"Service here tonight was amazing! Haven't been here since the remodel, but the new decor is beautiful! They had a little fire going inside which made it warm and cozy! Food came out promptly and was delicious! The manager Karen was wonderful, she came around to the tables and checked on everyone and their meals! Thank you Karen for the genuine kindness you showed to all the families tonight! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This Macayos puts the bell road one to shame, they actually have service, get your order fast, cook the food like how you ordered, etc. etc. etc.  Every problem I have ever expierienced at the bell road Macayos this place makes up for 10 fold. They have a popular happy hour at the bar, not for me. Great mexican food and expierience."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. It took over an hour for my family to get our meal, from the time we say down in a restaurant that was not particularly busy. Our waiter took his title seriously, waiting at least 30 minutes before taking our order, this while serving a group that included 3 children 5 and younger. Needless to say the kids got restless before we ordered, much less before we got our food, and by the time I was done eating had moved to whatever comes after restless.   Part of the problem, no doubt, was that it took me so long to eat simply because my meal was particularly awful . In fact, had the children not already been climbing the walls, I would have sent my chili rellenos back and gotten something else, because I have never seen this dish so viciously murdered in my life. In my experience this dish is a lightly battered pepper, filled with cheese and then fried. What I received was two peppers amidst a loaf of fried bread batter, more along the lines of donuts with peppers stuffed in them. To make matters worse the fried batter had no traces of crispness, I don't know the reason, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with where they stored this dish before preparing it to serve as what their menu calls hand dipped fresh daily. Where would that have been? Most certainly the freezer. How could I tell? You know that flavor that permeates frozen food that has spent too long in the company of other random frozen items? That was the only flavor I could taste in that massive chili stuffed donut they served me.   Needless to say, I wouldn't eat here again, and I don't suggest you do either. With the number of quality Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, why consider going to one where you might get even moderately bad service, much less one where you'll wait an hour to get warmed up frozen food?"}
{"text":"Macayo's has always been kind of a hit or miss with us. While not everything on their menu is great, you'll probably find something that you'll like if you're willing to experiment a little.  Their chips and salsa are pretty standard. My favorite dish, however, was a sampler platter that had miniature versions of practically everything (mini chimi, tamales etc). Much to my dismay, they removed it from the menu several months ago. Thankfully, the servers assured me that it could still be made quite easily on request. During our most recent visit, however, things seemed to take a turn for the worse.  I inquired about the combo platter, but was told by the server that they don't have that anymore and would have to order something else. I went with the significantly less exciting Tour de Macayo, while my girlfriend ordered her usual chicken enchiladas. By mistake, she received a cheese enchilada instead. When we politely said something, the server was not apologetic and seemed to \"turn off\" the hospitality button from that point on. I hate it when this happens, because you feel you're just supposed to shut up and take what you get.    On the other hand, my \"tour\" had a pretty decent cheese enchilada and small chimichanga. However, the rice and beans tasted way off. Well, actually, the beans didn't taste like anything at all, while the rice possessed that \"old grease\" aftertaste that just ruins the dish completely. But after what happened with the cheese enchilada, I decided that it was best just to keep quiet.  Side Note: Macayo's actually makes a very good fried ice cream for dessert, but since our server rushed us off with the bill and didn't bother inquiring about dessert, we went to get ice cream elsewhere.  I'll be honest. When Macayo's is \"on,\" they're usually fairly decent with their service and food. But if they're not on top of things, the inconsistencies reveal themselves and you wind up leaving rather disappointed."}
{"text":"Well this is the 2nd time in 3 weeks I have eaten here, one of the last weeks I was in the mid west so it probably would have been 3 for 3. Last trip I had the Steak and Shrimp Fajitas, very flavorful. Decor was nice and the seating was comfortable. Our servers were knowledgeable on the menu both times and were always friendly and kept the chips salsa and drinks coming. Today I had the Carne Asada Chimichanga, it had a queso spinach sauce that I enjoyed. Portions were enormous and what started off as my lunch also became my dinner. Gonna be a go to for Mexican Food when we have friends from out of town visit."}
{"text":"The customer service was so terrible! We sat at the bar and every single person other than the food runner, had a terrible attitude. We had the flag down bus boys to get drink refills and ask to have our order taken TWICE. On top of that the bad attitudes of every bartender was crazy! I witnessed them giving the same snotty attitude to the guy sitting next to us to. Everyone I've talked to about it said they've had the same experiences. You guys really need to get your customer service figured out, awful!"}
{"text":"Zach and Richard are my favorite bartenders! Always make me feel welcome! The service with them is awesome! They are very friendly!"}
{"text":"It was national nacho day so I decided to be patriotic and invite my mom to get some good greasy grub! She, much like me will never turn down the chance to some good mexican food or some quality mother daughter RR.   We walked in and were greeted by a friendly hostess and were seated right away. Our server was friendly and efficient and checked back on us often.   My only problem was the food - it wasn't that great. We started with the build your own guac dip. Sounded like a great idea but execution seriously lacked, and they charge and arm and a leg for it. It was a small scoop of plain guacamole with small dishes of tomatoes, red onion, jalapeño and cilantro. Even mixed up on the plate it was lacking something.   I ordered a Carnitas Chimichanga and it lacked any real flavor - It was more filbertos $6.99 chimichanga than the $14.00 I paid for it, and even sadder the rice tasted burnt... such a bummer. It was a really disappointing dinner and I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I took the advice of my in laws and tried this place. Not to my surprise the food was absolutely awful. The beans and rice tasted so blan and burnt. Needless to say I've been throwing up all morning and I kno it's from there. My advice just keep driving by like I should've."}
{"text":"Flavorless shredded-beef anything!  Too bad, this is a nice building with a few really cool seating areas.  Unfortunately, they just seem to load up every weekend night with so many people that the food has taken a back seat.   The revenue must be great!     I'm a big fan of shredded beef mexican food.   At Macayo's I have to change up and hit a carnitas or fajita deal.   They need to put some love back into the flavoring.     Ask for the 'hot' salsa (sauce) they will not bring it unless you do.   Oh, by the way, it's really not that hot.     I'll still go there in a pinch if I need to, but giving anymore than 2 stars would be way to generous.    To me, this place is just a local \"Mexican-Food-Denny's'."}
{"text":"I love other Macayo locations! I LOVE them, so I am so disappointed to be giving a review like this to one so close to my home. We attended to support my daughter's school with a family dining night. We asked to sit outside and that was the worst idea ever. Apparently sitting outside means no server. We kept having to go to the bar to get service which is very awkward with a small child. The food was cold when it arrived. This is so not the service you get at other Macayos, check out the other locations before going to this one."}
{"text":"I love eating at this location. It is fun to have the guitar player that walks around serenade you! The food is always cooked well and the free chips and salsa is amazing too! Definately a place you can bring the family or just go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mexican places.   Baja pork chimi? Oh yes. Lots of baja cheese sauce.   Chips and spinach queso? Ohhh yeah."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a delicious dinner here tonight. I ordered the Carne Asada Burro and it is the best I have ever had! The steak was very tender and flavorful and I added the baja sauce! Amazing. I have ordered this same dish at other restaurants and the steak is over cooked, dry and without flavor. The refried beans on the side were also very good. My hubby ordered ordered the chicken enchiladas with Baja sauce and was also very pleased with his food. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive and our order was out in less than 15 minutes on a busy night (with several large tables in the restaurant). We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Saying the service was extremely poor is an understatement. Our 'waitress' took over 10 minutes to greet us. Then, we had the pleasure of waiting an additional 15 minutes for water (which hadn't arrived before we left). I would award zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"This was excellent food for a good price! I ordered a chicken enchilada and tortilla soup. The soup was the best I have had and chicken in enchilada was very good. I am a very picky eater and I give 4 stars.."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a pleasant dinner. She had a bean burrito and I had a chicken burrito. Both were enchilada style with red sauce. We also had a cheese crisp and our meals were accompanied by margaritas on the rocks. Both the meals and drinks were very tasty. The service especially was excellent."}
{"text":"One star is generous, seeing that I've been there 4 times-4 TIMES- and each time was consistent in its disappointment. If anything I feel like I must've lost lost brain cells somewhere along the way because I STILL went back to confirm their inadequacy three more times.  Every time the service has been slow. Not just regularly slow, more like, \"haven't seen the waitress in 20 minutes\" slow. Without fail. And not even just \"oh she's gone to other tables but not ours\" but more like \"did she clock out? Is she gone?\" Different staff. Every time.   The food tastes like it just came out of a microwave and I'm sure my future fetus could do a better job than the obviously half dead \"chef\" they have in the kitchen.   The drinks are drastically watered down and over priced. I will give the manager credit though. Because my boyfriends friend complained about her drink being 80% water and the bartender was going to charge her full price to remake it. The manager stepped in and remade it herself-the right way-without charge   But overall, this place is even more disappointing than the average Applebees. They make chilis look like a Gordon Ramsey experiment."}
{"text":"The cheese crisp is delicious, my server Andrew did an awesome job at making us feel like guests instead of costumers. Chips and salsa always perfect when I come in and the flavors overall are beginning to remind me of a more authentic Mexican taste. Can't wait for what's to come from Macayos. I'll definitely be back to see Andr"}
{"text":"All I have to say is... You had a nice run but it's time to quite.  I go about once a year and each year they go down hill a little more.  I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Always dependable - excellent green corn tamales and cheese crisps. They have several locations and I've found them to be consistent."}
{"text":"We came in for happy hour for my friends birthday and walked into the bar and asked the waitress if it just the bar top or the side tables too. She said sit where ever you want. Okay. So we sat. And sat. She walked by and got two orders before making eye contact with us. Walked by three more times and still got ignored. Another server asked if we ordered the spin dip and we said we hadn't even been greeted yet and she walked away. Still sitting and waiting.. we see another table sit down and she starts taking their order right in front of us. They were on wait when we could see open tables everywhere. Then we sat and Googled another happy hour spot for a few minutes. We left and no one said a single word. We both serve too and this was the worst thing we've ever seen. Hahaha worst service here!! The manager watched us leave too and didn't even budge. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Jake is a new waiter and was very friendly and talkative and did a great job!   THe only complaint was it was a bit warm and it is summer!  But food is what we expect and is  yummy!"}
{"text":"It seems every time we order for take out they get the order wrong or short on something. We gave them another chance tonight. We ordered 2 Pork Carnita Dinners with extra tortillas for both. We got 2 tortillas for the both of us that was cold and hard. The Dinner was cold too. Would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service was good in terms of our food coming in a timely manner and the waiter made suggestions. My disappointment with the service is we were there for my dads 82nd birthday and even though we told the hostess and the waiter they did nothing to make it special.  We asked about it when we left and the hostess apologized and said they usually sing. A little disappointing.  The food was okay, not great but okay."}
{"text":"I met my lil brother and family For lunch here, great service, very nice and great food, we ordered 2 sampler platters being that we had a coupon for a buy one get one free but we hadn't printed it out, the server had gotten a manager Pattie she was understanding that we were unable to print our coupon and asked us to email it to her and she printed it out allowing us to use it, I can appreciate good customer service and they offer that here, thanks for lunch we will be back soon,Thanks Zachary"}
{"text":"1st of all I never review places I eat and think people's best option if not satisfied is to to never return.  That being said I have to share the experience I had at this Macayo location.   This happened approx 3 months ago and has taking me this long to write this down. While eating dinner with my daughters a group of approx 7 people eating next to us, started the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  An older lady at that table  began puking on the floor and employees brought her to go boxes and placed them on the floor so that she could continue puking. Her family kept eating and she kept puking. After 10 minutes or more of this they finally left and hugged a server so I believe they were someone's family ? Anyway my dismay was the way the mess was cleaned up. The mess and puke was swept up with a broom into a dust pan that was dripping puke the entire way across the carpet and into the kitchen. Our server then poured plain water and began to wipe up the carpet with no gloves on. He then set the towel down on the service station and without washing hands brought us our check. Never been so disgusted in my life and will never return."}
{"text":"My husband & I went on a Friday afternoon (3:30) for a late lunch/early dinner. We were sitted & given menus.  Waiters walked by us, no water or chips given to us.  We already had decided what we were going to have.....still not service.  We watched another waitress working her section. They were all being waited on.  I would say at that time of day there was about 9 booths/tables occupied.  Wasn't busy yet.  The waiter in our section kept going back & forth to the kitchen.  He looked over at us but did not acknowledge us.  Including us, he had 3 tables.  We walked out (3:55pm)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, after a long day. Service was great. I ordered fish tacos, they were tasty. Hubby ordered a steak burrito, said it was good. He wanted it with melted cheese, so back it went. It came back with a small \"sprinkle\" of cheese that took both of us by surprise as we fell simultaneously into laughter. What? Is cheese that expensive? Oh, and of course we were charged extra for what should have been  $.50 and no more. LOL."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the food here, but the servers aren't usually very agreeable. I was genuinely the most disappointed with my service the last time I was here. They are always quick to get the food out however this time my server accidentally got my order wrong and instead of apologizing and fixing it he argued with me about what I had actually ordered, and then proceeded to shake his head as he walked away. That is completely unacceptable coming from someone who served her way through college. I felt bad enough about the encounter that I lost my appetite which is also unacceptable. I can only hope their management team will use this as a training opportunity for current and future employees with hopes that they don't treat their guests the way I was treated tonight."}
{"text":"its a chain, the food is decent and filling (as mexican always is), the service was mediocre(fine, but not really impressive, and kinda absent), and its got average prices compared to other mexican restaurant chains.  per tradition you get chips and salsa - salsa is mild but you can request hot. its the very thin style but we were also given an even more spicy option that was chunky. thats my style.  i got the BBQ Chipotle Tacos - 2 tacos with bbq shredded pork, pineapple chunks and an avocado sauce. i thought it was pretty good..mixture of savory and sweet that worked well. their plates come with black beans (can request refried) which is a plus for me.  i dont know why i went and messed with margaritas by getting the (claimed) popular snake bite margarita instead of a traditional. they basically turn it into a sweet girly cocktail with a taste resembling grenadine. there is agave sweetener in it so that would obviously make it sweeter. but in the end, i didnt taste that much spice and it was basically an artificial cherry margarita. and that was on the SECOND attempt. we thought we were sent the wrong order because it was sickeningly sweet the first time and had no spice whatsoever.  i was told i had to try the traditional desert known by these places, Sopapillas...it tasted just like funnel cake minus the texture, with honey to dip in. might have been yummier with fresh fruit (strawberries) on it. but like to choose over something delicious like fried ice cream? meh, pass.  i hear there is about a gazillion restaurant options in phoenix so i wouldnt really come back if it was me."}
{"text":"Love this place! We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here. Margarita fountain and all.  It has something for everyone on the menu. Our out of town guests always love a quick visit here. Feels so 'Arizona' to them."}
{"text":"Ok we returned to this location after a horrible first experience. This time on a Friday night around 6:30pm I must say the second visit was a lot more enjoyable. The staff was very good and the social media person came out and personally greeted us and was very attentive to our needs. Food was delicious and the cocktails were on point. We will return to this location."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband.  I ordered 2 al'a carte items off the menu (taco & enchilada).  They didn't have the prices on the menu for al'a carte.  My husband got the lunch special (burrito).  Chips and salsa were ok.  Both our lunches were ok.  Service was not very good.  Waited for a long time to get the check and when we finally got it, I was shocked that my taco and enchilada was $10.  More than if I would have ordered it with the lunch special.  Same order with rice and beans would have been $8.99.  I asked where the al'a carte prices are on the menu and the waitress said, \"they are not listed\".  I could have got the same items at a fast food place for $5 and it would have been just as good.  Thumbs down on this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my husband.  He had the lunch special and I ordered 2 items al'a carte.  The prices on the al'a carte items are not listed on the menu.  I was very disappointed when I received the check and it was more expensive than the lunch special (which include rice and beans).  I asked them about it but the manager couldn't be found.  We won't return."}
{"text":"Kudos to Macayo's! New menu, clean flavors, clean presentation, solid service... The main man did the build your own thing with an enchilada and a tostada and I had a chicken chimi... All very tasty! Our only complaint was with the chicken on our nachos, it was canned chicken. Not sure why when they used very tender, moist, flavorful chicken in the chimi. The nachos were very good, they would have been great with the shredded chicken. They would have been outstanding if chicken asada had been used!  But this is a HUGE turnaround for Macayo's and for the better!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here on a Friday night. Was seated quickly, and the menu was large...seems like a chain vs. family owned establishment. Not worries.  We were served by the most timid hipster-faced mumbler I've ever met. Seriously could not understand a word he said. I asked for a kids menu for my 13 year old daughter, and he immediately questioned my motives, asking \"just who is this for?\" I explained that my youngest was 14 and special needs and couldn't read such a vast menu with so many choices.....he awkwardly left the table to get our drinks. He then asked to take our order and I had to ask him again to bring a kids menu to the table. We ask if the guacamole is fresh in house. He said yes, and that he recommended it highly , because he just came out here for his night off to have dinner with a friend and that is what he ordered. Okay, then bring it to us. I am pretty sure that it was the Wholly Guacamole brand from Costco. I buy it all the time, and I know the taste.   I have some recent IBD issues, and have to stay away from beans at all costs, so it was hard for me to find a menu item without beans. I finally settle on a salad that is to have Grilled chicken, calabacitas, parmesan cheese and a blend of mixed greens tossed in Cilantro Lime dressing. I looked up clabacitas and noted it had no beans in it (it was supposed to contain corn, zucchini, sweet and poblano peppers). My salad comes with black beans...At first I was not sure if it was my mistake or theirs, so I ask to see the menu. Sure enough, there is no mention of black beans anywhere on the salad description. When I bring this to the attention of our server, he says \"Oh, this is awkward, I hate it when something like this happens. I don't know what to do....\" Then he mumbled off....awkward really is the only word for the service we received. Our bill came for the full amount, and we paid it. As much as I tried to eat around the black beans, the meal still managed to get me sick.  I might go back just to have mumble mouth serve us again. He was so awkwards he was entertaining. But the food really wasn't good enough to warrant a second try.-"}
{"text":"It's been 20 days since this review.  I was contacted by a manager, I believe his name was Dale, who apologized profusely for the poor service.  He then offered to email a \"Dinner for Two\" certificate.  That was two weeks ago.  Guess their internet does not work either.  Or maybe it is just really poor management skills."}
{"text":"Last night my Office Hosted their Annual Christmas Party on the patio and words cannot describe how amazing it was. Juan the manager was super attentive and made sure we were happy from the moment we arrived until the very end. They set up the area for us beautifully and as each attendant arrived the service staff was quick with their drinks and making them feel welcome. We will continue to have our Holiday Parties here! Thank you to everyone who made our office party the hit it was!   I highly recommend hosting your big event here!"}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. We really wanted Mexican food tonight so decided on a late dinner trip. We were greeted right away and sat in a booth. Our server took a while to get to us, but was very pleasant and helpful. We saw a free cheese crisp through yelp so ordered our drinks and started with that. It came out quickly and was crisp and perfect. Even my picky kid ate it ha ha. I was pleasantly surprised to see a build your own mini tacos for my other picky kid who doesn't like cheese...I know weird right?! Anyways he could have either chicken or beef and got the chicken. All the sides came in small bowls and a side of rice. It was perfect for him. My older son ordered a bean and cheese burrito and barely ate it. He said it was very dry. So basically he filled up on soda and didn't eat a thing besides the appetizer and chips and salsa. I ordered the carnitas dinner which was recommended by our waitress . It came with just enough tortillas which a lot of places never give you. Rice and beans as a side. It said it would come with pico as well, but was very disappointed with the tiny pile of lettuce and a few tomatoes mixed together. Bummer. Beans were very dry and couldn't eat them. The carnitas were good, but again dry and had to douse them in salsa. I've been another time where I ordered the street tacos. By far my favorite. Service was outstanding so for me I'll leave 4 stars. Next time I'm just hoping for a little fresher food because I think tonight it sat under a heat lamp too long."}
{"text":"I have been going to Macayo's for years and they have some delicious mexican food. My personal favorite is the chimichanga, which is amazing. I have a hard time ordering anything else because it is perfect. My wife tried the chili relleno last time and that was delicious as well. I've had many different things here and have never been disappointed. Their free chips and salsa are delicious too. I can't find a single complaint."}
{"text":"I work for a very large corporation in the Ahwatukee area and we consistently use Macayo's in Ahwatukee for our catering needs.  Kim, the catering manager has been an amazing partner to us for the past several years.  She can produce an amazing menu for all budgets and she has on several occasions worked magic within budgetary constraints.  Macayo's delivers a delicious product always.  Our employees love it and request it all the time.  They are always on time and Kim always delivers with a smile.   Thanks to the Ahwatukee Macayo's team for being such a great resource for us."}
{"text":"I will be the first to tell you that I do not eat much Mexican outside of my house or my in-laws house because I get it fresh there. So, while in the Mesa area a group of friends decided to go to Macayos to get some food as half of the group is veg/full vegan and needed a place that has some options for them.  The restaurant was not full at all on a Saturday afternoon and though it was blazing outside the AC made it feel nice and cool inside. Our large group of about 15 was seated quickly and our drink orders were taken super fast. After we were all ready to order our order was taken, then it took about 30 mins for our food to come out. The waitress waited until all of our food was ready, which left me starving, but was a good idea as we were all able to eat together.  I, being the \"Taco Kingpin\", ordered the Chicken Tinga tacos with black beans, spanish rice and guacamole. The tinga was better than I expected. I am not sure if many people know what Tinga is, but it is Chicken marinated with onions and chipotle peppers. This one was not spicy at all, as opposed to homemade versions. Everything was above average, as I like to say, regular restaurant Mexican food.  For dessert our table ordered some deep fried ice cream. I did not try it, but from what I heard it was pretty good and easy to share. Overall it was not bad, I could be bias as I do not Mexican food outside my house, but it was above average Mexican."}
{"text":"Macayo's offers a broad selection of Mexican favorites like enchiladas, burritos, chimis, etc.  I had a chicken chimi and it was very flavorful.  The salsa is delicious with just enough heat. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is enormous, but the interior decor is interesting to say the least.  It is overly bright inside, like a Mexican Denny's.  There are fake animals everywhere and enough fake plants to make Rainforest Cafe jealous. Overall this is just an average Mexican restaurant in a town full of great Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been to this Macayo's too many times to count and unlike other restaurants that change over time I can always count on Macayo's to have the best service and food possible. Plus the food is cheap and you get plenty of it. My food choices have varied and I have always been impressed with my choices, although my favorites are still Spinach Con Queso for an appetizer and a Baja Chimi with Beef! Just talking about it now makes me want to go again!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of driving to Surprise because of the traffic but this is the only Macayos open for breakfast on the weekend and of course we got there to late for breakfast so I will have to try again.  This location is really nice in a pretty cool area close to the 303.  Service as great as usually and the atmosphere is like all the others...very casual and comfortable.  I love the Macayos chips and salsa, there is lots of garlic in their salsa and it taste fantastic!  I ordered the beef baja chimi and it was so great I ate the whole thing (even after I promised myself I would only eat half), so much for the diet.  Anyway we loved it and will be back again soon, there just isn't enough Mexican food places that serve brunch any more and it is always the best when they do."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm going 5 stars....mostly because all of the Mexican food in the NW valley is average.  I came here yesterday and was blown away by their green corn tamale with baja sauce, I want to go straight back today just to have another.  Damn was it good!  I had the 2 item lunch special and also got the beef enchilada with beans, total cost came to about $8 and another $2 for the drink so with tax and tip it didn't cost much at all for a good meal in a restaurant.  I always think of this place since I have to drive for more authentic Mexican but Macayos has pretty darn good chips and salsa (which is how you know your food will be good) and I also get another dish here but I can't seem to remember right now....guess I will have to re-review later.  Not sure I will ever get anything else but that tamale anyway, just get it done."}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE. I asked a question about an item on the menu on one occasion, and the condescending waitress treated me like a deaf child who couldn't read. Another time, the waitress we had was obviously having a bad day because she kept cursing in Spanish under her breath, and practically threw our food at us when it came, and then never returned the rest of the time we were there. The glasses, silverware, and tables have been dirty EVERYTIME, and they always take FOREVER. Not returning to this location."}
{"text":"To be honest, I used to love this place. I regret coming back here after 5 years. Before the place was beautifully decorated and it was beautiful. Now, it's very plain. The salsa we were served was watered down and the chips were stale. I had fish tacos which were subpar compared to the other tacos I've ever had. My family ordered veggie enchiladas and they were atrocious. My sister ordered the mini chimis and they were undercooked and not filled with anything. The only reason I gave this place deserves a star is their margaritas were ok. I had a flight and they were way too sweet. To be honest, as Mexican food in Arizona go, go anywhere else. I don't understand why , as I quote our waiter, \"the cooks were being lazy.\"  That's never a good excuse for a restaurant. I felt insulted hen the waiter told us that. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch around 1:30. Restaurant was probably 30% full. The Hostess was nice but our waitress didn't show up for a good 15minutes. A salad and two tacos should not take over 40minutes to cook.  Will never go back to sit down next time I will go to their fast food building."}
{"text":"I lived in Arizona for a lot of years and Macayo's was good back then. I still buy their taco sauce at Walmart for homemade tacos. While not true Mexican food, back then it was good and not real expensive.  Things have changed for the worst judging by the mixed reviews and my personal experience. Bad service, bad food and prices that are not reflective of what the quality of the food or the serving size.  Ours was a party of three all former Arizonians and prior customers of Macayo's. Two of us ordered tacos, 1 order of fish tacos and I ordered chicken street tacos. They only serve 2 tacos for an order and they are scrawny at that. All of the tacos disintegrated as we picked them up and we ended up eating tacos with our forks. The person who ordered the fish tacos suffered from an upset stomach later. My chicken street tacos were terrible, the worst I have ever had. Cubes of diced chicken with some cabbage and pico.   The service was deplorable, I think the tacos fell apart because they were ready but not picked up by the server in a timely manner allowing the tortillas to get wet and fall apart. We had to wave the waitress down to get our check because she avoided eye contact throughout our visit.  I hate to give one of my old favorites a bad review but it was a total bad experience."}
{"text":"My grandparents love coming to this place. Every time we come they always order the mini chimichangas and LOVE them. The last time we came I ordered the the Grilled Steak Tacos with black beans and calabacitas. It was delicious! Everything here is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my favorites and Macayo's did not disappoint. I had the enchilada sampler which was wonderful. The serving portions are large, so half of it will become my lunch.  They had an amazing top shelf margarita that was one of the smoothest I have ever had. We definitely will be going back to ask for our new favorite waiter Carlos. Upon arriving we were seated immediately. Our food came quickly and one of the supervisors was walking around to see how things were going. Interior was bright and cheery too."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. We walked in and after a short wait were seated. The runner promptly greeted us and delivered chips and salsa. Chips were warm and there were two kinds of salsa. They both were fairly decent. That's where it ends. We sat for 15 minutes without a single person coming to our table. So we walked out. It's too bad because the menu looked promising. Apparently they need servers at this restaurant because there were none in sight."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and nice, very relaxed atmosphere. Now on to the food.... Bland no taste except the basics. Not what mexican food suppose to taste like.... Salsa was way to water down like their food. Should have stuck to the macayos on my side of town  thomas and 75th ave"}
{"text":"a few weeks ago i went to a different location where we where not pleased with the over all quality and taste of the food...... this time we came to the right location where the food is great and the service is on point. only complaint was a little bit of fat found in my wife's shredded beef chimi. other then that i will come back to this location on 75th ave and thomas  every time."}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks. I went for happy hour at the bar and had a good time. Service was great and not rushed."}
{"text":"Very good food as always! That's the 2nd location we've eaten at and we're always satisfied."}
{"text":"So terrible.  This is not quality food folks.  Everything is overly salty and the queso.  Their beans taste stale and their staff is rude.  The salsa has some spice in it that is so out of place and gross.  I just was so heartbroken that this is what qualifies as Mexican food in Arizona.  Let's just say that I tried it so you don't have to."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this chain (7/12/13) and I don't think we'll be returning. Food was ok...I got chicken breast and it was pretty dry and my husband's food (sorry, forget what he got!) was super greasy. Chips and salsa were probably the best part. Service also left a little to be desired."}
{"text":"Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but it's pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  I've also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me."}
{"text":"food was good but the service needs to be more polish. I know its a good restaurant but the servers need training. Food is good and always ask for fresh salsa.."}
{"text":"It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.  Turnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there."}
{"text":"I love Macayo's but not this location.  Went in the other night and the service was terrible.  The food was so so and the whole environment just seemed like we were bothering them by being there.  Every staff member we encountered was rude.  We sat outside on the patio which is dirty for being a restaurant especially.  Happy to go to many of the other locations but won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed by the low rating this Macayo's has! It's the closest one to where we live, and we've had nothing but great service and delicious, quickly served food.  The last time we went (around 2 pm on a Friday-- admittedly not rush time, but still), we were seated promptly, greeted, asked about our drink order, and served. Our server was attentive and answered all our questions without any snark or exasperation.  Our food came out hot and was delicious-- I forgot exactly what my boyfriend had, but it was something with garlic cream sauce, which was out of this world. I had the California Burrito (or at least that's what I call it... it's the veggie burrito) and it was so good I couldn't wait to take it home for leftovers! (I was the tool who left it there though... booo!)  The meal was reasonably priced, our check came out correctly, and we were given excellent service. No complaints, and we'll be going again!"}
{"text":"I bought a deal chicken to try this place out and they refused to honor my coupon  because they don't know how to use the smart phone app. I hate being ripped off by MACAYOS."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was bad. Waiter never came around, my drink was empty most of the time and wasn't getting refilled. Normally love this place. Wait staff was lacking, I really hope this won't be a normal occurrence."}
{"text":"So I have eaten at Macayo's more times than I can count. We usually go either to this location or the one in Mesa.   Yes it is not authentic Mexican more Americanized Mexican - but the beer is cold the food good and they make a great Margarita especially when you can bring a glass you bought there 10 years and they will refill it for $4 (by the way the older ones are and much bigger - 6oz bigger to be exact).   So not really sure what happened tonight - we arrived at 5:35 and there were only a few tables in use in the bar - we sat down got waters and chips ask for hot salsa and then placed our order 15 minutes goes by and no salsa. Finally at 610 we got our appetizer and were able to remind the waitress about our hot salsa and refills, at 6:25 my buddy got his food (a cheese crisp and green corn tamale bites) with the promise that my veggie fajitas were coming right up .... well at 6:40 I grabbed the bartender and told him he might as well cancel my order - my buddy had already eaten and I was ready to go (and find a place to get something to eat - then again I ate enough chips by that point I wasn't hungry).   I have a feeling it was a kitchen issue our waitress did end up getting at least 5 more tables and it was obvious everyone was asking about food (although two parties that sat down 20 minutes after us got their orders and had paid their bills and were leaving when our first food came out.   So not sure what was up tonight."}
{"text":"Macayo's is one of our go to places for Mexican food. Usually my husband and I will go and order a spinach con queso appetizer and split a shredded beef baja burro. The creamy white sauce is just right and this meal hits the spot when you have a craving."}
{"text":"The food here is always very consistent. I enjoy the veggie tacos and just discovered the Mercado salad. That salad is no joke. So much flavor and very filling. The dressing comes on the side and I'm happy it did. I only used half and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Slow service, mediocre Mexican food. Happy Hour Marg's are premixed and maybe 5% alcohol. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I love the chimichangas that they have here, they are SO good.  We've been going to this location for many years and have always had a good time when we stop in for dinner.  The food is good and the margaritas are tasty."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- childlike.  Service- awful. Food was okay. Drinks were eh! The hostesses were arguing about something when we walked in...very unprofessional. ...don't waste your time"}
{"text":"7/21/16 7:45 pm Dinner is finished. Overall, another enjoyable experience. With the food itself you can sense/taste the quality and effort they put in to creating the dish. Not too salty, not too spicy, etc.   Our waitress was very hospitable. She made sure to check on us periodically, not over or under doing it. No attitude, unless it were an upbeat, positive one."}
{"text":"We got some food for take out from here not long ago, and really enjoyed the food and pricing so we decided to come back again tonight and actually eat in the restaurant. Once again the food was great, we got our chips & salsa and meal in a timely manner, and our waitress Carissa (not sure if that's the correct way to spell it) was fantastic. She was timely, had an amazing personality and was so friendly! It's one thing to just have good food and a server that is attentive, but even better to have someone who just has that personality to work in the customer service industry. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years so, decided to rediscover it.    Got veggie enchiladas and they weren't bad.  The sauce was a little tangy for my taste so, scraped off a lot of it and the huge glob of sour cream that went on top.  It helped a little but, enchilada sauce just soaks in and takes over. The rice was good and the beans were really awesome that came with it.    I'm picky with salsa and the bowl that they give you with chips has some good flavor to it."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to acknowledge that this review has nothing to do with the staff. Our waitress was very pleasant, friendly, and attentive, as was every other staff member with whom we interacted. The positives ended there, though. The salsa is probably the most bland salsa I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant. I asked for spicier salsa, and it wasn't any better-- and definitely was NOT spicy. Onto our meals. Very overpriced, to begin with. $11 to choose 2 items off of an a la carte menu? Seriously? My husband thought his meal was just okay (chicken enchilada and chile relleno), but the enchilada sauce was horribly bland. I ordered the vegetable fajitas. They brought out the standard fajita plate (guac, sour cream, tomatos, lettuce, beans, tortillas), but the vegetable fajita dish was steamed broccoli, squash, and zuccinni with absolutely no seasonings. I've NEVER had a Mexican restaurant serve me plain steamed broccoli for fajitas! I asked about the traditional fajita vegetables (the grilled, seasoned peppers and onions) and was told that I would have to pay extra for a side of them. Wait... I ordered veggie fajitas but actual fajita veggies cost extra?? By the end of the meal, we had paid almost $30 when we could have had a better \"Mexican\" meal at Taco Bell for $7. I won't be going back to Macayo's... even if someone else is picking up the tab."}
{"text":"Yummy. Standard Americanized Mexican food establishment. The service is hit or miss, but never bad. This is the place that finally got my wife to start eating Mexican food, huge thanks to Macayos! The Chimi is amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 3 year Anniversary here on 9-6-17. This has always been one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, haven't been here in quite sometime! Glad to know it didn't let me down after a few years has gone by.  Anyway first off let me say, our waitress was AMAZING! My wife asked for recommendations on the menu and she was very helpful!   While The choices on the menu is what you would find on most other restaurant menu's, the food is awesome! I LOVED the flavors! Sometimes you get just a pile of food at other places where everything tastes the same..not here. Its very different, kinda hard to explain. My wife had never been here before, and she loved it!   We had a cook leaving for the night and came over to talk to us just for the heck of it. He saw us and we talked for about almost 10 mins or so. He was a real nice guy, his name was Sunny, not sure if that's how he spells his name, but you get the drift. Gave us recommendations as well.   Just very impressed by this location, and while we came when it wasn't busy, it was nice just to be taken care of like we were,. Hopefully our next experience is just as great!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I was going to go to this place but wanted some information so I called and no one answered. So I took my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience"}
{"text":"-An acceptable chain restaurant to take \"out-of-town\" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.  -Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any \"...Berto's\" type place in the Valley!  -Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.  -$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.  -Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from \"salsa breath\".  -Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?  -Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.  -Parking is plentiful.  -Separate entrance in the back for take-out."}
{"text":"Food was real good during our recent happy hour visit. Sat in the bar and had great service. No music playing and kinda of a not so happy environment. Don't mistake the food and service good it just seems like a little bit of radio or even live music would take this place from food to great."}
{"text":"Understaffed.  The chimichanga was very good.  The spinich was not too salty. I will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food. I had tortilla soup which I'd never had before but loved it. I also ordered some tortillas but they were mostly charred. I also had some mini chimis and they were ok. Bit dry.  I docked it two stars however because of the way the servers are forced to work. I was with big parties both nights I was there, and the restaurant seats them and has no manpower to take care of them if it's at all busy.   The first night, my server Fannie was an absolute sweetheart. I told the manager and he said that he'd only been there 5 days and had already added her as \"one of his favorites\". I'm sorry dude, you're nice and everything but five days in you shouldn't already be having favorites. I mean Fannie should be everyone's favorite but hold your judgement for a couple weeks man! You don't even know your staff yet! He also said that if I wrote a good review about her she would get a chance to join a raffle for free work uniforms and stuff like that. That seems wrong to me. Uniforms should be paid for by the jobs anyway. (I should know, because mine aren't either and it's bull. How are you gunna make someone pay to work at a place?!)   Anyway both nights the place was understaffed and the servers had good poker faces but they were drowning. It took forever just to take our orders because the servers were stretched so thin. Then the food took forever because there weren't enough cooks.   In all it took over half an hour to get me some water (the second night, I don't know who that server was but it wasn't Fannie! That angel kept me and my friends quenched! But I know the second server was also in over his head with customers poor thing)   And over an hour to get food. So I would definitely recommend this place in small groups and either on slow hours or with patience.   I would also recommend people to start applying here and help these servers out! You rock Fannie. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a special day and We had Mitch as our server whom started off with a decent server relationship.  The person Whom I came with received the incorrect order and when they brought it to Mitch's attention the plate was taken away with no apology, no acknowledgement, nothing. The correct item was brought back by Erin not our server Mitch with extra sauce. When the bill came out we were charged for a side of sauce we didn't ask for (my companion added for extra sauce to their entree which it was). My friend inquired as to Mitch's lack of acknowledgement of the meal error. He simply replied, let me get my manager. We spoke to the manager who took the side of sauce off, which we requested, and comp'ed the meal 20%. Needless to say Mitch didn't get a great tip and hopefully his manger spoke to him about the mediocre service we received. The food was delicious as always."}
{"text":"Had planned to dine elsewhere but when that did not work out, we had heard good things from family so ultimately came here for lunch.  It was surprisingly quiet, which perhaps should have been our first clue.  Our drinks came quickly and our orders were taken and we started in on the chips and salsa.  It was fresh but a little watery for me.  The queso dip was blah.  It seemed to be lacking flavor and quickly hardened.  Three of the orders came quickly, but the fourth came MUCH later (at least 5 minutes) without any explanation or apology.  Our waiter seemed scattered and even spilled a pitcher of tea (thankfully not very close to our table).  We would ask for refills or extra chips etc, sometimes they would come, often we would have to remind him or our requests. The combination I chose was mediocre.  The chicken enchilada was just OK but thankfully topped it with the Baja sauce upon the suggestion of a family member.  The chili relleno had the thickest batter and was tasteless.  The black beans were seemingly straight from the can topped with a little cheese.  The highlight of my lunch was the bite of a fellow diners chicken tamale ... sweet and savory and topped with the baja sauce ... I found myself wishing I had followed her lead and ordered that instead ..."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite here for lunch with some family who were in from out of town. It's conveniently located just a short ways off the freeway (and among a bunch of other shopping options, if you need to hop off the freeway and take care of both food and shopping).   The inside is decorated wonderfully - lots of color and interesting things to look at. Service was good, food was pretty good, price was reasonable. I'd definitely stop by again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"My family and I came to this location for the first time today. Great customer service, the food came out fast to our table and our waitress was great...too bad I don't recall her name. Anyhow, I'm still a huge fan of their green Chile tamale bites(omg delicious) and the shredded beef tacos! The water view was great too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, the table we were sat at was dirty so we asked to move. Libby was so accommodating and apologized for the dirty table. We were able to choose our seat and our waitress was Karissa. She was spot on with her manner, knowledge and recommendations. At the end of it all, thank you girls for making it worth the stop in!!"}
{"text":"The food is lacking quality and cost is not that great. I paid over $8 for one enchilada and one side; that's it - that was the plate. The enchilada was not very good and my side, tortilla soup, was okay.   Do not order the sopaipillas. This restaurant does not know how to make them. They were quite disgusting. Sopapillas are supposed to be thin and fluffy yet what we got were fried biscuits. extremely dense and hard to eat. Not very tasty, not authentic sopapillas.   Needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal. Don't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal. I do not know how their alcoholic drinks are since we didn't order any."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner this evening. We've been here before and the results have been hit and miss.  We arrived and had to wait about 25 minutes for a table. We got seated at the table and the manager took our drink order. He brought the drinks over after a few minutes and someone dropped off chips and salsa. But then no one ever came to take our order. We had to ask for a server to place an order after a good 20 minutes at the table. They were Busy but I've seen it busier. By that time there were empty tables. We placed the order with the server. I told him no cheese no guacamole and no sour cream on anything. My husband ordered four tacos Ala cart, crispy shell, only meat and cheese and lots of extra cheese even cheese on the side. We said it multiple times.  We are now at the restaurant for an hour before the food comes. My food had cheese on it, my husband's tacos had more than meat and cheese on them. We sent it all back and waited another 10 minutes or so before it got brought back again. Mine was correct but my husband's were barely warm with barely any cheese and not in crispy shells. We told the waiter we wanted the manager. Finally after we had been there an hour and 20 minutes my husband got up and went and found the manager himself. The manager remade his tacos and did not charge us for the meal and admitted the waiter had never told him we asked to see him.   We were there for 2 hours to have a simple meal. The manager was very apologetic and tried to make it right but we will not be coming back. This is not the first time we've had issues getting the right food or with getting my husband's tacos barely warm.   I would have given it one star but because the manager attempted to make it right I gave it two."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here before but it was great!  Very friendly staff. Fast service, good food and drinks and moderately priced. Super atmosphere.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Sigh. Yet another disappointment and another lesson in why you should never give second chances. I really try to stick to my general rule of never setting foot in a place with less than a 4-star average, but in my naivete, I thought perhaps things had changed in the last decade. In a word, nope.  We were promptly greeted and given a nice, three-seater, rounded booth, but off the bat I found it awkward. A party of two in that setup means that you can't sit next to each other without being perpendicular and facing different directions. You could opt to sit on opposing sides of the booth, but then you're five feet apart, which is also annoying for a couple. Not interested in starting off the experience with a complaint, we opted to suck it up and make the best of it. Again, really awkward choice for a party of two, but we saw several other couples that got stuck in the same booths. Just weird.  Next up, the chips and salsa. While i appreciate that they were complimentary, the chips were somewhat flavorless and stale, and the salsa looked and tasted like someone took expired, store-bought mild salsa and mixed it 50/50 with lukewarm water. This is the only place I have ever been where I legitimately preferred to take my stale chips down dry rather than eating them with salsa. It was that bad. What kind of Mexican restaurant manages to screw up chips and salsa?   Next up, the entrees, probably the biggest let down of the night. I ordered a chimichanga, the \"Grande\" meal, so-called because it comes with \"everything\". Their version of \"everything\" basically means that they up charge from the regular chimichanga dinner, just so you can have beans, rice, sour cream and guacamole. Why in the hell do I have to pay extra for what every other legit Mexican restaurant would give you as part of any chimichanga entree, usually for a lot less money? The nickel and dime bullshit didn't stop there. My wife ordered tacos and the server asked if she wanted the sour cream and guacamole on the side. Since my wife hates both, she said that was fine. Only after we got the bill, did we find out that this was two separate side orders we neither needed nor wanted, and they charged us $3.78 between the two of them. The sour cream was as thick as freshly scooped ice cream, and the guacamole was not fresh or flavorful at all. What a total rip off and dick move by the server.   To add insult to injury, they are stingy on the portion size. Smallest chimichanga I have ever gotten at a Mexican restaurant, and my wife only got two tacos, both of which were made with shitty tortillas that came apart almost immediately. Neither entree had much flavor, and the chimichanga was one of the worst I've ever had. If you imagine eating unseasoned, flavorless chicken that has been wrapped in wet, mushy cardboard, that about sums it up. Absolutely no crunch, no flavor, no nothing.   Last but not least, I must address the clientele in here. Even though it was at least half empty, due the late hour (after 8:30pm), there were still screaming, bastard children all over, along with their degenerate parents, who of course did nothing to stop them from disrupting everyone else's dinner. Why the hell anyone has their toddlers and infants awake at this hour, I can't even imagine, but it was really off-putting to have some screaming little shit race by our booth every five minutes. Am I in a daycare center or a restaurant?   When the bill showed up, no booze and no appetizers, two entrees with under-sized portions and crap quality, one scoop of inedible sour cream and one scoop of nasty guacamole came in at over $40 before the tip. I can't even remember the last time we spent that much at a Mexican restaurant, and this was probably half the amount of food we usually get anywhere else too. To call it highway robbery would be an understatement. These people should be ashamed of what they deliver for the price they charge.   Would I return? Fuck no!"}
{"text":"Very rude front entry group. Not helpful or nice at all sour faces and act like they don't want to be there."}
{"text":"I ordered the corn crisp. It was supposed to come with Pico De gallo and salsa. I added beef. My order comes out looking like my 7 year old made an afternoon snack. Hot mess! I asked my \"server\" where the other stuff is. He said no, it's just this. I said, no it comes with blah blah blah. He responded ya, maybe it comes with salsa or something, walked away, and yall... He didn't return. Needless to say, I did not eat nor pay for this hot mess. The service was nuts and I find it hilarious that this microwaved snack took forever to come out. Ya, no thanks! I remember this place being the place to be back in the day. No more."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Macayo's, but after stopping by for dinner last night, I will probably not be visiting this location again.  First off, when pulling into their parking lot, there is a very visible sign notifying customers that Macayo's is not responsible for any items stolen from customer's cars. Not so good. If you are openly warning me that break-ins are frequent in your parking lot, why should I eat here if there is a safer option somewhere else?  On the night I visited this location, four of us had stopped by to grab dinner before a concert. When we asked for a table, we were offered seats at the bar. No big deal - except that after we walked around the corner, we quickly learned that the bar was completely full. Back to the hostess station.  We are now walked back to another portion of the restaurant that is almost completely empty. Huh. In any case, our server promptly brought us drinks and kept the chips & salsa coming until my brother arrived.  One of my favorite entrees is the Baja Chimi, but I have to tell you that I was really disappointed with the one that I ate here. I chose shredded beef, but apparently at this location that includes gristle & fat that I don't normally receive at the other Macayo's locations. I'm not sure what the issue was here, but at least three times I bit into meat that was inedible.  Our server was very attentive and kept things moving, so kudos to him for doing an excellent job. Hostess station...not sure what was going on there. As customers were leaving, they never even thanked them for stopping by - or even wished anyone a good evening. In fact, the girls in the front appeared to be spending more time talking to each other than to customers. This is really not THAT big of a deal to me, but if it were my restaurant, I would probably extend myself a little more to thank my customers for choosing me over another establishment.  If you do decide to visit this Macayo's location before seeing a concert at the nearby Pavillion, plan on arriving there at least 2 hours before the show. If you arrive this far in advance, you will have no problem getting a table. One hour before the show and this place will be packed with concertgoers.  I am still a Macayo's fan, and I will still frequent the Depot Cantina location in Tempe - but I will probably not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"UGH... Three weeks ago my husband and I went into the Macayo's restaurant in Goodyear and smelled a TERRIBLE smell.  The hostess explained that the sewer had backed up, but if you go to the back of the restaurant you really can't smell it.  REALLY?!?!?  I don't think so... and I think it must be against a health code someplace to keep the doors open when your sewer is backed up.  The bathrooms are located right next the front doors when you walk in.  There a lot of people in the restaurant eating even with the stench.  I can't believe they continued to serve food, the restaurant should have been closed.  I'll never go back there again.  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the response from management but this was a very disappointing meal. I didn't touch the rice and you can see how small of a portion I was given, the sauce was watery and tasted terrible. I dropped $30 in your restaurant and with all due respect, that's not a mistake I'm willing to make again. Arizona is loaded with quality Mexican Restaurants so unfortunately it's one strike and you're out.   I've  been going to Macayo's for decades and I always thought the food was good. Not sure what happened tonight but the sauce for my chimi was horrendous and inedible. I picked it apart trying to salvage any portion but finally gave up. I've been living in Chicago for the last decade so I'm not sure if it was a bad night or a change in quality over the years but either way this is not the place I remember.    Disappointed :("}
{"text":"Great place! Great food!!! Good service!!! Happy workers!!! Green corn tamale is so good! Good drinks! Awesome happy hour too!"}
{"text":"The service is the only thing this place had going for it. The bartender Becky was friendly and helpful despite being very busy and short handed. However, almost every single table was trashed and the bar was gross. Dirty dishes everywhere. The food was sub-standard for a decent Mexican American dish. I got the carne asada tacos and the meat was not tender at all, difficult to chew. Low quality for sure."}
{"text":"So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision.   Perhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful.   Between my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either).   Our server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.  If you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.  I will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe."}
{"text":"I admit, I am not a mexican food coniseur, but I have a taste for it every now and then.  Being that I've never eaten at a Macayo's before, I thought I would give it a shot this time, and sit down and eat here at this location.  On the good side, the place is very colorfully decorated....lots of bright colors, and plenty of decor to match.  The service was wonderful, and I enjoyed myself while I was here.  The down side, is that I found the food a bit pricy, and I wasn't all that impressed.  I ordered 2 tacos and a cup of tortilla chicken soup.  The cup was rather tiny, and was a bit disappointed with the small portion.  It was good, but a bit spicy for my taste.  The tacos were good, but honestly, Ive gotten bigger, better tasting tacos from Filbertos at half the price.  I could see myself coming here more as a happy hour guest, or bringing some out of town friends here to enjoy the decor and get a taste for some of thier food, but not as a regular customer.  I don't think its bad, I just feel that the food was just okay and it was a bit overpriced for what I felt like I got."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. I love their mini chimis and I also got a patron margarita that was on special that was pretty good. My husband did the fajita quesadilla and said it was pretty good! Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Great traditional family owned restaurant, I went on some of my first dates to Macayo's when I was young.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is upbeat and the server's are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Macayo's has pretty good Mexican food and a nice variety.  The atmosphere is great and the service is generally pretty good."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food, ever. We were there for lunch. We were rudely greeted by a very annoyed host who told us it was a 20-25 minute wait so we went to the bar. The restaurants in general was not clean. We ordered a cheese and chili quesadilla and  carne Assad burrito. I did not think you could mess up a quesadilla but I now know you can. There was so little cheese that it did not cover the tortilla and it was full of chilies. It should have been a chili quesadilla. The burrito was bare bones as well on a dry tortilla. We got a view of inside the Kitchen and it was a mess and not very clean. Save yourself. Go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, the customer service is subpar, and take-out orders take a century to get done. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I'll just go back to Popo's."}
{"text":"My family and I love Mexican food. If and when we eat out its almost always Mexican. We love coming to Macayos for so many reasons. They have a ton of booths, family friendly, great wait staff, super quick service and we almost never have to wait longer than 5-10 minutes for a table. There's a lot is chain type Mexican places in the arrowhead area and they are definitely not all created equal. Macayos is most definitely the best!"}
{"text":"This Macayo's is just like every other Macayo's except they have the slowest service in the world.  Standard chain Mexican food. I normally get the California burrito and an Iced tea. Nothing overly spectacular. Actually, the chips and salsa are really good.  Do not come here if you are in a rush because you will be anxiously shifting in your seat waiting for your check at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"I like the food here. One of the better Mexican restaurants that we've been to off of Bell. Can't say it's the best Mexican food but it's pretty good. The interior is very eye catching. I like the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"This place smelled disgusting as soon as we entered, so we also left! It smelled like sewer!! We've had bad experiences with places that smell disgusting like this so therefore we wouldn't recommend any place that STINKS! It has a lot to say about their food in my opinion. I would give zero stars but in order for my review to post I had to choose to add a star."}
{"text":"Very sad day today.  The day that I finally gave up on macayos.  For almost a year the service has been going down hill, but we kept coming back hoping against hope that it would return to form.  Macayos used to be the restaurant we told our friends to go try in phoenix.  No longer.    Today we were sat at a table by a grouchy hostess, and there we remained for 15 mins before our existence was acknowledged again.  The salsa, which used to be the high point of the meal, was a pasty tomatoey bland mess.  The chips were the dregs from the bottom of the barrel.  My diet coke was good, for what it's worth.  When we were finally given a chance to order, the waitress corrected my pronunciation of my side (which is fine) but when the meal came and said side was not on my plate at all, a little piece of me died inside.  \"Here is your rice and beans, sir.\" It was not worth a complaint.  The entrée, while decent, could be found at nearly any quick service Mexican food place, and was not worth the 12 bucks I paid for it.    The worst part was the ambiance though.  There was a distinct lack of ranchero music, or any music for that matter.  Instead, my wife and I were serenaded by the sound of clattering cutlery, and the profanities of the table neighbors.  They were a classy bunch, one of whom kicked the other as they were leaving, to which the assaulted party yelled \"what the f----!\" Icing on the cake.  A little loud ranchero music would have completely covered that macayos.  Take note.  All in all, there are plenty of good Mexican restaurants in pPoenix.  I'm going to go to a good one from now on."}
{"text":"The service was very attentive. The people were very nice. The food was great. I had the 1 shredded beef taco and 2 sides. The tortilla soup was delicious and so were the refried beans. My husband had chicken tacos and rice and beans. The chips kept coming. It was wonderful"}
{"text":"Came in and no hostess had to wait.  Seated and waited for the iced tea.  Meal is ok for lunch. I think it's a little pricey for what you get on the lunch menu.  No big difference from their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.   Now you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.    But sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant. They make McDonald version of Mexican food.  I can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc.  I am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food."}
{"text":"Macayos is an Arizona staple. Their baja sauce is as good as it gets. Wait wait no...the green tamale bites with the baja sauce are as good as it gets. Ruben is an amazing server, he always remembers us when we comes in and makes it a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Great prompt delivery service from grub hub. The food was warm and delicious!"}
{"text":"We've been to Macayo's a million times, this time was by far the best. Our waiter Rick did a fantastic job! Due to allergies, I have a fairly complicated order and he listened intently without making me feel like it was a hassle. Our food came out super quick and both of our meals were delicious! Rick checked on us a few times and was on top of our drink and chips refills! The manager thanked us on the way out and we let him know how great Rick was!"}
{"text":"Overall we like this place. The food is good but service is not so much. We have NEVER had a friendly server here. We go at least twice a month, and it always seems like the servers are angry. Never had anyone with any personality. The food is good though and a affordable. We always split an appetizer and then share the combo platter. Plenty of food and your out for a good price! We will continue to go!"}
{"text":"We came here without checking Yelp on a whim while out driving. I'm surprised that the reviews are not better.  Our server Brenna was stellar. She recommended the Chicken Poblano and it was soooooo delicious. We will be back.  The chile poppers were super hot... But the filling and the dipping sauce were very tasty.   Give them a try"}
{"text":"Never experienced such slow service in my life and it wasn't crowded. They messed up my friends order twice. Overpriced fajitas which were burnt. Meeiocre food at best. Booth was dirty. Overall bad experience. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Not a place for authentic Mexican food but if you are looking for gringo southwest food where you can take lightweights from the east coast to it is ok.  I do like their salsa. Lots of flavor but not very spicy. The guacamole is a overpriced rip off. It is what it is."}
{"text":"What the heck do zebras have to do with a Mexican restaurant? Yep, nothing. I abhor the decoration here, but more than that, the food was not good either. This was not my choice of restaurants, but fortunately I do not have to go back.   The only thing that was good were the warm chips."}
{"text":"Oh, yummmm.  She thought the tortilla soup was delicious, and He found the albandigos soup was the flavor he had been seeking since Yuma in the 60's.  It is definitely a family atmosphere....four babies at the next table, but but good-natured and comfortable.  We will come back again when we are in the area.  Don't pass up the chocolate chimis!  Follow-up:  We did get back, on our next trip, and She had the soup again.  Great food, but that marguerita was  MONSTER....had to take a l-o-n-g walk after dinner!"}
{"text":"Service is bad here. Ring the bell for take out someone yells just a minute then they never come."}
{"text":"I wrote off Macayo's awhile back, though I can't remember why. I think the giant dining room was too big and loud but this time we opted to sit at a corner table in the bar (introvert success!). We were treated to sweet early 2000's alt rock during our meal including jams from smash mouth, creed, and vertical horizon. Still better than echoes of screaming children and the loud aunt from Wisconsin exclaiming her joy of having a real margarita.   But on to the food. Being vegan in north Phoenix/Glendale can be an isolating experience with chain restaurants and a few emerging enterprises making a plant based meal nearly impossible or unenjoyable. Macayo's, however, has a decent option in their \"calabacitas\" (I thought it was supposed to be a squash of some sort but it was a mix of peppers, corn, and zucchini which was fine with me) tacos simply ordered without cheese. I ordered black beans and veggies for my side (which was basically the contents of the tacos on plate). Normally I would order rice but I thought to double check with my server despite reading the rice was vegan from a previous yelp review. She verified it was back to being made with chicken stock but it has been changing frequently. Hopefully they omit chicken stock in the future. Anyway, the pair of tacos were well filled, dotted with a dollop of guacamole, and served with a tomatillo salsa that added a nice pop of freshness. There was also a habanero salsa but it wasn't my jam. My partner ordered a cheese crisp with Baja sauce (after seeing everyone on here losing their shit over the condiment) and found it to be exactly what he expected (because, despite the simplicity of a cheese crisp, it is possible to make one poorly). My tacos were excellent. I'm very pleased to be able to put Macayo's back into my short list of vegan friendly sit-down restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The food was OK+, but not anything to write home about.  Place was OK, but again, nothing special    Went with a large group,  and the service was attentive and good.  Will I come back? Probably not.  There are just too many better places."}
{"text":"it took 20 minutes for me to even so much as get LOOKED at by my server and then she ignored us and it took Kelly Salhus to happen to see us from accross Macayos (THANK GOD) whose not even our server , to get us chips and drinks...  my server (not kelly) then proceeded to bring my FIVE YEAR OLD an adult glass cup & never had the thougght to maybe take it back and bring a kids cup maybe ???  lord have mercy!!!!!!!!!!   i at least gave Kelly her well deserved 5 stars for taking the initiative to be a proactive server !!"}
{"text":"My family and I went there Sunday and to say the least we were disappointed in the food. Service was fast and the waitress was really nice but who ever is in the kitchen did not take time preparing food or making sure the food was on par. We both ordered fish tacos and when we took the first bite they were almost cold... There was barely any fish in it. Even the rice and beans were cold like they had been sitting out..  We won't be returning to that Macayo's ever again."}
{"text":"I have been eating at valley Macayo's for most of my 48 years.  The service is great here and some things still remain, but this location is not living entirely up to the standard as far as food, quality, taste, service size and value for the price.  Old man Woody would not be pleased about this, I'm sure.    For starters, the chips.  C  In a way I am glad they are no longer using lard, for health reasons, but they are kind of boring now.    And the salsa.  B-   Where are the flavorful oregano chunks?  What happened with the original recipe?   Mostly tomato sauce.  Boring.    the rice. C minus-  It used to be the most flavorful and large portion covering a good chunk of your plate. Where once lovely, soft pieces of oregano and cut green onions lay is now a bland and skimpy small portion.  The original flavor is gone.  PLEASE put it back.    The beans.  A+ They are flavorful but portion size is down.    The enchilada sauce. A+   It is still the original flavor.  They need to hold on to this.  You have not had great red enchilada sauce until you've had this one.    The steak fajitas.  D  - At $15.99 they came in flavorless, kind of chewy and only a miniscule side of beans and pico mixed with lettuce (?) No rice.    It's almost like they forgot to season it.  Sad and not worth the money.     The stuffed Pobalano Chile.  C minus.   Another disappointment.  Stuffed with tender chicken and breaded and deep fried, the intention was good.  But temperature of the deep fryer was too hot for this one as the crust was almost over done but the chile had not been properly tenderized.  It needs to be worked on folks.  I think an egg batter a la chile relleno would be an improvement here.    And what happened to the open buffet happy hour?  This used to be my regular drop off point after work.    The music.  It was an ecclectic mix of modern Latin.  I didn't really get into it.    The decor.  It is still okay.  I think I liked it better previously though.    There are still some wonderful econo choices for dishes, but overall, prices seem to have crept up, taste is down and portion size is down.  The old Macayo's was much better.  Please put it back like it was!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! We my mom's surprise 60th birthday party on the back patio and it was great. I've gotten lucky and always have had great service here. My only complaint is that I wish there was another one closer to my house (in South Chandler)."}
{"text":"food was good but service not the best, I will give it to them due to construction and being busy lunch hour. I will def come back :)"}
{"text":"I visited Macayo's with my family on a visit in early December.  Since I don't live in town anymore, I cannot chalk up my visit to just a bad night, but I can share my experience.    We were hoping to get in for happy hour, but it was packed. Bummer, but not a strike against the restaurant.   We still wanted to stay for some drinks and dinner. We requested a table for 7. Mind you, our party was standing in front of the host stand.  Most of us are about 6' or more with the crowning jewel of height is my step father, clocking in at 7'1\".  They stuck us at two tiny, pushed together tables, 7 of us, in the main walk way from the kitchen. Even if we all were at a more comfortable table, or we were smaller people, you don't put people in the walkways from the kitchen.   My sister and I were constantly getting shoved in the back, but chose to sit there so our parents weren't the ones assaulted.  I had to sit with my purse on my lap since I couldn't hang on the chair with the traffic going by and there was no floor space to spare with our tangle of legs.   I grabbed the margarita menu hoping that ordering a couple would help save the quickly falling mood.  DAMN DRINKS WERE $10+. At a bloody restaurant, during happy hour.  Oh but happy hour doesn't apply to the dining side.  A few of us ordered a drink, still.  My mom's came with just a piece of lime rind, my upgraded margarita looked like a regular and came in a smaller glass and I just got excuses from the waiter that they are the same ounces. (Bullshit and we pointed it out with the empties after the fact but he didn't care.)  I was still charged the $12.50 for the shorted drink. The food was ok but not much of a selection.  I shared a meal with my sister to off set the cost of our drinks.   It was very disappointing and my mom was crushed that the only evening we had to visit a Mexican restaurant, during my visit to Arizona, was such crap."}
{"text":"Two stars feels a little harsh but Macaynot's just didn't quite measure up to the standard for Mexican in the valley.  One of the restaurants I held up as a standard to judge Macaydon't's against is a little hole in the wall Mexican place near my office.  The food there is less diverse but more authentic and better than Macayshouldn't's and for the price much better.  So if I can get better than Macayno's and more authentic than Macaykeepgoingo's and cheaper than Macaymovealongthere'sbetterandcheaperMexicandowntheroadalittleway's than why I am going to eat there?  They do have a nice outdoor seating area on a pond that features large warning signs about not feeding the birds as well as diners feeding the birds and a live demonstration on the mercenary behavior of birds when they get used to people feeding them and practically land on your plate to grab a peck or two.  The food came out very quickly at Macayhuh's and the service was very good.  Everything slowed to a crawl for some reason when we asked for a box and the check.  Don't get the wrong impression, Macaysosofood's is OK, it's not bad by any stretch.  I would eat here if someone else was buying for sure.  I had a fish taco (overdone) and blue corn enchilada which was OK."}
{"text":"Loved our experience at Macayos! Food was really yummy, and the atmosphere was welcoming. The hostess pushed together about 6 tables to accommodate our large party, and service was fast. $0.99 tacos were a little hard to chew, but my Baja burrito was scrumptious."}
{"text":"i greatly enjoy this restaurant. The chips are brought warm and i love the picante salsa which can be brought along with a hotter salsa as well. The orders are large and the taste is wonderful . i usually order a Burro and it covers the plate :) Able to get to our table quickly and food also is brought in a good timely manner. I have eaten at 3 of their restaurants and they are all the same and very good."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Gave Macayo's a shot but I wish I didn't. The food is bland for Mexican food. We waited for what seemed like forever for a burrito and street tacos. The meat in the tacos was very dry and basically inedible. The poor waiter said that someone had taken my order by accident so he had made the tacos himself. My fiancé said that his burrito was subpar and since we hadn't eaten in hours he was not a happy camper."}
{"text":"Amazing. Went to Scottsdale location on a roadtrip to mejico. It was disappointing literally disappointing. I then was driving back to LA, and thought why not try to make up for it? And stopped at this location. Dear god service is better food was better faster best service ive ever had, chips were fresh and hot this time. Huge difference!!! I love macayos. Enchiladas, red corn Taquitos, Baja sauce, beans n cheese! Jordan was the best service ever. She is amazing!!!!  Further: If you do not like this, it's because you are choosing very poorly for entrees. What can one TRULY never go wrong with at Macayos?  - Red Corn Chicken Taquitos - Cheese Crisp (dont ask - just eat it!) - They used to have Chicken Maximillion but they removed it from the menu so I'm going to just say mostly anything with the baja sauce.   I was disappointed by: - Baja Chicken Chimichanga  - Macayos Burgers - Green Corn Tamale- way too much jalepeno.  If you go for the classics, your mind will explode every time. If you don't.. sorry.. you will give it 1-2 stars, as it is GRINGO Mexican. It has a few spectacular dishes which I drive 5.5 hours just to consume, but it's not authentico by any flip of the coin. There's nothing wrong with that, but just don't expect it."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We waited to be sat for 10 minutes and there were plenty of tables open. We were not given lunch menus. Our waitress was rude the minute we sat down. Our order took 45 minutes to come out and it was wrong. When we told her she mumbled under her breath and walked away.  She never brought the correct food. We will never be going back!"}
{"text":"I am a long time fan of Macayos since I first ate at one in Mesa 1999. This visit was disappointing. No one acknowledged us as we walked in. We walker in to bar area and I went searching for hostess. We asked if we could sit outside, she said yes and she would bring us menus and plates. We waited 8 min and she never came. We walked back in and sat at the bar, (hostess was standing around chatting). The bartender was the saving grace for our visit. He   Seemed to be juggling bartending and helping the servers wait in the few tables there. A customer actually came to the bar to order refill/drinks bc she hadn't seen her waitress in so long. Food tastes great. Good job to the bartender. Hope the rest of staff appreciates him"}
{"text":"Today before my food was brought out I was informed they were out of Baja sauce... that's the only way I eat my burrito. So I ended up not enjoying it. Had I been given the opportunity I would have ordered tacos instead. They didn't charge me for the Baja but I would have liked something else should have let customer know asap. It was a California type burrito and isn't good to me without Baja sauce. I ended up not liking the burrito but would have like the opportunity to get something else instead of told abruptly something missing"}
{"text":"This review is gonna be a little different. As much as I go here, you would think I love Mexican food. Truth is, I'm not a big fan at all. My wife loves it and with that, I'm bound to make an appearance once a week.   My two items that I rotate here are the California burrito, and the Cheeseburger. The burrito is the closest thing here I can get to Chipotle which I love, and the burger, well it's pretty good, but nothing special. The hidden gem here is the french fries. Man those are good. Cooked in the same oil as the tortilla chips, it really brings a different flavor to the fries.   One thing I can say about this restaurant that I love? The excellent customer service. I've never had a bad waiter or waitress and the manager is very involved in the customers experience as he does ask everyone if they've enjoyed themselves and if there is anything he can do to make it better.  That alone makes me want to come back.  And who knows, I might try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is one of our regular stops. We LOVE the Baja Sauce. I would put that stuff on everything. Baja Chimi is amazing. I also love the Fajitas. They put green chills with the onions. Salsa is also good."}
{"text":"2 Storey's of moderately passable mexican. The salsa is what pulls them down, along with the beans... they tasted like they wanted to be yummy and just weren't.   ON the PLUS side were the plethora (tell me Jefe do you know what a plethora is?) of SUPER MEGA chips in my basket of chips... if you don't know what a super mega chip is, let me tell you:  It's a corn chip that has multiple corn chips folded into one another, often with the center being chewy because it's not fully fried. YUM  Thank you and goodnight."}
{"text":"Came in near close with my family and got seated with Ashley who gave us an awesome . Awesome service, great suggestions from the menu and stellar upkeep throughout our meal. The food was on point (I had the steak and shrimp fajitas and definitely overstuffed myself because I didn't want to stop eating them) and my drink never once went empty. If your looking for some damn tasty Mexican food especially locally owned definitely give this place a try and make sure to ask for Ashley to wait on you, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My family set up my birthday dinner here...as we do for EVERY birthday, I arrived a bit earlier then my group, I told them the name on the party and the hostess said there was no reservation and that we called the wrong location... It's was a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy so they were able to get us a seat on the patio for our large group. The service was alright, the server showed no personality just came by got us our food and dropped off our drinks.   Today, I decided to order food for our shop. Took the hostess 5 minutes to even notice I was there...the servers stood there and said nothing, just looked at me. No greeting, No utensils, NO customer service."}
{"text":"Chips were good so was the mild and hot salsa, I got the steak fajitas quesadilla and my husband got the carne asada chimichanga, the food was great honestly the only thing I had a problem with was the waitress attitude towards my husband, he dosnt speak Spanish nor does he have any idea what he was ordering lol basically I did because well I am Mexican and I explained it to him, but when the waitress came to take our order she asked him if he was ok with the spinach cheese on top and my husband was totally clueless to what she was asking, so he was a little lost and she made a comment about how he didn't even know what he was ordering and just very awkward, then I asked her for the hot sauce because she only gave us mild, and she was like ok and looked at my husband and asked him in a very rude way to it..."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Phoenix 2-4 times a year since 1988, and almost every visit has included a dinner or drinks at Macayo's.  We still have our porcelain refillable mugs we bought way back then (though I'm not sure they still \"do\" that).  The huge dining room is open-aired and festive (though my wife prefers the darkened bar area) and everything I've eaten there is good, and the servers are always awesome (and my family can be a handful). My sister loves the special drinks the bartender makes (it's a Naked Iguana or Sticky Azalea or something) and my pescatarian wife says Macayo's has the BEST FISH TACOS ANYWHERE."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Drink refills from the bar took 30 minutes. Waitress only stopped at our table 3 times in 2 hours. Out of Patron. Ordered shrimp fajitas and 30 minutes later the waitress told us the shrimp is still frozen so it would still \"be a while\". We canceled that order. Ordered a margarita refill that we never got. Took 30 minutes to get a plate of mini chimichangas. Impossible to flag down a waiter and took 15 minutes just to FIND a manager. Waitress spilled water all over our table. We will never be back to this location. Wait staff standing around on their phones. Food arrived long before our drinks."}
{"text":"Dear Macayo's,   I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.  I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.  Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.  The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor.   I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante \"New York City?!\" commercials.   I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's?   I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling \"Baja sauce\", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color.   I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.  Wishing you deep fried broken dreams, Erica"}
{"text":"Customer service and management was horrible. It took an hour for us to get an appetizer of mini chimis, rice and beans. That was all we ordered. The table next to us who sat AFTER us, ordered AFTER and had a LARGER party with more complex meals got served BEFORE us. In fact, the were almost done by the time our food came. We had to send the food back when it came because it was room temp/cold when we got it. Managements excuses were, \"it depends what side of the menu you order from because we're backed up on the appetizers\". And the other excuse was, \"their are more of you than there is of us\". The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because the manager took half off the meal. I won't be back. Baja sauce and good drinks aren't enough to get me in the door if the service is sucky."}
{"text":"The service wasn't bad but the drinks was like a $3 Margarita water down and to much ice cubes.. chipotle margarita still better in my book. Food was over cooked... lil to dry"}
{"text":"Kyle was great always so efficient ready to go with smiles and great team work to, food delicious, very welcoming and they do catering too. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This my friends is evidence of a very tasty, perfect green chili \"baja\" chimichanga !  It was too good to photo until I was done! Believe me, it was very good to look at but much tastier.  I will be getting this again!  The food service was great and our food came fast!"}
{"text":"Food was good service was amazing! My server Candace was attentive and super friendly making my dining experience top notch."}
{"text":"My first time at this location, and if the food weren't actually pretty good, I would have rated it a one.  We visited during a lunch hour on Saturday, and I wouldn't have thought the amount of business justified a waiter taking literally a few minutes to get our drink order. In fact, I think ours was the only table in the section with customers seated. I was tolerant of this initial slowness thinking it would get better from there, but it never did. Every step required an extended wait right up to getting my check. The waiter didn't even check in on us while we were eating. When I got up to go to the bathroom after the check had been presented suddenly the waiter was there to get his money. And this is the ONLY time I've been asked for my ID with my credit card at a restaurant.   Some might defend that as a necessary and even nice security step given the world we live in today, etc. But if left a bad taste in my mouth. A restaurant shouldn't be doing this. I had just spent over $100 for a dinner and drinks in a far nicer place in Denver, and wasn't asked for an ID.  So overall, a decent place with good food who needs to manage their help a lot better, and stop asking for ID from customers paying with credit cards."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in cleanliness. Last week I was there with my kids and when we sat down, one of my kids noticed rice still stuck in her fork.  This happened a few months ago too and we pointed it out then.  I spoke to Bennie the manager about it and was assured they would look into it and fix the problem. Tonight we gave it another shot because if they were working on it, it would be fixed, right?  Nope. Silverware was crusted with food and Bennie didn't know what to say so he tried to suggest the caked on food was a water spot. Water spots are not 3 dimensional last I checked. Also, the ceramic plates had obvious chips which did not bode well.  We left without ordering. Health Department notified. That is all.  Ok, so it's been a while so we went back...because the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over and expect a different result. We sat down and the table was really wet. When we told our hostess, her response was to hand us napkins so WE could wipe it down. Then they brought us plates and utensils. The plates had sticky residue on them and the silverware was dirty. I met someone from the Department of Health and he confirmed this place is a hot mess.  We got up and left. Can't eat here."}
{"text":"A long-time Macayo's customer but recently moved to the Surprise, AZ area and disappointed with this location.  Visited the restaurant this past weekend evening.  Waiter provided good service but informed us the restaurant was out of chips but would try to make some ASAP.  Then, ordered a Mexican beer but the waiter said they were also out of several beers including the one we ordered--how does a Mexican restaurant run out of chips and beer on a weekend night?!   I then ask to speak to a manager and was told Victoria would stop by.  Received dinner and shortly thereafter, the chips came-guess which one we ignored with dinner in front of us?  Got thru dinner and left.  The manager never stopped by our table probably to avoid hearing a complaint.  A couple of weeks ago, noticed the amount charged to my credit card was higher than the ticketed amount.  Called this same location and found out the tip amount was increased AFTER I left the restaurant.  A manager credited-back the overcharge but why was this done in the first place.  To many issues with this location for a chain restaurant that I've visited in the Valley for the past 30 years."}
{"text":"Went here for valentines day. The wait was only 15minutes. The service was great. The food was delicious. Got the mix and match yummy chicken enchilada and beef taco with rice n beans. The waiter was very respectful and polite. He got us anything and everything we needed. Got sopapillas as desert. Couldnt of asked for a better dinner. Would defenitly reccomend this place. Also the house margeritas and cool glasses are worth it."}
{"text":"The food and service are always great. We always enjoy having lunch here! Would highly recommend that you stop here after church on Sundays."}
{"text":"I went with a large group of 18 at 6pm on a Saturday.  This was my first time at this chain.  Food was just ok, definitely Americanized.  My favorite thing I tried were the green chili corn balls as an appetizer.  Service was also just ok.  The waitress forgot to bring out corn tortillas for one dish and stopped refilling our drinks 1/2 through our visit."}
{"text":"Prices are good and wait staff try hard, but food was not flavorful and came out lukewarm. The atmosphere was typical franchise Mexican atmosphere. The servers are trying hard and offered to bring replacement food or free desert. Ally our server was a great server and said she felt bad.  The manager offered to comp some of the bill.  Manager comped all but drinks"}
{"text":"Seems prices go up while quality and service goes down. I mean 10 bucks for a green corn tamale ala carte? Really thou? I can only afford this place    Now during happy hour for the appetizers."}
{"text":"Macayo's food is good, just the service sometimes leads a lot to be desired!"}
{"text":"The worst food ever!  It was embarrassing how bad the food was. It was nothing more than microwaved, canned, pre packaged junk. I had their sample plate small size, not sure what it was called.It took them 3 minutes after taking our order to food on the table. Should have been a red flag. It was microwaved so hot it was ridiculous.Rubbery shell, dry burnt meat in the taco, oh my It was not edible at all. On a Monday night at 7 pm,  also dirty tables all around I will never eat here again! The salsa was bottled junk again. Chips were ok that's about it.  Dont waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"Great chicken enchilada and ground beef taco with rice and beans. Food came out quick and was delicious. Margarita was great as well. Server was very nice. Basketball games were on. They have an outside patio to dine at with the view of the gold course. Great place."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent prices. Employees work hard and are customer service oriented. Only reason I did not rate a 5 is because the food is not amazing. First timers should try the Mexican Flag enchiladas."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is friendly and efficient. My favorite item has to the the Mexican Flag enchiladas. The beans and rice are good. The complimentary chips and salsa are good, too, as they taste fresh."}
{"text":"While service wasn't exceptional, I cannot say enough about the management. Rosa went above and beyond taking care of us and ensuring our dinner was perfect. Furthermore, THREE HOURS after we left and I called looking for my daughter's retainers she went far beyond what I expected by checking the dumpster for them...and found them!! She makes this restaurant amazing and one I will continue to visit! Thank you Rosa!"}
{"text":"I have to say after reading some of the reviews I was apprehensive, however my experience at macayo's Glendale was amazing! The food was amazing the staff was attentive and friendly. Our  server was Trish and she couldn't have been more pleasant and accomadating! I recommend the sangria. We also had the spinach queso dip, tortilla soup, lobster relleno, relleno trio and churro for dessert everything was amazing! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try their tamales. 20 min wait on a Friday night. The ambiance is confusing for a Mexican restaurant. They were playing music from the 50s and they have African safari decor... zebras, elephant, etc. We got seated right around 20 min and I ordered the Mex & Match with the green corn tamale (in husk) with rice & black beans. My friend got the beef tamale so we could try both. The chips & salsa were on point! Didn't take too long to get our food. The green corn tamale had a really good flavor, but I didn't like how big the green chile pieces were and the consistency was more wet than I expected. The beef tamale was very good. Lots of meat inside and the masa wasn't dry at all. Their black beans are seasoned very well. We also got the fried ice cream for dessert. It wasn't a huge portion, which was good. Just a small scoop of ice cream with a yummy fried coating, honey, and tons of whipped cream. There was a lot of whipped cream leftover when we got done with it. Not a bad dinner overall."}
{"text":"Finally tried the Macayo's in the area  off 59th and Bell, and let me tell you they aren't the same as one on 75th and Thomas, a big  disappointing to have to write this review, as Macayo's used to be one of my favorite place to go . Anyways we walked in and after a short wait were seated. The runner promptly greeted us and delivered chips and salsa. Chips were warm and there were two kinds of salsa. They both  salsa still lacks flavor. It tastes like stewed tomatoes are just dumped into a bowl. I understand that the servers are busy and they have full sections most of the time but when you wait five minutes to get a drink order Other than that my only problem was the food - it wasn't that great  I had a beef burrito enchilada style with rice and beans. It's \"eh\". I've had a lot better, have had worse. It's mediocre. The enchilada sauce on the burrito doesn't really taste like much. If you really want some good salsa come and see me. And you will not be disappointed .."}
{"text":"Living just a 3 1/2 mile away for the past few years, I really had no excuse to avoiding Macayo's for so long. I tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method. While I still stick to this mothodology, its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity. I mean, you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty, meaty, and full of carbs.  Macayo's  was just the spot. We ordered a Spinach Con Queso  ,and Mimi Chimichangas and also order their Fiesta Wings which they so good . After filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting appetizers, we couldn't even begin to eat the chimi. While my expectations for a next day chimichanga wasn't so high up there, it was actually still good the next day. I imagine that it would have been all the better had I eaten it fresh from the kitchen. Maybe next time ill go light on the beer,and margaritas however I can personally say I enjoy myself .  Either way, Macayo's is a solid choice for your Mexican delights."}
{"text":"The deal with Macayo's is they took a family owned restaurant that at one point in it's history had really go Mexican food and made it into a slap the food on the plate, put the wait staff in ugly shirts, and charge way to much for nasty Mexican food! If the price was in the area of say Taco Bell I would think it was ok but for the price you pay the food is nasty....take it or leave...I would leave it."}
{"text":"Satisfied with everything!!! Melanie, super friendly and helpful!! Kids had a great time...Will definitely come back here next time we visit Az"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended by the staff members of another restaurant in town.  Rebecca, the hostess was extremely cheerful and witty.  She seated us immediately and made sure we had what we needed before our waiter was available.  J.L. was our waiter and took our orders and served us promptly!  The food was good and it was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"There was a misunderstanding when we were being seated and Mike the bartender came over and apologized profusely--he was so very kind. The margarita he made was amazing and the food was fresh and quick to get to our table--a good experience and Mike was so so nice!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time Macayos food and service has been horrible. I Placed an order to go last night for a chimichanga and chicken Tinga street tacos. When I picked up my order my recipe said Grilled Tacos. I expressed my concern that I had asked for the chicken Tinga street tacos. She shrugged me off and said they were the same thing. Once I got home I realized in fact they were the WRONG tacos. So not only did she get my order wrong, she also denied her mistake and refused to fix it. Also, the grilled tacos were horrible! The tortilla was already ripped and there was more cabbage than chicken. I threw them away. I am very disappointed and will never return to Macayos."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar....you'll be ignored. It took a good 15 minutes to take our order, and chips & salsa were never refilled. It's not like it was busy either...3 other heartbeats in the bar area.  A slightly better beer selection than other Mexican joints, but next time I'll go so where with better food and service and order a margarita instead."}
{"text":"Horrible service. No chips, no service, no nothing. Just waited for 15 minutes. I am so sad that this place has gone down so much. I have never experienced a lack of service as I did today. I do not recommend this location to anyone. Go to another nearby Mexican restaurant - maybe you'll at least get noticed there."}
{"text":"I have been sitting here in the bar area for 15 mins and no one has come to serve me. It is incredibly slow. I'm leaving!"}
{"text":"2nd time I've called this location (confirmed on my phone in front of employee) and my order was not entered when I came to pick it up. No apology either time. Just \"whoops, I'll enter it in now\" and being forced to wait 20 minutes. I called the order in to AVOID this wait. Why are your employees so incompetent that they can't enter in the orders they claim they are talking over the phone? Get your act together, Macayo. One time, okay. 2 times in just a few weeks? Incompetent."}
{"text":"Waited til I'd been to this location 3 times to write a review. Unfortunately it started off bad and never got better.  In a nutshell, food is average and a bit pricey.  Salsa, both the chunky and thinner hot one are pretty good.  Booze/Margs are great but expensive.  Service, in my opinion has been the most painful part.   Last visit there last week I stood at the front desk with my two small kids waiting to be seated for several minutes, while 5-6 employees and a 'manager' were arguing about who was leaving at what time that night."}
{"text":"My partner and I have had Macayos before and we've never been disappointed. The food is so delicious--minus tamale bites as an appetizer, but that's because I wasn't expecting it to be sweet and deep fried. But literally everything was delicious! Our waitress, Angelica, was able to have our appetizer switched out and had us laughing the entire time. She's was very friendly and attentive which is something we appreciate!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with our family last night. The restaurant was pretty empty so we expected to have prompt service. We waited to have drinks brought out and it seemed like through the whole meal we had to keep asking for refills. It took more than 30 minutes to get our food once we ordered, and some of our food was cold and we didn't get some of our side dishes. We were the only table the waitress had and she was very inattentive. One of the drinks from the bar had to be made 3 times before it was correct. The waitress seemed to be struggling but no one was there to help her. We were very disappointed in the service, food and the drinks. For the amount of money we spent, our expectations fell way short."}
{"text":"Will be the last time I eat there. My wife and I went for lunch, not busy at all. We were sat by a nice employee (from the front). Our waitress came, took our drink order than it was a good 20 minutes before we saw her again. We ordered our food finally. After it arrived we didn't see our waitress again for about 45 minutes (a table of 5 showed up), but she was at their table every 10 minutes. When she finally decided to come over to us (after we waved her down) we asked for boxes and our check. This happened about 3 more times before she actually brought it (she was too busy checking on the other table). The lack of customer service was appalling. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very nice attmosphere and the food was great will be returning often, wait staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Ordered take out today, staff was super slow she acted as if she didn't want to be there. We waited nearly 25 minutes before she took our order. Needless to say  we will not be ordering out from them any more. One of the worst experiences we have we ever have.  Update received a call from the GM who invited us down to have a better experience and it was much better he said he owned the issue and wanted to make things right. He gets it and has earned our respect and business!"}
{"text":"Services pretty good most of the time, food is great wish they had a bigger menu cause we eat there quite a bit!"}
{"text":"The food is average Americanized Mexican food. They do have killer Happy Hour deals. And during the summer right now, Happy is all day Saturday and Sunday!  Great value if you want some good cheap greasy Mexican food and a beer."}
{"text":"First time here. Met some family for dinner at their suggestion. The food was so, so. Chips were not authentic, homemade. Salsa tastes like it came from a jar. Drinks quality/taste was inconsistent. Server was a little clueless about customer service. Not very accommodating regarding our needs/requests. If I never darken their doorsteps again I won't miss or mourn it. I gave it two stars because we had a good time despite the not so great service. And like I said, the food was so, so. Definitely not great, but not awful."}
{"text":"5 stars for Issaic!! Nicest server we've encountered on our trip to Arizona, and we have a pretty high bar for this place since two of our friends used to work here. Loved the awesome service for a great end of the holiday weekend lunch."}
{"text":"Shout out to Ashley B.! We got sat in her section tonight and she was rocking! She was so nice and made sure that we were taken care of all while working 7+ tables on three different levels of the restaurant. We chatted with her at the end and she loved her sections of the night, working so hard and had such a high value for customer satisfaction. Just an amazing young woman! Will come back and ask for her by name."}
{"text":"I drove by this location and almost kept going. However once again I was in the mood for Mexican food and decided to give this place a try. The restaurant itself is rather outdated, trip hazards everywhere as you walk from one level to another to another. A pretty dated restaurant.  I ordered what else, a burrito. Again what is it with all meat inside and nothing else...after a while you really want more favorable tastes. Oh well, another restaurant bites the dust when it comes to burritos. Maybe try something different if I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am a native of Phoenix. I am so sad that so many restaurants that I have loved for decades are failing their customers. Why, oh why, does it have to be so?? We used to eat at this Macayo's location weekly. But, because the quality had been suffering, we haven't eaten at Macayo's for several years.   We tried it today in hopes of rekindling our love of Macayo's. After all, the doors are still opened (to our surprise) so we thought maybe they changed it back up. Well....not so. We ordered our meal and the first thing my hubby and I tasted was the rice. It looked fantastic!! Visually, the texture was good and there were chunks of stewed tomatoes, just the way we like it!! BUT, the rice tasted like they had put cleaning product in the pan and forgot to rinse it!!! I mean it was DISGUSTING and RANK!!! I took a picture of the rice in case my husband and I ended up in the hospital or dead. I wanted to document the cause.  We advised the server. She was very awesome!!! She sent over the manager whose attitude was basically \"whatever\". She offered us beans. My husband said yes and I said no.   We got our bill and we were overcharged. I pointed it out the the manager who \"corrected\" the bill. We put cash out (the cash amount was obvious) and the manager asked us if we needed change:  Based on the amount of our bill, she was asking us if we were willing to leave almost a 100% tip. NOPE!! Add insult to injury (the rice tasted like it was poison, we were overcharged and now we are being asked to leave an almost 100% tip), in the end, even though the manager \"fixed\" the overcharge, we were STILL OVERCHARGED!!!!   NEVER, EVER, EVER will we give Macayo's another opportunity to earn our business!! There are way too many other options!! Come on, Macayo's!!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan.  They used an anaheim chili in the relleno... BIG mistake. It is poblano or nothing, people!  I also tried a green corn/green chili tamale. Too sweet. Not enough green chili. Just meh.  They did have a good habanero based salsa by request... unfortunately, like most Mexican joints these days, the chips you used to dip in the salsa sucked by all measures.  Another Mex restaurant disappointment. A pattern has definitely developed."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere is festive. There is a bar side and a restaurant side to the place. The food is only average though. The cost is too expensive for average food. I had the green chili verde. There was a 1/4 inch of meat fat on the top that should have been skimmed off before serving. The quesadillas seem to have gotten smaller. Definitely no my favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a classic Mexican chain restaurant and they are consistently delicious. We each had a different margarita and we all tasted the others. They were all good. I had the cucumber margarita which was really light, less sugar, and very tasty. We each had two individual bowls of salsa with chips as an appetizer. Yum! For dinner I had the roasted poblano chili. It wasn't too heavy, nor to light. I really enjoyed it. My husband had the steak fajitas and he likes them well done. The seasoning was perfect. Our other friend had the Baja Burro, which looked delicious. This isn't a need an upscale five star Mexican Cantina, but a great neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The price was right. The service was friendly, reliable and at a reasonable pace. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would. Apparently this is not a place where you can go after a day's work on Friday afternoon. FIRST they would let kids sit upstairs in the bar area!!! After getting past that my party of 5 ordered rounds of drinks and food.  This is where things took a turn for the worse. 1. The waitress took our order for 3 more beers and more chips 2. The manager comes over about 20 mins later and asks if everything is ok. We say yes but we haven't gotten our drinks yet. The manager stumbles over his words and then says the guy at our table has been cut off by the server (mind you he is about 5'10 and 250 and had 4 drinks over 3 hours AND ate food).  By no means was he drunk or being rude or obnoxious. 3. The manager comes back about 5 mins later with the food the guy who was cut off ordered. We sent it back and asked for the check. The manager came back with 1 check, when we asked the waitress upon sitting down to split the checks since we knew we would all be paying separate.  Plus the waitress never took off the sangria which was sent back after 1 sip due to being gross.  4. We got our checks separately and after 10 more minutes and no manager or waitress in site I brought our checks to the bar with all the cards and requested to pay.  5. 10 more mins go by and still no manager or waitress. The bartender eventually brings back the checks and cards. 6. The waitress managed to avoid our table for more than 45 mins with nothing to say.  Moral of the story, if your going to cut people off please train your staff to do it appropriately and respectfully. If it is the policy of your establishment to do so after so many drinks just say so. Don't avoid the table altogether and make them feel like CRAP.  I will NEVER go back to ANY Macayos establishment ever again. If I want Mexican food I will go to GARCIAS, MANUELS, or VALLE DE LUNA as the food at Macayos is nothing spectacular and I'm sure I can find better customer service elsewhere!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm at Macayo's o Bell this afternoon on this beautiful Saturday. Happy hour was perfect the service was better than the food if you ever get here look up Angel best waitress in town."}
{"text":"They have made improvements to their menu and their food is even better!!! The staff is the best - they really care about their customers!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since they remodeled and was pleasantly surprised by it when we got there. Although it was as efficient as it could have been in adding seats, they were able to add a few inside and outside, which of course helps reduce wait times. Also the new look has a nice Hispanic rustic chic look (if that even a real thing) that's way better than the old look.   The food was great all around from price to flavor. Since I'm a sucker for green chile pork, I got their green chile pork stew, which was amazing. It was a little unique vs. traditional green chile pork, but light, fresh and filling.  Our server was probably the best server we've had in 10 years. Super friendly and personable, Johnny on the spot with refills and great with kids. If I remembered her name is totally give her a huge shout out on hear."}
{"text":"This weekend we went to Macayo's to celebrate a birthday.  We had a 7:30 reservation and the table was set up early! I brought a cake to the restaurant and they were nice enough to put it in the refrigerator until we were ready for dessert. Many people in our party have a lot of specific food needs and our server, Kyle, made suggestions to help each individual person. He was so helpful and kind. Our meals were hot and even though there were a lot of special requests, they came out perfect. I would go here again"}
{"text":"Consistently terrible. The food is always okay. But the service is atrocious. We've been here three times over the past few years and it's always the same. I used to be a server so I'm very understanding but the service here is unbelievable."}
{"text":"We've had bad experiences with macayos service in the past. We received a gift certificate from a manager to try the chain again and give them another chance. We chose this location instead of our usual. Our server was awesome, attentive, very friendly and had good suggestions. If you come to this location ask for Ernesto as your server."}
{"text":"Seriously, what the he'll happened to Macayos?!?!  Came here on a Saturday for lunch.  They've completely overhauled their menu since the last time I came here, and not for the better.  Everything is nickel and dimed.  Extra charge for sour cream, extra charge for guacamole, without even telling you.  I am both sad and outraged that this is what the beloved native born Macayos has become.  Never again will I come back.  $50 for 3 entree's and 3 waters.  Not for me.  can find better mexican food, after all, this is Phoenix.    RIP Macayos, you've had a good run, but it's time to get out of the game and stop embarrassing yourself."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Mexican restaurants.  We've been coming here for at least 10 years and only had one really bad experience.  We sat in the bar last night and had Cinco de Mayo specials.  Good prices and great food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went out to dinner last night... we were trying to think of a good Mexican food restaurant to go to and I decided why not macayos its been a while since I had been there. Its been hard for us to find good service lately, i dont know what it is.... Our Servers name was David he was right on top of everything. I work in the restaurant industry so im very picky. He brought refills before they were gone, stopped to ask if we needed anything before the meal came out, and after we got our meal he came back by to see if everything was good. very consistent! but he wasn't just on top of us he was on top of all of his tables. Food was great... Great service... will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"OMG, paid $12 for a 2 chicken taco plate and got less than 1 single breast of chicken in both, maybe about 2/3's of a breast.  Way overpriced and totally mediocre.  Salsa was god but I got the feeling it was a bit watered down."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews for Macayo's. I stop in at least once a month. They serve the best Mexican food that I have had in Phoenix.  The service is always excellent, the food is consistently delicious and is served quickly.   I love Macayo's and this location in particular is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ok normally I would give this place 5 stars. Tonight is not one of them. The WORST SERVICE EVER! 4 tables in the bar. That's it. So when it took us 10 mins at least to just get water. 5 mins later a menu. After 15 mins the beer is still sitting at the bar. Got up to get them ourselves the bartender says relax sit down we are really busy. Again 4 tables. I believe 30 mins was plenty of time to relax. Didn't even bother to order food just paid the tab and left. On a side note the table next to us had to bang their silverware on the table just to get their water. Poor customer service all the way around. And no didn't even feel bad for telling the bartender he was a real POS. Kudos however to the kind man that made sure we had our chips and salsa. He was the best part of the experience. Hence the only deserving star."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant, I guess so what can you expect? I was a tourist in town for MLB \"spring training\" and this place was right near the KC Royals' stadium. Had the chimichangas and maybe they'd spent too long in the warming area so they had gotten awfully chewy. I'd been hungry but it was too much trouble to eat these."}
{"text":"Predicable \"Mexican\" for anybody looking for a bland feed of rice and other stuff. Good environment and all that predicable stuff. No spice of any measure is available which is contrary to expectations but assured by the waiter not to hurt business of Canadian visitors. Good value = 3 stars"}
{"text":"I come her for the margarita's. It's really the only thing that has kept me faithful to macayo's. The menu has changed and i can taste the difference. I do really like their Baja chicken burro. The patio area is always nice. The bar area upstairs is due for a renovation.   Overall the food is ok the drinks are good the location is great."}
{"text":"My service was great and the chips and salsa was prob the only thing that tasted good at this restaurant. I ordered a green chile burrito and chimichanga and it was distasteful. The lettuce was also stale for some reason. I normally don't do fast food but in my opinion, Filiberto's would've tasted better than macayos."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the grilled chicken street tacos from the Happy Hour bar menu. I liked the salsa as it had just a kick, but not much. I ordered the prickly pear margarita, it was just ok. My husband had the chicken poblano, he said it was really good and the red sauce was awesome.  What I didn't care for was the waitress asked if we were ready for our check before she asked if we wanted anything else, we did, we ordered an additional beer! We will definitely go back and I will try something from the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, one of the best mexican food places around. Great chips and salsa for free and the shredded beef chimichanga is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Eh..it was alright.  My wifes mother is in town and she was given the duty of baby sitter the other night so that me and my wife could go out on a date.  We decided to hit up Macayos.  It was close, we had never been before, and Mexican food usually hits the spot.  I ordered the \"Tour De  Macayo\" which included a chicken chimichanga, a cheese enchilada, a beef taco and some spinach artichoke type dip.  It was billed as \"smaller portions of your favorite items so you can try them all out\".  Sounded alright.  It was only $11.99 too, which isn't bad.  My wife got the \"Original Combo\" which consisted of a beef taco, cheese enchilada and bean tostada.  Hers was only $9.99.  I had water to drink.   Chips and salsa were served shortly after we sat down.  Here is how the food was.............  Chips and Salsa-  Good.  Chips needed a little bit of salt though.  Nice and warm and crispy.  Tour De Macayo-  The first thing I noticed when this platter came out was how small the items were.  They weren't joking when they said \"smaller portions\".  I started with the chicken chimichanga.  The taste was good and it was a solid tube stuffed to the brim with chicken.  I tried the cheese enchilada next.  It was your basic cheese enchilada, red sauce.  Decent but not great.  Next up was the spinach artichoke dip.  Nasty!  It was cold and didn't taste good.  I took one bite and left it to the side.   I left the mini beef taco for last.  This thing was tiny.  It was barely as long as my index finger.  3 bites and it was done.  Taste was good but it was skimp!  Rice and beans were decent.  Service was great and the prices were actually pretty good!  The food was kind of skimp and bland though and I don't think I will be racing to come back.  There are other Mexican spots in Surprise that I want try out before coming back here."}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant but this will be the last time I will ever return to this location. Make sure you do not get Briana as your waitress she has no personality and makes you feel like an inconvenience being there. As i server i dont like tipping bad but i shouldnt have even left a tip for this girl. What a shame"}
{"text":"We have been to this location quite a few times, and we love it.   We've never had any problems, but this time my husband found a hair in his food. At first he thought it might have been his hair, but he literally had to dig it out of his burrito.  He was pretty upset because he was really enjoying it.  We called the waiter over, and explained what happened. He offered to take it off the bill, or just make a whole other one.  We got a second one to go.  The waiter also got the manager to come over and talk to us.  The manager was very friendly and apologized over and over.   When they brought us the second burrito, it was already bagged and ready to go, and they included chips and salsa also!!!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price! Chips and salsa are delicious, but the salsa is a little too salty. Still good enough to shovel in your mouth til you're so full and your meal arrives. Generous helpings ensure that you won't leave hungry. I had the Baja burro with chicken. Just make sure to ask for it unfried if you don't like fried things. The guacamole was fresh and delicious. I took home half my meal and ordered the flan to splurge. It tasted like nirvana in my mouth. I would've licked the plate had no one been around! I was seated immediately and my server was amazing! His name is Sonny. If you are lucky enough to get him, he will treat you right! He's super friendly, efficient and checks on you the perfect amount of times. He makes you feel like you are part of the Macayo's family. What a great employee! I highly recommend this Macayo's in Ahwahtukee. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Macayo's was very busy. Sunday night. There were a few tables open so we asked to sit at the one facing the patio with the lake view. The hostess was very accomadating & sat us at the requested table. Our server was at our table quickly & took our drink order. K & I decided we were going to try the \"3 course meal for $10.99\" offer. This is a pretty good deal. You start with either tortilla soup or salad. Then pick one of the 4 entrees & finish with one of the two desserts. K went with Tortilla soup, Shredded Beef Mexican Flag Chimichanga (sauces on the side) & fried ice cream. This is where it got interesting. K asked if she could sub additional Baja sauce for the green sauce but was told no. She could however order the sauces on the side with additional Baja sauce. Huh? Our server politely pointed to the small print on the menu that read \"No substitutions, Thank You\". Geeze. I'm starting to get flashbacks of our dinner at Abuelo's. Unless these are pre-made, why can't the cook scoop an addional blob of Baja sauce instead of a laddle of red sauce? Monkey's... I know it's Monkey's. K said the Tortilla soup was not overly spicy with a nice rich flavor. Her Flag Chimi was tasty, plenty of filling and extra yummy with the extra baja sauce. K really enjoyed the fried ice cream. A scoop of Dryers quality Vanilla ice cream rolled in a crunchy corn flake and cinnamon type coating & fried. Topped with a drizzle of honey. Yummy goodness. I ordered the salad, Green Chile Pork Stew & fried ice cream. The salad was a decent little salad. Really a perfect starter. The pork stew had chunks of pork with Poblano pepper, tomatillo, Jalapeno, onion & cilantro. It came with 2 flour tortillas. Yummy. Really a good stew. I gave my ice cream to C. C wanted his new favorite Mexican dish... Steak & cheese, toss in a tortilla if you must. Well looky there, on the 3 course menu is a Grilled steak quesadilla. Perfect. Or so we thought. C asked if they could leave off the chopped up vegetable medley sprinkled on the top. Our server politely pointed out that there is also chopped up veggies (onions & peppers) INSIDE the quesadilla AND again pointed to the \"No substitutions\" note on the 3 course menu. Monkey's. &@$# Monkey's. So we scrapped that idea & went with the Carne Asada Burro without the pico de gallo. $11.49. Since this is on the regular dinner menu our server said we could make any necessary changes we wanted. C loved the burro. The carne asada was cut into decent sized chunks, very flavorful & not at all chewy. Winner, winner, steak burro dinner. We took the rice & beans to go. C loved my fried ice cream but was not a fan of the honey drizzle. In the end we all loved our food. A policy is a policy so I can't really complain. Good food. Polite service. Fair pricing. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here last Wednesday. We chose to sit in the bar side for happy hour which was actually decent. We were served by not one, but two girls, Destiny and Courtney. They worked as a team to serve us in one of their booths while taking care of other tables and the bar top and making drink tickets. We got to talk with them and they were both friendly and fun and provided great customer service. We will definitely be back and hopefully they will be working again! The Prickly pear margarita was our favorite as well as the happy hour street tacos! The only reason we are not giving 5 stars is because we ordered the carne asada which was AWFUL. The meat was horrible tough and fatty. Whoever was cooking it seemed to not even care about how the meat was cooked or cut or even presented. If it wasn't for the girls taking care of us I would be really disappointed"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, salsa and chips tasted like store bought packaged chips and jar salsa from a grocery store.  Food was not seasoned  well and very bland.  We both left most of it on the plate when we left.  A total waste of $41.00"}
{"text":"cheese crisp was not too good. my tacos were cold as well. our waitress was really nice"}
{"text":"Food was... OK, Drinks were... OK. Happy hour was... OK. Outside patio was PACKED at HH and servers were having a hard time keeping up. Drinks and food were definitely WAY too slow to arrive. Management should look into upping the staff for the \"after 5pm\" crowd that blasted this place on a Friday night. If the service could have kept up, it could have easily been a 4 or 5 star night. Maybe next time.  Oh, and don't forget to purchase your souvenir mug, so you too can enjoy $4 refills on (24 oz.???) Marg's, but be careful, they love to pack those things full of ICE over and over again so make sure to request \"no more ICE\" after your first one or just go frozen."}
{"text":"We went there on New Years Eve. My husband got fajitas, and I got quesadillas. My husband said his fajitas were very oniony, had a few spicy peppers, and very little anything else. My quesadillas were permeated with onions and spicy, spicy soggy green peppers (which I don't recall as being warned of those on the menu) so I took one bite and couldn't eat any more of it. It was gross and waaayyy too spicy for me to eat. The only thing I liked was my husband's strawberry margarita, which had booze in it, compared to my non alcoholic version (I'm pregnant). I had a sip of his and it was yummy. My daughter drank most of mine. She ate a lot of chips and wouldn't touch my quesadilla. We won't bother eating there again. What a bummer."}
{"text":"I think Macayo's is pretty good! They have a great menu however I think they're a bit over priced. (I'd recommend Aribas)."}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa, pretty good food (I have had both the steak burritos and steak tacos and both were good!), and good service!    I have been to this location, the one in Goodyear (on McDowell and Litchfield), and the one in Scottsdale (on Scottsdale Rd), and all have been similar quality as far as food, drink, and service... so that's about as much consistency as you can ask for from a chain restaurant.  I'll be back... again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here last night. The Chile Relleno and Green Corn Tamale with rice and beans were both delicious and served very hot topped with bubbling cheese.   Margaritas were ample and poured right on! Outdoor patio with TVS had a wonderful atmosphere and service was great. One suggestion to management though, please get rubber tips for your metal chairs. Constant noise from scraping chairs."}
{"text":"Regular Mexican hang out for us.  We had happy hour at the bar and were happy to see all tables surely clean.  Staff was dressed professionally and were very attentive.  I think they could use a dedicated Bus boy.  They have 2 waiters who also were bartenders and 1 other waiter.  In the recent past staff was inconsistent now it appears that this new crew really wants to work hard for Macayo's. I hope Macayo's give them the support they deserve so we get a quicker service."}
{"text":"I just had the best lunch...as always the food is consistently great!"}
{"text":"I am from AZ but I now live in Illinois.  I crave Macayo's and come here so many times when I visit.  This trip has been disappointing.  All the food seems a little off.  The hot sauce is way too spicy and it's missing that flavor only Macayo's hot sauce has.  Please please please go back to your original recipes."}
{"text":"We went in a few weeks ago with friends from out of state because we really love the food. It was a super busy Friday evening. We sat in the bar and our server was taking care of a lot of tables so we were ok waiting a little longer than normal to order our first drinks. The issues came in when we had to continue waiting. Then our food got mixed up. Burritos went to one person instead of enchiladas but we were halfway through before we noticed. We just thought the burritos got smaller.  We mentioned this to our server and she said let me talk to the manager and see what we can do. The manager then came over to our table and asked what the problem was. We explained and he said \"So what do you want me to do about it?\"  Really? He then told us that he looked at us several times while we were eating and we \"looked happy\". He argued with us for a bit until I told him to leave the table. I think what upset me the most was his attitude and that he acted like we were just trying to get a free meal or something.  He did end up giving everyone a discount but when he brought the check over he said since you are mad at me here is the number to call and complain. ??? What a baby.  NO we won't be back. Too bad because the food and service are usually good but I have no desire to deal with him again. Maybe he should go take a course i how to behave like an adult."}
{"text":"I like this place. Chips and salsa and good chicken tacos and awesome tortilla soup. Like awesome kick ass soup for a chain!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and was able to be seated within 15 minutes of check-in. Great enchiladas! Entertaining atmosphere but seems very noisy."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to a Macayo's in a long time. (It's a phoenix tradition) my wife has never been so I knew I need to take her. We came on a Friday night and it was ridiculously packed. To our surprise though they got us sat within 10 minutes! The staff was super busy and we got just slightly over looked, but they were amazing about and gave us a free appetizer. Everyone from the managers to the servers was super nice and friendly.  So I'm a bit of a tamale snob. I love them! I had a two tamale plate one with red sauce and one with baja sauce....thy were amazing. Two of the best tamales I've ever had. I would definitely recommend the baja sauce, was sweet and spicy, though both were great.  So my wife had a great first experience and even though they were super busy and I was a little hectic, they got us sat quickly and was super accommodating for any inconvenience! We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going here since the mid 1990s.  This is my go-to staging area where I fill up on some yummy Mexican food, and margaritas prior to concerts at nearby Ak-Chin Pavillion (formerly Desert Sky Pavillion)."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Mexican, service is a little slow each time I've been there. Last night I did the Mex-N-Match, taco, burrito, rice and refried beans. Order a Margarita and it was heavy handed on the pour, ordered another one 5 minutes before food was sent to the table and was almost done with the meal when it arrived, heavy poured and glad I had the DD!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and was treated very well. Food was served quickly and piping hot. Service was very good too. Margaritas (frozen) are the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"$10.00 for a burrito cut in half and some cabbage thrown in, not good, nothing on the side, won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Ate here with a party of five. The food was just OK, nothing special at all. Save yourself some money and DO NOT order the Sangria...if that is what they call Sangria. It was cheap red wine, the insta-headache kind with a lime in it. It was the worst tasting Sangria I have ever had. Three of us ordered it and none of us could drink it. This used to be great Mexican food just run of the mill stuff now...disappointing for sure that last few times I have been here. We waited 20 min for a table with a mostly empty restaurant. On the good side our waiter John was stellar."}
{"text":"Below you will see a review submitted by Natalie A. Unfortunately, I was a guest in her party during the experience she also reviewed. I came to Yelp to save others from what we went through without even knowing she commented... and reading her review, makes this so necessary. In whatever line of work you do, you encounter people who consistently want something for free and hope to take advantage of \"the customer is always right\" motto. I assure you, I have no problem paying my way. We called around looking for a fun happy hour spot and decided on Macayo's. I'll point out that neither during our call to check about happy hour, nor when we arrived did any staff member mention that happy hour was only in the bar area. We were seated in the dining room and ordered drinks, appetizers and dinner. Upon receiving the bill, someone in our party questioned the happy hour pricing. The server seemed timid and just left the table to grab the manager. Honestly, I had no problem just paying it and leaving but when Erica Martin came to our table, my tune definitely changed. This woman has no business being in the hospitality industry. She basically said TOUGH LUCK with an overkill smile on her face and a male shadowing her who said nothing. (She should not be training anyone) Again, business is business and there are policies... but come on, knock off a draft beer and thank everyone for coming. Then learn from it and inform your hostess staff to relay these policies to your guests. Not her, and this location is going to pay for her mistake. I made sure to tell everyone I knew about how we were treated. And yes, she went right to the hostess stand and began mocking us, ensuring that we heard. For a middle aged woman and from a management standpoint, completely ridiculous behavior."}
{"text":"If I was judging it off of food it would be a two star, but since they had a friendly and personable staff and a great authentic environment I give it a three."}
{"text":"We live nearby so we eat here every now and then. The food is always good - so are the margaritas. My favorite was the berry berry - and I was impressed to see that they used real, fresh berries in it. YUM!  I do wish they would get rid of the whacky African animal motif. But they've been on that corner forever and I guess it's a \"thing\" by now."}
{"text":"The view the waiter the food the lake the drinks everything was super, my new favorite spot every time I visit AZ from now on"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat, enjoy the view and be taken care of by our waitress, Becky. She was a sweetheart and would highly recommend any of my friends and family to go to THIS MACAYOS just for this woman. She brings out the best in you and provided our food fast and more importantly fresh. When a waitress/waiter is considerate and pleasant, it makes the going out for dinner effect that much better. A job well done to this Macayo's location and will return again."}
{"text":"I've been to Macayo's twice for happy hour and I enjoyed myself. I'm a fan of their cheese crisp; it looks like an extremely thin crust pizza. Their mini chimichangas are really good too. Their margaritas are watered down but that's why I go during happy hour, so I can drink a few of them.  It's definitely a great Happy Hour spot that I'd recommend to my friends and plan on going back again."}
{"text":"What gave me the push to finally try this place was their enticing three course meal special. We also had a coupon for a free spinach con queso appetizer, which was fabulous. The salad, which was my first course, was pretty good. Our waiter rubbed me the wrong way early on, however, when I asked him what dressings they offered. He rolled his eyes at me and asked me if I wanted something creamy or something like Italian \"cuz I don't wanna stand here and name them all.\" Excuse me, is that not part of your job to tell patrons what their salad dressing choices are?! I didn't understand the big deal, especially after he eventually rattled off all the dressings in fewer than five seconds. The food was delivered quickly, which was impressive. Granted the restaurant was far from packed on the particular Wednesday we went for an early dinner. My second course was a chicken dish. It was supposed to be spicy, but was far from it. The portion size was decent, though. Rice, beans, salsa...All average taste, not spectacular by any means. My third course, the pumpkin flan, was delicious. I just wish the size of the flan they served me was doubled. So puny! Am I in a rush to get back here? No. Did I hate it? No. At least I know which dressing I will be ordering for my salad whenever I go to Macayo's next so I won't be inconveniencing our server!"}
{"text":"New renovations look great but the servers and hostess are awful. They need serious training on costumer service. The other table next to us was saying the same thing. literally the only attentive person there with no attitude was our busser. He was working so hard and even got us our check and handed it to us because our waiter disappeared and we never saw him again the entire time after ordering. (we had to hunt him down also just to order)"}
{"text":"We came here expecting the same service other macayos gave but nope we waited 25 minutes for the hostess/host to seat us while servers/bussers were looking at us not saying a word or even smiling at least. We got tired of waiting so we decided to walk out....as we started walking toward the door...the hostess finally comes from the kitchen...needless to say we just kept walking...we will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Can't come to Arizona without hitting up a Macayo's.  Growing up, we usually ate at the Central location.  Back in the 80's I was enrolled in their Birthday program.  So special, they'd send me a Birthday Card, guaranteeing me a free meal and special toy.  So personal!    We frequent this location now because my parents are Sun City Snowbirds.  Food is fantastic, consistent through the years!  Go to meal: start with chips and HOT salsa (if they don't initially bring it, just ask,) a cheese crisp; then for the beef chimi (soo delicious, crispy outside, juicy inside, and lovely red sauce topping--can't go wrong!!)  Husband's fav right now is the  chicken poblano, side of sour cream.  And they always have fresh iced tea.  This place can get packed nights and weekends.  We love middle of the afternoon visits, in between lunch and dinner rush.  It's quiet, service is very relaxed, and we can hear each other.  This last visit \"Ate 0710\" waited on us.  Very pleasant and attentive.  Our meals are always so big, there's plenty for a second meal. \"Ate\" was considerate enough to box and bag our to-go's.  We bought some extra chips and salsa for our trip back to The Bay Area.  Another successful meal and service!!  See you guys in a few months!!"}
{"text":"The service can be hit or miss but the food is DELICIOUS! The quality of food at this location is much more consistent than other locations. Try the baja sauce!"}
{"text":"The food here was alright. Nothing was bad but nothing was amazing. I am used to eating a lot of good Mexican food so I wasn't really impressed. Not a bad place to visit it's just that I've had better. The people were friendly though so I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice. We like the \"Americanized\" Mexican food. I always order the Chicken Fajita Quesdailla which is great! It's always more than I can finish. The atmosphere is nice with the bright colors and unique decor. It elevates the experience to something similar to dining at a Rainforest Cafe. The last time we ate the service was slow. We waited a few minutes before the hostess noticed us then she sat us in a section where the sever was already gone for the night. It delayed our drinks and chips/salsa but when we finally did get service it was great. We ended up having 2 servers who swapped out halfway through our meal. It wasn't bad enough to deter me from going back. It's a nice place for families."}
{"text":"Dessert is the only reason to frequent this place. The food isn't well prepared and the taste isn't always there. Service is good, everyone is friendly but that doesn't make up for the lack of quality in the food."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Food & customer service has always been a pleasure.   They are very family friendly & will engage with you & your children which is a major plus for us. We ordered mini chimi's, 3 kids plates, fajitas & cheese crisp. Food was delicious! Fajitas were a little over priced but they were good.  Only downside was that it took our food a little longer to be served. They were not busy. At all."}
{"text":"There are alot of great choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area. Macayos is not one of them.  We've eaten at several of the restaurants in the Valley including the Surprise location (twice), and the only consistency is bad food.  We're finally done with Macayos.  We lived in Arizona and New Mexico a great part of our life and we've experienced wonderful cuisine. We've also lived in the Pacific Northwest where Mexican food is awful. Macayos reminds me of some of the gringo places in Seattle.  The food is bland. The salsa has very little flavor. OK, the portions are big if that's what you want. There are so many better options out there."}
{"text":"Came here for date night last night and it was amazing. We got sat right away and our server brought us our chips and salsa and our drink orders almost right away. We ordered and our food was hot and amazing! The only thing I would complain about would be our server being too attentive. I mean it isn't bad it showed he cared but we saw him at our table every 7-10 minutes.  Other than that. Everything about this place is great! Fast and great food"}
{"text":"Went for lunch but they have no lunch menu . Dinner prices for lunch is way too expensive . When we walked in it smelled like a restroom . Ordered a beef burrito and had no beef in it . All beans , lunch came to seventeen dollars including tip . Alot of money for a bean burrito . Never going again ever ."}
{"text":"If I would have written this review a few years ago it would've been 5 stars and 4-5 on every visit. The carnitas are always good , they serve pepsi products , the mexican common dishes are always solid and the restaurant is colorful. What changed,  I don't know. There was a Manager named Conrad who retired , he seemed a little laid back , some workers loved him the others did not . It didn't matter to us , when he was there everything went off without a hitch , no kitchen errors , great service , hot food with cold garnish and not dried out rice. I think the big difference now is the food may sit before coming out , and the servers aren't as seasoned. Some are great , Crystal in Pickup is great , But getting a good server , the correct order and it being fresh is like hitting the lottery. Hands down this used to be my favorite for a consistently solid Mexican meal. Arribas in Goodyear and Rio El Mirage on Bell and Litchfield have jumped ahead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here and we had the most outstanding service from our server Candy and she was awesome. Our food came in a timely manner and was delicious. One if their managers Karen came to our table and was so nice and friendly. This is definitely a place we are returning too."}
{"text":"Worst service ever,  food ordered showed up at different times, which is not a good thing when it's a party of 10, plus a few dishes were wrong. Had two servers that were scatterbrained, it wasn't even busy for them to take so long to get drinks when needed..   The food was overrated, overpriced and overcooked, (due to microwaving).   No wonder I have not been to macayos in 15 years,  it sucked then and now more than ever...  Horrible place, they should shut the doors and call it a day for good"}
{"text":"Terrible service and cold, late food. It wasn't even busy to use as an excuse. Imagine my surprise when 1 ala carte taco was $5.99. Quite a disconnect between the servers and the kitchen. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"OK, so we have eaten here twice. I had the green pork burrito. To say the least, it was anemic. There was NO pork! This was the second time. Last time, I complained and they fixed it. This time , I said to heck with it. It will be the LAST time. I neglected to say that the verde sauce was extra... Oh, well. Caveat Emptor... Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Old Macayo's. Could use a face lift. Bar staff are slow to help patrons. Haven't been here in 22 years...it has serious slid down hill over the years. But it could be worse."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese quesadilla and it was awful. Also ordered the mini chimichangas and they were deep fried and burnt. The chips and salsa was ok. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Our entire family thinks this is the best Mexican food we have ever eaten. I had the Tres Rellenos and each one was better than the next. The cheese crispy is stuff of legend, my husband told me for years that it was amazing and it absolutely was. The chicken and cheese quesadillas converted my son to a Mexican food loving child in less than 10 minutes. My husband  3 enchilada plate  was  over the top excellent. And my daughter's grilled fish Tacos were fresh and perfectly seasoned. This will definitely be our go-to Mexican restaurant and they come back to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Not happy with our service, food ok. Took forever to get seated. Finally seated (2 adults, 1 2.5 yr old and 11 mth old twins--all well behaved and happy). Once seated, we were given chips, no waters. Took awhile for server to come. Once he came, he got our drink order wrong (brought a beer we did not order and iced tea, still no waters). Sent beer back. When we ordered, our server kept changing our order so we \"could save money\". ? He said appetizer was free for first time customers. We ordered the cheese crisp. Came back 3 times asking if we really wanted it with guac and beef. Appetizer finally came. It was good. Luckily I brought snacks to keep the kids happy. Meal finally came. We had to eat fast and asked for the check because we had now been there for 1.5 hrs. The server up charged for the so called \"free appetizer\" and dips and charged us for a beer that we didn't order. We had to leave by then so I did not leave a good tip. Not happy and not coming back. **I usually give pretty good reviews and places a break, but not happy with service here."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Closest Mexican restaurant to our new house. Food was below average. There was a huge dip in my bench seat. Worn out. I was sitting on the plywood. The fork that was waiting for my wife had a chunk of cheese or something stuck to it."}
{"text":"First of all the waitress was ok but all of our little plates had food stuck to it went thru 5 plates before finding a couple of them good then we get our food my plate had to food dried and stuck to the bottom got a manager he got it remade then the second plate had a different kind of food stuck hard then I let him know again he said was when they wipe the sauce off the plate must be really really really hot then for it to stick that hard then he got a little upset then just drops the plate in front of me he was really rude at the end he was trying to be nice will never go back to this again"}
{"text":"A great Sunday dinner at Macayo's. We came into the bar this afternoon, for an early dinner, and was greeted by Zach our awesome server.  He always remembers us and has great customer service skills. We you come into the bar at Macayo's in Surprise please ask for Zach, he will treat you right!"}
{"text":"for many years Macayo's has been a steady consistent place to get good Mexican food.  Personally, i'm a big fan of chicken pablano or the Carnitas.  Both are good options.   Their baja sauce is a cream cheese warm cheese that is very good"}
{"text":"It's Macayo's. Not terrible but not really Mexican food either."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was at least 25 years ago, we were in the area so decided to give it a try. I was so impressed with the upkeep of the restaurant! It was spotless, and in fact the manager was cleaning the fireplace, etc. while we were there. Our waiter was awesome as well! And the food was just as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"We ate dinner with my daughter and her boyfriend.  It was a special occasion as he asked our permission to marry our daughter.  The food was really great.  Our server Kyle was awesome.  He gave us exceptional service. He is an  awesome server."}
{"text":"First and last time. I got the burrito bowl to go. Looked like sides in a box. Not enough rice to make a bowl. Sad. I called was offered a refund but it's not a convenient location for me to go back to."}
{"text":"First let me say, I love Macayos. I've been going there at least once a month if not more for almost 5 years.   However, I'm not very impressed with this location. I was so excited when we found this one, because we thought the closest location was Awatukee.   My husband and I have dined in twice and gotten take out once. Our first waiter was absolutely terrible. We were there for nearly 2 hours because he took so long with everything, the food was very good though. Our second visit was ok, the service was better, but the food wasn't as good. The mini chicken chimis I ordered had hardly any chicken in them.   The same thing happened when we ordered take out, I was basically eating an empty eggroll. They also charged $3.50 for an extra small side of salsa, which they did not bother to inform us of when we placed our order.   Their chips are always over or undercooked. Which is annoying, as chips are a part of the experience!   All in all, I think we'll drive the extra 15 min. and go to the Awatukee location."}
{"text":"Food tasteless. Sad, it used to be my favorite for Mexican food. The salsa was bland and that was a sign of bad news. I had pork Chimi Grande dinner and the pork was very dry, no seasoning, and tasteless. The refried beans and even the dang rice had no flavor. Sat 10 minutes after eating to get bill. Must be under new management because I will no longer drive 13 miles one way to eat there anymore."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible service!  I had just arrived from California, it was hot and I was starving.  I wanted Mexican so I decided to give this a whirl.  Granted we got there at 8 and they close at 10, but still.  Hostess sat us down and handed us menus.  No one came for about 15 minutes until I got up to notify the hostess.  She said \"oh, sorry there must have been some confusion with the waiters. Uh, ok! She took our order, brought us out drinks and after we got our food, our server showed up.  A little too late I thought.   She asked if we needed refills and we said no.  My friend asked for a side of beans and the girl forgot, says \"oh no I forgot about those but I'll make sure they're pipping hot when they come out\".  She was a complete airhead!  The food was mediocre at best!  Won't be going back to this place, yuck!"}
{"text":"This place has been popular ever since it opened. We were sorely lacking a decent non-fast food restaurant in this part of the city and Macayo's fits the bill. The salsa, as another reviewer mentioned, is really really good. I usually go with the Chimichanga and it never disappoints. The decor is very colorful and lively. I would say it's a good value for the money. If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night you should make reservations. It can be a long wait otherwise."}
{"text":"I would love this place if it wasn't for the food. I like how it is painted on the outside and inside it is all bright colors with different colored chairs. And I think the cheesy décor is pretty cool, too. I love the giant margarita glasses and Mexican Talavera pottery style birds everywhere. The service is passable. But I just can't eat here. Not that this location is particularly bad food or anything. I just really don't like Macayos. Way too much cheese all over everything. Their chips are like cardboard and the salsa never tastes fresh. The tortillas are not authentic Mexican at all. The one thing I do appreciate is that they give you the option of having calabacitas (sautéed diced zucchini and corn kernels) as a side dish.  I wish other Mexican places would have a veggie side as an option in addition to the usual rice and beans (they do offer black beans, too which is also nice)."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the Macayo's on Bell Road many times.  Our group had the chicken poblano, salmon tacos, and baja chimi.  The food was tasty and the service was good.  I'll continue to eat there."}
{"text":"Super saucy, cheesy gooey mess of a platter i had. Better mexican food at mixteca and popos. Macayos should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant about 4-5 times and only because my friends wanted to go. The menu is \"OK\" with my favorite thing being the chile relleno.My biggest complaint is their salsa. I understand fusions and adding a twist to recipes to challenge palates.  Coming up with original dishes and modifying traditional ones is what can separate you from the rest. That said, I don't understand, in fact I have a problem with adding oregano to a salsa. For some reason they seem to be a successful chain but I'll be honest, I will only eat at Macayo's when I need to reach a compromise."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  They have great service, a nice ambiance, and the chips and salsa are great.  And the fried ice cream is the best!  Everyone in our family and everyone we have introduced the restaurant to, agree.  I have been to the Mesa and Gilbert location and prefer the Gilbert one.  There is a nice beside the restaurant literally out the patio.  Great place for a date or for a family night of good food."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a reservation for 15-20 people for an after party following our wedding and reception this past weekend. The reservation was ready as requested. Good thing, too, since we had 19 people in attendance and the restaurant was absolutely packed.  The service was quite slow to start, but once it got going it went well. The food came out reasonably quickly for such a packed restaurant. Our server was friendly and even complimented us at the end of the meal for being such a fun group to deal with.  Our group had a good time, very good food, and decent service. About the only problem we had aside from the slow start to the service was the noise level as there were quite a few birthday celebrations throughout which required several servers to sing and clap loudly. It was a little disturbing for people in our party with sensitive hearing, though we all appreciated the friendly party atmosphere."}
{"text":"This location usually has horrible service and it did not start out well this visit as it took us a minute to get sat because the host was chatting with a customer while sitting at the bar. However, once we were sat our server Rosalie was quite pleasant and provided good service. Our food was about average, but worth going back for. Overall, decent experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch Monday Nov 4th. Was greeted as I walked in and asked for a patio table. It was open seating so I picked a 2 top table. The host shortly brought my menu out to me and that was the end of my pleasant experience. Been sitting here for 15 mins, no one has been out to check on me or grab my drink order. I am the only one on the patio but that doesn't excuse the neglect. Looks like I need to take my business else where.. unfortunate cause I was really looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. Came in on a Saturday night and was sat on the patio because the restaurant was full. After sitting for 15-20min our server finally greeted us and took our drink order we waited another 15 mins for our drinks we then both ordered beef chimichangas 45 mins later someone else delivered our food mind you our server had not filled our drinks or checked on us the entire time. We bit into the chimichangas and they were both chicken and waited another 10 mins for our server to check back with use so we could tell him about the mistake to no avail so we both walked out. Once we got in our car we see the server for the 1st time in over an hour walk out the front door looking for us."}

{"text":"I arrived at 6:20pm on a Friday night requesting a table for 12 people to celebrate my birthday. I was told it would be about a 40-45 min wait...I said \"no problem, can we wait in the bar and have some drinks until the table was ready?\". I was told, \"no problem we would be found when our table was ready\". I continued into the bar and found two hightop tables for us to wait at. I was passed by several servers walking to the kitchen and the bartender never greeted us upon entering. After several minutes passing looking around for service I waived at the bartender asking if there was a sever on or did we need to go to the bar. He pointed at a girl sever walking toward us and got her attention, as he pointed at us showing that we needed help. The server Jessica briefly stopped looked back at us then turned to the bartender and said \"what\"?  He pointed at my table again and she then turned around ignoring the bartender and my table then walked into the kitchen. The bartender looked back at my table with wide eyes that she just did that!   Jessica then returns with an attitude, chips and salsa and a rude greeting after over 10 minutes of sitting there. Being that I am also a server I remained quiet for the moment understanding it is a busy night. I told Jessica that we were just having drinks until our table opened up. She took our drink order and left. The bar was hardly full and several servers huddle in a group at end of the bar as I continue to have terrible service from the Jessica girl. As more members of my party arrive she passes by avoiding eye contact time and time again. Finally she eventually gets flagged down by other members of my party trying to get a drink. And two other members of my party had to get up and go to the bar to order due to her skill of ignoring tables. She again stops and leaves as fast a possible not even asking the full table if anyone would like another round and rushes off. At this time we have now been waiting for over an hour and my sister asks for her beer tab to close. Jessica stops and with a rude tone and says \"you want separate checks then\"? Shocked by her response I said , \"yes we are separate\". Before I could even finish my sentence she already started to walk away when I was also trying to order myself a new drink. I snapped and said \"Hey!...I am about to ask for your manager if you keep being rude and jetting off before you even hear what I'm trying to say\". I then asked for another round and my check also. She returns with my sisters check which was incorrect and charged with an extra beer that she didn't' even have. Now approaching an hour and 20 min later our table is finally ready. I said forget my check just transfer to my table and fix my sisters tab.   After we moved my new server came and asked who had the pina colada's in the bar...which was me...and I said \"that was me\". She then then says \"Oh, that was you huh?\" and rudely walked away! As if the other server warned her that I just chewed her ass out in the bar. Then to top it off my parents told our new server it was my birthday mid meal. I was never wished a happy birthday or given a desert or anything! Our table was not even asked if we wanted desert! Never again will I ever return after being a life long customer of this place...since I was a kid. As a fellow server in the industry I was completely appalled and shocked by the service given. NEVER AGAIN...and this place should be ashamed. As I read other reviews on here...seems as if service is not even a standard or concern after reviewing these ratings...what a joke! Just completely disappointed...what a away to spend your birthday!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for happy hour.  In the bar - ordered two REGULAR margaritas at the happy hour price. Server delivered GRANDE margaritas instead (probably because we ordered just one appetizer - when we ordered she said \"just that?\").  Server had an attitude problem from the get-go.  Not a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Ya know Macayo's is one of my favorite Mexican food places in the valley...I will start with that.  This visit was by far disappointing! I was in the mood for a carnitas chimmy.....and well left empty handed and still hungry after an hour of waiting. The bartender and staff seemed pretty overwhelmed the entire time we were there. One waitress was running all over the placing dropping things left and right.  That's It took forever to get chips and salsa. So when the food was taking forever to get to us we asked for more chips and salsa....like 5 times.  When we got frustrated enough from waiting we asked for our tab, but oh yea the bartender was MIA for the 10 minuets so the waitress could not tab us our so the offered a manger.  Oooh look the bartender appeared to apologize and that the manager was going to serve us the food when it was ready....oooooooookay but how long was that going to be. Just super annoyed that one of my favorite places has gone down hill for whatever reason....again I'm pretty disappointed and my chimmy craving is still there.  My boyfriend does not like it when I'm hangry....he says THANKS!!"}
{"text":"Ask for April - best server EVER! Girl really knows her customers and is 'on it' with every request... Will be back and hopefully April will be my server!"}
