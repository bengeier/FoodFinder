{"text":"On an adventure metro trip with the wee daughter, we happened upon this restaurant. What a great surprise! Fantastic food (we had the chicken & goat platters), nice ambiance and the owner/chef was super friendly. Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Une très bonne soirée, ce genre de restaurant où on a le sourire dès qu'on met le premier pied dedans jusqu'au moment où on en sort. 
La taille réduite du restaurant et l'ambiance tamisée donne vraiment cette belle impression cosi de manger dans le salon de  Bibi Ntumba. L'accueil souriant et efficace des serveuses nous met rapidement à l'aise sur un fond de John Coltrane. La carte se résume à 5 plats tous accompagnés de riz brun salade et plantains. J'ai pris le poulet aux arachides et ma blonde le tilapia.  Dans un délai bien plus que raisonnable (Bibi étant, en plus, la seule cuisinière) les plats arrivent et n'enlèvent pas mon sourire. L'assiette est copieuse. C'est un des meilleurs poulets aux arachides que j'ai eu l'occasion de manger, le poulet est vraiment tendre et la sauce ni trop liquide nu trop pâteuse. Juste parfait! Par gourmandise j'ai commandé des plantains en plus (une bonne dose).
Je recommande donc ce restaurant et félicite Bibi et les jeunes filles pour leur effort qui on fait que c'est aujourd'hui ma meilleure expérience dans un restaurant à Montréal. 
Ahsante Bibi!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant familial. Le service est chaleureux et on y mange de la bonne cuisine maison. Le poulet grillé et son accompagnement etaient tres bons, et les portions assez généreuses. Peut etre un des meilleurs restaurants africains de Montréal"}
{"text":"Whenever someone says \"Hey, did you check out the African joint down the block\" I instantly get a brain aneurysm.  Africa is a continent the size of Europe, United States, Japan, India and China combined.  When you are trying to talk about an African \" flavor\" in this fashion it's like pointing at a random edible object at the local Provigo and claiming it to be a Canadian flavor - theoretically true, but really patently ridiculous.  The flavor of Maghrebi African is different from the flavors of Egypt, which is different from, say, Ethiopian or Eriterian.  Same goes for Francophone Africa versus Anglophone, or Arab versus Christian.    The truth of the matter is - there are patterns to ingredient availability and ethnic influences, but the more exposure to it means you'll learn to figure out origins and influences.

Take, for instance, Gracia Afrika.  It's a tiny tiny place (with literally 7 tables) on Notre Dame Street West within the gentrifying Little Burgundy neighborhood (it's west island but within the Green line metro), and completely walkable to Marche Atwater.  Bibi (that's the name of the proprietress) does the cooking and the cleaning, and her culinary skill-set is something special.  She's from Kinshasa, Republic of Congo, so her cuisine tends to lean on the flavors of Sub-Saharan west Africa.  You'll see quite a bit of peanut based soups or stews, the use of bananas (or possibly coco-yam dumplings known as fu-fu) as starches, flavorful rice and beans dishes, goat or lamb as meats, or fish grilled in banana leaves.  For those of you who are familiar with Senegalese, Ivorian, or  (to a certain degree) Haitian cuisine, you'll find it reminiscent of that.

Bibi and her restaurant is very well known in Montreal - she kept the place open for the past 6 years and built up quite a following.  Montreal is infamous for killing restaurants due to its establishment-per-capita ratio (much higher than NYC) - in fact, one of the things you notice strolling through certain neighborhoods like The Main or Downtown is how frequent you see \"A Louer\" (for rent) signs at failed restaurant storefronts.  Those who can't hack it are spun out quickly with fickle crowds, high rents and expenses.  It take a brass pair to run a restaurant in this town.  Does she have a pair?   You bet - she cooked for Michaëlle Jean (the former governor general of Canada, and a local girl) at state dinners.  And she alone will cook for you, wash for you and tend to your needs.  Service will be a little slower, but hey, 90 minute suppers are the norms here dining out.  The place is BYOB, so take advantage of that Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ) or the Depannier nearby and buy yourself a nice bottle of red before coming in.  The limited menu is usually written on a chalkboard and presented to you in the fashion of a good Parisian bistro - have Google Translate ready as boss-lady does not really speak too much English.  If you speak French, ask her questions and she'll gladly oblige.

Okay, onto the food.  What can you expect?  Well, the day I went with the missus, we got 2 dishes - mwambe (which is a chicken stew in a peanut gravy) and whole fish (it's tilapia) grilled in banana leaves and topped with a pepper/onion sauce.  The Mwambe is rather like the Senegalese mafe, which is lamb and carmelized onions stewed in dende (palm oil), ground peanuts and spices.  In Bibi's Congolese version the amount of dende is knocked down quite significantly, and the meal is served with a flavorful rice pilaf (think of it as like a cross between an Indian Biryani and Jamaican rice-and-peas).  The fish is like the Senegalese yassa, which is a grilled fish stew with peppers onions and lemon.  In Bibi's version, the lemon isn't there, but it's still extremely good and delicious.  The meals also come with fried plantains (the savory version) and a salad (which comes out of a CostCo carton, heh).  Pricing is reasonable (about $18/person before the 15% Quebec taxes) and the service is decent.  

So yes, her cuisine isn't exactly reflective of the entire Africa continent - show me a place that serves Egyptian, Moroccan, Ethiopian, Ivorian, Senegalese, Ghanian, Nigerian, Congolese, Mozambique, Botswanan, and South African all under one roof, and maybe we can lay claim to that one.   However, if you want a taste of what Ivorian, Senegalese and Congolese might taste like, step right up to Gracia Afrika, there's an iron lady here who will show you.  I personally consider her restaurant to be a must-visit if you are in Montreal, it's just as important as Schwartz's, Rotisserie Romados, Sai Gwan, Agrikol or the Pool Room."}
{"text":"Prices went up. Paid $21 for grilled goat. Received a plate with brown rice, small salad, and little portion with grilled goat. I can't believe I paid so much for a plate that was probably not worth more than $10."}
{"text":"Great intimate place to eat. Very romantic. Customer service. Nice for small groups. Will definitely receive repeat business. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Exactly what was needed on a freezing Montreal winter night. If you love stews, then you'll enjoy this very cozy and warm BYOB. Just a bit on the expensive side, especially for the portions, but where else can you find homemade stews from the Congo in Montreal?"}
{"text":"Tonight we had a wonderful dinner at Gracia Afrika, which is just down the street from our place. We were greeted by the owner, Bibi Ntumna. I asked what time she closed, since it was 25 minutes until 9:00. She responded, with a big smile, \"Whenever you are done.\"

We've just moved to Montreal and speak almost no French, but Bibi speaks some English. She has a menu written on a chalkboard; always a good sign, since it changes based on availability. I ordered Mwambe, which is chicken simmered in peanut sauce, and my wife got grilled goat. 

Bibi has a small kitchen and we could watch her prepare the food. The dishes both came with a big scoop of spiced beans and rice, a side of fried plantains, and a lettuce/tomato salad. The plates are deceptively large: by the time we finished eating we were both extremely full. My only regret is that we didn't know to bring a bottle of wine with us, since we popped in on a fortuitous whim. 

The food was fantastic, the service was top notch, and the restaurant itself is cozy and lovely. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice family style African restaurant. 
We tried almost everything on the menu and everything was delicious. 
It got a cozy home cooking atmosphere, we really enjoyed our time. 
Also, it's BYOW!"}
{"text":"Great food, very comforting, loved the heat that was added to the dishes upon request, cosy spot. Will be going back soon !"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. We came here on a Friday night and waited half an hour before being shown the menu. We ordered and waited for another hour before our food came.

While we were waiting she offered us two small samosas per person because we were waiting so long - she ended up charging us 6 dollars per person for bite sized samosas that we didn't want.

My bill ended up being 40 dollars for a few pieces of overcooked and dry goat, shreds of iceberg lettuce, 3 slices of fried plantains and a small cup of rice. The chicken we ordered wasn't much better. Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"First time having African food. It was delicious! A great place for comfort food!  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I know exactly zilch about African cuisine.

I don't mean North African, like Moroccan and Tunisian  of which we have plenty in Montreal.
I mean equatorial Africa. Cuisines of countries like Congo, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal or Ivory Coast. I admit my ignorance completely on the foods of that part of the world.

But now, I don't have an excuse anymore. Gracia Afrika sits on a stretch of Notre-Dame street which is rapidly undergoing gentrification. Within walking distance of both Lionel-Groulx and St.Henri metro stations, it's a great place to stop off for dinner right after work. With simmered stew and curry-like dishes, if you like Indian food, it's not a hard stretch to appreciate Gracia Afrika either.

With dishes like Mwambe, a simmered chicken in peanut sauce dish or dishes  like spicy catfish cooked in banana leaves, the food is spicy, but not hot, extremely flavorful and satisfying in a home-cooked meal kind of way. It's also BYOB. Ingredients like coconut milk, plantains, rice, beans, goat and lamb all are featured prominently.

We came in last night and were instantly welcomed warmly by owner and cook Bibi Ntumna. Articles which have featured the restaurant are all on display on the wall. Bibi has also cooked for the likes of former Governor General Michaelle Jean, introducing African food to the folks in government.

So if you want to get to know what African food is like, make a stop here. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"It was my wife b-day and she wanted to try something different.  I found this place on Yelp and both ratings had 5 Stars. 
Since we had a party at the house for 7:30 we needed an early dinner. Bibi was not sure if she would have food ready for so early but she told me she would call me by 5, and she did. She normally does not open so early but she did for us. When we arrived  doors were still locked but she let us in the the place was all ours. 
I fell in love the minute I walked in. It just had that I am gonna like it feel.
I had the chicken in Peanut Butter sauce, while 2 of my kids had soso Chicken and the other had the fish. My wife had the Goat. Everything was great as I tried a little of everything. fish was great wit a hint of spice. Just enough to notice.
service was just excellent and I promised we'll be back."}
