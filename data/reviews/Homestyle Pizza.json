{"text":"I live for this place. I live about 8 minutes away, in a town no one will deliver to, but these guys didn't even flinch when I told them my address. Always a plus!  The food is super fresh and delicious, the staff is kind and friendly, and you can't beat the price. And, as a Stromboli expert, I swear by their dough pockets of deliciousness. Also amazing are the pepperoni rolls! They're magical. The only thing I don't like is that they're cash only and the only bank in Cecil closed down awhile ago. It's not bad enough that I'd give them four stars, though. This restaurant is perfection."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza anywhere, really! Sandwiches and hoggie's  are great too!
Family run business, best around!"}
{"text":"Just moved to McDonald and so far had been very disappointed in the pizza selections. Saw this place and decided to give it a try. 

You can tell it's more \"homemade\" than many pizza shops. Not greasy at all either. We got the regular crust, which was a good thickness - not so thin that the cheese and toppings weigh it down. I just got green peppers and onions. The veggies seemed fresh and there was a good amount on the pizza. The sauce was also good - somewhat sweet but seasoned well. 

My husband got the buffalo chicken pizza and loved it. Was happy they put in ranch on the side even though he forgot to ask. 

We will definitely come back and try other things. Some of the best takeout pizza I've had in the greater Pittsburgh area for sure."}
{"text":"Really impressed with our spur of the moment pizza and half of an Italian hoagie! The pizza was delicious and not greasy at all, and the hoagie was a+++ will be returning !"}
{"text":"The pizza is good,  but the wings are better! $4.75 for a small pizza cannot be beat! I got a small white pizza and my husband got a small pepperoni pizza. He loved his, but I wish mine would have been cooked just a minute or two longer. I like crispy pizza, but it was still good and the price is right! The mild wings were bomb! Cooked perfectly and nice and saucy! The staff was so friendly. Who doesn't love supporting local, family ran businesses? We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little family pizza place tucked away in a quaint neighborhood! Awesome , friendly owners !"}
{"text":"Homestyle Pizza is family owned and family run. This definitely shows through their fast and friendly customer service. Since moving to McDonald, we tried just about every pizza place in town. Homestyle blew them away with their quality. The crust is very high quality. I chose their buffalo chicken pizza both times I've been there and was very satisfied. I consider these guys to be my new go-to."}
