{"text":"Mon bubble tea au Litchi était surprenamment bon et pas excessivement sucré comme la plupart. Je n'hésiterais pas à recommander et à y retourner."}
{"text":"Hate to give a place a bad review but the bubble tea I got green tea passion fruit tasted bitter when I went to ask the server they said that's how passion fruit tastes like.... Ummm Im a regular drinking this flavor and its not so bitter think bitter melon bitter I assume its either not good syrup or the wrong teas I kept questioning them that it doesn't taste like it the server just said its already made I can't make another one. I'm not a happy camper when comparing to chat time or ten rens. Avoid this place. Its really small and cozy tho."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's different, different good. It's good for a casual hangout spot, unlike other bubble tea cafes (always packed and noisy). The taste wasn't disappointing and it was actually pretty good. I'd love to go back to this cafe again."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to meet me downtown during the afternoon so we decided to meet at Eaton Center. He bought something to eat since it was relatively close to lunch but since I ate a late breakfast and wasn't really hungry, I opted to find a place where I could just get something to drink.  I decided to try out Bubble Tease. It is located in the Eaton Center's food court.  The drink I got was a bit pricey (my drink cost me $6.31) but I enjoyed it. I can't really complain about the service since it was okay or as to be expected."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their tea is great and the owner is so sweet! ;)  I went there with my girlfriend and we ordered the almond slush tea with tapioca. I really liked it and we go back there pretty frequently."}
{"text":"I hate to give a place poor reviews esp if its their first one but their drinks are not good. Ordered the taro mill tea and it tasted like milk tea with a bit of taro flavouring...basically, your typical average tea shop.  To be honest, I never understood why Cha Time had such dedicated followers but after trying other tea shops and the type of bubble teas they offered, everything pales in comparison. The quality of Cha Time's ingredients definitely put them in the forefront.  I wished bubble tease offered great drinks as its conveniently located where I live. I guess I will need to make the trip to Dundas if I ever have a bubble tea craving."}
{"text":"Pretty good but super pricey for a mall bubble tea location. The tea is tasty, but I've had better for less money. I like the design of their booth and their cups, it's really cute."}
{"text":"On trouve Bubble Tease dans la halte bouffe sous le niveau métro. Perso, j'adore les bubble tea, mais je les trouve souvent trop sucrés et les formats sont gigantesques. Chez Bubble tease il y a un petit format (12-14 onces) et ça goûte le vrai thé vert frais! J'ai pris aux pêches et j'ai adoré!"}
