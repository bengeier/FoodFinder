{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as we were walking aimlessly around Montreal on a rainy evening in search of the \"perfect spot.\" All of the restaurants we passed were missing something. We spotted this place from across the street. The dim lighting from inside, the blue and white stripped awning and the rain falling made for the \"perfect spot.\" We chose to sit at one of the four outside tables, yes, in the rain! The awning blocked most of it, except when the wind blew. We stubbornly remained outside our entire meal and it was worth it. From the bottle of wine to the tasty food to the wonderful staff, we found just what we were looking for. This is a place we would visit again next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant serving well-prepared French and Italian food. Service was very friendly and attentive. I had veal saltimbocca which came with a cream sauce. My wife had a fish that was well cooked. Can't say it was an extremely impressive meal but it was very good."}
{"text":"Wonderful French restaurant in Old Montreal with delicious, simple, fresh, authentic food and drinks at good prices. We especially loved the French onion soup, the sun dried tomato pasta, the duck and spinach cannelloni, and the creme brûlée (plus the bread that came with the meal!). The staff were just lovely--some of the most helpful, attentive, and friendly I've ever encountered. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good food and a nice atmosphere.  Its in a quiter part of old montreal where we saw lots of locals enjoying dinner too.  Much better then the tourist trapa restaurants in the heart of Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Just okay. Yelp lists this as a French restaurant, but to me it skewed somewhere between French and Italian. Call it Mediterranean. We had cannelloni stuffed with veal, and the shrimps provencal (in a tomato sauce). They were both reasonably competent (lived in Philadelphia for years, so I'll admit I have pretty high standards for Italian, and food in general), but not exciting. The bread was so so (I have an unreasonable love of bread). The tomato tartare starter was really a few thin slices of tomato on greens, totally fine but not quite what the name suggested. We had the lemon meringue \"pie\" for dessert -- pastry shell was very hard (didn't flake), lemon not tart enough for my taste. The creme anglaise on the side was, however, delicious. Service was fine. Reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"Great experience at this lovely, atmospheric place. The service and personnel were second only to the satisfying meal. As a first course, we had a brilliant and subtle duck foi gras with a fruit compote. The complimentary flavors and textures made for a superb experience. The main course, braised lamb chops in a tasty sauce, with whipped potatoes and fresh vegetables, was exactly what we needed. Overall a more than delicious and gratifying evening."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food.

I ordered veal meatballs and pasta. The veal was cold on the inside and I was never offered parmesan or fresh pepper. 

Service is slow and of the 3 waitreses that served our little section, none of them came to ask if everything was ok.

They took away our dishes and didn't offer us a dessert menu. We had time so we waited to see if they'll acknowledge us. 15 min later...one of them came by. 

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Place was cute, but the service was pretty much non existent. We waited a very long time to be acknowledged even to order. The food was fine, but I wasn't even hungry after this long wait.  For an order of soup, salmon, escargot and creme brulee trio, we must have been there for 2.5 hours. Need to hire more servers."}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing out of the ordinary but solid. It was close to hotel and we wanted French food. Had the filet poivre, onion soup and Creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Great option for local french cuisine in old montreal with good service and the fine dining experience. Had escargot for the first time... Very tender, but the hilite were the scallops seared snd prepared to perfection. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet. We have been there three times and never been disappointed. The man who runs the restaurant is amazing and personable. He talks to us like family every time we come. The food is always artfully played and delicious. The first course gazpacho was not the best I have had there but that was more of a personal preference. For my entree I had a fillo crusted salmon with incredibly delicious lentils. The rest of my family got steak in a pepper sauce. The neat was tender with the perfect amount of spice. I recommend the creme brûlée as a dessert with a cappuccino or a glass of port. 
I will come back here every time I get back to Montreal. 
My only comment is that it is more of a romantic date night or dinner with friends spot. My older kids were fine but my youngest picky eater only had the choice of grilled chicken or ravioli. Neither picky kid friendly options. I asked if the chef could make a grilled cheese but they were not able to do his options were limited. Not a big deal but if you have the picky kids in tow you might want to skip this one with them. 

Love. Love. Love this place. Thanks for a memorable meal in a gorgeous setting."}
{"text":"Food was very disappointing. My husband ordered Cornish hen and I ordered short ribs. Cornish hen was very dry and tasteless; my short ribs was lukewarm, and the fats in the middle was still solid. Appetizers were slightly better but not fantastic. The foie gras I ordered was frozen mixture of butter and foie gras, not impressed. Food was so bad that both of us left the restaurant disappointed and unsatisfied. 
We had much better French food in the neighbourhood for similar prices. So I would recommend you try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my bonus one night while I was on the road alone. I ate outside to enjoy the gorgeous weather in late May in Montreal. It was a good choice, because not only is there fantastic Montreal eye-candy someone was glad in full vintage middle-ages executioner gear including the bag over the head. It was a sight to behold.

I tried the buffalo tartar as a means of expanding my palate. It was a little more of an acquired taste for me, but it was still good; the potatoes and veggies it came with were excellent. I went with the recommended merlot(?) and was pleased. I had something chocolate for dessert as well as tea, which was included in my meal. I ate here the night after I ate at Forquet Fourchette, and I like this place better. Next time I will stick with more traditional fare (fliet mignon, duck confit.)"}
{"text":"I had a truly delightful escargot plate here, and an u forgettable spicy beef tartare that I will be dreaming about for days. It must be a hidden gem because it was not very noisy or packed, just a quaint dark setting to indulge appreciate the authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"Le Gargote in my opinion is one of the best French Restaurants in the greater Montreal area.

Also one of the most popular and scenic locations, in the heart of old Montreal, you can sit bu the open fireplace sip red wine and eat very traditional French and Quebec fare. 

The exposed old stone walls and horse drawn carriages going by make you feel as though you are in Europe.

Now the food: Venison, veal, foux grais, duck confit, all with seasonal sides and wine parings.
I just melt or either can also get intimidated at the menu. 
Reasonably priced, abt. $25-45 PP."}
{"text":"This was a really good restaurant that I very much enjoyed and would certainly say to go to if you're in the neighborhood. I don't know that it's a 5 star establishment, especially given that I just gave a French fry joint a 5 star rating. But then, we spent $4 on fries and, well, a lot more here. Having said that, it was nice sitting outside, the wine was good, service was good, and the food was good. Price was in-line with what you would expect. Certainly worth the visit. 

They gave us bread, as much as we wanted, which is always good unless the bread is terrible. The bread wasn't terrible so that's a good thing. We also got a soup, a gazpacho I believe. It was good, especially with the free bread. I like bread. 

The appetizer was the stuffed portobello with goat cheese. It was really good, regardless of the amount of bread they may or may not have given us. Of course as soon as it was gone I wanted more, but then we had the main dish that was coming next so it was ok. I'm trying to think of what the main dish was, and I'm completely and totally drawing a blank. So I'm going to pause while I think about this.

...

Nope, not coming back to me. It was almost a month ago now and it has long since slipped both of our minds. We both feel like it was some kind of beef, and it had a salad on the side. I guess this testimonial would be enough to suggest that the meal was entirely not memorable. And I can't exactly argue that body of evidence before you. But I assure you it was good, and if I lived across the street I would go there right now to prove a point. What point, I'm not sure. 

Anyway, from top to bottom the experience was solidly good and I would recommend it. So ok, maybe the main dish didn't blow me away and make me remember the meal 3 weeks later. But life is hectic and 1 meal among a busy 6 day trip to Montreal is sometimes hard to remember so many days later. But this was our 1 splurge of the trip and it was worth it. I suggest you take your chance and give it a shot. And if you want to review it I would do so the next day, or at least write down what you ate so you can remember when you sit down to put those tastes to words a few weeks later. 

Oh, the wine recommendation. It was good. We got a Merlot from France and it was a tasty selection. It went well with the meal and we both enjoyed it. See? We do remember most of the meal. Just not the meat. Bread, soup, wine, salad, appetizer, service, ambiance...all good & memorable. But the meat...the meat escapes me. So I guess maybe next time we'll get the fish."}
{"text":"Someone asked me the other day where to go in Montreal and this is my go to place for dinner!  It has been a few years since I was here so I Yelped it for to get the address.  The few times I have been here it has never disappointed!  I was glad to see them show up on Yelp and I look forward to my next trip back."}
{"text":"Oh baby.  La Gargote seriously didn't disappoint.  The food was delicious, the service was perfect, the restaurant was clean, portions were not skimpy, and the wine was exactly as described.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  If I wanted to be picky, I could say that my steak was a little undercooked, but it was delicious and I didn't leave any.

As for the decor:  The restaurant is in an old building, in an old section of the city.  There's an exposed brick wall that's been there for hundreds of years and frankly, I wouldn't want it to look any different than it does.  Dated?  No, that's honest, transparent character.  If you want something trendy, go somewhere else you're missing something real and something amazing.  On my next trip to Montreal, I will seek out La Gargote."}
{"text":"We are happy to post a five star review for this restaurant. We did a lot of research before setting our sights on La Gargote; read many reviews and looked at a lot of menus. The ambiance is classic French bistro in Old Montreal. We were greeted by the host, Samy, and seated promptly. The menu is a bit on the small side, but it is obvious that they take care with preparation and presentation. My meal included (by choice) an arugula salad - other choice was a carrot pottage - with an entree of cod. The cod was oven roasted and presented with capers and tomatoes along with a rice timbale and steamed veggies (I'm sorry I didn't take a picture - beautiful to look at). My partner had the filet (7 oz.) with a peppercorn sauce that was accompanied by roasted potatoes and steamed veggies. Meat was perfectly cooked to medium and tender. Desserts chosen were chocolate profiteroles (oh so delicious) and tarte tatin; both made in-house. Yum! Samy was attentive and quite pleasant. His servers paced the meal well and were very nice. There is a full bar and available seating outside, weather permitting. We strongly endorse your consideration of this restaurant."}
{"text":"A group of us ladies vacationing in Montreal a couple of weeks ago ended up having dinner at La Gargote restaurant based on our tour guide's recommendation. La Gargote is a quaint little restaurant, great ambiance.  I ordered the homemade cannoli with rabbit and lamb.  It isn't an option I'd normally see on a menu here in the states (based on the restaurants I usually frequent) but since this was vacation, I wanted to try something different.  It was very good. I forget the type of sauce that was included, but the meat was shredded and extremely tender and the sauce complimented the meat perfectly. Our server was great!  He had a great sense of humor, was very attentive and patient with all of us ladies.  I believe he is the owner or son of the owner..  Either way, he made the dining experience even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food is really good! We tried the tuna and veal cutler! The sauce for tuna is just fantastic, I loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing French food. Great decor. Intimate atmosphere. Very polite and helpful staff. Salmon tartar is amazing."}
{"text":"Lovely, friendly, warm tiny place with such wonderful staff!  The food, wine (at perfect temp) and patrons are all great.  Lovely corner to stop in and have lunch!!"}
{"text":"Bad and discriminating service, the worst service I have ever met. They seated so called \"regular customers\" at priority and the old female servant lied about her mistakes in providing service on discrimination basis."}
{"text":"An unexpected \"find\" near Gibbys. I couldn't get into anywhere nearby so I went to this place. It's a pleasant cozy unpretentious and reasonable restaurant just off the busy tourist area. It's not grand but very romantic and food was tasty. The avocado salad was just right, which is not easy to do. Wine suggestion was excellent. Nice alternative to the busier touristy places one block away."}
{"text":"Sat outdoors on a beautiful first evening in Montreal. Perfect French experience, beautiful food and great warm service."}
{"text":"Great food, service and location. Definitely worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this restaurant on a not so cheap a first date some 15 years ago on the recommendation of an old friend living in the neighborhood. 

Seeing that they underwent a several month long renovation, I was curious to perhaps splurge and try them again upon re-opening. However, based on what happened on their \"grand opening\" day I am not sure if I will spend that kind of money there, with heaps of other choices - and of various International cuisines - around many corners.

I'm not a big fan of rants, so I'll try to summerize; I happened to see the side door opened, and gentleman prepping lettuce. I said something to the effect of - are you prepping for the re-opening? A waiter then appeared and offered to make me reservations. I was told there was no dress code - as I was not expecting to come and eat right then and there. While he was welcoming me to dine, I asked about the menu, and since it was only on the board out front, he verbalized and motioned - why don't you ask the Chef (he's right here).

With that I the Chef began reading off the evenings table d'hote - which admittedly sounded good. I was considering coming later on to be one of their first 2.0 diners. Then unfortunately, and with out any politeness to speak of, another man came in shoo'ed me away like I was some random streetwalker, and ironically said they had prep to do. 

Obviously the have prep to do, but next time figure out the situation before being (rude). Sure there must be some level of first night stress in his directness, but there are ways to say it better. Furthermore, I would never have come in if not invited - and purposely stayed at a distance until invited. 

Too bad I don't feel welcome anymore, in fact I feel put off. That  relationship way-back-when didn't workout, and so far this one never got a chance to begin. I hope they have respect for their patrons, since rudeness can cause unwanted reputations to form or be confirmed. 

I'm putting a 2 for the feeling of being put off. The Chef's menu did sound much more towards 5 stars. If somehow I get a welcome sign or the stars align, I'll take a chance on a second date.

Respectfully, I do wish them good luck with the opening."}
{"text":"Great patio spot in old montreal. Fresh and tasty seafood. Girlfriend and I shared the mussles - large portion. Great beer too. Feels like Europe eating there.."}
{"text":"What an experience! To travel and to enjoy a great meal after exploring the streets of Old Montreal. La Gargote did not disappoint. We walked up to the restaurant on a Friday afternoon, and we were immediately seated. Sammy (our waiter/proprietor) asked what drinks we'd like and we ordered the house Martini, that was to die for. Seriously this beverage was flat out tasty, savory and complimented all the food we ate. 

Sammy was great, he gave us the time to truly enjoy our meal, so that we savored every course and reflected on its tastes and flavors. Our meals included the daily special of veal flank steak with mushroom sauce, along with the pasta/shrimp in Ricard cream. Both dishes had my mother and I craving every last drop! 

We completed our meal with the three sampler creme brûlée (vanilla, blueberry and Triple-Sec Basil ) and a glass of port. This meal was an experience, more than that, it was a memory that my mother and I will always connect with when reminiscing about our time in Old Montreal. Thank you to all the staff at La Gargote, we'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I was unsure what to expect coming here. We booked our trip last minute, and there weren't a lot of reservations available on a Saturday night. Gargote had some mixed reviews, but we decided to give it a try. 
This place has an interesting ambience. It's definitely \"rustic\", which is a nice way of saying outdated :) I didn't love the decor inside, although I suppose it has a quaintness to it. The customers eating inside when we arrived definitely skewed towards the older. People were very casually dressed. 
We chose to sit outside despite it being a bit cool, just for a better ambience. I'm glad we did- it was really nice with the lights on the tree across the street. Our waiter was really great--friendly, helpful, and funny. We ordered a bottle of wine (burgundy, which was OK, nothing special) for $46, and tried both the escargot and foie grois appetizers. Both were good, but the escargot was the real winner--it was served with brie and bread, and the sauce was delicious. I would highly recommend it. 
For my entree I had half beef tartare and half salmon tartare (both had half portions listed as options on the menu, so I asked if I could combine). They were both really tasty, and larger portions than I expected. I liked the beef the most; it had a really nice spicy flavor, and it was very good with the salad it came served with. The salmon was also nice, and had a bit of a tang from the capers and (I think) jalapeno. 
My husband ordered the deer medallions, mostly out of the novelty of it (it's not something we are used to seeing on a menu). I thought it was pretty good, but it didn't blow me away. It came served with carrots and broccoli. 
As if that wasn't enough food, our waiter convinced us to try dessert :) We went with the creme brulee trio, and it was a winner. It comes with three small creme brulees: a triple sec and basil, a vanilla, and a blueberry. The blueberry was meh- the texture was too loose from the berries, and the flavor wasn't anything special. The vanilla was really, really good--a great example of classic creme brulee flavor and texture. But for me, the triple sec and basil really stole the show... what an interesting combination of flavors! I could have eaten three of just these, even as full as I was :) 
Overall we really enjoyed our experience here. It's worth noting that we were here quite a while-- about 3 hours--as service is what I'd describe as \"leisurely\" :) It was a really nice night since we had nowhere to be, but I'd recommend not coming here if you're in a rush :)"}
{"text":"La dernière fois que j'étais allé à la Gargotte ce devait être en 2003. Inchangée. Je n'y suis allé toujours que pour le lunch et voilà, j'ai eu envie d'y retourner, j'en avais gardé une image somme toute positive, mais j'y allais toujours entre collègues et j'ay avais du plaisir, mais je crois que cela ne dépendait pas du resto.

Si le lieu est toujours aussi charmeur je suis toujours aussi déçu du peu de choix en formule et des prix exhorbitants à la carte. Je me suis rabattu sur l'onglet qui était dur et les légumes vapeur tout simplement inacceptables en 2011. Le céleri rémoulade était bien mais c'est *du céléri rémoulade*... Mon invitée a eu les pâtes (je crois qu'elle est restée bloquée sur le petit nombre de choix), on a prix de l'eau pétillante et un café et bang! 65$ plus tard, on est sortis.

Pour le lunch, considérant ce qu'on a eu, c'est franchement décevant surtout que des alternatives dans le Vieux, il y en a à la pelle.

Je ne peux pas juger pour le soir, le rapport qualité-prix est peut-être meilleur. Je regardais la clientèle, dans la cinquantaine avancée, possiblement des habitués donc et j'imagine que nombre de touristes sont attirés par le cachet de l'endroit.

Pour ma part, j'y retournerai dans 7-8 ans peut-être..."}
