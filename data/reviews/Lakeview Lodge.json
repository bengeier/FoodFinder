{"text":"I booked this hotel for my daughters and I because it was close to family we were visiting. Upon check in I was charged for all 3 nights. We checked in the evening just before sunset. We opened the door to our room and the smell hit us first. We then noticed stains on the carpeting, TV remote held together with gray duct tape, inflatable mattress, long black hair through out the room, in the dresser top drawer a used washcloth and dirty tissue, the light above the bed did not work, the pull out sofa had a higher elevation on the feet than the head, a roach, when the blinds were closed you could still stand outside of the room and see the whole bed, coffee maker with no coffee or cups, and dirty shower curtain. As bad as it sounds I was still willing to stay there because of the proximity to our family. I contacted the hotel to request a sheet to put  over the window for privacy. The lady that brought the sheet advised me there were bear that come to the dumpsters at night, right outside of our room. At this point I called my daughters in. 
When we were showering that evening the water went out, no water.  I finally reached someone at the hotel and I was advised there was an electrical problem and they were working on it. We had water again about an hour later. At about 2am I woke up to what I can only describe as a very loud electrical sound. This went on for 2 hours keeping all three of us awake. I would have checked out at this point but the exterior was not lit well and could not see if there were any bears. We left at first light, when we could see if there were bears and again we had no water. 
I spoke with the owner Michelle Ketchem and told her of our experience. She advised me I would receive a refund. It's been 3 months and I still have not received $100 of the money I paid. This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had and would never recommend staying here."}
{"text":"The lodge has the BEST brunches ever! No matter what the buffet has in store, it is always on point. Practically gourmet. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. They have an omelet bar most weeks and Chelsea makes terrific omelettes and great conversation. Matt is a wonderful server, or family's personal favorite. He always remembers our usual drink orders and quirks and takes great care of us. I'm having him bartend my wedding that will be held there. Overall WONDERFUL place. :)"}
