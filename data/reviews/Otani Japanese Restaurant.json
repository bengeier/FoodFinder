{"text":"As it has an average of 4.5, we tried it for dinner in the dining room. Service was friendly but slow and it was really bad-we had to ask several times for multiple items. Food wasn't that good & sauces were strange. They didn't have the traditional 'yum yum' sauce or the traditional hibachi sauces-just an FYI. There are also several menu items that were not included in the 50% off nights but that's not specified in the menu. If you want hibachi, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"By far best sushi in Ohio. Everything is perfect. Food, ambience and service. First roll I had here was 10 years ago. Still going strong. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had Christmas dinner there earlier today. I had a great time, and really good food.
I had the privilege of dining with a Chinese family that explained the finer points to me about the sauces, translations, etcetera...
I know this is a Japanese restaurant, but it's Chinese owned, and much of the staff is Chinese. 
Don't let that bother you. Many of the Japanese places around Cle are actually ran by Chinese owners.
..Anyway, most people are scared of good maki rolls, let alone sashimi.
The family I dined with ordered for the whole table and what I got was a giant, delicious platter of sashimi, maki, and tempura.
We sat in the more private back room, not the hibachi side, so this was mostly a sushi fest.
There were a few separate complete meals ordered as well, but I'll start with the sushi.
The sashimi was salmon, scallops, white tuna, cold smoked tuna, yellowtail, and a couple others that I don't quite remember. Beautifully presented and delicious. It was a lot of sashimi. I've actually never eaten that much simple sashimi in one sitting before, and I've had a lot of sushi for a white dude. 
It was all perfectly chilled, and I could tell it was as fresh as sushi around Ohio is gonna get.
Something else noteworthy is the sides/pallet cleansers. The seaweed salad over radish noodle apparently comes standard with sushi platters. It's something most places don't do, but they do it very good here. Sometimes seaweed salad can be overly fishy or salty, but theirs was impressive. The pickled ginger is as good as you'll get anywhere( I look at pickled ginger with sushi, like coleslaw with smoked BBQ. It's important to have it right.)
A few maki rolls were ordered for the table. I was most impressed with the \"4.5\". I think it was the first roll I've had where raw clam was the best part.
The service was very good, and kept the tea pots and sauces coming.
One member of my party had hibachi steak brought over and it was cooked to the perfect medium as ordered. I, myself also ordered a spicy chicken dish. The portion for this was also huge. It was different from what I excepted. Whole fillets of lightly breaded chicken, rather than chunks of chicken drenched in sauce. The sauce for this dish actually came on the side. I really only ordered this as a side note, so I could have a meal for later and as of an hour ago, I know that was a wise choice... Be aware though, that their Chinese dishes are not what you will expect. They are prepared in a more Japanese style.
Maybe the fact that I was guest to an Asian family who ordered for me, and ordered so many items that it would be impossible to not enjoy the meal- factors in to how much I loved it, but aside from that, it was some of the most impressive sashimi I've ever had in Cleveland.   
If you ace the sashimi, it's because you serve good sushi. I had a great time, and will be back. 
Also, forgot to mention that the decor is very stylish and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"On a recent visit during lunch hour, I ordered the chicken/shrimp hibachi combination. I was seated at a table alone, not a problem. While the chef prepared my meal, I did not receive a show with the fire/jokes oh well. My egg was burned and in 2-3 chunks, the chef actually flipped some shrimp onto his greasy and dirty apron and pushed it back on the grill. Gross, I told him to remake it ..still horrid. Do not eat at this dump."}
{"text":"This was so disgusting. I have eaten at SO many sushi restaurants and have never had sushi this nasty. Id prefer to get sushi from the gas station. It had NO flavor. Is extremely over priced. & I was charged for dipping sauce!! Not .50 but 2.00 each for DIPPING sauce! I will NEVER eat here again. Ever. Dont waste your money!"}
{"text":"I have to give them 4 stars just for lunch alone. Prices are definitely reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

Haven't been to dinner in quite a while because of the long wait and the soft drinks always seem to be flat. Not to say that a flat soft drink would keep me from the place."}
{"text":"Had not been here in years and don't know if I will go back.

We had a party of 3, made reservations for 6:30 Saturday.  After waiting and waiting and threatening to leave, we were finally seated at about 7:10 p.m.  Don't understand the sense of reservations when the staff doesn't seem to care.  Waited almost 10 minutes for someone to come to our hibachi table; we told our server our disappointment and frustration in the unacceptable wait.  Took almost another 10 minutes for the hibachi chef to get to the table.  My yakiniku was bland."}
{"text":"Went to Otani for 1/2 price sushi, the sushi is as good as Sushi Rock or Pacifie East. But the service was pretty bad we have to wait about 10 mins before the server come to take our order.Wait about another hour before we get out sushi by that time my kids was ready to go home.Never get out tea or water refill. Wait anther 10 mins to get out check."}
{"text":"On Tuesdays they do half price hibachi, Wednesdays they do half price sushi. Hibachi is good, sushi is great. Good menu, knowledgeable and friendly staff, fun atmosphere. Great for dates! This is our favorite Japanese restaurant ink the area by far."}
{"text":"Went a week ago to celebrate my mother's 89 B-day. There were six of us  - we were seated promptly at a Hibachi table.  The waitress was very attentive and the chef put on a fine show. The food portions were huge especially the rice and veggies. I think they have them portioned out for groups of eight so our smaller group got more to eat. Great fun place but  be prepared to walk away with a very full stomach.  I had the shrimp and steak which was  delicious. The ginger chicken is great too. Highly recommended for a small group but if you are just a couple  or two couples they will seat you with another small group."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal at Otani's.  The service was extremely slow for dinner and the food was sub par.  I was reminded why I haven't visited this establishment in over a year.  I won't be going back until I forget how bad this experience was."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Otani I ordered the seafood ramen and the ume sushi, and I enjoyed both of these even though the service was really damn slow. The second time I went with some friends, and we got two orders of sushi, which we didn't know the price until we got the bill, because the waiter was picking out the most expensive things when I was asking for a recommendation. We also ordered salads and pork ramen for all of us.

The pork ramen was good at first, but after a couple of spoonfuls I realized the trauma that ISIS victims went through. The sushi wasn't remotely as good as Giant Eagle sushi or even some homeade sushi made by some white uncle. The salad didn't have the traditional ginger dressing, and instead had a white dressing that tasted like some spoiled sour cream mixed with the tobacco swallowed excrement of the employees there."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic - but be prepared to be ignored at the door. Last time we were there we waited 5 minutes for someone to greet us, but gave up. No wonder there was hardly anyone there"}
{"text":"Favorites . Ocean roll !! Full or flavor. It's a must try. Everyone who works here is amazing especially the owner Janet ! They will take good care of u. They remember what you like each time you come in. :)"}
{"text":"I had lunch there on a Saturday. My husband and I sat at the sushi counter. Female sushi chef.  The cucumber kani was one of the best I ever had. The eel maki with sauce was wonderful. White fish maki okay and spicy tuna not so good. Overall decent sushi. service was meh....I still prefer suhei for sushi."}
{"text":"They have really good sushi, but they're a little pricey so you can't go every day. If you like this place, you'll LOVE TJ Buffet on Mayfield Rd - look it up here on Yelp and read my review."}
{"text":"The fried rice during hibachi wasn't cooked long enough. Our chef rushed through it. The steak we requested medium rare was over medium. The lobster was over cooked and tasted like I was licking a dirty cook top. I didn't care for their white sauce. The general quality of the ingredients used was poor. 

If you want GREAT hibachi at the same cost please save your money and go to Wasabi in Beachwood. Way better."}
{"text":"One of the best in greater Cleveland, OH.  Half price sushi Wednesday 5:00 'til 7:00."}
{"text":"Food is Amazing! The sushi was wonderful. Definitely better than wasabi but much smaller and intimate."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" choice when I want a \"cook at the table\" Asian dining experience. Much better than the near by Benihana."}
{"text":"What can I say.. This is the best Japanese restaurant I know of. A Cleveland tradition.."}
{"text":"My favorite hibachi & sushi restaurant in Northeast Ohio. The servers are always attentive & kind and the food is excellent. Many hibachi restaurants have a hard time offering consistent high quality meals, but Otani has never disappointed me! They often have restaurant.com gift certificates available, so I'd recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious sushi rolls I've ever had, the Papa Jalepeno! However the meal was less than impressive, I've had better Japanese at the local mall food court. Basically it consisted of vegetables and noodles swimming in a sauce that was average at best. If I happen to go back, I would definitely stick with just the sushi. The ambience was not bad but not great either. The server was very attentive at first and then seemed to disappear at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Cleveland! Love love love it here. Small bar and small sushi bar but fantastic restaurant seating and amazing food. Big place too as half is hibachi and plenty of parking. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First of all, I love Japanese food, usually go for sushi, but have had many enjoyable hibachi experiences at other restaurants.  I've been to Otani for lunch and dinner in the past, but never for hibachi.  My other dining experiences were always quite positive.

Unfortunately, my lunch with coworkers a few weeks ago was different.  I get that the hibachi chef's are there not only to cook, but also to entertain -- they always do.  I love to laugh, I am not uptight, and rarely offended.  This guy, however, our chef that is, only made me laugh an uncomfortable chuckle, but mostly just made me want to go back to work.

His jokes were inappropriate for anyone, especially a group of coworkers and the couple seated with us.  He kept asking where everyone was from....  when it came to my two African-American coworkers, after each of their answers he questioned... \"really?  I would have thought Africa -hahahahahah\"  REALLY??  Are you serious????  My work friends laughed, yes, but they also looked at this guy like he was nuts, which I certainly hope he was. 

The other thing that is typically fun about hibachi is the \"tricks\" performed by the chef.  This guy was just as good as others I've seen, but for an added bonus would show his great skill at aiming for anything and being able to get the food to land there.  Yes, of course, our plates as is expected....  but also....  I got a piece of chicken in my water glass, my boss got some egg in his....  everyone got some type of food item floating in their beverage.

Personally, I found this disgusting.  I have a food thing though.  I don't like certain things to touch, I can't watch or participate in food fights, etc....  But, since this guy does this all the time (and I am told it's part of his normal routine) shouldn't the waitress be waiting to provide you a fresh drink????  Well, the answer is apparently no, as I never received a new water.

The food itself was okay.  Nothing special.  Maybe tainted in flavor by my poor experience.  

My advice is to go here for dinner on the regular dining side, but unless you are a fan of slapstick humor and inappropriate jokes I would go elsewhere for hibachi."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My family has been coming here for almost 10 years. The food is always good, my absolute favorite is Crazy Russian, Phoenix and Volcano rolls. They really have good quality ingredients. Not the cheapest place to go, but definitely a must try for both sushi and hibachi. Yes, service could be a little slow, but the atmosphere and the food always balance it out."}
{"text":"i came here for 1/2 price sushi night, or i should say that the people who took me here did.

i've been to japan 8 times, and i've lived in a good sushi town (seattle) for 4 years.  this sushi is average at best, and overpriced for what you get.

the people i was with did not seem to notice that everyone who worked there was speaking cantonese to each other, but i did.  if you're looking for an authentic \"japanese experience,\" you will not get that here.

i was told that the first 2 rolls i tried to order were not part of the 1/2-off special, even though they were not on the \"special roll\" menu which is exempt from the deal.  the third roll i tried to order was sold out.  okay.

finally i managed to get a few things, but i was underwelmed.  even the green tea i ordered was mediocre and came in a kettle that you would never see in a true japanese restaurant.  

maybe this place was great in the 70's/80's when the first generation of owners were there.  but i see a place that seems designed to take uncultured and well-off eastsiders for a ride.  i guess they enjoy it, but i didn't.

this place would last about a month in a city like seattle.  i didn't try the hibachi so i can't comment on that, but maybe the cooked food is better."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this, as the servers and staff are very nice. But, this is not Japanese food. We had the Pork Katsu and vegetable ramen. The Katsu was breaded with what I could only describe as italian style bread crumbs. I mean, the taste was fine, for a pork cutlet. Not Katsu. As for the ramen, it was completely lacking in flavor. The one plus, the bill before the tip came up to less than $20.

Maybe my experience would have been better if I would have tried their sushi. But, I do not think I will be going back to give it a chance."}
{"text":"First time here and was disappointed...
We got one cup of orange juice that was moldy....seems like expired for a long time, I don't know why the waitress didn't smell it and check the expiration date.
Otherwise the service is good,the waitress is friendly and patient.
Afraid of the food's quality here,wont be back."}
{"text":"I rarely dislike a Japanese Steakhouse, but I definately did not care for this one. There were a couple red flags right away that made me think I had chosen poorly on dinner options for the night. First was that it was a small place located in a strip mall with poor outside curb appeal. Second and more importantly, I came there on a Friday night at 630 for hibachi and there were about 4 other people in the whole place. 

The server did not speak English very well, but she was polite enough. Drinks were ok. The best part about the place is their sushi. They did a nice job with that. The hibachi chef must have been brand new because he was the most boring and bland chef I have ever had. The place looked dirty and not well kept and the food was so-so at best other than the sushi. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going here  with my family for over 10 years. Otanis is one of my favorite sushi places in Cleveland. I enjoy a lot of their rolls, the crazy Russian is one of my favorites. Great Chirashi too."}
{"text":"Absolute ripoff! The food couldn't have been less fresh, and the portions were the tiniest of tiny. Our $4 crab Rangoon came with 3 pieces, and my bubble tea had crunchy, unfresh boba. 

We were so offended we didn't even make it to dinner- we just ordered a completely expensive, 6 piece roll and got the check. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have."}
{"text":"I stopped in Otani for lunch while waiting for traffic to thin out on 271 recently.  As my eyes adjusted from the sunny day outside I was happy to find that I had entered a cozy space.  The gloss black chairs, low lighting and beaded curtains made me feel as if I was being naughty by nipping off for lunch on a weekday!

I was warmly greeted by a waitress and sat back to peruse the menu.  I ordered three appetizers for lunch:  the crab rangoon (okay, but only four of them), the fried tofu (amazing and filling), and the dumplings (not fresh and quite hard on the outside).

Some girls next to me ordered the lunch hibachi, however I never heard their food being grilled.  By the time I left they were eating their lunches but I don't know where it was cooked.  Although the menu lists \"lunch hibachi\" I didn't actually witness Hibachi chefs grilling food.  This, is a mystery...

I read the sushi menu but nothing denoted that the rolls that were spicy/not spicy.  I like spicy rolls with cream cheese and crunchy, deep fried crust.  I couldn't tell from the menu what would meet my expectations - and sadly the waitstaff seemed slightly unequipped to deal with an in-depth discussion in English.

The meal I had was delicious and the hot sake was priced slightly below other area restaurants.

The decor may be kitschy but walking through a beaded curtain makes me feel like I'm the star in a 1970s B-movie."}
{"text":"Best hibachi/sushi place in Cleveland. Good prices, great portion sizes, friendly staff. Half price hibachi on Tuesday, half price sushi on Wednesday. I go here once a week and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"When I write this I don't mean to be rude. I'm just a half Japanese that loves ramen. The ramen at Otani isn't \"Japanese\" at all. I feel like they put noodles and thin broth and threw in some egg. I was pretty disappointed. The broth definitely needs more flavor. The chef needs to take a course on how to cook meat again cause the pork belly was way too fatty and I felt like I was chewing on rubber. Japanese pork belly is meant to be soft. 
My friends would like to add that the teriyaki was good and the lobster balls as well."}
{"text":"Great little place hidden in the back of Golden Gate Plaza.  We first came for a meal with friends in December, and enjoyed a good show and good food.  Have returned a couple more times and the food has always been good.  Really like the wasabi sauce they use."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen of times for lunch and each visit was good to great. The restaurant isn't too busy during lunch hours and I'd be in and out in less than an hour. Hibachi may take a bit of time if they choose to wait for other customers. Dining room service is quick if you order any of their lunch specials (all under $10). 

I've also been here on several occasions for half off hibachi (Tuesday) and half off sushi (Wednesday). It's a great deal on half days. Hibachi dinners offer a lot of food and comes with miso soup and salad. You also get a few pieces of shrimp as an appetizer (which you don't get for lunch hibachi). I usually order a steak & scallops combo for dinner. The steaks are usually cooked nicely and the scallops were fresh and non-rubbery. Be aware that whatever you're wearing to hibachi will be doused with the smell of grease and soy!

I enjoy going here with a group of people and its fun to watch the chefs perform. My favorite by far is Ray. No only is he great at cooking, he's the most entertaining. He's also spot on when it comes to cooking steaks. Sushi here is quite good, but if I were to pay full price, there are definitely better options near by."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Otani's in Mayfield with my family for many years. I really enjoy the sushi there. Out of all the Japanese restaurants I've been to, in my opinion Otani's makes the best version of the Volcano roll."}
{"text":"Otanis has been one of my favorites restaurants for my entire life.  Many anniversaries and birthdays have been celebrated here.  Yes- the service needs improvement I also feel that the shrimp used to be better then it is now. And yes I miss the best hibachi chef ever that greeted everyone as Boss but I still give it a 5 out of 5 for several reasons.  Their salad dressing is the best!  It is creamy and to die for.  But the BEST thing about Otanis that really sets it apart from other hibachi is their white sauce.  Unlike those other bums that have yum yum sauce Otanis has the heavenly white sauce.  I have been trying to figure out what is in it for 28 years.  I think it is a mixture of wasabi, mayo and oil.  No wonder it is so good!  It has a cold like spiciness to it that cannot be beat.  I also think their fried rice is better than any other hibachi place around.  Yet another thing that sets Otanis apart is their sesame chicken.  First it actually have sesame seeds on it and a lot of them.  The sesame chicken is made with dark meat and it is juicy and flavorful.  If dark meat is to your thing you can get breast but the dark meat is so much better.  I have been to many, many other hibachi restaurant (it is kind of a hobby of mine)  but still find Otanis to be the best hibachi ever."}
{"text":"Consistency. That's what you get at Otani's. Fresh high quality sushi. Great service from veteran servers who recognize you, and a smile. Swift kitchen orders, even faster sushi bar delivery. Overall the experience is always wonderful. There are other spots more trendy than this, but as a staple in the area Otani's remains my personal favorite. Try the Tako Salad. Enjoy a bento box. Everything is spot on!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, most recently because of a coupon.  So I'm going to do an apples-to-apples comparison to my favorite Japanese restaurant on Cleveland's east side: Shinano (in Solon).  

Sushi's OK, nothing to write home about.  Miso soup and salad were adequate.

Shrimp tempura is one of the best ways to judge a Japanese restaurant as there really is no variation in recipe (either you do it right or you don't).  Its simplicity reveals how well the restaurant focuses on ingredient quality, cooking oil cleanliness, and technique.  Unfortunately, Otani's shrimp tempura was oil-soaked and caused it to be mushy - a real no-no! (Batter should be light, airy, and crispy).  The shrimp itself did not taste fresh - real pungent in flavor indicative of low-quality or old shrimp.

On this visit, we also had the Unaju (broiled teriyaki eel on rice) - again, although very rich in flavor - a very simple dish.  It was actually quite good.

Bottom line: this place is borderline OK (on the low end) for me, nothing special.  I opted for 3 stars (instead of 2) because not everything is that awful and I would probably find myself going here more often if there wasn't better competition just down the road.  So, would I go here again?  Nah, especially since Shinano is not far from here and does not compromise quality and freshness."}
{"text":"I stopped on a Sunday night to get take-out on my way home. The service was fast and friendly. The man at the front desk was kind and knowledgeable; the woman who wandered through was also very personable.

I ordered the ocean roll and two pieces of white tuna sashimi. The roll was flavorful and delicious (it had a lot of \"substance\" if that makes sense... I was very full from this meal). The sashimi was lightly seared, which I thought was a little odd, but I enjoyed the new experience. I was also delighted at the quality and size of the cuts.

The presentation of my takeout was beautiful, so I can only imagine what it looks like when you dine in the restaurant.

They serve a full range of fare, including Japanese curry which I think is rather hard to find in Cleveland. They close for a brief period during the day, so be sure to look ahead at hours.

I'm a bit baffled by the recent negative reviews; my only complaint would regard the parking lot which has the narrow spaces I find annoying, but I can't blame the restaurant for that. I'd happily come back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Otani's for more than 20 years. Great lunch specials, Half Price Sushi Wednesdays (5-7 PM), great service. Quality of the fish is tremendous, best salmon skin in the area, good and crispy with just enough meat and natural oils. I have turned many a fan with that hand roll alone. The presentations are always wonderful, and I never miss a chance for Otani's if someone has a craving for sushi. A must for anyone's go to list."}
{"text":"Great food - the best scallops I've ever had - and a LOT of fun! I've only ever tried the hibachi side but it was well worth the price. I'd recommend this to anyone! And go for the fried rice - it's so good when it's so fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm very indecisive in whether to give Otani's a 3 or a 4, but because of their HALF-OFF Hibachi Tuesdays and HALF-OFF sushi Wednesdays,  I decided a 4 was a better rating for this restaurant. 

I've never had a bad experience at Otani's and I must say, every chef I've had there always performs their show like it's their first show ever! The chefs have such energy and the waitresses are so friendly that it's hard not to come back here again. 

The hibachi side is your usual hibachi food  It's really good and for half price, it's even more worth it!! The food portions are huge and they have the best salad dressing (that I still can't name what dressing it is). The other thing I love about their hibachi is their wasabi sauce that goes so well with their seafood!

Then, the sushi/chinese food side.. this might be the reason I hesitated to give Otani's a 4. The chinese food isn't that authentic and other than the hibachi as an attraction, their chinese menu and flavors aren't memorable enough to make me think of this restaurant when i'm craving some sushi/chinese food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my dad. It was his choice, I was trying to push Jersey Mikes but he wanted Otani! Otani it was. Started out with a fresh salmon and avocado roll. It was perfect! We both ordered chicken, shrimp and beef. The miso soup was good, and the salad just plain iceberg with some ginger/mayo dressing. Pretty standard. The meal was a pretty good portion of rice veggies and protein. We both finished it. I put some chili paste on mine as I have to eat spicy food! The hibachi chef did a decent job, he was the more mellow one. I noticed that they have 1/2 price drinks on Thursday. Did not feel like drinking but sushi and drinks is always a dangerous combination for me. My rankings 
1. Sexy time 
2. Good sleep 
3. Drinks and Sushi 
4. 125 MPH on a sport bike with a cutie on the back (in the old days)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this establishment ever since i was brought here as a kid for special occasions.  Now they have HALF-OFF Hibachi Tuesdays and HALF-OFF sushi Wednesdays - which are UNSURPASSED in the world of Japanese cuisine.  You simply will NOT find a better deal than this, and that alone wins them 4 stars. 

However, their sushi is always well prepared and delicious...Though it is some of the same fare you can get else where.  Its not like there's a million ways to prepare raw salmon after all.  Their Volcano sushi is really good and unique tho.  

I still have not found a restaurant that makes Miso Soup HALF as good as these guys, its simply amazing.  Their Ginger salad appetizers are good unless you don't like a lot of dressing, and the mushroom soup is not bad either.  

If you enjoy Sake, they have a relatively good value for $6.95 a bottle I think, and personally i think its great.  Half the time there, if you have sake in front of you, the chefs will offer you free sake shots / refill your bottle sometimes for free... A huge plus in my book.  

I have had EVERY thing on their hibachi menu and never been disappointed.  Their white sauce is great with seafood and their brown sauce is great with everything, especially dumped on rice.  

Most of the time there's enough leftover for lunch leftovers the next day, and the cheerfulness of the entire staff is contagious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered my food for delivery and it was very good. However, I had ordered yum yum sauce on the side and a worker called me and asked me if yum yum sauce was, ' the brown sauce, the white sauce, or the pink sauce?'. Maybe it's wrong of me but I assumed a worker at a hibachi restaurant would know which sauce I was referring to. I asked for the pink sauce because that's the closest to what yum yum looks like. Very wrong sauce. Nice people, decent food, but not the best experience."}
{"text":"Service was bad. The rice and chicken looked and tasted like it was rewarmed and not fresh. We were overcharged, probably because the person was new and needed more supervision. We will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp udon noodle. I was surprised to find only two fried shrimps with several big chopped fried potatoes, broccoli without any flavor in a separate bowl. Another bowl is served with noodle soaked in water mixed with  soybean source . A small bowl is served with soybean source. The taste is totally far away from delicious. The price on menu is $8.50. But I was charged with $8.95. All of these does not deserve this price."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and got the seafood ramen.  Very disappointed.  The dish did not include real ramen noodles, but what seemed like spaghetti noodles.  The broth did not have a depth of flavor, and just seemed like a soy sauce based broth.  It did have a good amount of shrimp and scallops, but the dish did not match the display out front which had vegetable and mushroom pieces."}
{"text":"Great Service and the best Sushi in Cleveland!!! 10 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I went here with a date the other night because I wanted sushi and easy parking. The first thing the hostess said to us was \"happy hour is over.\" Maybe I looked cheap. Fair enough, I was getting sushi at a strip mall. The waitress was friendly but slow. The saving grace of the place is that you can order small servings of sushi instead of a whole roll,  so it's good if you want to try things out without making a huge investment in something you might hate. Still, I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"They have the best sushi and ramen noodles in Cleveland! I love the Sunshine rolls, Hurricane rolls are good too. I have taken many of my friends and colleagues to Otani, and they all loved it!"}
{"text":"Ray is one of the best hibachi chefs I've ever had. I have been coming here for over 25 years and it truly is the best hibachi place out there. Their salad dressing is so good and unique! Plus on Tuesday's they do half off hibachi. Can't beat the price OR the taste!"}
{"text":"The hibachi area needs a good cleaning and they filled in the tip amount on the credit card receipt.  The hibachi food isn't as good as it used to be.  This used to be the place we came for special occasions but not anymore."}
{"text":"Between 3 and 4 stars for me.

This would be a solid 4 if not for the RIDICULOUSLY LONG WAIT to get my food. There was almost no one in the restaurant that day but for some reason the food took FOREVER. Supposedly this is a common complaint with this restaurant.

Food is pretty good, a little salty but much superior to a lot of the other Japanese food in Cleveland. The prices on the lunch specials cannot be beat."}
{"text":"I stopped by Otani's for lunch after a hearing a glowing recommendation from a coworker. Needless to say, that person has lost all credibility in my book. 

There were hardly any people in the restaurant and there was a kind of creepy vibe. I sat on the non hibachi side and it seemed pretty run down. I wasn't in the mood for sushi (nor could the waitress tell me if I could get any meat free sushi), so I got a plain old vegetable stir fry. Or as I called it - onions with a side of onions. Lunch FAIL. I'm not the greatest cook, but I can toss more than a couple types of vegetables together to make a stir fry. Who wants a plate full of onions?! (unless you're eating onion rings or something, but that's a whole different kind of deal) 

I have literally no desire to go back to Otani's ever again. I'm giving it two stars because my friend seemed to enjoy his sushi and soup."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I visited this Restaurant. In the past I remember it being a great place, but after my recent visit I was sad to see that it isn't any more. It was dirty and dingy looking. The food was terrible. The egg in the fried rice was brown and rubbery. My chicken was all fat, and tasteless. After I left I got sick and so did at 3 others in my group. It is sad to see what has happened to this place. The one positive was the service was good, everyone was quite friendly."}
{"text":"I go every week!  Excellent fresh fish, Fong is the best sushi chef I know!  He will even make specialized rolls if he knows your taste well enough!  Best service I've ever had at a restaurant, even the other customers are consistently friendly and engaging with other customers.  It's my way of getting a great lunch and escaping the real world for just a little while.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

Hint:  Try the shrimp avocado salad!"}
{"text":"I remember coming to the Christmas parties here when I was young, a lot of fun!

A while back I remember eating here with a friend, they got a sushi boat and I got pineapple & pork fried rice, inside of a pineapple fruit, very lovely. 

It is a lot of fun here, might come back to try hibachi or their special half off sushi night."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with some co-workers on a recent trip up to the Cleveland area for work.  They all seemed to like this place and their overall lunch concept of sushi and hibachi (without the tableside performance) seemed like a good idea.  The food was plentiful with the chicken and steak hibachi combo, but it took forever for a server to come take drink and food orders once we were seated.  The restaurant was not overly busy for lunch so I'm not sure why there was such a delay.  It also seemed to take quite a while to get checks and cash out and a simple lunch took over 90 minutes."}
{"text":"A staple for us when we are looking for a hibachi especially on the there half off night. The chefs here are pretty entertaining. As far as the sushi side goes, they are good, we have had better in the area but again there half off night is good when we remember it. Food is a solid 4 stars but the staff can be disappointing sometimes and hard to understand."}
{"text":"I like Otani a lot better than Sushi Rock

Better food, better service.

They also have a half-price sushi menu on Wednesday from 5-7, as well as a half price hibachi menu on Tuesday from 5-7."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi I've ever tasted. The show part of the cooking was weak. The filet was flavorless.   The rice was meh. The noodles were just plain awful.  And even the miso and vegatables were bad. So disappointing cuz the atmosphere is really cute."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from a hooker whom my friend had in the car with us on a trip to his mom's house. After hearing what his mother had said about this place I decided to give it a shot. I took my thirteen kids and my three wives there. It was a very enjoyable place except for an angry Asian guy yelling at me and my family. The people who worked there were kinda rude, too. Like, they all had their eyes closed and wouldn't look at me...?!?! They were speaking some incoherent language to each other, probably talking shit about my one wife who kinda looks like that one fat girl in Mean Girls. You know, the one who wore the sandals or whatever. Either way, the food wasn't bad but the people were just flat out mean. I don't appreciate people who won't give me direct eye contact and won't tell me things right to my face. I am disappointed."}
{"text":"The Prices aren't matching the quality of the food. Make the drive to pacific east, trust me."}
{"text":"The staff were very polite and accommodating, and the chef was lively and put on a great show for the kids. However, the food was somewhat bland and they didn't serve traditional \"yum yum\" sauce like you find at similar restaurants. They also got my order wrong (chicken instead of steak). The prices were the same or higher than comparable establishments, yet the food was not as good."}
{"text":"Second time coming to Otani's, my first being the Hibachi side, this time I hit the traditional Japanese.  I came in expecting a 4 star experience and left feeling good with my choice for dinner with 3 other friends.

We ordered a bottle of saki and 2 sushi rolls.  I had asked the sushi chefs what they recommended and which fish was the freshest, they happily told me to go for the tuna.  YUMM!  Each person at the table absolutely loved the sushi.  I personally thought it was good - great  knowing that I have had better but considering that we didn't come for just sushi, it was a nice surprise.  

We also ordered spring rolls and crab rangoons.  The rangoons were made with real crab and packed lots of flavor.  Spring rolls also were good, not overly greasy,  seemed to me that they were prepped recently.

Dinner I went with the Shabu Shabu for two.  I probably wouldn't go for this particular dish again.  Everything comes raw or blanched and you need to cook your own food in a boiling broth.  It was definitely fun in a hot pot kind of way, but by no means did it match up to the flavor and experience of a true hot pot.  So considering it was my first time and with my expectations bordering around 'I can say I tried it', I really thought it was more fun then fabulous.  My friends dishes were great though.  However, hate me for it, but I can't remember what they had because I was too into my Shabu to even notice.  I did try them though.

The waitress provided each of us with a departing gift in the form of a free saki shot.  Great way to end an interesting night.  Everyone had fun, food was good, sushi surprised us, and we all left feeling satisfied.  We will be back again.

Keep an eye out for restaurant.com and mailers.  Otani usually does a buy one get one or $$ off hibachi meals and dinners on the traditional side.  Food always tastes better when it comes half off!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Otani for over 20 years and unfortunately in recent years it's gone down hill. On a recent visit, we ordered a kid's meal with appetizers hoping for it to arrive first. Well, it arrived an hour later...after all the adult dinners. The waiter claimed thinly sliced steak takes a long time to cook. Really?!! And then, the kid's steak dinners- emphasis on kid - was more onions than steak. 

The waiter disappeared for long stretches and we literally had to track him down around the restaurant to get out bills. He'd run away from the table before we could get a word out. He didn't discount the drinks like he was supposed to but at that point we were too tired and annoyed to ask him to fix it. And at that point, it doesn't even matter if the food is good or not because the service sucks so much."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service during lunch hour. Got seated with my family and waited at least ten minutes without anyone stopping by to greet and get drink orders even though the restaurant was mostly empty. Decided to leave the restaurant so I can't comment on the food taste/quality."}
{"text":"I've had Hibachi in Boston, Denver, Phoenix and Cleveland.  Otani can hold it's own.  The wait can be very long, get here early.

Among the standouts here are the salad dressing and sauces for the meats.  For Hibachi the prices are fair and if you're going to spring for Hibachi - make it Otani.  You'll get a decent show and very good food.

Great place for groups.  If you come with kids ask for a table with other kids if possible and ask for a chef that has flourish.  Of course, don't come with kids until they can control themselves in a manner befitting a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch.  We ordered dumpling app.  Hubby had lunch special bowl. Both had miso soup, I had pickled veggies and crab roll.  

Food good enough, but perhaps not stellar that one would expect to meet price point.  Our lunch came to $47.00 before tip. 

Problem though with communication. No disrespect, but our server had very, very limited English skills. Better than my Japanese language skills, but perhaps a different position would be better. With lunch bowl special, I was trying to ascertain if this was similar to the Korean bi bim bop. Description led that way, but not sure.  Response was a shrug.  Note to self...it is not anything like bi bim bop.  Asked what veggies came with pickled veggie app, she was unable to answer. Asked for crab roll to be made spicier with perhaps some yum yum sauce or something. Got a nod, but no sauce.  

So...food not bad, pricy, service ...they try but language barrier puts them behind the eight ball. 

Sorry, but for the same price point I will go to shuhei."}
{"text":"The happy hour is good, the sushi is good, the hibachi is good, but the service needs some serious attention."}
{"text":"Food was cool...the service wasn't the greatest in the beginning but it got better towards the end. They give you a lot of food with the hibachi specials which is really great!"}
{"text":"Tonight, I ordered take-out for a co-worker and I from Otani.  I ordered the Tiger Roll and the Kraby Roll.  Upon arrival, our sushi was ready for pickup.  When I was given the total, $34.50, I asked if we could separate the checks, because we were paying with our corporate credit cards.  I was told that the $34.50 was for my two rolls!  Wow!  Most expensive sushi I've ever bought!

Anyway, it was fresh and delicious.  I couldn't decipher if the caviar atop the rolls was real, but it was good.  The caviar wasn't extraordinarily salty, which is what I would expect of real caviar.  I have to admit though, I've only had caviar once or twice before and I wouldn't know real from Air-Soft pellets!

Despite the exorbitant price, the sushi was good.  This was the first time I've tried sushi at Otani and I was pleased.  I guess because it was dinner time the prices increase by 50%.  Hope my company agrees to pay the bill!  At least I have lunch for tomorrow because the rolls were much bigger than expected.

I've eaten here many times for lunch and once for dinner.  Someday, I'll have to try their hibachi."}
{"text":"Wednesday, 1/2 off sushi day! Arrived at 6:30 pm. Tables were all taken, but we were able to sit at the bar right away. It was actually cool to see the chefs make the sushi right in front of us.

We got blue ribbon, rainbow, and yellow tail nigiri-sushi. Blue ribbon is something you expect from typical Japanese restaurants, though delicious. 

But rainbow and yellow tail nigiri-sushi! What made them special were the sashimis on top of the rice. These are kept really cold, soft, fresh, and THICK. By far the thickest sashimis I've seen on the sushi. Just a wonderful experience.

And I only paid $20 for the dinner! Amazing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. The food was prepared with far too much salt and our table, the rail and the back of our seats were covered in stickiness.
I understand that the nature of hibachi cooking will cause oil to be in the air but the surfaces should be clean. I was very uncomfortable and unable to sit back in my seat because I didn't want to get the sticky oil residue on me.
It's pretty upsetting to spend over $100 for a meal that was too salty and where we couldn't sit comfortably.  We do not recommend this location & won't be back.
The 2 stars are for the friendly staff only."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why this is rated lower.   It looks like the recent reviews were good so we tried it out.   We sat in the dining side because my husband wanted sushi.   The prices are high for hibachi, but they have good choices for other things.   I got chicken soba noodles.   It was excellent.  My husband reports his sushi was very good and fresh.   The rolls appeared to have more interesting than normal.

The service was excellent and attentive.   I would encourage people to try it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland. I definitely recommend the dynamite roll and the shrimp avacado salad!"}
{"text":"I always say that Otani's is for people who aren't familiar with real Japanese food. The food tastes good and the service is fine, but dishes that I like aren't offered. I also think they're overpriced."}
{"text":"It seems like a place that's struggling to survive, and has raised prices rather than fix the problems. I've been there very occasionally across 15 years and tonight will have been the last time. 

The sushi prices are high ($3.50 for a single piece of e.g. Maki sushi) and I think that's way higher than they used to be. I went with my family because I thought it would be tasty food at a reasonable price. The sushi was tasty. But the rest of our food was just average, and the service was very poor - slow and inattentive, and she seemed frustrated with our questions. The menus (plastic laminate) were strongly smelly, like some sort of cleaning product. TVs were on over the sushi bar, and in a nearly-empty restaurant they seated another family right next to us. Overall we were very disappointed and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here it has now been over 1 hour since my order for sushi was placed. I had to stop a waitress to get out mushroom soup that should have came an hour ago. Do not come here. The half price is not worth the 2 hour dinner duration. As the food is good. There service is terrible.  They speak very broken English and make it so u don't get confused and just nod and say ok. Ughhhh I want my food!!!

Update 1 hour and 13 minute. I swear they forgot our order and when we questioned them they just acted stupid. 
Finally left after 2.5 hours. Ughhh waste of a Wednesday"}
{"text":"My second time there; I guess I forgot to review the first time. I wasn't too impressed the first time around. The service wasn't great. Plus we ordered their special sushi and the roles were soggy and were falling apart.
The second time experience was better. We got the regular roles and they were pretty good. Their fish is fresh, which is always a big plus. 
They are also, as far as I know, the only place around that serves Pho (the Vietnamese noodle soup), which is awesome on a cold snowy day. But just wish they had a wider selection of Pho on the menu.
One noticeable minus - their miso soup tastes like that instant paste stuff; really not worth getting.
Otherwise, nice place and should try their Habachi grill at some point."}
{"text":"This place is remarkable with the decor and the service. It's more authentic than any other hibachi restaurant I've been in and I've worked at 2 and visit many. We had Michelle today and she was very friendly and attentive. I went during lunch with my boyfriend. We had shrimp and shrimp and scallops. The bill only came to about $30 and the value was incredible. No noodles like Benihana or Wasabi but none were needed. I prefer the fried rice anyway. The light wasabi sauce blows the heavy yum yum sauce out of the water. I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a while now. Sushi happens to be very consistent and great tasting. I prefer to sit at a regular table and not bump elbows with a stranger. Very good mushroom soup and great speciality rolls."}
{"text":"We just moved from San Francisco and tried to find a good Japanese food in Cleveland. We gave this restaurant a try because of the review on YELP.  

We both agreed that it was the worse Japanese food we've ever had. It was not authentic and OVERPRICE. The food quality was bad and even worse compared to the price. The service was also bad. Our waitress had no idea about Japanese food.  We thought she was Chinese.

Believe me... Don't waste your time and money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to golden gate plaza for the bike shop then got hungry, really wanted to try this place so we checked it out.

Girlfriend got the steak and chicken hibachi. I stole a couple pieces and we both agreed that the chicken was just ok, nothing special. But the steak tasted amazing, I'm sure it's a simple NY strip or something but it tasted great. Their sauce that came with hibachi was different but good.

I got the spicy pork belly ramen. The ramen, egg, broth was amazing. Egg is perfectly cooked with the middle runny, the broth could've been spicier but I love spicy and always want everything spicier. And the ramen nearly cooked perfect. The pork belly was tea flavored cooked and I wasn't expecting it, but it was still really good. 

Overall 4/5, only since the chicken was kinda bland and also that the spicy broth cost $1 extra. Would gladly come back here again."}
{"text":"Been here before for Hibachi which was fabulous and from my recollection one of the funniest hibachi performers I've had. Today, felt like getting sushi wasted so we took advantage of the half price sushi night (FYI, half price specials end at 7pm and doesn't include the sushi sampler or anything on the new sushi item list). Additionally, place gets crowded and they only take reservation on half price sushi nights if you have a party of 5.

Despite the foot traffic in there tonight, our server was attentive and got our order on point (i'm a fan of just small amount of rice as not to dilute the taste, also not a fan of cream cheese in my sushi).

Saba (mackerel) nigiri, sold in single servings. Not a party favorite but my Filipino heritage draws me to this salt water/fishy delicacy. A very healthy serving and fresh for what you get.

Spicy tuna, wrapped in seaweed, 6 pieces. Kind of small, definitely poppable bite size, boasts a nice karate chop to my face with spice. Pleasantly unexpected.

Rainbow roll, a premium California roll inside (avocado, crabstick, cucumber), capped with a rainbow of salmon, Hamachi, shrimp and maguro. Such pretty presentation and equally delicious. I think I heard every neighboring table order this roll as well.

4.5 roll, were like sushi cookies, had to eat these in several installments, but was my favorite of the order. Spicy tuna, shrimp, masago, wrapped in rice and strips of seawood, topped with red clam. usually also comes with cream cheese, but I opted out. 

Spicy scallops, 6 pieces, were just plain diced spicy scallops. Also very small niblets of pleasure, like seafood bon bons. didn't think they had much spice factor, also heavily laden in some mayo sauce. 

Definitely happy with this sushi excursion and will happily return"}
