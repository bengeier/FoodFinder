{"text":"The food is AMAZING! I'm so glad we found this restaurant. I always have the Gamberi and add the house salad! My husband changes it up so I always get a taste of whatever he's having! Every time we come here the food is delicious!  Yummmmmmy!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Food is always great, service top notch and atmosphere is relaxing and inviting. Its a little pricy for us to go as often as we would like but its one of our fave places! Its a gem!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner for the second time. We are from St Louis, Missouri , with some of the best Italian restaurants in the US. We drove 40 minutes to have dinner because this is the best Italian we have found in Phoenix. Great wine list- very extensive and reasonable.  Would recommend - great food !!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Best Italian food I've had in Mesa, though to be fair I've only lived here 4 years.  A bit expensive but hey you pay for quality. Also the bread is BOMB"}
{"text":"Very nice clean establishment. great patio! service was wonderful! Food okay and i'm kind of particular with my wine and glass did not meet my standards glass was dirty and had lint inside with wine! Very nice selection of wine. My suggestion would be to find another restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Horrible food & even worse service.  Go buy a $2 bottle of Ragu and a box of pasta. Guaranteed that will be a better meal that what is served at Alessia's!  Bread was burned and sauce tasted like cold tomato soup!!! Disgusting!!! WARNING: DO NOT VISIT!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner! We had the pesto flatbread pizza, the salmon was great!, and the chicken picatta - fabulous! The service was great, ambiance perfect, and of course the food!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  We couldn't make up our mind so we ordered way more food then we could eat, but every bit of it was good.  Jon the owner is very informative an tries to make the atmosphere that of a large family gathering....IMO....some people my not care for that, but we loved it an ended up sharing our wine with the table next to us.  We can't wait to go back!  Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Pollo Porcini arrived with fork-tender chicken as did the Insalata Pollo Gorgonzola. The owner is a kidder but don't let it bother you."}
{"text":"Been looking for a really good Italian restaurant nearby my place but the hunt continues.  This place is good don't get me wrong and I would go back but don't think I would ever crave returning to this place its just not that caliber.  Nice sized portions not to small not to big everyone seemed to enjoyed there menu selections.  But just not great.  Staff was friendly and service was good no complaints really to speak of it's just not what I am searching for."}
{"text":"While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu."}
{"text":"I went here a while back ago for dinner. I was wanting something that wasn't the normal restaurants you see everyday. I was very pleased with the service and the food was incredible! The owner was friendly as he walked around and spoke with people. The waiter was very nice and helpful as I had no idea about what different things were. It is a slow paced, sit back and relax place. They do not rush you like the other big corporate restaurants do since they are all about customer count and moving people in and out quickly. I was very happy with everything and will be going back when time and money permit, I've been craving it very badly lately."}
{"text":"Some of the food is good while others are just ok or not what you were thinking. Service was great. Seemed like after every sip of water someone was there to refill it.  If you're looking for Olive Garden style food this isn't it. If you're looking for something a little more classy this may be it."}
{"text":"Alessia's is the biggest disappointment I have found on Yelp. After seeing all the great reviews, I had been wanting to try this place for some time. With so many 5 star reviews and a number of people on here raving about the freshness and quality of the food, I had high hopes. Unfortunately Alessia's didn't live up to the hype. The service was very slow, which I won't hold against them. Most people were sipping wine, so maybe it's their intention to slow it down a bit. The bread is garbage. Probably the worst part of my night there. It tasted like they went across the street to Basha's and bought some rolls that they heated up in the microwave. A good Italian restaurant has to have good bread. The rest of our meal didn't get much better. The pasta we ordered was disappointing. Small portions, small taste, big cost. Definitely not worth the price we paid or the time we waited. The reviews I read did not describe the food I ate. I understand if you love Alessia's for the atmosphere, the wine or maybe because it's hard to find a place like this in Mesa, but the food I ate did not deserve 4.5 stars. It was bad enough that I have no intention of giving Alessia's a second chance. Not the worst I've ever had, just the most disappointing. One last gripe I have is the service. The bad jokes and cheesy Italian don't fit with everything else this place is trying to do. The guy did know his stuff, but he was slow and made me feel awkward more than I'd expect."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a recommendation. My wife said her chicken erbe dish was the best Italian since we left NY. My chicken marsala was tasty but I think the sauce needed to be reduced more. Bread and salad were excellent. We made a mistake I think going on a weekend so we waited an hour for table. They use multiple wate staff and the first one to the table stated that along with the special but hurried away without asking us if he take a drink order so we sat another ten minutes waiting for his return. When he did return for the food order he acted annoyed that my wife wanted to give him a drink order first. I ordered a salad to have first and after a twenty minute wait had to flag him down to get it. The outcome was my meal was served immediately after. We will give I a try again on a off night."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Nice selection of food.  I truly enjoyed the atmosphere.   Additionally the staff were very polite and around frequently enough to provide great service."}
{"text":"My favorite place! I love coming to this restaurant where I'm treated like family. John is a most courteous host - he's learned what my husband and I like in wines and never fails to offer an excellent suggestion when we ask. His lovely wife Shari is the chef and I have yet to choose a dish that I've not liked. This is a REAL Italian restaurant, folks, not a watered down Americanized one. No, you won't find chicken parm, but neither did I find it in Italy. A tip - always add sausage to your meal. Shari makes her own and it's spectacular!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice in the last 4 days and I look forward to coming back again soon.  This little place is a treasure.  Every menu item we've tried has been terrific.  John, part of the husband-wife ownership, will make you feel welcome and will cater to your every need.  The service is attentive and prompt.  We've been all over the country trying to find good cannolis.  Everywhere we go, they are either gritty or soggy.  We've found great cannolis in the Bronx, Long Island and Mesa.  Yes, that's right...at Alessia's.  We just moved to AZ from the SF Bay Area and have quickly found our favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I very rarely give a 5 star review.  I reserve it for only the truly exceptional places.  Alessias definitely earned it.  It is one of only 2 places in Phoenix that I would give that score.  A friend suggested we try Alessias.  We love Italian food but had never seen an ad for them or heard about them.  After our first visit I have to wonder why no-one had ever recommended out before.  Perhaps they were trying to keep it all for themselves.    The decor reminded all of us of Italy.  The staff were all very friendly and made us feel like we were already regulars.  The service was very good and they seemed to anticipate our requests before we made them.  I had the Florence steak with a house salad.  I got a perfectly sized steak covered with an excellent sauce and cooked mushrooms.  The flavor and texture were amazing.  The rest of the party ordered veal piccata, veal marsala and the gnocchi (with fresh grated parmesan).  Everyone said that their dish was the best we have had  in a very long time.  Each was cooked just right and had flavors that caused each of us to pause to savor the flavors.  The portions were very good for the price.  Despite being full we managed to choose 3 separate desserts to try: the tiramisu, the chocolate lava cake and the spumoni bomba.  They are all larger than we expected so I worried we would leave a lot.  That didn't happen with any of them.  I only wanted a bite of the tiramisu but I wound up eating several.  Not to sound repetitive but it was amazing; I wound up eating over a quarter of it.    After that we focused in the lava cake.  It was hands down the best I've ever had.  My son isn't a cake fan but he loved it so much he wanted to be the one to finish it off.  The spunoni bomba was filled the bowl it came in.  Once we cracked the chocolate shell we made short work of it as well.  Although we have been in that corner plaza several times we never really noticed it tucked away in the corner.  Now that we have the unanimous family decision is we have found our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have had. Carbonara and alfredo are excellent accented with the homemade sausage. I agree that this place is located in an odd place. After you eat here you won't believe this place is located in a strip mall. Would have given five stars but kinda slow with the entrees and the check."}
{"text":"I recently ate dinner at Alessia's Ristorante Italiano located at 5251 E. Brown Rd in Mesa (yes, Mesa). It is tucked in the corner of a strip mall on the SE corner of Higley and Brown Roads, a few doors down from the Broadway Palm dinner theater. It is a smaller, mom and pop restaurant that serves up all sorts of Italian fare.    Dinner   Alessia's is owned and run by Jon and Shari Carr. Shari does all the cooking and Jon kind of runs the rest of the show. It's a very small restaurant with room for maybe 30 or 40 people max inside. They do have a patio area as well, but this time of year it's a bit chilly for dining al fresco. The decor is pretty bland, but that is just fine for a local eatery. Alessia's is a cozy place and you will definitely get some personal attention from Jon.   The wine list is nice and features all Italian wines. That helps with the authenticity, but I would personally like to see a focus on Italian wines, but still have some offerings from other wine producing areas of the world. The wine prices are reasonable (1.5x - 2x retail) and there are a fair number of them by the glass. We ordered a bottle of 2003 Santome Raboso ($48). This is a very lush wine. Rich fruit, leathery, and very well composed on the palate. Raboso reminds me of really good Cab Sav with some Merlot added for rounded structure.   Alessia's menu offers all the pasta types you would expect, but what I liked is that you can also get just about any type of sauce on those pasta dishes. There are also meat and seafood based entrees as well. The appetizer selection is small, but the choices are pretty solid. Prices are reasonable with apps being $6 - $10 and all larger plates being under $22 (many are under $15).   We split an appetizer, a pasta dish, and an entree. Here is a rundown of the items in the order we ate them:   Crostini ai Porcini - These were small pieces of grilled bread with fresh mozzarella on them and then topped with sauteed porcini mushrooms and herbs. It was very tasty, but there was so much garlic sauteed with the mushrooms that it kind of detracted from an otherwise delicious appetizer. We still ate it all and it was good we shared it as I could feel the garlic oozing out of my pores afterwards, so I knew I wouldn't be the only one warding off vampires that evening.   Gnocchi with Creamy Gorgonzola Sauce - This dish resulted in a good news/bad news situation. The good news was that the gorgonzola sauce was very tasty. Rich and creamy with a nice bite from the gorgonzola. The bad news is that the gnocchi were just OK. They tasted undercooked, like a pasta that is too al dente. They weren't bad, but the fresh bread dipped in the gorgonzola sauce was making us smile more than the potato dumplings were.    Pollo Erbe - Two chicken breasts served in a red sauce with rosemary, sage, garlic, onions, and basil. The chicken was wonderful; very moist and the sauce was great. I would definitely order this again. This came with a choice of a salad or pasta. We got the salad, but if I could use the \"way back machine\", I would have taken pasta on the side with the chicken and then bypassed the gnocchi for a salad course. Live and learn :)   Overall, the meal was very pleasant. The service was good and Jon makes the patrons feel at home with his sense of humor. The food arrives at a casual pace and that was just fine with us as we were enjoying each course without being rushed.   Final Take  Alessia's is a great neighborhood eatery where you can get a good meal at a decent price. Yes, there are things I would change here and there on the menu, but overall the restaurant delivers exactly what you'd expect from a locally owned Italian restaurant. And to this Foodie, that is reason enough to dine there.  Overall Grade = B (Good)  The EV Foodie"}
{"text":"Based on all the reviews here we gave this a try. I don't think we have ever been so dissatisfied at any other restaurant, that we have been to. My wife ordered fettuccine, with Alfredo sauce. It was like water, without taste. And mine was angel hair pasta with tomato sauce, and it wasn't any more flavorful, than hers was. I did like the warm bread, but the olive oil and vinegar to dip the bread in, had far too much vinegar. And we had to wait for quite a while, for the food to arrive. We were expecting a very good meal, and were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Alessia's is a good privately owned Italian restaurant. If you are not a fan of the typical corporate large joints that rustles you in and out like cattle, then this is a must try. Good food, good selection, fair prices, portions just right for my big appetite. Service was good with attention to detail such as knowing his menue by heart including every dishes ingredients and how it was prepared. This was important to me as my wife suffers from certain food alergens.  Only disappointment was the microwaved bread as to make appear as it just had came out of the oven. They should use the oven to re heat it instead, nothing wrong with re heating the bread. The microwave makes it rubbery and tough as it cools. Good job over all. this was my first time and yes I will return again. Well done."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my family. First thing the food is fantastic - everyone was more than ecstatic about everything from the appetizers to the dessert. The service was the best I have had in a very long time.  They don't have a children's menu but let me tell you that's a good thing! Everyone's children's menu has the same 5 items and honestly I don't know why the kids don't rebel! My granddaughter (6 yrs old) got to eat grown up healthy food for dinner.   The staff (including the owner) were very attentive to the whole table but I have to say they made my granddaughter feel like a million bucks. They gave her a coloring book and crayons and told her they were having a coloring contest. She did her picture, they took it to the front and hung it on the podium. As we walked out to leave as soon as she went through the door the whole bar cheered for her and told her she won the contest!  We will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"This is a place I really wanted to like but didn't.  It sounds great in theory;  authentic Italian food with an attached wine bar but, unfortunately, the atmosphere just won't bring us back.  First off, It seems to be a place geared toward regulars.  Rather than sitting in the restaurant, my wife thought the bar was cute and wanted to sit there.  Although several chairs were empty, a couple sitting at the bar told us they were \"saved.\"  Not even a hello from the bartender.  Hmmm, ok.  Feeling like the uncool kids in the cafeteria, we accepted a table in the dining room.  My wife ordered a pomodoro dish and I had a veal piccata.  Mine was better than her bland, watery pasta, but definitely not anything to write home about.  We both enjoyed our wine - we always like wine!  Like the food, the wait staff was marginal at best.  Not particularly attentive, and probably hanging out in the bar with more important people than us.  Overall, not one to recommend to friends or neighbors. The 2 star rating says, \"Meh. There's better places to go.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I are self proclaimed foodies, and well versed on Italian food, having grown up in Chicago's Little Italy. We've also eaten our way through the motherland, Italia. Since we discovered Alessia's  was close to home, we stopped in a few nights ago to give it a shot. Bingo! This place is the real deal! The atmosphere is that of a trattoria, even if it's not on a piazza - just a half-occupied strip mall. The food is the real star here. We ordered the calamari. Surprisingly, it was not grilled ( or battered and fried), but cooked in a delectable garlicky red sauce that must have been nectar to the god Jupiter. Salads were lightly dressed with an assortment of fresh greens. Out tortellini and linguine dishes were cooked al dente. Our cannoli desserts were filled just before serving to maintain a crispy shell. The sweet ricotta filling was perfect. Coffee was fresh, wait staff was friendly and very capable. The only downside was horrible bread- really, a very poor excuse for Italian bread, which should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The dipping oil at the table should have been extra Virgin olive oil for more flavor, or at least some herbs should have been added to it. In closing, a gem of a place except for the bread. We will be back for sure. Excellent."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Took a while to get our food but when a table of 12+ people sit before you at a mom n pap place you need to expect that. Food and service A+"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food. Me and my wife spent our past anniversary in San Francisco and had some really excellent italian food.   Since then we've been desiring something similar. We've tried many places in the valley and Alessia's is the first that has given us that same feeling.  Love it, we'll be back many many times in the years to come."}
{"text":"We were greeted with such warmth by the entire team.  Our server was named Sam. Sam was very personable,  had an impeccable memory & was well versed on the extensive Wine List.  We started out with a glass of Valporticella and proceed to order. We were advised that the special was a 7 ounce Filet, cooked Medium Rare topped with a great sauce, sprinkled with blue cheese and served on a bed of risotto. Of course, my date, my date, Heide Kaldor was convinced and happy to order it.  While sitting there, we were ordered the Salad Contadina. Extremely well praoered greens, served with grated tomatoes & topped with an impeccable dressing. Both, my date and I were highly impressed.  The staff worked together like an all star team would. Another Server named Derrick also came up to our table and gave us bread & our balsamic & oil plate.  Our next course was brought out moments after we both were done with our salads. It was a piece of art that tasted as great as it looked. The filet was cooked to perfection, the sauce was just the right amount, the  cheese on top of the sauce was delightful & all served on a buttery risotto.  While eating, we were greeted by the owner John. He did more than just check on our meal. He personalized our service with some great banter. When he left our table, my date & I were left with smiles and even more to talk with.  Our drinks were poured faster than they were finished. Towards the end of our filling meal, Derrick had suggested we save room for our dessert. Since it was Heide's Birthday, we had to order the tiramasu.  We are so glad we did. What a great finish to a great meal.  When all was finished, our bill was well under $100. In which we were pleasantly surprised.   Alessia's Ristorante Italiano has proven to be that flawless diamond worth the search 4. There name may start with an A, but I definitely give them a well deserved A+"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight and was greated with big hello's. Seated by owner Christopher and took our drink orders and told us the special of the day. I ordered Pasta Erbe, Rosemary,sage onions, basil in a tomato sauce. It was wonderful. My boyfriend ordered Veal Marsala, he said it's the best he's ever had!!! Cheesecake to finish off and coffee for him. It was a great meal, we will be back."}
{"text":"So, there were highs and lows to our visit at Alessia's.  Highs: The service was excellent. My glasses were never empty, and the entire staff was extremely professional. We had gone on a weekend just before Thanksgiving, and the special was truly something special. We were told it was a once-a-year thing, and were both SO glad we tried it. It was a \"deconstructed Thanksgiving dinner\" made into a lasagna. Noodles were layered with mozzarella, pulled turkey meat, stuffing, etc. It was topped with a basil prosciutto gravy, which I had only one complaint about-- that I didn't order extra. It was SO flavorful, and really set off the dish. It also came with fresh cranberry sauce that was literally the best I have ever had. I typically don't even eat cranberry sauce, but this was really exceptional.   The cannolis we had for desert were AH-MAZING. Do not go there and leave without eating them! Also they were very reasonably priced at 2 for $5.  Lows: The delicious slice of Thanksgiving lasagna was either $22 or $24 (I can't remember which.) It did come with bread, but a salad was extra. So while it was delicious, I just don't know if it was worth the price.  My bottle of Chateau Ste. Michele Riesling (Approximately seven dollars in a store) was also $38. I know restaurants have mark up, etc etc-- but I have ordered this exact bottle of wine at many restaurants and have never come close to paying this.  The restaurant is in a strip mall... pretty hard to be super classy in a strip mall. My only other complaint is a bit petty, but the owner was flitting about quite a bit, and he was just a bit smarmy for me.   I don't know if we will go back for a meal, but we have already talked about swinging by again just for the cannolis!  Highs: good, creative, flavorful food; CANNOLIS; great service. Lows: pricey; smallish portions."}
{"text":"Service was fine and the place was nice. It was the food-terrible calamari,  its not breaded, its in a tomato water. I had the special, beef ravioli, bland, mushy, drowned in soggy tomatos and olive oil. Price $18.00 for 8 raviolis."}
{"text":"I've never been to Arizona before but I'm looking at moving here. This was the very first meal I had in Arizona and, oh my goodness, everything was fantastic! Wine was delicious, bruschetta was perfectly balanced and crunchy, pasta was al dente, the porcini sauce in particular was fantastic. The owner was nice and attentive. He made us feel welcome and was a pleasure to chat with. I had very low expectations for genuine Italian food but I was blown away. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Yes the food was good, if not a bit over priced for ( as most of the folks here write)being in a strip mall in Mesa catering to snowbirds who like Olive Garden. However, the owner didn't know what cannelloni was and smirked when I wondered why it wasn't  on the menu.The chef/ cook is not Italian, so there's the answer. I'm from SF and grew up eating at north beach and 4 star Italian places.  The waiter/ owner insisted on calling me M'lady and telling me to try some wine, which I told him I do not drink.. Annoying. The shopping center is actually very charming and attractive. I live close to it, and No- I'm not a senior in a mobile home park.  I was hoping I would love this place, but maybe I will try one more visit. The patio looked really nice.  As with everyone else, the husband was the key annoying factor in this review."}
{"text":"Why, oh why does this have to be in BFE? When I go to a quaint little place in downtown Phoenix that has \"cucina\" in its title, THIS is exactly what I'm dreaming I'm going to find. But no, no... this is not my dumb luck. My dumb luck is that my parents are in from out of state, basking in the manufactured housing glory that is much of this part of Mesa and we decide to go grab some dinner. Since I'm NEVER out here, I naturally grab Yelp to get some recommendations. Well what do you know! Four and a half star Italian place just a mile down the road? Don't mind if I do!  Now I'm skeptical going into this, I have to be honest. Four and a half stars in Mesa is like four and a half stars in Sun City. It means nothing because the palates around here are... shall we say, tending toward the bland. But what the heck, I'll give it a shot. WOW. I've only eaten at this place this one time and I feel fairly comfortable saying that not only is it the best Italian food I've ever had in the Valley, but I'll also almost certainly be trekking it all the way back out here 30+ miles to this godforsaken place just to experience it again.  I could have made a meal of the complimentary bread. They bring it out with balsamic and olive oil on a plate to dip the bread in like a lot of places do, but here it is garnished with what looked to me like pepper, thyme and chili flakes. YUM. We started with the calamari, braised in a red marinara-type sauce replete with chunks of fresh garlic. The last of the bread went to sop up the leftover juices. Not one drop was wasted. It is here we decided we might really be in for something good.  I had the Tortellini Pomodoro with homemade sausage added. It was of a good quality and the sauce - like all the sauces here - was fresh and just wonderful. The sausage was tasty, the depth of flavors excellent. My father had the Linguine Bolognese, which I have uploaded a picture of. It was stellar. No one left unhappy.  Some folks have bagged on the owner, John. He is a bit over the top, but you get the sincere feeling that he is really happy you are there and proud of what he has accomplished here with his wife (the chef) and rightly so. We liked him.  Now for the nitpicking: The menu is too dense. The headlines are all Italian and so they largely tell you nothing about what the dishes are, unless of course, you speak Italian. Yeah it feels a bit more AUTHENTICO and all that, but I'd rather have more descriptive titles.  Secondly, their iced tea was ridiculously weak, maybe it was just a bad batch. That's about all I can say bad about this place. Well, maybe it's a bit too pricey as well but I can forgive pricey when the food and service is this good.  If you're ever out this way, do yourself a favor: check this place out. My highest recommendation."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional dinner tonight! To start with, the service from seating to goodbye was absolutely excellent and professional, as well as friendly!  We started with the Bruschetta Caprese which was absolutely delightful and seasoned impeccably!  Then we had the Scallops and Risotto special which had an incredible sauce, and were absolutely blown away!  John, the owner, recommended a fantastic wine, from an extensive and wonderful wine list.  We ordered Tiramisu and Cannoli for dessert, both of which were excellent.  All we can say, again, is that we had an absolutely wonderful and delightful experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Gnocci alla Brian was amazing & their special, which consist of shrimp, homemade garlic cream sauce & mango= yum! Plus, staff & owner very friendly & attentive. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I've tried in Az! Very fresh authentic ingredients, everything on the menu is amazing"}
{"text":"First visit here tonight. Won't be the last! Delicious food, surprisingly charming ambience. Great glass of Merlot: much volume, reasonable price. Perfectly seasoned dinner salad. Warm, crusty bread. Delectable Bolognese fettuccini. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We gave a large birthday party for a very special man on a very special birthday.  We wanted great food, attentive service, and a family atmosphere with people who understood that a 70th birthday is a pretty big occasion.  I don't know how anything could have gotten any better!  The food exceeded our expectations, the service was excellent but never intrusive.  The planning stage with John and Scott was easy and they paid attention to every detail I asked for.  All 24 guests said it was one of the nicest family parties they had ever been to.  The weather on that gorgeous patio was perfect too--I can't decide whether I loved the Alfredo more than the Erbe, or the Pollo Marsala.  But this morning we are tasting the leftovers and we will let you know!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try something new, my family and I love a good Italian meal. The bread that was served wasn't good, it tasted old. Our bruschetta appetizers were disappointing as well, we ordered all three. The only one  that was worth ordering again was the one with the fig spread, the one with the sauce was just okay the bread it was served on could not hold the sauce so it was mush. The tomatoes served on the salads and the bruschetta were shredded and not ripe, they were pale and had almost no flavor. My husband ordered the fettuccini alfredo with their homemade sausage, it was bright orange and just okay. We had chicken Marsala, chicken piccata and a pasta dish as well. The chicken piccata had almost no lemon flavor. We skipped dessert as we were already disappointed with our meal. We would not go back, we love trying new places but we will not be back to Alessia's."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Another unassuming strip mall restaurant with excellent food in Mesa. After living here for seven years, I'm *finally* finding the authentic mom-n-pop places with good food, yay! And they're all in strip malls. Weird.  Alessia's was great. We had a party of six so we called earlier in the day to get a reservation (following their website guidelines, which state reservations will be taken for parties of 5 or more). We left a message because they don't open until 5pm. When we arrived, the owner (John) greeted us and knew about our reservation without having to look it up, and he gave us our choice of a round or a rectangle table. The place felt homey, and it was comfortable. John is definitely over the top with his kidding, but I didn't mind it. And he really knew what he was talking about food-wise.   I'm not a huge pasta-lover but my family is.Here are the reports from most in our party:   The linguini carbonara was wonderful. Very full-flavored. It heated up the next day better than expected, which was a nice treat.  The cappelini pesto was tasty but the sauce was a little overpowering -- maybe a bit too much sauce for the amount of pasta. (and maybe angel hair wasn't the best choice of pasta for this sauce - it was really swimming in it).   The gorgonzola gnocchi was delicious (we had this for an appetizer for the table).   The lobster ravioli was very good but a bit mild in flavor.  The tortellini bolognese was fabulous.  Overall great pasta and decent prices with good service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Arizona. Food and service are top notch"}
{"text":"They push wine as soon as you walk in the door. We had to wait to too long to get a small table that was in the way. We were bombarded by wait staff asking us the same thing. The bread was well let's say I have had better. The food was over priced for what you get. The sauce was runny & too many onions. I felt sick after eating there. The only good thing was the dessert. No plans to return."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was relaxing. I went with my family (who all like different things and are pretty picky eaters). When we left the restaurant everyone was happy and full (which is kind of a miracle). We had the seafood risotto, the lobster ravioli, chicken, lamb, and the best chocolate cake ever. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking to try a new restaurant for dinner so we ended up at Alessia's. I have been to other business' in the same complex and never knew it was there, they say they don't advertise, all word of mouth. I was very surprised to see that there is a nice Italian spot near home without having to go to a chain restaurant.  The service was good from beginning to end, you don't just get one server assigned to you, whoever is walking through (the very small dining space) will check up on you and make sure everything is ok, I liked this because we didn't go unnoticed. Even though the dining area is small, it was never loud, and there were even a few children when we arrived. It seems like it is families that have been coming here for years and their children actually know how to behave in a nice restaurant.  Now to the best part, the food. We were served bread to start off with, nothing special,  but I was starving so it was appreciated. For dinner we ordered the Insalata Milanese, breaded veal over greens with delicious mozzarella and  chiffonade tomatoes was simple and satisfying, I would come back for this salad alone! We also order the Pomobasil Gnocchi, the tomato sauce was so good I doubt we left a drop on the plate, but the semolina gnocchi itself wasn't what I wanted. I prefer potato, so I wouldn't mark points off for that being it is more a personal preference issue because everything came to us cooked very well. For dessert we had a cannoli that was also very good. Overall I would definitely come back here and bring some friends with."}
{"text":"We love this place,  everything we had was amazing,  bruschetta, lobster ravioli and even the oil mix for the bread.   We will be back"}
{"text":"This is my first review and a well deserved one! Alessia's is by far the BEST Italian restaurant I have found in the valley (take that from a Chicago girl!!!). The Bruschetta....TO DIE FOR....They shave the tomatoes into thin slices that taste like they were picked directly out of the garden...The bread and oil and balsemic vinegar...amazing..the bread is so moist and piping hot....The owner was serving us and was so knowledgeable!!! He picked out a wine for me based on a vague description of what I like. It was right on spot! I ordered Fettucine Alfredo and the owner was straight up and honest with me stating, \"Alfredo is wonderful, but if you're looking for incredible, you have to try the Pasta Carbonera\" OH MY GOSH WAS HE RIGHT....Best creamy pasta dish with fresh bacon and so many flavors! We ended the meal with the melt in your mouth Tiramisu....This is the first of many visits for me and the owner informed me of a wine tasting they do for $18...COUNT ME IN!"}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service, the food is phenomenal. Highly recommend the mussels, chicken porcini yum, yum"}
{"text":"Alessia's is, by and large, the number one hidden gem in Mesa. We moved to Mesa three years ago and stumbled upon Alessia's while we were exploring our new neighborhood.    First-the owner is who he is.  We love his engaging personality and off-color humor.  I get that some people may not like it, but he keeps us entertained and gives the restuarant a down-home feel.  The bread is to die for.  Excellente!  And the food...I had been in search of true Gnocchi since I got back from a visit with my mom in Italy years ago.  She lives near Naples and snuck me into an amazing cafe there where I experienced...I mean truly experienced gnocchi for the first time.  I will never forget the moment, the smells, the sounds, the taste.  Food that is so delicately prepared has a way to imbed itself in a person's memory.  It happened for me one day in Naples.  And, years later, it happened again in a small ristorante in Mesa.    I'm not a huge Tiramisu fan, but my other half is, and he tells me the Tiramisu at Alessia's is some of the best he has ever had.    For the money, you will not get a better experience of true, Italian food and fun-loving service.  I highly recommend Alessia's to one and all...."}
{"text":"Entering the small dining room I noticed a quaint and homey feel in spite of the large windows and a couple of doors.  Music was kept low and people at tables could easily hold conversation.  Wait staff was busy and attentive and our water glasses were really never left empty.  We ordered a house salad to share and were surprised when they had split it for us between plates when we had not specified that request.  While I had not seen a salad with tomato crushed on top before, the flavor achieved was fresh, simple and pleasingly acidic.  This was obviously not a bottled dressing and I really enjoyed it with a bit of freshly cracked pepper.  As I finished my salad I noted the steaming plates being delivered to the tables near me.  I dearly love gnocchi and not every Italian restaurant offers it so I was delighted to find it on their menu.  There were four choices of sauce for the gnocchi including pomobasil, amatricciano, gorgonzola, and the last I believe was a sausage variety.  As tempted as I was by the gorgonzola sauce I opted to have the pomobasil thinking it would give me the purest experience with how they prepare the gnocchi.  My plate arrived steaming like the others.  The sauce at first glance seemed overly pureed without much texture.  The texture of the gnocchi however was delicate and pleasant.  I would have liked more spice and herbs in the sauce, still.  There wasn't enough of the basil in this pomobasil sauce.  Again the flavor of fresh tomato was apparent though.  Nothing canned here.  Bottom line: lovely service, fresh ingredients, friendly atmosphere and nice Italian wines.  Homemade gnocchi done right.  But if you're a big fan of garlic or have a very hearty palate this is probably not your place."}
{"text":"delicious food indeed but even though that is the most important factor when wanting a memorable fabulous dining experience,  the food wasn't the only factor that made eating at alessia's so amazing. we were greeting by friendly staff and asked if wanted to eat in restaurant or in patio area.  of course I choose the romantic white lights seating outside. during the meal, a table with young adults were laughing and having a great time saying how they love coming to this restaurant.  and the table next 2 me had a more seasoned mature group and one man talked about how good his food was and how the chef shari knows just what he likes.  the woman was talking to her other friend and she said something like... I don't know how shari does it...when I make this dish at home, it's just not the same.  then after dinner I was asked me to take a photo of this raving fan with chef owner shari.  obviously he loves to eat good food and must frequent here often.  now grant it, this was a super fabulous experience because I haven't see my friend shari in decades but overall still would've given this place 5stars.  superb italian food, great atmosphere with awesome staff that even hug each other goodbye for the night & genuinely love each other... who wouldn't want to surround yourself with that?"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this restaurant because the owner was the biggest d-bag you have ever met. He was so obnoxious and loud trying to entertain everyone that walked in. I don't need a clown show with my dinner. I think the music in the restaurant is purposely very low so he can hear himself mispronounce Italian words. On top of this he gave me a glass of wine that smelled and tasted more like vinegar and feet. I told him very discreetly and politely that my wine does not taste right he made a big deal out of it. There was 3 other tables there for dinner and he put on a show for them by yelling that he just opened that bottle and he checked it himself. The table next to us was an older couple that were his friends and even they joined in and made some rude comments. I couldn't believe it! This is a nightmare: I am paying to be insulted! Everyone was staring at me and it was extremely embarrassing.  Seems that this place has survived so far because the owners wife is the chef and she does a good job, the food was great.  My advice to her: Get your dead beat of husband away from your customers. he's more suited to clean the toilets then interact with people. He said the word PERFECTO a thousand times. He is annoying, cheesy and rude. He doesn't know sh$t about wine."}
{"text":"This is hands down a very good italian restaurant. Give them a try. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband found this place looking on Yelp. We are always on the hunt for new places to try. The food was amazing, service was top notch, and the atmosphere was great. We will definitely be back and be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Some the best Italian food in town great service. The use the team concept which means you never have to look for help to keep you ice tea filled grin The food had layers of flavors and the pasta was home made and perfect  Well done"}
{"text":"My family and i have been regulars at this restaurant since it first opened. We are good friends with all the staff and owners. The food here is so good, it almost ruins going to other italian restaurants because it never tastes as good. The entire staff are super friendly and all know exactly what my family and i enjoy as far as where we like to sit, wines, entrees. They really care about the costumers. Would recommend to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"I was craving Italian but wanted to try a new restaurant. Tucked into the corner of a small strip mall with private outside dining and a cute Tuscan theme inside, I was happy with the atmosphere. I wanted to try a seafood pasta dish but the menu didn't have exactly what I was looking for but the server was happy to make my dish to order, yay! I ordered fish and shrimp with a tomato cream sauce and my husband ordered the Frutti deMarre (sp?). Both were out to the table quickly and were delicious! My meal consisted of large shrimp and Mahi Mahi. My husband kept saying how great his meal was. In fact, he said that he decided before he got his meal that he would only eat half since he wasn't that hungry. He ended up eating the entire meal it was so good. My meal was the perfect amount of pasta, seafood and sauce and the shrimp and Mahi were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all.  I couldn't really give 5 stars due to the lettuce in our salads having pink stalks (you know, the color it gets when it is starting to get old). I also wasn't a fan of the salad dressing due to it tasting of too much oil. I did take the pickled portion of the salad off. Not sure what it was but my husband thought it was amazing  and I'm sure was meant to balance the oil in the dressing.  We'll definitely be back to try the Lobster Ravioli."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem.  Its tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, but I'm so glad we found it.  Walking in, we loved the decor, and the wine bar.  Everyone there was very attentive-refilling drinks and bringing us things before we even had to ask.  I dont think there was one person on the staff that didn't ask us if we needed anything.  The food was great, I cant wait to go back and try more of the menu.  The owner is so friendly, he was out checking on tables and even stopped and talked to us for a bit, his wife is the chef- and boy can she cook."}
{"text":"We are in love with this place! It is tucked away and there isn't a road sign, but holy moly it is worth it!!!!!   The food is some of the best Italian food in Arizona hands down. And their wine selection is great! Always ask about the house specials! The chef is amazing!  The owners are always there working and are wonderful people! Along with the rest of the staff! The service is a team effort so you never have to look to get a drink refilled or anything extra!  The house made desserts are to die for!!  We love this place and will continue to come every time we are in Arizona! Everyone we've sent in thanks us for pointing it out!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good news. Delicious food. Entrees, desserts, yum. Now the bad-it took us an hour and a half to get that delicious food. Now, we were a large group of 9, and we arrived for our reservation and were immediately seated which was great. It only took a few minutes to decide but took our waiter 45 min to take our order. The 45 min it took to get the food was not entirely unreasonable for a group of 9 and I would have given 3 stars. However, our waiter happened to be the manager and he blamed the slow service on the chef and said \"SHE\" would be buying us dessert for the wait. The cannolies were delicious. But some apology with some ownership would have been nice."}
{"text":"I was visiting for the weekend and found this restaurant searching on my mobile phone, it was incredible! The food and service were the best I ever had. Only came to $50 bucks for two and it should of been $100."}
{"text":"Third time dining at Alessia's. As always the food was fantastic. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The owner John is down to earth and a professional. Pleasure speaking with him. Nice to enjoy great food and service in a family owned operation. Look forward to returning and passing word to friends about this gem in Mesa. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Soupy pasta sauce, very unremarkable house salad. Not great atmosphere in a little strip mall  Would not return."}
{"text":"We had my husbands 75th birthday party there, total of 37 people.  The food was awesome and I can not say enough about their service.  The entire event from the planning to the dinner they were so accommodating.  If I could give a 10 star I would.  Thank you Scott for making this party a success!"}
{"text":"Now I know why all the reviews are so good and why people are willing to write volumes of information about the place.  I'm not that guy, so I'll keep it brief...  Just try it.  All the people making these posts are not delusional.  I've eaten at places in little italy in NY that weren't this good.  The bruschetta is great and very unique.  If you haven't eaten there, you should...  It's really that simple..."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing. We waited about an hour for the table but it was well worth it. The staff is super attentive and super friendly. The food was incredible. Must try the lasagna! If it's in season, try the Orange Pedal beer. Very good! Great atmosphere as well. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Is it better than Olive Garden?...Yes.  Is it better than what you get in Italy?...no, not even close. I only point that out because of how much they push their authenticity. I've tried it several times over the last 5 years and I can never find something that is simply and honestly authentic... it's always off in some way. For example, the pasta is always swimming in sauce, like soup amounts of sauce... why can it not just be dressed in sauce as you finish the pasta in the pan like it should be? The bread... why is it so cheap and crustless like you buy it at the grocery store? There are good purveyors like MJ Bread, just buy from them and charge me more so that I can say, \"this is such good bread\"... that is what happens when I go to legit Italian places."}
{"text":"Excellent! Romantic and quaint. The wine list is awesome and chefs specials are so delicious. Highly recommend if you want authentic Italian food, ironically prepared by an Asian lady."}
{"text":"Amazing food, you feel like part of the family.  Probably best experience I've ever had even internationally.   Bravo Alessia what an amazing experience."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based on its Yelp reviews. We were very pleased. Adorable little Italian restaurant with very very very attentive wait staff. I was unhappy with my veal and it was quickly taken awAy with no argument. Quite the contrary ,,, food was terrific. Cannoli's to die for. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"To say this was a disappointment would be too kind. We should have known when the menus said \"entrate\" to describe entrees. \"Entrate\"? Rudimentary Italian, or having ever eaten in an Italian restaurant, and you know this means \"you have entered\"... I guess they meant the \"twilight zone\"...where noodles swimming in an over-garlic, under-flavor concoction passes for some sort of sauce? And I guess, in this twilight zone, the vegetable oil on the tables was for dipping what they call \"bread\". Maybe before opening an Italian restaurant, these people should have perhaps tasted the flavors Italian food has to offer. If this is Italian, Dominos is pizza. And FYI, you meant \"secondi\"...not \"entrate\"."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant.  4.5  The service was fantastic. Everyone is working every table so you are never waiting for the next course or a water refill.   Wine list is extensive, many glass offerings. Prices for full bottles drink during dinner and 'retail' if you want to take a bottle home. Retail is a few dollars over cost. Mid priced wines ($40-50) are better values. retail spread is lower.  Food was fantastic. I had a shrimp pasta (gamberi). The sauce was very light and didn't have a pool of oil or butter at the bottom. My wife had salmon which was delicious and also had a very nice sauce.  I will go back again, next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Authentic flavors, great wine, friendly staff. Intimate setting, great for a date night. My brother and I went with friends and we all ordered different entrees. They were all fantastic. Mesa doesn't have much to choose from for fine Italian dining and this place is a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Small, quaint and the food is awesome.  We enjoyed our meal at Alessia's Ristorante in Mesa very much.  The owner is very friendly and personable.  We went there later in the evening on a Friday and had no problem getting in.  We enjoyed the mussels and calamari which was very tasty.  Best mussels I have had in a long time.  The three of us had pasta dishes very good and plenty of food.  Highly recommend this small quaint restaurant, it certainly is on our favorites list."}
{"text":"Let's start with the pros. Quaint little place hidden in Mesa AZ. Nice front bar and reasonable prices. Pretty decent wine list.  About the food.   The bread wasn't good at all. Period.   I had the caprese salad wich was OK, barely OK.  I ordered the capellini with erbe sauce. The rosemary flavor was a little overwhelming but in general was OK.  I wouldn't crave to go back but if I lived in the neighborhood, I probably would go once in a while.  The best part of dinner, was the company  (as it should always be:)  Cheers"}
{"text":"What a delightful find!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcomed.  The service was exceptional and the food was even better.  I had Bolognese (added in capers, yum!) and the others had Lobster Ravioli and Fettuccine Alfredo.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food (not the best I've had) homemade style. The atmosphere is old, outdated, and gloomy. The food is EXTREMELY overpriced. I will not be going here EVER again. Our bill for 3 people and three entrees, 2 salads, came to $82 with NO alcohol just two cokes NOT including a tip! We had excellent service and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"I am amazed at the few negative reviews. Sounds more like people who enjoy writing negative comments more than someone who actually ate at Alessia's.   This restaurant is absolutely amazing, the service was excellent and the food was wonderful. The ravioli was homemade and had excellent flavor, perfect balance between the cheese and spinach. The sauce was extremely flavorful, very rich but not to salty! Perfect.   The wine selection was very good. I think a major plus is the menu, it is not too large, just enough choices. So many restaurant's have giant menus with way too much. The selection is perfect.   If you do not like Alessia's, you do not know what real Italian food is all about. Go back to Olive Garden.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"WOW!  Just about sums this place up..  My husband & I had stumbled across this place one evening when we were dining at a nearby fast food chain and said we'd have to try it out sometime.  So, one night we did and it was nothing short of AWESOME in all aspects from the greeting we received by the hostess to the waiter to the ambiance.  It is very quaint, authentic and romantic.  It is tucked in the corner of a shopping plaza and what it lacked in size, it made up in all the things that matter the most (food, service, wine selection, etc.).  Our waiter owns this resturant with his wife, who is the Head Chef.  Their hostess, a young lady was FANTASTIC, she was warm, welcoming, friendly and professional, very sweet demeanor.  Our waiter was extremely knowledegable about the wine and food selections and had a very relatable, easy going personality, but maintained the right amount of professionalism, we felt like we were dining at a 5 star la-ti-da kinda resturant.  The food was nothing short of amazing, you could taste the fresh ingredients and its pure authenticity.  Even when I didn't think I could eat another bite, I couldn't stop myself, I wanted MORE!  The bottle of wine the waiter helped us to select was a great selection for our very different paletes, a little bit of sweet for me and a lil' twinge of dry for my husband, pure bliss in a glass!  I highly recommend Alessia's to anyone, we will DEFINITELY be back!  Also, just a tip sign up for their weekly email, they are a wine distributor and hold free wine tastings."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago while visiting for Spring Training and it was a great experience. The staff was great and really tag-teamed to service our group of 7. We did make reservations well in advance, but the place was not too busy (Saturday at 7). The food was really good too. The Alfredo was one of the best I've had and my wife really liked her lasagna. Everybody else seemed to really like their dishes too."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the excitement is about.  The food is passable, but nothing extraordinary. There are far more distinguished restaurants within easy reach, Especially for the money . Entrées here are around $20 each, which is not that much less expensive than many higher end restaurants in the surrounding area . The portion size, especially with the pasta mare we ordered, seems skimpy."}
{"text":"Great place!!. Food was delicious and the service was wonderful. I love it when the owner of a restaurant comes out and speaks to there costumer, he filled us in on the place and the food and how it came to be. very nice guy!.. we'll definitely be coming back!!!.."}
{"text":"Stopped in earlier this week and enjoyed eating there. Friendly service, food was a little above average, but wine selection is pretty limited. Will def. come in and try some other dishes soon."}
{"text":"My husband finally did good. He suggested that we try Alessia's and it was excellent!  Very good service, nice hot bread, and a great wine selection. I had the special (which I could say in Italian because it was beautiful) which was a stewed pulled pork dish and served in the both with broad egg noodles. I was not disappointed!! Hubbie has the lobster ravioli which he also really enjoyed.  Servers were friendly and attentive. We will return!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Hidden gem in Mesa. Very authentic, hearty Italian food! They have a cute little patio as well for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Ambience is on point, decor is on point, and bread is heavenly. Love dat crunch. Mm. 4 starz"}
{"text":"We came for a going away party and had a large area reserved for us. The staff was so accommodating and took good care of us the whole evening. I loved the ambiance and it felt like I was in Italy surrounded by a plethora of shelved wines.   We started off with a delicious cheese and meat platter paired with red and white wine. Then we ordered a caprese salad with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella. For the entree, I got the fettuccine bolognese which was awesome and my husband got the gamberi (shrimp)with gluten-free corn penne. Wow for gluten-free, that pasta was seriously really delicious and cooked perfectly al-dente. We finished the dinner with a tasty homemade cannoli! The ingredients were all really fresh and clean which is probably why I didn't fall into a sedated food coma after the meal.   If you're trying to find an authentic Italian restaurant especially in the East Mesa area, look no further! Alessia's is legit!"}
{"text":"I have been in the valley for the better part of 12 yeas and in that time I haven't found a go to Italian place. Until last night... WOW!!! The service was spot on and really attentive from the moment we walked in the door. The recommended special, carbonara with egg on top, was unreal and my girlfriend's lobster ravioli was delicious. Capped off with a New York cheese cake and coffee made it a perfect meal. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great find.  Very nice Italian place with great food and super service.  Like many of the places in Mesa, it's in a strip mall, but don't let the outside fool you.  The inside is very nice.  The Puttanseca was really well prepared."}
{"text":"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.   \" wine tasting director\" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"}
{"text":"Lovely family Italian restaurant located in a nondescript strip mall behind the Iowa Cafe. Diverse menu reads like a journey thru the various regions of Italy. Nice wine list at 2x retail rather than the more typical 3x. Personalized attention, good food. My only problem is that I' m just passing tbru and won't be able to make this a regular haunt!"}
{"text":"this is a great Italian restaurant, a hidden gem but very difficult to get to because it isolated in the corner of a shopping plaza Way out in a restaurant wasteland on the eastern side of Mesa."}
{"text":"Love this little Italian place a few streets away from home. Best Italian food around! The owner is a great and funny gentleman who always entertaining to my family. His wife is an AMAZING chef. My go to dish is the cheese ravioli with pink sauce. My boyfriend always switches it up but normally gets a side of Penne Alfredo. Last week he got the lamb and it was divine. We ALWAYS save room for dessert!! I normally get the chocolate truffle and the raspberry cheesecake but this last time we got the cream puffs and they were like soft pillows of whipped cream and pastry dough in your mouth. Delicious. Will be back for more again and again"}
{"text":"Stopped in at the last minute with no reservation. They had a big bridal party on the patio but we were seated right away. Service was great. Food was very good with ample serving size. The bartender made a really good wine bottle recommendation that was spot on. Just an all around great experience. The chef even came out and said hello."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites.  I love taking a date here sitting out on the patio is romantic and fun.  Great hidden little place in Mesa  It is owner operated by a husband and wife (husband takes care of front of house, wife cooks) so service and quality are always at their best.    I still remember the first time i went there it was just about 9:00pm as i walked up I saw that they close at 9:00, but thought i would just look at the menu... I didn't want to be that guy who shows up 5 min before close and am the only table in house.  As i looked at the restaurant i loved the decoration it looked really romantic and well decorated.  The maitre d (who turned out to be the owner) asked if we were there for dinner, I let him know that I saw they were closing in 5 min so I was just checking the place out, his response.... \"you got money?\" ... \"um... ya\" ... \"well, are you hungry\".... again \"um... ya\" his simple response \"then were open, we don't close till people stop coming in\"  He was really engaging and has been every time i have been their since, he keeps things moving in the restaurant and leaves you alone if you are on a date and want to be left alone, he has good judgement.  He is an important part of why this place is great.  He makes it feel like you are part of the restaurant.  His wife is an amazing cook.  AMAZING. Everything is fresh, everything is prepared to order, pasta made in house, everything seasoned perfectly, every time... great selection of food great selection of wine.  If you need any help decided what to get the husband is very able to help you find something you like.  Very accommodating.   i love this place."}
{"text":"The hubs loves Italian and a co-worker suggested Alessia's...what a great place!!  Tucked in the corner of a shopping center, it was a nice surprise to walk into such an inviting ambiance and the outside dining area was just as charming!  The servers work as a team so you don't have a dedicated person, but their method works and everyone is super nice.  We started our meal with a bottle of wine, bread, and calamari.  They have an extensive wine list and we were a little overwhelmed, but the servers were great at making suggestions. The calamari is not the typical fried version, but still very good. Hubs was not a fan, but the pasta made up for it!  We ended up with the carbonara for me and chicken alfredo for him and we ate every last bite!  Their signature is the homemade sausage which was good, but I wish they did meatballs. We finished off dinner with cheesecake and the chocolate truffle - both very good and appropriately portioned. Overall, we truly enjoyed our experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the creative juices are not kicking in this morning, but I had to put up some type of review because having this place at 4 stars is a travesty.  What a stellar experience my girlfriend and I had on Saturday!  The decor was nice, it probably seems old-fashioned to some but I loved the blue tablecloths with white brick inside.  The bread was fine but not quite worth raving over, and the oil/vinaigrette(balsamic vinegar?) was just ordinary.  Everything thereafter was phenomenal however, starting with a calamari appetizer for 9.75, a good number of unbreaded ( thankfully! ) rings of chewy goodness swimming in a sea of garlicky red sauce.  My cioppino was similar except with whitefish, mussels, shrimp, clams, and capers in the sauce, which gave it a delightful bite to it for 21.00, and the 3 slices of garlic toast was woefully insufficient to sop up every drop of sauce.  Thankfully bread re-fills are there for that!  My girlfriend's Gorgonzola Gnocchi for 16.00 was RIDICULOUSLY good, and I normally hate those who unnecessarily capitalize but I can't help it, I can't think of any other way to convey to the reader how AWESOME this was.  Creamy, and even tangy somehow, cheesy perfection on perfectly cooked potatoey goodness.  Finally the tiramasu for 6.95 was a revelation on how tiramasu should be, with the perfect cocoa/booze/biscuit ratio to end our meal on an even higher note.  My iced tea was 2.50 as well but I don't recall seeing it on my bill.  It made the tip look better at $70 at least, go 30%! ( I almost never do that).  Man, just awesomely awesome, my style and humor are out the window this morning unfortunately, but I do love this place already."}
{"text":"A fine neighborhood bistro.  Service was excellent and they really made us feel welcome.  The owner was out mixing it up with the patrons, he said to us on our way out the door, \"see you tomorrow\".  Food was good, not outstanding, but definitely worth going to again.  Prices were very reasonable.  We will hit it again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and extremely attentive staff. This is the best Italian food anywhere in AZ!"}
{"text":"A favorite place to go when I'm craving good homemade Northern Italian food! Really love the risotto norcina. Jon & his staff are friendly & treat returning customers like good friends & family. It's a casual dining atmosphere. It's also  a good time to sit at the bar & chat with Kenji! There are so many great wine selections by the bottle or the glass! Highly recommend this great restaurant located off Higley & Brown."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  It is not a place that you would find from the road but I promise you that you will not be disappointed once you go inside and dine.  The service is amazing and the owners are amazing.  The food quality is very high and the taste will make you say mmmmm several times during your meal.  I highly recommend this place for a great date night!"}
{"text":"Good food, a little on the expensive side. I'm not sure if they have a happy hour or not but that would help."}
{"text":"Wow... never knew this place was here. Super wine list. Try the Pinot Nero. Menu has a wide selection. We had the bolognese and the spinach ravioli. Both were well done. Anxious to try some of the things on the menu with capers and anchovies. Good selection of deserts and it's right next to an Italian grocer/gelato shop. Who needs to go to Italy? Oh yes, the service was very good too."}
{"text":"We love to eat at small, locally owned businesses and found Alessia's from Yelp reviews.  We started off with our traditional dessert first.  You cannot miss the tiramisu.  It was the best ever!  My husband ordered the chocolate truffle, which I sampled.  it was good, but it could not compare with the tiramisu.    I ordered the Pollo Piccata.  It was unlike any dish I had before and was so good. It came with a large portion of amazing sauce, capers, and mushrooms.  Yum!   I have had Pollo Piccata before, but not like what I had tonight!  My husband ordered the Pollo Porcini which was equally delicious.     The place got pretty busy, but service was excellent.  We did have to ask for bread because they forgot, but that was not a big deal.  Our glasses stayed full.  The servers were great.  Tables are a little small.  I was a little cramped with the side pasta and my main entree.  I had my side entree in an awkward spot and not quite in front of me and spilled a little.   (O//o)  Portion sizes were generous, but I would have liked a larger piece of tiramisu--but that's partly because I love dessert and it was so good!  The owner was super friendly and funny.  It was just a wonderful, cozy atmosphere with delicious food.   We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"It has been at least 4 years since we went here for dinner. Happily, it's still the best Italian in Mesa - maybe in the valley. What a great place.  The lamb was perfect, veal superb.   They have an extensive wine list and the owner is always there to welcome you and help with questions."}
{"text":"wonderful experience!  the food and service was excellent.  we tried the pesto with chicken and loved it!  owner is on site and assures superb customer service!  found a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Had the Gnocchi Alla Brian, the gnocchi was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent. The service was excellent.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanted go out to dinner with my mother and sister.  We wanted something close to home but not a \"chain\" restaurant. After reading reviews we choose Alessia's and walked out wondering how we had missed this gem.   The atmosphere is quiet and spacious. You can hear the person across the table from you which is a bonus for communication.   The staff goes out of their way to ensure a delightful dining experience with many suggestions. I was especially impressed that one of the staff noticed a diner at an adjacent table had not eaten much of their pasta. After inquiring and making some suggestions, a new plate was placed in front of the diner to rave reviews.  With that dedication to customers, how can you go wrong?  Our pasta was fresh and perfectly done. But I must admit that it is the BRUSCHETTA con PROSCUITTO e MARSCOPONE that I can't wait to have again.   We do not drink wine but this looks like a wonderful place to meet someone for a glass and conversation.   We will be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to celebrate our 47th anniversary last night at Alessia's and we were not disappointed with our selection. The food was excellent, the team concept of waiting a table was great and their attentiveness was outstanding.  It was a memory making night so thank you and keep up the excellent work!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, tucked behind Applebee's, outstanding food, atmosphere and service.   Went with my wife and son, ordered three different dishes and shared.  Each one was better than the other.  Highly recommend Alessia's!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a wonderful find in Mesa.  Can't say enough about the service and atmosphere and fabulous food.  Would come back frequently if we lived here. Desserts to die for. Excellent Italian wine list"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and boy, what a happy accident that was. It is now our favorite place to dine and we love having Scott wait on us. The owner is engaging and pleasant. His wife is an amazing chef, trained in Italy. They have one of the biggest wine selections we've ever seen. If you aren't sure what to order, Scott has plenty of wine suggestions for you. They have music playing softly in the background which doesn't interrupt the normal flow of conversation. Servers are all top notch as is the food. The bread with the olive oil is delicious. I'm not normally a fan of eating bread, but when we dine here, oh yeah... love it. We drive all the way from Florence to dine here and do it as often as we possibly can. It can be a little on the expensive side depending upon what you order, but you get what you pay for. If you're going to complain about price point go to Olive Garden, for heaven sake. Your dinner will be mediocre, but you won't complain about affordability. Once you go Alessia's, you'll never view Italian the same way."}
{"text":"Can you say FANTASTIC!!  This place knows the meaning of TRUE Italian food.  I would recommend Alessia's to anyone looking for great authentic Italian food.  If you think Olive Garden is this $hit..... then don't come here.  I actually found this place on Yelp, and it sparked my eye because of it's great reviews.  I did a little more investigating and found out that it is a little hole in the wall located within a strip mall.  EVEN BETTER.  Any of you food lovers know that any hole is the wall with a almost 5 start rating is going to be FANTASTIC.  I for one was NOT disappointed.  I cannot wait for the next time we go back!!"}
{"text":"Loved my quiet outdoor dinner with hubby tonight as we start exploring the area (just moved here).  Excellent service with 4 people, yummy (big) homemade pasta menu with many options (and gluten fee choices).  Chianti wine special...plus Italian beer.  Did I mention chocolate gelato - truffle and cannoli (handmade) deserts?  Tucked away in a strip center...you might just miss it.  Don't forget they have a wine retail store with tasting events!"}
{"text":"My husband, brother, and sister-in-law decided to try something new. I'd seen the great reviews for this place so I recommended we give it a try. When we arrived the smell inside was fabulous! I thought \"wow, this place must live up to it's yelp reputation\". Unfortunately, I was wrong.   There wasn't any inside seating so we ended up sitting outside on the patio. It was a little cool outside but they had space heaters so it made it more comfortable. Almost immediately after being seated our water glasses were filled and a plate of oil and vinegar was sat infront of us for the bread. I was thinking that this was going to be a nice dining experience. However it took a good 10-15 minutes for our waiter to appear and briefly introduce himself before rushing to take another tables order. He was a little too chatty for me and seemed like he was trying really hard. Nothing against him, he was a nice guy and I'm sure some people like that in a waiter, but it just isn't my thing. About 5 minutes later some bread arrived which was pretty disappointing. Tasted like store-bought french bread that had been heated in a microwave (after a few minutes of sitting on the plate it became rock hard and crusty). 10-15 minutes later our waiter reappeared to take our orders. He was waiting on the 5 tables outside and kept disappearing inside so I'm assuming he was dealing with tables inside. I understand that he was a little overloaded but it was starting to get a little frustrating that it was taking so long just to get our order in.   My husband and I decided to share the Carbonara ($16 plus another $4 split-plate charge which we weren't told about and only realized when we received our bill...a BIG turn off for me!), my brother ordered the special which was some garlic shrimp ravioli in a white sauce ($18), and my sister-in-law ordered the spinach ravioli in a white sauce ($15). I thought it looked a little pricey but figured that if it was good homemade, hearty, filling Italian food then it would be worth it.   About 20 minutes later our food finally arrived. My brother's shrimp ravioli looked a little skimpy...only about 7 ravioli on the plate. He said the taste was fine (nothing great) but left still hungry and felt like for the price he was a little shorted. My sister-in-law's portion was also a little small looking...only about 7 or 8 ravioli and she, too, left hungry and feeling shorted. My husband and I each had a small bowl of pasta (since we split it) but were both very disappointed in the taste. It was bland and the pasta was not fresh made (definitely tasted like it came from a box). The panchetta was chewy and a little rubbery, not crisp like I expected. There were big chunks of cooked egg whites in the pasta which means that it wasn't mixed fast enough when the egg was added. Not the biggest deal I guess but for the price I was expecting some amazing home-cooked Italian food. I hate to admit it but I've had better Italian food from a chain restaraunt.   When our tickets came we were all left feeling like the price did not match the quality or quantity of food we'd expected. It's one thing to have huge portions and bland food, or to have smaller portions but amazing food; but to have small portions and bland food is disappointing. I had high hopes for this place given the great reviews and in the end felt bad that I had recommended such a bust for our night out. You know it's a bad sign when you leave thinking of over a dozen other places you wish you would've gone instead. I don't think I will ever go back and don't feel like I can recommend it to my friends and family.   Overall I'd break the rating down as follows:  Food: 3 stars Service: 2 stars Cost for what you get: 1 star"}
{"text":"The Wife and I were looking for a new date night location, so we decided to try Alessia's based on the reviews. We were not disappointed!  From the outside it doesn't look like much, since it's tucked into a strip mall corner.  But inside, the decor is warm and friendly. The staff is like family and provided excellent descriptions of the wide variety of pasta dishes. The house wine selection was affordable and delicious.  The food was fantastic, and exactly what we were looking for to have a relaxing meal.   The dining area is not large, but not crowded.  We could easily carry on a close conversation with about 3/4 of the tables seated.  The adjoining wine room seemed like a nice place for happy hour or weekend scene.  The wine selection was huge, but affordable for the novice.  I  highly recommend Alessia's, and we will definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I think the food was decent but WAY overpriced. I have no problem spending money on a good meal but this was a little stupid. The tiramisu was the smallest portion I have ever seen....and for $7.00...are you kidding me? The pasta sauce was watery and the risotto was bland. I wish I were more impressed, not to mention, when I ordered dinner the man who took my order wasn't exactly friendly and seemed put out by my call."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quality in every aspect! I walked in the small front door and was greeted by a sweet hostess who did not lose her composure when I stated i would be dining alone (the single diner always throws serving staff and hostesses a slight curve ball to test their reaction and with family and friends all out of down I was flying solo!) she offered me the option to sit inside or outside and I choose the fresh air option. It was a quiet little patio area and they have done a beautiful job making it feel warm, inviting and romantic. I can not even describe how fantastic my waitress was, Joanne I believe was her name (I'm sorry, I'm horrible with names) she was bright and cheery, made fabulous suggestions and quick accommodations to recommendations when I mentioned a few dietary restrictions I had. Everything was delicious from the warm bread and dipping oils, to the pesto linguini with added shrimp and a take home of tiramisu. Each person who came to my table was attentive and kind, knowledgable and composed. Although the food was divine, the staff I encountered seemed to be the element that truly places this quaint authentic Italian restaurant at the top of my list for all time. Thank you, so much."}
{"text":"This restaraunt was a bit of a dissappointment. It was overpriced, and the patio seating wasnt comfortable. Food was bland and the wine selection wasnt anything i couldnt find myself at a local store. Overall, it was \"Meh.\" No wow factor. Service was also slow."}
{"text":"This is great Italian food and wine. I had a prosciutto wrapped scallop dish served over risotto that was spectacular.  Take John's suggestions on wine!  He suggested 2 bottles of wine for us and both were very good.  We sat on the patio and it was great."}
{"text":"Good but not great Italian food and a little too pricey for the portion size.  The service is first-class but a little over the top - three different persons asked us if we wanted wine! And speaking of wine. the selection was extensive but they had no \"house wine\" (at a more reasonable price)."}
{"text":"Nice decor, huge wine selection if that's your thing. We went for an early (5-ish) dinner and were seated right away. Though I will add the place filled up shortly thereafter.  Staff has a \"team\" approach so everything moved efficiently. Staff maybe a bit over-soliticious as water glasses were refilled almost every time I took a drink and how's-your-meal? after every third bite.   But the food... the food was unbelievably delicious. Worth the tiny bit higher priced than Olive Garden type chains because it's so good. Had leftovers for brunch the next day and it was even better.   I will gladly return."}
{"text":"Dont let the location scare you. The food here is top notch - everything they make is AMAZING. They know their wines and they aim to please. The wait can be problematic, so if that is going to ruin your dinner, don't bother. I think its well worth the wait (relax, have some wine!)"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, was wanting to impress my wife. The hostess said there was quite a wait, as they just finished up a party of 19. We sat in the lobby and noticed there was three clean empty tables off to our left. So, I asked again to be seated. Once again, the hostess responded with her well-rehearsed nonsense about the \"party of 19 that just left.\" Three couples in suits and cocktail dresses came in and were treated like royalty. The manager seemed to know them. They were seated righted away. Sweet Merciful Lord, did you have to make it so obvious? I had to fight the suction to keep from being pulled out of my chair. As a third generation Sicilian, I have never accepted bad or disrespectful service. If they behaved this way in Chicago or New York, they wouldn't stay in business long. They can get away with it in Mesa because nobody seems to care, people act like doormats and simply \"take it.\" Pathetic. As for this Sicilian-Italiano, i pass on this dump!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try...everything is always fresh...service and atmosphere is always great...good prices large portions...One of the few good restaurants around that actually care about their customers and making sure that they have an enjoyable evening and they only serve quality food...make sure to save room for desert....been there 3 times in the past 30 days and always impressed and always tried something different..."}
{"text":"We try to stop here every time we're in the area. Great, happy servers, an owner who's always on sight and helpful, delicious Italian food. A lovely dinner outside on the patio. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times now.  It's is always great!  The ambience is very relaxed as well as classy.  The staff is very friendly & great !"}
{"text":"Truly a diamond in the rough! I am rarely in this part of Phoenix, and I was pleasantly surprised by Alessia's. The food was beautiful and delicious. The roasted vegetable appetizer was outstanding and the tiramisu is the best I've had in years. The atmosphere was warm and sophisticated and the service. . . outstanding! They stayed open late for us and were gracious and attentive when we were the last party in the restaurant. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and wine selection and he was awesome! I live on the other side of town, but I would actually drive out to Mesa just to experience this place again."}
{"text":"We were told to go to this place by a bar tender from another restaurant for their Tiramisu, which is AMAZING!!! And fell in LOVE with the place and the people!! So we went back just a few days later and are now regulars!   The Salads are SO fresh the seafood is delicious and the pasta is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything there and the portions are Very generous!   And they have a wine selection unlike any other wine bar in the Valley.   Alessia's is a must eat at Italians restaurant! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation to us and we are so glad we were told about it. This is a small restaurant tucked away in a strip mall of all places.  Right off the bat we were served with bread and this bread was so soft and crunchy and wonderful! We had Bruschetta for our appetizer and were super impressed.  Gnocchi and pasta primervera were the main course. The food was so hot and was a very large portion. We were super impressed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"food was quite good, 4 star + but expensive.  We were also seated at a table for two that should be redesignated a table for one.  Way to small for two plates, drinks and misc stuff.  If you do make it there, walk two doors down and get a gelato.   MMMMM"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. From the appetizer, dinner, dessert and fabulous wine. Great customer service from the hostess, waiter and owner. Top notch all around!!!!"}
{"text":"The gnocchi is amazing!  Had red sauce with the gnocchi and it was even tasty the next day, the portions are huge.  Spinach ravioli with béchamel sauce was truly one of the best sauces i've had.  We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful everything.  The food was great, service friendly and nicely paced, loved the patio seating, soft music.  Tried their wine tasting option available that night with dinner and it was just the extra perfect touch.  We have added this very nice locally owned to our preferred list (a very, very short list) for our pleasure and out of town company."}
{"text":"For those of you that are reading the reviews. I first want to say that there is a website. Read the menu before you go.  Second,  I have been going here for years and enjoy hearing John share stories about his children. So. If you ask them Shari would be more than happy to make you a kid friendly meal!  They are that accommodating.  Love this place. Food is always spectacular.   Make sure you sign up for their newsletter"}
{"text":"The food was great the bread they serve must have been from last week. Need to serve good old Italian bread."}
{"text":"Went back recently and my entree was prepared poorly. The pasta was swimming in water and the shrimp was so over cooked it had become rubbery.  Four of us went there to eat two had great entrees and two of us did not."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for takeout. I had good customer service on the phone and when I picked up my food order.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Alessia's Ristorante Italiano has been open since 2004. We used to go a few times a month and then stopped when somehow my husband and I thought they closed. Thanks to a fellow Yelper when I was looking for a great restaurant near our home I found this little gem again.  We were greeted by a friendly gentleman that we later learned was one of the owners - the other being his wife who is the chef. They have an interesting back story if you care to check out their website but I'll mention that they do know Italian food!  We opted to forgo the salads and were glad we did because the main dishes were hearty. There were four of us in our party and two had the Gorgonzola Linguini both agreeing it was delicious. Our friend had the Pesto Pasta and he raved about the flavor so good there too. I had the Cappelini Bolognese and was delighted with the flavors. Slow cooked sauce to perfection ~ just like it's supposed to be done. It's the only sauce made ahead due to the cooking time. Everything else is made fresh to order. My only complaint (and I really won't call it that) was that I like my pasta a little more el dente and I didn't ask. However I feel that an Italian restaurant should cook it that way so I don't always think to mention it.  The table shared a tiramisu and it was DELICIOUS!! I was sorry my friends ate as much as they did! I'm somewhat of a tiramisu snob so trust me if I say it's good - it is.  Really reasonable prices and outstanding service too. Best kept secret in Mesa. Love this little family restaurant and I will be returning to become a regular again."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! It's family owned and the owner makes the Italian sausage by herself and it is by far the best Italian sausage I've ever had. Wonderful service, wonderful wine and spectacular food. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little treasure to have found!  Absolutely delicious homemade Italian food..."}
{"text":"It was a bad evening. Entrees were served 35-40 min after the apps. No one told us anything until they said your meal would be up in 2 min.  Then The owner explained the kitchen was overwhelmed. Since the way they use the wait staff is that you have multiple servers. Not a good system since no one is responsible. Our servers were very inexperienced and not able to make any recommendation with the exception of the wine. The wine was good. The apps and entrees very OK, but not special.  After our dinners were served the owner apologized 3 or 4 Times, but it was way two late for that. If the owner/ waitress had informed us that the kitchen  was swamped and offered us a glass of wine, they could have made lemonade instead of sour lemons. No offer of coffee or dessert on the house.    It was really a horrible night."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner on the patio tonight. The weather was as perfect as the food, the service was great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and will be back on purpose. This authentic Italian fare is made with high quality ingredients and an obvious attention to detail. The owner himself helped us with our wine selection, and his choices were spot on. I felt like I had dinner with family. The food was delicious and unpretentious, and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Hands down best Italian in the valley.  Owner is always on site and is just a super nice guy.  The food is incredible.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well...thanks again fellow yelpers we loved this place.  Just one thing it is small and quaint.  Go early especially in the winter.  It was raining too so the patio was. Not operating.  Food. And service was great.  Homemade owner is out and about and you can feel and taste the passion.  We WILL be back"}
{"text":"This place is great. It has a slower tempo to it. So be prepared to enjoy a conversation with your companion/s, and share a bottle of wine, appetizers and a dessert. I wouldn't say the service is slow or lacking; they place a big emphasis on the pace. Italian wine is its own thing, and they have a wonderful selection. Get advice if you're unfamiliar with the different varietals. Great quality food, and well-executed seafood, calamari, mussels - not over or under-cooked. My only issue was that the bolognese reminded me of chef boy-r-dee, and the tables could be slightly larger."}
{"text":"Incredible gem of a restaurant in Mesa. In close proximity to Matta's so was a challenge to give up the local standard in order to try something different.  So glad we did! The restaurant has a quaint charm and the owner welcomes each of his customers personally.  The waitress was attentive, but not overbearing. The special was spinach lasagna with Gorgonzola cheese.  Apparantly, the specials rotate on a weekly basis and this one may not surface again for 3 months. Best lasagna we have had out here! I got on the mailing list to be notified when we can come back and enjoy it again.  We finally found our Italian spot in the valley.  Jon, the owner teased us on the way out, \"see you tomorrow. \" He may be doing exactly that!"}
{"text":"Dining here was highly recommended and viewed by others as a place of interest for quality Italian food.   They offer bread and olive oil / vinegar as a starter & appetizer for the table. Though, I've heard over the years that this isn't an Italian thing, as bread is fattening and olive oil is frequently used for main dishes.. I still enjoyed the concept. Took me a second to adjust to the sourish pungent taste, but all in all I took plenty of bites.  When you're hungry, you're hungry. Shoot, if you put a bag of Frito Lay's in front of me at a high end restaurant knowing the food won't be out for a minute, heck yeah. I'll still eat them.  Anyways, the wine expert at our table strategically selected a bottle of wine from the plethora of choices Alessia's had to offer. Chosen was..  2008 Bertani Villa Arvedi - Magnifioso, crisp, heavy alcohol content and intense with flavors. I'm not a wine expert, but the feeling that came over..  Red, red wine Go to my head Make me forget that I.. Still need her so  Red, red wine It's up to you All I can do, I've done But memories won't go No, memories won't go  If the karaoke machine was plugged in, ya boy would've went to town. I totally felt like I was in a UB40 music video from the 80's. My father then went on to tell stories of the court room, as he was a former lawyer, captivating his immediate audience and those surrounding. He's a loud guy. Give him a glass of wine and you'd think he's announcing at Nascar event.    Okay, enough about the wine. I ordered the Strangola pasta dish, which in my world, is pretty to the point and hard to mess up. The Italian sausage was tremendous. Flavored and seasoned to perfection. The sauce, though, was watery and kind of weighed down the entire plate. I mean, every bite excessive amounts of sauce would spew off my spoon and fork. Yeah, I had to use both cause it was just so.. slippery? I liked it, but only so much. It was a little too soupy for my blood. I thought I was going to devour this plate.. but I left quite a bit of food to rest on it. RIP. There was a time when I was renting a room from an Italian family, and they cooked up storms EVERY night. Because of this, I expect a lot from establishments like so.. and I'll say I felt the dish didn't have as much love put into it. In turn I wasn't too impressed.  It seems like everyone else enjoyed their dish and I have to give the staff credit. We were checked on frequently and they had us laughing from time to time. Kind of wish I had what the other folks surrounding me ordered.. maybe my review would've been different."}
{"text":"This was our (wife and me) first visit...WOW!! We are kicking ourselves for not going sooner. We have lived around the corner for almost two years!!   The services as amazing and the food is worth every penny and more!!  We were too full to enjoy their gelato place next door but we will be back!  The grocery/deli is a rare find so in a way, I hope not TOO many people see this.  Go once, trust us!!"}
{"text":"Second visit November 11, 2015  It's funny, the very first time I went to Alyssia's it was certainly a five-star restaurant.  That being said, tonight a slight blemish in their performance.  The owner was absent; no greeting, no hugs for the wives, no personal touches.  The waitstaff was diffident. The food too was rather bland and it didn't have the same charm and ambiance as the first time - so I've demoted them down to four stars due to my disappointment.  Perhaps it was an off night for them.  I will try it one more time before I give up on this great restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to dine here because it was highly rated and close to home.  The wait was an hr and a half on a Friday night at 7pm.  They don't tell you how long the wait is and keep telling you it will be anytime soon.  I had the lobster ravioli - just okay.  But I ate it all anyway because by the time we got our food after the long wait for the table, it was practically 9pm.  By 9pm, saltine crackers would be delightful to me.  My husband had the chicken parmasean and thought it was just okay as well.  Nothing special about either one of our entrees.  Dessert was good - I had the profiteroles and thought they were good.    We didn't think the restaurant was worth the money or the wait.  The restaurant also has a musty cheesy smell.    We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"After waiting an eternity for the hostess to show up (no one else from the 5-6 people who walked by us could seat us) we then spent another 15 minutes watching waiters walk by our table until I flagged someone down asking if someone could take our order.   Food was good, not great. My Che Calamari dish had so few pieces of calamari that I had to hunt for them and my dad's clam dish also had very few clams.   My cappuccino at the end of dinner was so watered down as to be un-drinkable.   This was our 2nd time there... the first time was much better, this time was unacceptably bad.   We won't be returning. Pity, they had something good which seems to have gone downhill."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with their foods although they are too busy all the time whenever we go there. I guess it proves their quality foods! Vongole pasta is absolutely perfect to my taste. Also don't skip their gelato shop right next door!"}
{"text":"One of the servers, Scott, gave me a sampling of wines to start....they were almost enough for a glass together. They take their wines seriously, and the food is delicious. Though I had the prosciutto and pea risotto - which was light and very flavorful - the tastiest item was their ground sausage, it was the best italian sausage in our fair valley. If we go back (it might as well be in payson), i'll be sure to try a pasta dish with their bolognese."}
{"text":"I would give four stars, but the wait problem makes me remove one star to make it three.  The food is good, but not exceptional.  I've been to Italy, so I know what real good-quality homemade Italian food tastes like.  This is not it.  Let me begin with the wait problem.  My party waited about 45 minutes on a Saturday night to get seated.  The restaurant was packed and the hostess could only tell us how many people were ahead of us and would not give us a time estimate.  We figured we would wait, it must be good if the place is packed.  We observed at least 20-30 finished diners exit while parties waited to be seated for a very long time.  Tables sat vacant and waiting parties did not get seated in a timely manner.  While I waited, I read other reviews commenting on this same issue!  (Some said it's worth the wait, others saying the contrary.)  We overheard exiting diners claim they waited more than an hour to get seated.  While my meal was good, it was not exceptional, and therefore not worth the wait.  My dinner date and I ordered the spinach ravioli and lasagna.  Portion sizes were fine (perhaps a little large).  Despite the wait problem, service was fast and friendly, but we ordered as soon as we sat down because we worried we'd have to wait a long time for our food.  The spinach ravioli was very heavy on the garlic, good, but not exceptional.  The lasagna was on the verge of being overcooked and was good, but not exceptional.  In conclusion, Alessia's has good food, but it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed our visits here.  It is a fresh and different dining experience in the area, unpretentious but still refined with excellent wine and food.  No wine snobbishness here and yet perhaps the best selection of Italian wines in the region.  Owner is partial to wines from Piedmonte.. a kindred spirit who is fanatical about Borolo.  One of the best authentic ragu Bologneise anywhere."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Mesa!!  A wonderful place to take a date and you can count on an INCREDIBLE dinner for sure. The wine list is 2nd to none and Jon's knowledge of it all, wine & food, is hard to beat. Not sure? just ask! Shari runs the kitchen and I have never been disappointed. She is a fantastic chef.   Try it, if you haven't, it will be one of your favorite spots in Mesa too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.  I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.  The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page."}
{"text":"Very strip mall looking restaurant in a \"L\" corner configuration which i am sure was challenging for the owners to set up.  Outdoor seating is available, but lacked any great pull to have you want to sit outside - no view, especially you are fenced away.  Staff are very friendly and co-owner John made his way through the tables to say hello.  One issue with the staff, we must have had at least 6 different folks serve and clear that may have been because it was later at night.  We ordered three pasta dishes -  1. thanksgiving lasagna (the special) - not a big fan and really could discern the tastes of the ingredients, for all the push it wasn't worth the order 2. spinach ravioli - the sauce had separated and was greasy 3. tortellini Bolognese - was pretty good I would rate the food a little above Maggiano's or Olive Garden.  Wine list is good and prices are not bad."}
{"text":"Little Italian restaurant in a strip mall.  But don't let that fool you.  Amazing food, great service and awesome dessert!  Service was great hands one of the best Italian restaurants from a quality and service perspective."}
{"text":"We went there because of Tiramisu   Without no doubt. It was really really good.  Nice atmosphere both indoor and outdoor   Food are fresh and delicious. Especially the bread. It soft and good test"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and overall was disappointed. Salad was good but the entrees were par to subpar. Had a pasta dish and gnocchi both tasted like they have from a frozen pre made dish. Quite disappointed as we have just moved to this neighborhood and was going for a go to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome place....very friendly staff, amazing service, DELICIOUS food, great ambiance.  Frequent often and always great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tiramisu, lamb, chicken, and alfredo angel hair!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a really nice meal here. The gnocchi is excellent. Fettuccine Alfredo is really good. For dessert try the tirimisu. They have an extensive wine list and the staff is very knowledgeable about the wines they sell. If you are not sure ask for a recommendation."}
{"text":"My mom, sister and I attended an Italian wine tasting event yesterday and had such a great time! We learned a lot about the grapes and regions. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The owner is a great host and the appetizers were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine.  Top notch for my wife and myself. We ate many places on our vacation and this was the best by far.  Not to mention the service was one of the best we've had in a long time. I had a special pesto ravioli and my wife had gnocchi. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and l have been patrons of Alessia's for years and have always found the food and service great. Last night, 8/25/17, we dined at the restaurant and were disappointed with the experience. The bread was old or had been frozen, our wine order was wrong, our salads were not fresh. I ordered my favorite dish, pasta with bolognese sauce and it was watery. One of the several waters who served us seemed to be trying to rush us out as she attempted to remove my dish as l was sipping my wine. When l complained to the maitre d about our drink order and our salads, he seemed to be irritated and his voice was a little too loud when responding. We probably won't return to Alessia's but we want to thank Jon and Shari for our previous great experiences and wish them well."}
{"text":"Im giving a 2 stars for the following reason:  The Cons: - Dinner took 2 hours to get through, even though we were seated right away. - Food prices are a bit high for most of their meals. Pasta with a little chicken not be an 17-20 plate. - Atmosphere was cramped. - Servers seemed to hover constantly. They have some weird system where everyone helps out with all tables. This creates an environment where you have someone checking in right after another server/busser has.  - Their olive oil they use for their bread dipping is extra light. Has no flavor. Surely with the price of meals, extra virgin can be used.  The Pros: - Servers and one of the owners were incredible nice. - Food tasted great. - Desert was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a tasty Italian Food Spot I saw on Yelp, I called in a order of Shrimp Alfredo and thin bread appetizer. I went there and my food was ready and everyone was friendly. I got home and ate the food and it was still warm and delicious.  Shrimp were nicely sized and cooked pasta as well. Prices are fair for the quality of the food. Overall a nice spot."}
{"text":"Out in east Mesa you are stuck in a barren desert of chain restaurants and diners that serve the needs of the Octogenarians coming down from the Midwest. Because of these conditions you take what unique and serviceable offerings are out there and you stick to them.  Alessia's is that option for Italian in the area.  The location is the classic strip-mall, something that Arizona has perfected,  and the menu contains the standard Italian dishes from up and down the peninsula.  Solid renditions of the old world originals with not too much in the way of American tampering."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food is fresh, it's served at the proper temperature and the portions are quite gorgeous. Tonight my wife and I shared an appetizer off muscles which was incredibly tasty and bountiful. We then shared a salad, which was served on two dishes by the kitchen. My wife had veal piccata with a side of pasta and I had the sauteed calamari with penne and a spicy red sauce. Each of the main dishes were wonderful. We skipped dessert as we were pleasantly full. Tonight we arrived at 5.45pm and were seated directly. By 6.30pm there was a slight wait, but that's not an issue as you can have a glass of wine or beer at their wine bar. We shall return and surely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This is our go to Italian restaurant everytime we come to the Phoenix area. Haven't been down for a few years and was happy to see they expanded. Food and service was excellent as always. Can't say enough about this place. Must try."}
{"text":"Excellent staff with tons of knowledge, even better food!! Would highly recommend anyone to come and try this place and see if you don't come back. Owner was very funny, and great at interacting. They were busy but got the food out plenty fast. Will most def be back again. My server was rachel who knew a lot about the drink selection and gave us many choices off the menu, which I ended up choosing the mare and cippino both were very fresh and huge portions. Thank you again Rachel and Jon made us feel like we were part of the family!! See you tomorrow , lol"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night with BF about 6:15. It was crowded, but not overly. I saw empty tables. We sat in the \"waiting area\" which was very nice. We had a sofa ll to ourselves. Extensive wine menu. We got a bottle of wine. Finally got a table about 7:15. We were greeted warmly. We said we knew what we wanted to order and were told someone would come shortly to take our order. About 15 minutes later, we got a plate with olive oil and balsamic, but no bread to go with it. About 10 minutes later, we flagged down the busboy and got some bread. Waitress came about 10 minutes later to take our order. Finally got food about 8:20. BF's steak was lukewarm. He sent it back. My salmon was OUTSTANDING. Spoke to the manager and he took the steak off the bill. He said they had a lot of large parties that night. All in all, I think we would return because the food was so good...."}
{"text":"So, we love the food, the atmosphere, everything. But please train your waitstaff how to handle glasses when they deliver and remove glasses from the table. Waiter was delivering water with his hands wrapped around the rim of the glass where our lips touch. Gross! Bussers we're sticking fingers in the glasses to remove them. Equally gross! These are absolute no no's in a restaurant like this. If it were a dump, I wouldn't bother. Raise the standard here."}
{"text":"Locals fav spot for wine and pasta.   The wine comes from an extensive list and you'll see rare finds.  Very quaint and authentic Italian. Family owned and run."}
{"text":"I had this bookmarked prior to visiting AZ and as it happened, it was near to our friends home. The service was amazing but the food, in my opinion, was bland. My hubby loved his lamb chop but my tortellini was so bland I couldn't even taste the prosciutto and the sauce was super bland cream sauce. Garlic? Seasoning? Not that I could determine. I would give it a 2nd try based on the service/staff though."}
{"text":"This is our fourth or fifth time here and we are never disappointed. Whether you are just a couple, or with a group of 10, the service is outstanding, the atmosphere perfect and the food is beyond my limited vocabulary. Soup, Salad, Entree and even the deserts are prepared to perfection. Tonight's visit was the perfect way to celebrate my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"really good authentic food! Service was incredible. No wait time, friendly & attentive staff. Definitely would recommend & go again"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when it come to this place. The tomato sauce is to die for on pretty much everything. The owner takes the time to come and meet and greet everybody at the table and give you his recommendations and cater to all your needs. It's great for an intimate evening with just your wife, but tonight enjoyed a large party and they never missed a beat. If you haven't been here or you've been here 20 times I recommend coming again and again."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!   Came in for an early valentines date on Thursday at around 530. We were seated right away at a nice table out on the patio (definitely recommend if the weather is right).   Service is quick and very polite. Waters were always full and they kept the delicious fresh bread coming!   We went with the angel hair carbonara and a tortellini. They were so flavorful and yummy!   Make sure to get the tiramisu for dessert, best we have ever had!   Will definitely keep coming back!   Well done!"}
{"text":"The best period. Hidden in a corner this Italian restaurant is superb. From the food to the outstanding ( 4 Star ) service and excellent wine list this is a restaurant you must experience to believe.  I just feel so luck to have stumbled upon it."}
{"text":"Exceeded all expectations. Wait staff was happy, friendly, and attentive. Everything from the appetizer, bread, and main courses were incredible. Even the water was amazing.   Would go again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers, we found this great little gem in our neck of the woods. We're always on the hunt for locally-owned restaurants and good Italian, and we found both in Alessia's. The fact that it was in Mesa and not central Phoenix was a plus!   We opted to sit on the patio, since the weather was perfect. There were a couple of other patrons outside with us, but it wasn't distracting in the slightest.   The staff was friendly and attentive, but not overly so. The owner came out at one point, checked on all the tables, joked with some of the regulars, but was very good at giving the couples on a romantic-type date (like us) space. We had different servers taking care of us, so it didn't feel like if we asked one for something it would start a war in the back. It was very much a team atmosphere.   The food was excellent. Warm, perfectly crusty bread with olive oil and balsamic for dipping was a great way to start off the evening. We started with the Pepata di Cozze (mussels). The mussels were tender and flavourful, the garlic and white wine sauce was great; not too rich.   We're big on sharing food, so we got two entrees to split: I got the Che Calamari Linguini and my partner got the Pescatora Nord Risotto. Both were just about perfect. My linguini was fairly light and full of flavour. The calamari rings were tender and not at all rubbery. The sauce had a little bit of a kick, which was nice. The risotto was bright and sunny, literally. Saffron yellow, with capers, clams, mussels and calamari. It was amazing! I think I may have enjoyed the risotto more than my pasta, but honestly I'm not too sure. Both were some of the best Italian food I've had in a long time. Fresh, homemade.   Dessert was pretty fantastic too. We wanted something decadent and chocolatey, neither of us being much of a fan of tiramisu (sacrilege, I know!). We opted for the chocolate truffle and we weren't disappointed. Zabaione cream, surrounded by chocolate, dusted with cocoa powder and whipped cream. Rich, but oh so good!   On the list of to-tries for next time: the gnocchi, the pescatora sud risotto and the chocolate lava cake. And there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"The is the best Italian food I've tasted that didn't come from my grandma's kitchen. I recommend the gnocchi Gorgonzola but everything is amazing here. All the pasta is made from scratch daily and the sauces have the most amazing flavor.  Don't leave w/o trying the Tiramisu.  The ambiance is super cute and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. Service was top-notch, food was delicious. Their tap broke after my husband ordered a beer, so they gave him a bottle on the house. I ordered the shrimp pasta, and my husband ordered the special which was chicken and pancetta. We were both very impressed. Bread was fresh out of the oven, and the canoli we splurged on for dessert was divine."}
{"text":"Overall this place looked nice and has good food. Tables were too close and we felt like you would be dining with all the people at the tables which surrounded everyone so we ate at the bar. Too pushy on the alcohol, not everyone drinks alcohol. Servings were small.  We ate at the bar it was okay, good service but you needed keep on top of the bartender. I would go back and eat again.  The wine selection was very good. I think a major plus is the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night and were impressed. The wait staff are all extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We noticed they had regular customers that they interacted with in a friendly way, all without neglecting any  other customers. And the food was incredible. My husband wanted to practically drink the marinara sauce from his lasagna. I got the risotto with homemade sausage and mushrooms. It was an earthy,  highly flavored dish.  Oh,  and i don't want to forget my Red wine sangria,  it was yummy! I'd recommend Alessia's to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the authentic Italian and the friendly servers! Make reservations or you could be waiting for 2-3 hours!"}
{"text":"The best customer service experience I have ever had. Great food and wine!!! They were more than accommodating to us and we had our 8 month old w/ us. They were really busy and we only had to wait 30 mins without a reservation. All of the employees were happy, upbeat, and worked very well together. I will recommend this place to everyone I know!!!! They also carry gluten free pasta. Which was a plus for my wife!!!! THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. Last time I was there, the owner greeted us and was super nice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I Googled \"best chicken alfredo in Mesa\" & Alessia's Ristorante Italiano and Vito's showed up as a result. We have been to Vito's so I decided to try a new place.  The atmosphere was great. There were other diners there even though it was only 1 hour before closing & the waitstaff were friendly & fast. We did not enjoy the olive oil with the bread, not exactly sure what was in it besides the oil but it was very strong.  My husband ordered chicken marsala and found the chicken to be stringy & the sauce to be very thin. His side was penne pasta with tomato sauce. The penne was either undercooked or very thick and the sauce was also runny. I had the chicken alfredo and found the sauce to be bland and the chicken slightly overcooked. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is not enough to bring us back again. Overall, we prefer the chicken alfredo at Uncle Sal's in Scottsdale if anyone would like a good recommendation to check out."}
{"text":"Restaurant opens at 3pm so a few of us waited outside in anticipation. Doors finally open and I came in with a party of 4 adults with 3 children. We sat waiting for our table to be prepared for 17 minutes despite their being a bartender a few feet away (which would indicate they did not work as a team). The waiter was filling water glasses n speaking to other patrons about specials before he finally sat us at our table. It was finally 350 by the time our food arrived (almost an hour after opening).   Food was alright despite there being lipstick on a glass. I had vegetables swimming in olive oil, the kids portions are very small. Sausage was bland and the pomodoro sauce tasted like store-bought marinara. Bread is excellent though.   Overall you're paying for nothing more than the atmosphere but I would not recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"After having a terrible experience at a restaurant nearby we decided to go here!  Now we're glad the other place was so terrible or we may not have found this place.  We sat out on the patio which was so nice and the food was just amazing!  The service was great, even the busser was very helpful with suggestions!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best Italian we've found in Mesa yet. The Veal was amazing as was the gnocci. Order some wine, sit on the patio and stay late. A great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Very friendly service .  This restaurant produces higher end culinary treasures.  Deliciously prepared and beautifully plated .   The coffee is imported Italian coffee, the Tiramisu is made in house and beyond delicious.  There appeared to be a challenge with the wine and water glasses. The water here is very hard and spots on glassware are difficult to avoid .  But...... they need to try.....  Regardless, we are already looking forward to our next visit there!"}
{"text":"I like Italian food. It's probably the only food I will take home, because the left overs are usually just as good the next day!  It's kinda sad that Alessia's is SO good that I don't even have left overs! We started off with bread and this amazing vinaigrette/oil combo. It was the best mixture I've ever had. For dinner, I had fettuccine with a homemade white sauce that was so creamy and filled with flavor, I couldn't believe it. The chicken I added was crisp and the spices used on the chicken complimented the white sauce nicely.  Side note: the owner (who served us) is a bit of a pompous...I'm thinking it has to do with the pride he has with his food/cultural differences...but still, brace yourself if he's there when you go otherwise he might ruin the food experience by his attitude.  Come, enjoy, and get fat! :}"}
{"text":"This place has prices like a five star restaurant, but only delivers at a two star level. The wait staff is very unprofessional, one of the female waitresses had black workout pants on, not even work attire. They are all extremely untrained. It was my mothers birthday, and they knew it, but none of the staff even mentioned it. The dining space is very small, and the food is just okay. I had shrimp primavera, it was swimming in brown sauce not even the pink sauce as described on the menu, it was horrible and runny. The salad was a joke, and made cheap! The wine selection is so over rated and has no complexity. I spent over $200 and could have gotten a way better meal for my money's worth at another place. I  have been here twice, and both times were disappointing, I will never go back!"}
{"text":"SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF. Everyone was helpful, kind of a group attack to serve you. Had the special pork tenderloin and side of pasta, very tender and the pasta sauce was really good. Wish it was bigger servings but I probably eat more than most."}
{"text":"Love the new addition and John the owner takes such great care of you.  The food (and drink of course) is always amazing.  If you have not had the cannoli...you are missing out!!!  Great date night location, and REALLY great for just a glass of wine and dessert..."}
{"text":"Solid red sauce that highlighted good pasta along with A very nice garlic beef tortellini.  Lamb was very nice. Puttenesca was OK."}
{"text":"me and my boyfriend ate here for the first time last night and all i can say is O!M!G! the food was some of the best Ive ever had and for a Wednesday night the place was pretty busy! from the yummy fresh warm bread, to the salad with the awesome shaved tomato pieces, to my HOMEMADE chicken alfredo which was most definitely the best Ive ever had in my life, and the raspberry cheesecake, everything was just absolutely amazing the service was great and the wine selection was HUGE! they were doing wine tasting for $18 each, i had to work today or i would have been all for it! i joined their E-Mail club so they will notify me next time it happens :) overall this place is a total surprise for being located where it is i cant wait to have an excuse to go back again now time to heat up the leftovers and have some lunch!"}
{"text":"I love the wine, the food, & the service here!!  The calamari appetizer is the best and is large enough for an entree!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so quaint and inviting...best kept secret in Mesa! We love to enjoy the wines from Italy and have never had the same one twice, the food is so delightful and reasonably priced as well as prepared in house...this is family owned and we have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food and service are both great!  Not sure why you'd go to any other Italian chain restaurant with this option.  Definitely plan on coming back, it is a bit unfortunate that we just discovered place.  The cannoli's are delicious.  The East Valley doesn't have many options... enjoy this one."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the East Valley.  Friendly staff, clean restaurant, food brought out promptly.  Incredible authentic Italian cuisine.  Had the veal and cooked perfectly. The bruschetta had amazing flavor.    There is also an Italian market next door.  So glad we finally tried this restaurant.  It won't be the last time."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my first choice for date night, and the only option for an anniversary dinner. It is owned by a married couple, the husband is the wine expert, and the wife is the chef. I love the large selection of wine. I love the knowledge that the owner has of the different wines, and I love that they make you feel like you are part of the family the first time you walk in. The wine is awesome, the food is awesome, and the atmosphere is awesome.   I like that the red wines are lightly chilled because it is rare to find that, and I think it makes it taste better. ( Red wines are the only wines I will drink, mostly red blends)  I highly recommend the calamari, my husband craves it often and gets giddy when we go there because he looks forward to it so much.   I have brought my children and they are made to feel just as welcome, and they also LOVE the calamari. They even fight over who gets to eat the ones with the most suction cups."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great. The food is outstanding and so is the service. The restaurant is much bigger inside than it looks. It has a nice bar, inside and outside dinning and a room for large parties.  The prices are good, portions are large and atmosphere is nice.  Dinner for two with apps, wine and dessert was $90. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"This restaurant had the worst food of any restaurant I've ever been to.  If you like their plates, you've never had a good meal in your life.  The bread and oil was terrible.  Risotto norcina was terrible and had no taste.  More like a terrible Rice-a-roni.  Spinach ravioli was a creamy mess and no taste.  Risotto nord was bad.  Veal marsala was endured.  Bruschetta was of the lowest quality I've ever had and anyone could have arranged it better.  It's not Italian food.  It's mom's or your own cooking if you barely know how to cook.  Server's were friendly and attentive but say things like \"Is it delicious?:)\"  I say: Of course you know it's terrible or you wouldn't ask me that way.  It's terrible.  Save your money!  Don't let them have it.  (One server introduced himself as: I'm the one who's taking your money.)  I repeat, don't spend a dime there!    How this became a recommended restaurant is a mystery to me."}
{"text":"Just got back from my first meal which was good and i have a few observations and tips to make your meal more  enjoyable. I have read through 40 + reviews and now see things a bit better. I hope the owners are reading this.  PRO'S - Very cute location and layout is nice. Cool bar area, wine store dinner seating and traditional seating.  Helpful staff, informative and pleasant.  Good house beer / Birra moretti- light &crisp Many wines to choose from 5-12.00  Good menu selection.  CONS-  THIS LOCATION IS A SNOWBIRD IMPACT ZONE ! WARNING !! WARNING !! We went at 5pm on fri eve and by 6pm it was a zoo. We had a good 40 minutes of quiet. You have been warned. Reservations for tables of 5 + only  The platooning of wait staff at every table sounds like a good idea in theory but the reality of it is quite strange. I see many reviewers made the same comment.. I watched a couple receive their check before their main dishes came !! Talk about strange! Even more strange was the head waiters comments to the couple. Whoa!! This has to change !  The food was good but it is what i call beginners italian. Their sauce is a basic loose red with light basil and fresh tomatoes mixed in. All of the food was mild in flavor and seasoning. This is not a \"johnny garlic\" type italian place.  The table bread was ok but the sliced chibatta toast with my cioppino was excellent !  The seafood cioppino should come standard with a side of pasta. This is an absolute must! 23.00  The Calamari appetizer was very light on Calamari and in red sauce. It should be a  traditional light fried calamari with red sauce for dipping.  I would not order it again otherwise  I enjoyed the meal and they have a special little spot that just needs a few tweaks to get to the next level.  Please try the Gelato italian grocer next door!  Snowbird alert !!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience I had here. Tonight I had the lasagna and it was out of this world.  I tried my friends fettuccini and it was the best we both have ever tried.  Reasonably priced and the owner is so nice !  Cute atmosphere. Romantic, small and quaint. I will absolutely be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good wine. Excellent food. One of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to.  And I am very picky, because I cook great Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Placed in the corner of a strip mall you might pass up at first glance. The decor is  pure Italian with low back ground music to set the mood. Fine Italian food with affordable prices. You can get a 10% discount coupon off their website. The risotto is superb, in which are several varieties. Good wine list and happy hour. Nice dessert menu as well. Supreme service from start to finish. Check out the Italian gelato shop next door. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went  there for the first time tonight for my birthday and this place is phenomenal! The food, service,  ambience...everything...did not disappoint at all.  I would highly recommend this place! We will  definitely be back for dinner or to celebrate any other occasion we may have."}
{"text":"Our second time dining here. It did not disappoint the first time, nor did it tonight. The bolognese with penne and also with tortellini dishes are amazing. Their wine list is killer as well. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I will definitely be coming back to Alessia's. I went on a Saturday night at 7 PM and the wait was not long at all. The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable and the wait staff worked as a team to make sure all guest felt welcomed and taken care of. The food was incredibly flavorful and my party and I agreed that it was \"the single best meal\" we have ever eaten. One of the proprietors, John, came over to our table to make conversation and check on us multiple times to make sure we were having a good time. If you live in Arizona, you need to try Alessia's."}
{"text":"We went to Alessia's once for dinner and the food and service was excellent. I decided to use the restaurant as our venue for my husband's 50th birthday. It was the perfect place. They set us up at their wine bar area. The room was perfect for our 30 guests. The  food served chicken marsala, penne bolognese and spinach ravioli were tasty and wonderful. Loved the chianti they had for us. We all enjoyed the evening . Thank you for all you did ! We would recommend the restaurant for a nice dinner and for a party venue!!! Five stars all the way"}
{"text":"What an adorable little place.  We went for valentines dinner and I love the low lights and  comfy feel.  It was a long wait but very much worth it."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night (8/18/16)with two other friends and the food was absolutely amazing. We had the caprese salad, calamari, ravioli as well as two deserts. Everything was just delicious and the staff was excellent! Everyone was so friendly and though my friends and I sat and talked for at least an hour we were never rushed and it seemed like we only had to drink half a glass of water before our glasses were refilled. I went home and immediately told my husband we had to have date night here! Wonderful service and amazing food...you can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant. We were seated on their patio which was tucked behind the restaurant, which is in the corner of the strip mall. There is an Italian grocer and gelato place next door, kind of like a Little Italy in east Mesa.   Service here was excellent and attentive. Our first waitress introduced herself and told us a bit about the restaurant. It's owned by a husband and wife team and the staff works together like family. We had several servers waiting on our table and it was easy to ask for anything we needed. They started us off with bread an a plate with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. For as much bread as we ate, we all ordered different plates, ranging from lamb, chicken, shrimp, calamari, beef, bruschetta, soup and salad. I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli in a bechamel sauce and I enjoyed it. It was a good size plate and I was surprised I finished it. I tried a few of the other dishes and liked them, even though I'm not big on Italian food and pasta in particular.   We skipped dessert even though some of the choices sounded great, since the gelato place was in the same complex and we planned to visit there before we headed over here. One of the servers who gave us the dessert menus heard me say gelato and said he wouldn't be offended if we went there because it's amazing, good attitude!  Overall, a really nice dinner here and I can see why they're popular. Far for us, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Probably the best Italian restaurant in Arizona. I prefer this place over more expensive places like Maggiano's. The atmosphere is cozy and private all while keeping very reasonable prices and portion sizes. I bring every family member that visits to eat here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad service, we sat for over 35mnts waiting for our wine, server never came back or check on us. I understand being busy, but this was a bit ridiculous.   Very disappointed with the way it turn out.  Hostess had no idea what she was doing or seem to care."}
{"text":"My husband and I live close by and decided to try Alessia's. When we walked in we were greeted by the bartender who said the hostess would be right back. We waited a few minutes and she never came. I was hugging my husband and this waiter decided to come up behind me and say hello as if he were going to seat us. I immediately let go of my husband only to find that he was just saying hi. The hostess still was not there so after a minute the waiter seated us and told us to sit where ever we wanted. So what was the point of waiting at all??? Anyways...  We browsed the menu and noting really seemed that appetizing to me. My husband asked the waiter how big the portions are for the fettuccine alfredo. The waiter looked at my husband like he was an idiot for asking such a question and said, \" I don't know, like average?  Does that make sense?\" My husband was pissed, but blew it off as to not ruin the evening. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo to split which came with a salad. The salad was good, but the alfredo tasted like EASY MAC! I would have sent it back, but I didn't want to make my husband feel bad because he chose the restaurant and I was hungry. The alfredo wasn't enough food, so we decided to order calamari from our SECOND waiter. Yes, they have multiple waiters as if they are TRYING to be a FIVE star restaurant, which they are not even close. Then our FIRST waiter came back to ask us if we wanted dessert, when we had just ordered something. I just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters. I felt like no one knew what was going on and that we kept getting interrupted.   Normally at Italian restaurants the calamari is fried, but not here. They set it in front of us and I was horrified. I did not want a nasty rubbery ring tomato soup. We sent it back and decided to just forget ordering anything else. We received our bill and noticed there was a $4 charge for \"splitting\" the EASY MAC. This place is such a rip off. We paid $18 for a two small bowls of EASY MAC. We did not see on the menu that there was a charge for splitting meals because if we had we would have not split a meal. I will never in my life come back to this place ever again!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was a favorite of my wife And I until today .... Tomorrow is my wife's 40th birthday and she choose to just have a nice intimate with me and our daughter . Well because we want to have a nice quiet diner and not a party they will not give us reservations . We would have to invite two more people for them to deem is worthy of a table . Would you want to wait for an hour on your birthday ???? NO !!!!!! So I have to say if your for nice and romantic don't go here. Your party is to small for them to care about. Thanks anyway"}
{"text":"Well!!! This place was recommended by someone at work and since I'm from the north valley I wanted a good Italian place other than riggys in the east valley...I must say, my coworker is going to hear about it  First thing the place is in a so so place in Mesa. Right next to a \"massage\" place. Looks can be fooling so we thought we would give it a try. We came in and had to wait to be seated with many open seats inside. Opened the menu and wow...prices were very high!!! Ok the food must be good right?   The waiter perceived to tell us that their wait staff works as a team...very weird We didn't see the same waiter or waitress once....horrible idea for a establishment.   There was 4 of us and we ordered different things. We waited 1.5 hour for food. They told us they had a big party but that's not really an excuse. They didn't even offer to comp us an app. We didn't realize we would have over a hour wait for food. We had to waive a random busser or waiter down to get refills and or more bread....horrible.   When the food came we were all starved. The risotto was under cooked and very mealy. The pasta was all supposed to be a scratch made...a total lie. Look at my other reviews. I get around the ARIZONA restaurant seen. The other 2 people we went with mention there food tasted of chef boy r d and spegettios. I tried and agreed. Really bad for 15+ bucks a plate   Once finished we just wanted to leave!!! We again had to waive down a random to get us our check. I felt so bad for recommending  the place I picked up the bill.   One small tid bit or rather tall the urinal  was way too tall. I'm 6'1 and had to get on my tippy toes to pee. For the other in my group it was just too much.   I hate Olive Garden but it's better then this place!!  As with all my reviews, I hope the owners read there reviews and not just the good ones to try an improve. Perhaps I'll give them another try if I hear from them..."}
{"text":"As my family has known Jon Carr, the owner of Alessia's, for many years, we will always be fond of his establishment and promote his business as much as we can!  As he has expanded his quaint dining into a full bar and restaurant, Alessia's has grown into quite the place to dine.  His pasta selections are amazing... each one of them!  And make sure you save room for dessert, as his wife makes them from scratch!  John is always an entertainer and will do anything to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Bit of a wait, but once seated and served you'll understand! The food is delicious and you can tell it's all homemade! Prices a little up there but it's definitely worth the splurge every now and then! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Hidden in the corner of this strip mall. Our server was very personable and knew her stuff.  They brought out bread with oil, balsamic vinegar and pepper.  My wife and I started with the salad. Her's was the Insalata Contadina and I had the Insalata Gorgonzola. Both dishes had fresh produce and the right amount of dressing. My wife also ordered a glass of Chianti which she enjoyed so much that she bought a bottle to bring home.  Our entrees where Carbonara and Pomodoro Basilico which I chosep Angel Hair pasta. I should have ordered a different pasta cause the pasta stuck together but tasted delicious. I like the kind of pasta that are loose and a bit thicker like linguini which my wife had with her entree. The entree was so delicious that I used the bread to scrape the bowl clean. This place is on our list for a return dinner when we are in the mood to travel since this place is 45 minutes away."}
{"text":"I dined here Friday night and it was fabulous.  I just moved to Gilbert and wanted to try something from dining downtown all the time and this place was a hidden gem! The staff was all very attentive and the owner Jon even came to our table to greet us.  We ordered a mix of bruschetta's (homemade sausage to die for) and had the spaghetti carbonara.  The place also has a plethora of wine that you can enjoy there or buy to take home.  Can't wait to go back to fully enjoy their wine bar."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.   Husband and wife run the entire restaurant. Husband focuses on front-of-house while wife cooks and manages back-of-house. He is always talking and joking with all of the tables, making sure everything is perfect.  So for the reviewer getting annoyed by being called \"M'lady\" - Get a grip!!!!.... He's a friendly, genuine person. So yes, if he stops by your table...he may actually talk to you for 2 minutes and have a conversation! He's a quirky guy - he likes telling jokes.   Food is excellent. You must get the MUSSELS for an appetizer!  I've actually never sat inside - but the tables are close, that's the Italian way! Sit outside if you can - more private - and they have amazing heaters for when it's too cold.  I also have to commend them on their servers and bussers. Very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. Every time."}
{"text":"The. Best. Ever.  The owner's are amazing - friendly, warm, and talented!! Recommendations are great, and they'll also try new things, which always end up amazing.  I recommend this place to everyone I know who ever travels within 50 miles of this place...it is a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally after seeing this place from the Gelato store next door, I had to try it. I was so pleasantly surprised with the whole experience that it will now be my favorite Italian place in the East Valley. After driving for 3 hours I wanted to be fed right now and I wanted Italian food. So I came off the 60 and drove a little north to give it a try. After finding out it isn't anything like a chain establishment with Northern Italian dishes, I was in heaven. All the dishes were described as Sauteed to Order. WOW! When they said that they had homemade Lasagna from the owners recipe for dinner, I was hooked. Add a small Gorgonzola Salad and some wonderful Sweet Red wine and I had one of the best Italian meals I've enjoyed outside of Firenze. After reading the menu before I order, I can assure myself that I will be back over and over again. The wine list is fantastic as is the dessert menu. If you love Italy or Italian food you will be very pleased after a meal here/"}
{"text":"A favorite for date night for my wife and I.  John and the staff are very welcoming and the food is never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, 6 different dinners ordered this evening and everyone loved them! Great Chianti recommendation and the service is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Bolegnese not soupy or overly garlic. House Chianti nice. Risotto de mare looked good, but I didn't taste. Fresh bread and oil balsamic nice touch. Open at 3. That helps weary travelers that don't want to wait until 5. Friendly staff. Cooked to order. Give it time."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and it only gets better!!! The hospitality, service and food are far better than you'll find anywhere!"}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful Italian restaurant in Mesa. Not only is the food absolutely excellent and the chef will taylor any meal to fit to your liking. My wife, very best friend and I frequented this restaurant at least once a week, as my friend had a severe garlic allergy but loved Italian. They not only catered to her allergy but made special dishes to accommodate her dietary restrictions.  Then there is the staff, all people from hostess to busboys and waiters and waitresses are so kind and helpful. They served us with not only a smile but kind, familiar conversation.  Last week we went in after about a 3 month break, as our friend passed away back in September and it took me a while to be able to go back. When we shared with the waitress that we had suffered a great loss in losing our friend, she looked and acted genuinely hurt. She offered hugs and sweet memories of our friend. Next came the waiters. Scott and I believe Trent is his name, please forgive me if I am mistaken, both came out and offered hugs and comforting words.  Not only did they make it a wonderful experience, as we were there to celebrate our friend's would be 75th birthday, but when we received the bill, it has already been paid. The waiters and waitresses covered our meal in honor of our lost friend, and wished us all well and invited us back soon.  This is a wonderful place to eat, with genuine human kindness. You absolutely must give Alessias a try, but go right at 5, as Mesa has their number and the place is intimate and cozy and fills up quickly!! Thank you to you all at Alessias!! We will see you soon!!  June 23,2018 Once again, amazing dinner, even better service and hospitality. Scott and the rest of the crew are the best. The kind of place that remembers your order and which wine you like. Never disappointed. If you are looking for a very delicious, stick to your ribs Italian meal at very reasonable prices, this is your place for a wonderful date. Thank you guys, so enjoyed our meal and your kindness!"}
{"text":"I never give reviews, I just don't take the time, although I do rely on your reviews all the time. But after our dinner tonight I decided I have to review this restaurant. The food was fantastic. So good. And the service was really really great. We were in a bit of a hurry so they made sure we got in and out very quickly, even on a Saturday night. We will definitely be making this a frequent stop!"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience here tonight.  It's not a big place, but the bar, dining, and patio areas are very cozy and well kept. Service was fantastic, and the wine selection was extensive. Ordered the Cappelini Puttanesca for dinner and thought it was a home run. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"166 reviews & this place has 4.5 stars? You have to be kiddig me! EVERYTHING that comprised my meal tasted frozen or canned with one exception. They tried to dress up the blah by putting a little bit of fresh basil on everything."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for our first anniversary dinner. We were pleasantly surprised, the staff was extremely helpful and nice. The food was fantastic, we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were there on a quiet Thursday night for an early dinner and our experience was great.  The shrimp appetizer was amazing, my wife ate every bit of a generous serving of lobster ravioli, and my penne carbonara was delicious.  I highly recommend this local establishment for any looking for authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"We were sitting there for an hour to get our food when there are only 3 tables at the patio. No olive oil come with the bread. We ordered appetizer and they never came back for main entry order until the appetizer was on the table. We had the dinner special and lamb. The lamb was not impressed at all. The meat was over cooked and lock of flavor. I like the environment and the stuff was nice and friendly. Although for the price the time we spend here, the food is not worth it. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I am blown away by this little diamond in the rough! This quaint little restaurant is tucked back in the corner of a strip mall in Mesa. I have heard a lot of whispers about this place and had to check it out myself! Absolutely amazing! The restaurants atmosphere is so peaceful and relaxing you can't help but enjoy yourself as soon as you walk through the lit court yard into the front door greeted by smiling faces. The staff is very friendly and the owners actually work here. It's owned by a husband and wife, the wife is the chef and the husband runs the front. Very promising future for this little restaurant, as for the owners love what they do and work very hard at making their customers happy. They are very caring and personable with each customer; you don't see this kind of attention in businesses now a days! They have a great menu; our food was fresh, authentic, mouth watering.... Great selection of wines....... make sure to leave room for dessert! Definitely left with my big ol food baby!! John and Shari expect to see us back very soon! Thank you for such a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Worst meal EVER!  Calamari fishy. Literally had 5 different waiters. Bolangese was mushy and tasteless in lasagna. Lobster ravioli same. Tasteless. Ciopinno fishy. Clams inedible. Again no flavor. Excellent Alfredo but chicken flavorless. We said nothing as we did not want to damper our sons 35th birthday dinner"}
{"text":"The carbonara  was the best I've ever had! Great wine selection but pricey.  I'll be back here but will sit in new as room or bar because air conditioner could not keep up in July!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Enjoyable night.  Mussels appetizer was really good."}
{"text":"We went for the first time last night. The food was outstanding.   We had veal piccata, chicken piccata, veal Marsala & chicken Erbe.  And the salad with the shaved garlicky tomatoes was the best ever! We brought our friends visiting from CA & they loved it too. Just because it's in a strip mall doesn't mean it isn't nice. Lovely interior - white tablecloths - Italian opera playing. Felt like we were in Italy. Outstanding service - orders came quickly. Definitely our go to Italian restaurant from now on. Wish I was there again tonight."}
{"text":"We just left and we loved it! We were there celebrating our anniversary. It was romantic and the staff was helpful and friendly! The food was amazing and the wine even better! I couldn't pronounce a thing on the menu and everyone was still so accommodating. I have not one bad thing to say about our lovely evening."}
{"text":"Best service:) calamari, best appetizer!!!! Ladies! So most wine choices very clean!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing wine show over 18 wines and a beer table. Great food served and apps. There was an  awesome group of people too. It was great place to beat the heat."}
{"text":"This is the only Italian restaurant I go to. The wine room is gorgeous and the selection is plentiful. It's a small, intimate restaurant with casual feel. Definitely one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Long time fan, great food, Jon is awesome. This visit was unusual, however.  Been coming to Alessia's for years now, I try to bring everyone I know, it's that good. Great food, wonderful people, and great Italian wine selection. It's always a pleasure to see Jon there and he really makes you feel special.  Only had one issue this last time, we sat in the new annex room next to the bar and it felt a bit like a no man's land regarding service. Our waiter came around infrequently and not once throughout our main course were we brought water or asked about wine, etc. I would have ordered another glass if only I had been asked! Also, had to dine among our dirty plates from appetizers as they never came to get them.  Felt compelled to leave a review this time because this was not normal for Alessia's, that said, I'll be back for sure, no where else can you get great food and authentic Italian wine! Thanks, Jon! Don't forget about people who sit in the new, wine tasting room though!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience twice!! We had a great meal last week, thought we would try again!  BETTER, best, great!  We feel like we made a discovery of a hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"This is a small Italian place. The food is really good, but I have had better dishes elsewhere. I can't say that I love everything on the menu, but I am always satisfied with what I get.   I like the atmosphere a lot- quaint, family owned, the staff is personable and friendly.   It is a tad on the expensive side, but I think the food and service is worth the price."}
{"text":"Small but sweet little family restaurant with authentic Italian food! Friendly service and they have indoor and out door seating and a bar as well.  The bread was awesome and our entees too. Everything was made fresh and tasted it too. The owner shook our hands and was very gracious. We paid $50 for two with an appetizer and tea."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night and it was fabulous! We started off with the bruschetta and it was different but delicious. The wine list is unbelievable and the wait staff is very knowledgable about the various wines as well as the dishes they prepare. We had the lamb and it was great but I should have gotten the pasta side dish, too! Next time for sure! We also had the Gamberi (their shrimp and pasta dish) and it was outstanding, too. Will definitely be going back to continue working our way through their wine list and outstanding menu."}
{"text":"This is one of those little places that you drive by 15,000 times and always wonder to yourself, \"Hmmm I wonder if they are any good\" and then one day you decide to go there and you are blown away at how good it is! They are tucked way back in the corner and if you blink you will miss them, but wow their food is great! It is not a cheap place so if that is what you are looking for, keep on driving, but they have great food, great service, and a great atmosphere. Our first time there, the inside was pretty busy and there was a wait, but they offered the patio for us. It was a little bit chilly out (here in AZ anything under 70 is cold) so they immediately brought over to our table 3-4 giant patio heaters and fired them up for us to make us comfortable. It was awesome, like we had our own private patio for our first dinner there (Maybe that is how they get you sucked in!).   Go there and order something! You will not be upset I promise you! They will even customize any order you want so don't hesitate to ask!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food! Beats all others! The cioppino is incredible! Wait staff works together beautifully. Love going here! They have an outdoor patio that is romantic as well as very relaxing."}
{"text":"The high reviews of this restaurant say more about the Italian food offerings available in Mesa rather than the quality of the restaurant itself. The service is always good but the food is typically unremarkable. Some dishes are better than what you would find at Carrabas or Olive Garden (the other pathetic Italian food staples in Mesa) which is why this place gets such high reviews. However, if you've ever had great Italian food, or even gone to a nicer chain like Maggianos in Scottsdale, this place is very mediocre. The food is often oily and chalk full of garlic. Other than garlic the taste is often under-seasoned. It's just not good. Not bad, but not good. If you never leave Mesa to eat though it may be the best Italian food available to you."}
{"text":"If you want to impress family, friends or a date, this is the place!  Their food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Always good food, Juicy Burgers, excellent Filly Cheesesteak great Fish and Chips. Service has always been good. Can get busy early on game days and fish fry night."}
{"text":"Food was good. Not as flavorful as I was expecting based on the reviews. You do not have one server but rather all of them cater to you. At times this was too much."}
{"text":"We've been on the hunt for a family owned Italian restaurant with homemade food, a warm atmosphere, and inviting staff. Alessia's surpassed our expectations.  Small and quaint, we were seated in the indoor dining room and quickly greeted by the waiter/owner. We took a while to order, but this was due to everything on the menu looking so appetizing. In addition, they have a huge wine list, sure to please a connoisseur, with about 150 different bottles.  After we ordered, we were brought very warm bread with olive oil and vinegar for dipping. The oil was great with the black pepper, red pepper, and spices.  We ordered the Insalata Gorgonzola with one of our entrees; the dressing was light, the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar went well with the Gorgonzola, and the fresh diced tomatoes made this a fantastic salad.  We had the Puttanesca and the Lamb Ciociara. The Puttanesca was outstanding. The sauce was deep, a little earthy, and the pasta was packed with olives, onions, capers, and most importantly, flavor!  My order of the lamb came out with the side of angel-hair pasta. The sauce on this lamb entree was outstanding. If we could have bought jars of the stuff we would have. The flavors of the pesto and fresh tomatoes complemented the fullness of the lamb, and the onions added a little sweetness to this savory dish. I did however find the lamb to be a little too grizzly for my liking. Although it was boneless and trimmed a little, I don't enjoy having to dig around the fat and grizzle to get to the best part. The staff here is so accommodating and so superb that I was able to switch out my dish for the Pescatora Sud Risotto (southern risotto): best decision possible.  Shortly after asking for the risotto, John brought it to our table, and this risotto was the highlight of the trip. I asked for it to be prepared spicy, and the spice was not overwhelming where it masked the rest of the entree, but it was enough to remind you that you did in fact request a spicy dish. The mussels were creamy, shrimp was flavorful, rice was cooked right, and the plate did not have a fishy smell or aftertaste. The risotto itself wasn't super creamy or heavy, but it still was loaded with flavor and the portion size was big enough to fill you up. Packed with a great assortment of seafood (clams, mussels, calamari, etc), this is definitely an entree to have again.  Eating at an Italian restaurant requires us to try their homemade Tiramisu, and this was no exception. The description didn't lie; layered with a light marscapone cream made this Tiramisu one of the lightest we've had. It didn't have a lot of espresso or alcohol flavor, but the portion size was enough to share, and the airiness didn't make you feel like you ate an overwhelming dessert. Recommended for sure!  We will definitely be back as this is one of our top choices for a family-owned Italian restaurant. John knows his food and his wine, his wife sure knows how to create spectacular meals, and they both know how to treat their customers"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food. I highly recommend getting the special of the night ! Good customer service as well.. I really enjoyed when the owner came to our table and personally asked how our meal was. I'm assuming his wife was the main chef. Will definitely recommend to clients."}
{"text":"Great food and service. All in our party got a different meal and all loved it.  I got the special of the day. Sausage and Angel hair. My wife is pretty picky and she loves the chicken piccatta."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place, for a little spot in a shopping center!  I'm pretty sure it was the owner who seated us himself and checked back multiple times. I think it was an actual cook who came out and checked that our salads were good. The female server who brought our drinks and food was very sweet, answered questions and joked around.   We ordered the seafood mare' and a chicken dish (I forget the name even though I get it everywhere; it was a chicken breast in white wine sauce with capers). Both were very good, though my sauce was kind of odd; it was thick and a little starchy; I'm used to a clear, thinner, more lemony/winey sauce if that makes sense. This may just be how Alessia's does it, to each their own :)    I only have 2 minor negative comments:  1) The initial waiter we were given - the owner had grabbed him as he went past and told him to wait on us, and he made it obvious he was not pleased. I got the impression he was about to be cut and sent home except for our sitting down. We saw very little of him, since they have a 'team' system, so he wasn't an issue  2) Their iced tea is not plain iced tea; it was a sweet fruity variety. We thought it was a mistake until we were brought a refill of the same kind. Unless the initial waiter screwed up the message, I don't know. We didn't want to be THAT table complaining about iced tea, since the nice server was busy with a large party."}
{"text":"Tonight we stopped in again, on a whim. A drizzly  Wednesday night and the place was packed!  We ate at the bar tonight. Service was great, thank you Kenji, as was the food. I had tonight's special, portobello stuffed ravioli. My young man had his favorite, the brunello tortellini. The ravioli was served in a mushroom, garlic cream sauce. Not too rich, it complimented the ravioli nicely. The brunello was great, as usual; sautéed pancetta and peas with tri color cheese tortellini in a garlic cream sauce.  Tiramisu was in order for dessert. It is house made and very delicious. Definitely a gem in north east Mesa."}
{"text":"Food and service were fabulous! Everything from the  bread and balsamic and olive oil combo to the main pasta dishes and dessert. The sauces for each dish we tried were unique and flavorful. Didn't get to try the home made tiramisu, but we will definitely be back to do so."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because a. I love Italian food, b. A few people told me I needed to go here, and c. It has a cozy decor, quiet and romantic feel.  Pros- the service is good, my water was never empty, and plates were cleared quickly.  Cons- the food.  Bread was completely average- nothing special.  My house salad although flavorful was completely drowned in dressing. And onto my meal- spinach ravioli. I think the ravioli would have been great, but I could not taste it due to the obscene amount of garlic cream sauce it was drowned in. After that amount of garlic, I will never have to worry about vampires or my husband ever kissing me again. I have been here one time before and had a pasta dish with pancetta, peas and cream sauce. The sauce was so rich that it made me feel sick and lacked any real flavor."}
{"text":"We ate there a couple nights ago for the third time and it is consistently excellent. Prices are fair and the service has been excellent. We really like this place."}
{"text":"One of Mesa's little hidden secrets. Must go! Reservations only for 5 or more so go before you are starving, wait may be half hour to 45 minutes but definitely worth the wait and no matter what you try, if it does not have the sausage IN it, get a side, delish! Beer and wine license only,,,,the house Moscato is just bubbly delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian food i have ever had besides being in Italy. The staff is first rate and very professional. They know the menu and give superb recommendations. While it may seem to be hidden and out of the way....it is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Atmosphere is okay.  Staff is tops!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth it. Quality is so much more than the chain Italian restaurants. It's small, it's loud, it's decorated like little Italy. The kind of atmosphere I would expect and want from a family owned Italian restaurant. We will definitely return for another date night."}
{"text":"I went to Alessia's on a Friday night with my best friend. After reading the reviews I expected it to be unbelievably busy since it was a Friday night. When I came was a ghost town. I had only heard of this restaurant form reviews so I was on the fence about actually going and leaving the comfort of the usual chain restaurants. One thing that already had me maybe rethinking going there was its location. It is nestled in a tiny little corner on Brown road and Higley. I found it very hard to find since there were no signs. Personally, if I'm having trouble finding the restaurant I probably won't like the food. Boy was I wrong! Alessia's is as if you were actually in Italy itself. It puts Olive Garden to shame! As soon as we walked in the atmosphere was very warming, the seating area was a little small but there was a large outside patio seating area to make up for it. The staff is very polite and attentive, catering to you every need. Our waiter was entertaining and knowledgeable about the menu items and where in Italy they originated from. One of the things that did turn us off was that the sodas came from soda cans that you could hear them opening in the kitchen. The restaurant wasn't too busy at all, so it was an overall great dinner experience. They had a wide variety of Italian wine. The wait for the food was average and pricing compared to others is slightly higher but it is very much worth it.  It is truly a hidden gem, good food humble restaurant and great food. Alessia's had a very intimate romantic feeling, I probably won't take my best friend there again but I would bring it up to my boyfriend. With all the factors of the experience I'm giving it four out of five stars. The food was the best Italian I've ever had but the one thing that ducted them a star was the difficulty of finding the restaurant. A tip I can give to food-lovers like myself that if you find a place you're dying to go to just do it! I would have never found this amazing place if it weren't for all the great reviews."}
{"text":"Holy cow, I love this place. Ridiculously fantastic AUTHENTIC Italian food. SO delicious, the owner is hilarious and accommodating. This was probably the best Italian food I've had, it was all so fresh and it came pretty fast too. Fantastic place for a nice date night, the perfect hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great tasting food all made  from scratch and you can literary taste the love and care that goes into each dish."}
{"text":"Seriously the best, freshly made Italian food I've had in a while. Casual but high end food quality. Our service was friendly, inviting and soo wonderful"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. We were seated quickly. Service was very good.. attentive staff. Had sausage bruschetta and the cioppino. Large portions..authentic recipes. Tiramisu was awesome as well. I wish we had known about it before.. will return."}
{"text":"Would not eat here owner rude after checking in they would not accept the $10 off coupon offered by this yelp app. Service was not poor food way to over priced!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! We saw it on a 'best of mesa' list and wanted to try it. When we arrived we were kind of sketched out by the location, its in a yucky strip mall next to an Asian massage parlor. Once inside though it is not so bad, decor is a little bit dated but it is very clean, and smelled wonderful.   We were seated right away (7 PM on a Sunday). The service was really quick, and they were amazing about refilling our water, I don't think anyone in our party had less than 3/4 glass at any given time.   The table was a little small for 4 people, so when they brought out bread and olive oil two of us couldn't get to it because of all the stuff on the table.  The bread was excellent though- we were referring to it as clouds. Slightly crispy crust and melt in your mouth center. It was incredible.   We started with a prosciutto and fig bruchetta, it came with four pieces and they were all piled high with the prosciutto. There was a thin layer of fig underneath. It was good, a little on the sweet side.   We all really enjoyed our food too. If you are expecting typical over seasoned/over sweetened  spaghetti sauce; this is not the place for you.  Their tomato sauces are just that- tomato ( and not the toxic canned garbage) with seasoning, such as basil shreds and cheese. Simple and classic. The portions were decently sized too.  The ravioli came with 8 3\" raviolis, the gnocchi was a full layer on a 8\" dish. ( lots of extra sauce for eating the extra clouds with.)  We ordered a chicken dish ( I don't remember what exactly) but the chicken took up the whole dish as well, and then there was a small bowl of pasta on the side.   It is worth checking out,  the place is small though so I could see there being a wait if you go at peak times, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mesa.  My wife and i have eaten here twice and the owner has come by to check on us both times and the food is INCREDIBLE.  Get the lamb."}
{"text":"This review is specifically due to the outstanding customer service my family and I received by John, the owner.   He clearly cares and makes sure everybody feels special, and this attitude is clearly shared by his excellent waitstaff.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had been here several years ago and the food was outstanding. Went last night for our anniversary and we did not have the same experience at all. My husband ordered the risotto - which was not risotto, but rather rice.   He said it wasn't much better than Rice-a-roni. I had the gnocchi - which was almost too salty to eat. It was a great disappointment. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We dropped by based on the reviews. Delicious north Italian food and they have an extensive wine list. Great service."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going to Alessia's. It's without a doubt the best Italian Restaurant we've found since we moved to Mesa from the Chicago area a few years ago.  There's a very nice wine bar/tasting room attached. Next door to that is a Gelato shop and next door to that a Italian grocery/sandwich shop with a small seating.  We've been sending friends here since we first tried it. We've always had good feedback. The staff is always knowledgeable and they know the menu well. Don't be afraid to ask for recommendations. Everything is freshly made to your order."}
{"text":"Alessia was opened several years ago by John, who used to be at Red White and Brew. we have been going to his lovely restaurant since it opened, and we always enjoy our food !! the pasta is very very good (i'm italian, so don't say this lightly) and the chicken alle erbe is also very very good: it is served with a sauce that has sage, basil and other herbs - delicious! the wine selection suits the dishes they are meant to accompany, and the desserts are great too! John and his staff are curteous and knowledgeable, so go dine at this gem of a restaurant ... you will not regret it  try anything on the menu and you will be glad you came in!"}
{"text":"We decided to make a second stop in after coming here months ago with friends.  This is the real deal.  Good quality and ambiance.  The wine is delicious and the food is hot and fresh.  I wanted a pasta dish with a red sauce and the one I was looking at came with a white the waitress told me no problem we can make it for you with red! It was delicious! we even passed on the dessert here in favor of a little gelato at the next door Italian market.  But, the desserts looked amazing.  Dinner for two with salads and drinks was 60.00 ish and worth it!  We will return again soon!"}
{"text":"This could be my new favorite Italian restaurant! Don't let the outside appearance fool you!  Excellent staff and we were greeted right away. The service at the table was perfect and they have multiple wait staff assist instead of just one.   I had the gnocchi brian and it was awesome and my wife tried the pasta bolognese which was out of this world! The fresh bread and salad were also very good.  For dessert we tried the tiramasu and cannolis and both were made to perfection. I am partial to the tiramasu which was light and one of the best I have had.   Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My mouth is still watering when I think about Alessia's. My mom and I came here for a fun Friday happy hour without any expectations. We were blown away on the service, quaint romantic feel, and the food...ohhhhh the food. We shared the gorgonzola salad and the lasagna. 100% best lasagna I've ever had. I thought the lasagna I make is pretty good, but this one blew me away. Everyone at the bar was super friendly and the bar man kept our drinks filled at all times. I cannot wait to bring more friends and family to this lovely place. It is now one of my faves!"}
{"text":"We recently were celebrating with a movie and dinner because we found out we were going to be grandparents again.  We had gone to another Italian restaurant near Higley and Baseline in Mesa but they were closed on Sunday.  We knew about Alessia's but had never been there.  We decided to give it a try.  There were five of us in our party.  My daughter ordered wine based on the server's recommendation - it was an excellent choice.  We had three vegetarians in our party and everyone was able to find something to meet their needs.  The bread was ok.  The dipping sauce was served on a flat plate.  We were sat at a round table and it was difficult to reach from all around the table without having to move things around and not spilling the dipping sauce.  The salad was good but if your going to charge for a plate of lettuce at least give a generous portion.  Everyone ordered a pasta dish and no one was disappointed.  We topped the meal off with cannoli's which were a sweet ending to our meal.   The service and food were all very good.  I would highly recommend this little gem right in my back yard."}
{"text":"I can't even lie this place was absolutely ridiculously good!! To the point where every mouthful made me moan in pleasure. Haven't had better Italian food (unless it was my auntie red cooking ) fettuccine carbonara just really I can't even describe it. If I tell you how delicious the tiramisu is I'm scared the place will be full in an hour. Definitely hitting this place every singe time I'm in Arizona!!!!! Great job and thanks to Scott for the \"back up\" diet cokes!"}
{"text":"Great wine list, wide selection of fresh pastas, excellent service, but very disappointed that pasta a mare (seafood) came in a red sauce which just did not cut it."}
{"text":"They had tables available but told us to wait because the kitchen was \"backed up.\" We waited over 15 minutes to be seated so we just left. Management should know if we had been given a table we could have at least had drinks and bread. The hostess said she didn't want to seat us, because the kitchen was not ready so we would be waiting a long time at the table.  That's bad logic considering we were waiting a long time in the front with no drinks or even an offer of a drink. Will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family and I went yesterday for Dinner, I got to say the food was excellent the desert superb..Price was very reasonable ..Im on Vacation but before I  leave I will come back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best Italian food in the East Valley service was impeccable we had a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and ever better service! Everyone was so courteous and warm. The selection of Italian wine is staggering. Thank you!"}
{"text":"On Friday, after coming home from a long day at work, I found my wife just as tired as I was.  After a suggestion that we go out for dinner, rather than stay home, she agreed.    I was able to convince her to try out a restaurant in Mesa for Italian food, Alessia's.  She agreed. It was the best recommendation that I made so far to her.    We enjoyed the Italian food.  My wife ordered some mixed seafood in a tomato sauce served on linguini.  Me, I ordered vongole (clams) in a tomato sauce served on linguine.  We ordered an appetizer of calamari sauteed in a tomato sauce.  The food was very good.  My wife, quite the critic on seafood, and various places, was pleasantly surprised.    --------------  I have been to Italy numerous times (business and pleasure).  The quality of the Italian food here reminded me of a place I dined at on one of business trips.  I was in the Valdarno region, south of Firenze.  I was in the town of Montrevarchi.  There is a restaurant in that town called Acqua & Sale.  The food that I had at Alessia's in Mesa AZ reminded me of that place.  The only thing better this time was that I could share it with my wife.    My wife has also been to Italy with me on vacation.  She agrees with me on the quality of the food, comparing to a place we went to in Venice.    Keep up the good work!!!  Do not go soft!!   I rarely give 5 stars.  You got one.  I usually only give 4 stars."}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable.  They serve as a team, and from the initial sit down, everyone treats you with attention and hospitality. They have excellent wine recommendations, and the meat and cheese board is great.  Ravioli dish is wonderful, dessert is even better."}
{"text":"My sis and I were in Mesa for a Cubs spring training game a few weeks ago and thanks to Yelp, we stumbled across this wonderful little hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall.  5pm on a Saturday evening and there was a short waiting list, so we chose to grab the last two stools at the bar where the bartender also provided full dinner service.  Wow! His personality and his knowledge of both the menu and the entire bar were second to none!  Prices reasonable and food quality outstanding.  And two homemade cannoli priced at 2 for $6 gave us a before bed snack at the hotel!  Thank you, Alessos :for a delicious experience.  Will be back next time we are anywhere close to Mesa!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a few weeks ago and will definitely be returning! The owner was there and was very friendly and personable,  he checked on all of the guests and made us feel like we were at home.  There was five of us in my group and everyone enjoyed their food! I had soup and the chicken piccata. The soup was phenomenal,  and the piccata was very flavorful. I recommend saving a little room and going next door to the gelato shop for dessert."}
{"text":"Applause!!!!  Delicious food and amazing service. If you're reading this review and contemplating going. Stop!, reading and just go. My husband and I came here for the first time for our anniversary and loved it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for a birthday celebration party of 4.  I was really looking forward to this since the reviews seemed pretty good.   I did get a little nervous because the outside looked like a little hole in the wall but I kept my mind open.  To start, greeter seemed a little unhappy so I just smiled and asked how she was doing.  She seemed to smile then well ok, we had 3 people ahead of us.  No prob its a Saturday night.  (Please note they only take reservations for groups 5 people and up and are only open between 5:30 to 9:30).  A took a little bit to get seated to a table that was empty the whole time we were waiting.  Ok, still open minded.  I then went to the ladies room.  The reason I say this part is apparently during this time, the rest of the party got to meet people who worked there that I didn't and got to hear the special of the day.  By the time I got back water was just being served.  We all decided on what we wanted and then we waited.  We drank down some water and got it refilled before our orders were taken.  During this time, water was spilled on my sister-in-laws dress but everyone, including the chef/owner seemed to be very apologetic about it.  So we finally ordered.  I shared a Gnocchi Gorgonzola and a Risotto Norcina.  We had to wait, we didn't order appetizers, but they brought us bread.  Just bread, none of the other carbs like butter or olive oil, just bread.  To me the bread was ok but everyone else seems to like it.  Finally after a wait our order gets to our table and HOLY COW.  It was so good.  I just couldn't believe how good it was.   I couldn't stop eating it.  I was just amazing so we finished both the plates.  After we were done with dinner we did order dessert, this is after all a birthday celebration.  We ordered a Handmade Canolis and Profitteros.  Once again, I was blown away on how good this was.  Also, this was the 1st time I had a taste of a Canoli and will never except anything less then how good this was.  Both desserts were just amazing.  My conclusion:  Service was a bit slow but the food was so worth the wait.  We are very picky about the Italian food we eat and are definitely go back for more.  I would like to test out their wine bar also.  Bottomline, this hole in the wall is a winner and I hope they stay around for a very long time.  Thank you for the amazing foods last night."}
{"text":"This is a gem here in Mesa. It is quietly tucked in the rear of a strip mall but the food, ambience, and service is impeccable! Have been on two separate occasion and left both times saying how enjoyable the experience was.  If you're in the mood for Italian cuisine don't wonder if you should visit or not. Just go and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing!! I had the strongola with angel hair which I loved, two people had pesto and one Alfredo and everyone loved their dish. Definitely can't wait to go back to try some more menu items! The staff were all very friendly, helpful and well mannered. Seemed to work well as a team."}
{"text":"I can't really talk about the food yet. We've been waiting for more than an hour and a half and still not close to sitting. The inept greeter told us that the wait wouldn't be long. We have not been acknowledged since we've been sitting here. Don't waste your night sitting here like a fool like us, go to Olive Garden and get on with your night.  EDIT: now that we have eaten, we feel that the low rating is deserved. We both had the pasta carbonara, and most of the flavor was bacon. The rest was rather bland."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was no good.  My husband is Italian so this was not a great experience. The sauce was all tomatoe with no other flavor. Pasta was \"meh\", and the homemade sausage was per my husbands words \"tastes weird\". Nice place but wont be back."}
