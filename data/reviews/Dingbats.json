{"text":"I have mixed feelings about giving this restaurant only 2 stars.  I didn't have very high hopes for the quality of my meal here, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was well prepared and very tasty.  My friend and I both ordered fajitas. She had the steak and mushroom, which looked amazing. I ordered the fajitas trio. The chicken was spiced just perfectly, and the shrimp was tender and delicious. I'm always afraid to order shrimp at restaurants because it is very easy to overcook, but the chef tonight was spot on. We also had the asiago artichoke appetizer. It was pretty good, but not something that I'd order again. If you've had spinach dip at any other American restaurant, you know what this tastes like. 

The host tonight was great, especially considering he spent most of the evening trying to make up for the shoddy service that the guests that were seated in our section received. Our waitress seemed to be either very poorly trained or very forgetful. Instead of keeping an eye on drinks to see if they needed refilled, we had to ask when our glasses had been empty for a while. My friend asked for her glass to be refilled, and instead of checking mine, she ran off. When she got back, I then had to ask her to also refill mine. After asking for the check, it was 15 minutes before she actually returned with the check. We both set out our forms of payment rather quickly....then waited a half hour for someone to come take care of the bill. We finally asked the host, who had dropped by again to see how we were doing.  I'm hoping tonight was an off night for the waitress, and that's not actually the standard of service that is common for Dingbats. 

I would definitely say, give it a try. The food was good, just make sure you have plenty of time."}
{"text":"The food was far from amazing and the service sketchy, since they didn't have too many people there. I expected a better turnout than that for a Pens game and they were shutting down around midnight. Also, it's rather over priced for what is essentially bar food."}
{"text":"A friend (my buddy Morgan M. who also wrote a review) and I stopped here for dinner while at the mall. Considering it's a mall restaurant, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised, other than a couple hiccups in service. 

We started with the Asiago Artichoke Dip, which was served with tasty warm pita slices. I thought it was good and tasted fresh. Perfect portion for two to share. Not amazing, but good.

I got a steak and mushroom fajita. It came out sizzling on one those cast iron sizzle-y doodads and smelled great. The portion was VERY generous (although they only provided 3 tortillas, my portion was enough for probably 5-6 fajitas). The steak was seasoned very well and the veggies worked nicely with the dish so I was very happy with the meal.

Now the service was odd. The girl we had was very friendly, checked on us often, and got us everything we needed. The problem was that we had to ask for everything. There was no silverware or napkins on our table when we sat down, and we had to point that out to her before we got any. In my opinion if my cup is empty the server should refill it, I shouldn't have to ask. It went on like this. The manager (I think) was playing host and he was asking the tables around us if everything was okay or if they needed anything, and he was quite friendly, and he saved the day after we sat with our money in the check for nearly half an hour without our server returning so we could leave.

My friend was definitely more offended by the service than I was...in my opinion, at least she was nice, although waiting for a check and waiting for my money to be picked up are very large pet peeves of mine, the quality of the food made up for the strange service we received and I would say I'll definitely return if I'm at the mall again."}
