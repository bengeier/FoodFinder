{"text":"the owner is rude and at least 3 of my neighbours have had similar experiences, will not be returning. the owner needs to learn basic manners.  Food is cheap and mediocre, but this place lacks customer service, I remember going here for the first time with my father and siblings, and we ate inside the restaurant, even then the service was horrible, being the only Chinese restaurant in our area this place has potential to make money, but the service is just horrible.   Will not return or recommend,"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to order chinese one night over the Christmas break and Hunan is the closest to our new home, just around the corner, so we decided to try it out. Hunan Chinese is located at the corner of Thickson and Dryden in the No Frills Plaza.  We decided to try a bunch of things so we ordered eggrolls, chicken balls, honey garlic spareribs, cantonese chow mein, a beef dish and chicken fried rice. We got a free order of pan fried dumplings too, which was a nice addition.  I love GOOD Chinese food and this all just fell SO flat for me. The eggrolls were good, nice and crispy on the outside, and the chicken balls were good too - not too big, so you got a good amount of chicken versus fried outside. That's where the good stopped. The spareribs were gross... I'm used to small, fairly meaty spareribs. These were large, very fatty and bland. Not much to speak of in the way of flavor, a big disappointment since these are usually a favourite of mine. The beef dish was good enough, the rice was boring and the cantonese chow mein hadn't been cooked enough or properly. A good chunk of the noodles were uncooked and it lacked flavor. As for the free dumplings, I see why they're free. The dipping sauce was great but whatever they put inside the dumplings was so gross. Not a fan.  I doubt we'll be back here - very mediocre chinese and not exactly a great price either."}
{"text":"Ordered here after i moved from scarborough to Oshawa and boy was i disappointed.  The food wasn't flavourful and the free dumplings were disgusting. They were basically burnt and whatever meat is in there I'm scared to find out. Price was just like any other place. Extremely mediocre. Not returning"}
{"text":"The food was awesome and delicious. Veggies with the meat were crisp and tasted very fresh. Chicken balls was not too battered which I like. Almond beef was tender and all the meat was easy to cut through. Not oily or greasy at all. Food was not super salty which is common with Chinese food. I will be ordering from here on the regular now. Simply awesome!!!!!"}
