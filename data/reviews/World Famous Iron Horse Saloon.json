{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday evening. My wife had the pirogi and I had the ribs.  One of the best ribs I've had in a long time. Very pleased with the whole experience.  

Highly recommend you stop in sometime."}
{"text":"Wired place. Came in for a beer and wings and there was no hostess or anyone behind the inside bar.... During business hours. So I wandered around until I found someone which happened to be outside at the patio bar. So I patiently waited for the bartender to finish her conversation whereas she finally asked if she could help me.  After inquiring about their beer selection and being severely disappointed I decided to just leave. Very strange, creepy, disorganized, and a sorry excuse of a business and a waste of time to even stop..."}
{"text":"Needed a Bloody Mary and something to eat. Place was open at 10:30 am on Saturday when I looked it up on Yelp. Bloody Mary did what it was supposed to and so did the BLT. Bartender was friendly. The hours are wrong on this entry. Good place."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a kayak trip to eat, drink, and be merry. I wanted nothing more than to leave soon after. The staff was nice, but we were unfortunately not welcomed by a group of customers who didn't like that we had a black gal with us. Let's just say the KKK jokes told open and loud were well worse than it would have been had they just shouted N bombs. As someone who grew up with motorcycles and now owns one, the spirit of freedom seems to be missing from some of the customers. I hope this isn't the norm for this spot. We didn't bother to complain since it might have made for more trouble than it's worth given the way these guys were taking.

Again, service was nice and friendly. We did enjoy the fried pickles, pretzel bun sandwiches, and child beers. The volleyball court was nice, the pool table wasn't beat up, and they even let us watch world cup. The for is basic bar fare, but its really good and priced well for what it is. I'm giving this place 3 stars under the assumption that it's not the Klan's rally point. But be careful just in case."}
{"text":"The ribs are to die for! And the buffalo chicken pizza is full of taste and not too spicy. Cathy suggested both and was very friendly and informative. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A buddy and I had a great Burger at Iron horse Today.

We rode in on our Jap Bikes and found a great place with live entertainment on the river.

Mid day FAST service.  When real busy, count on a bit of wait, and another drink. Enjoy the Band.. And riverside walk   We Will be back !

Great Bike Parking"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect, except that it may be a redneck biker bar way out on 422 east. So was surprised!  Big place with lots of pool tables in the front rooms. Bar and food is in the back. Has garage doors to open in good weather. Nice textured cement floor. Decent tables and chairs. One TV on the wall. A 70s band playing. Clean. Self service at the bar for drinks and food. Nice bartenders. Nice patrons. Started to get crowded about 9:15 pm. We got there at 8. Had a beer and a delicious burger. Others said the burgers were the best. Monthly $2-3 beer specials. Need to call about the Friday night fish frys. And...Summer brings out the kayak rentals.  We'll be back for casual comfort."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird creepy place. We did the kayak thing and it was ok but the rental kayaks are super cheap and uncomfortable.  There was 0 instruction on how to adjust things.  I have rented at other places and this was defiantly the worst experience. 
We didn't feel like staying for drinks/food. The good news is Blazin Bills is right down the road."}
