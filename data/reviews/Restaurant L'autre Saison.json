{"text":"I cannot recommend this restaurant.

1.  As soon as we were seated, our waiter came and asked us if we wanted to order.  I thought that was a bit odd considering he just saw us being seated and we didn't even have a moment to look at the menu.  It was a bit pushy.

2.  When we ordered, the waiter asked if we wanted to order a bottle of wine.  I asked if they had wines by the glass, he seemed annoyed that we didn't want to order a whole bottle (needless to say why) and his response was cabernet or merlot.  Huh?  To clarify, I asked if it was French, and he said it was bordeaux.  Huh?  

3.  We ordered duck confit.  The waiter assured me it was your standard crispy - tender -
 fall off the bone - duck confit.  The duck confit we received was clearly rushed - hard meat, hard fat and with rubbery skin you couldn't even cut with a knife.

4.  We took a few bites and had the waiter take it away.  We expressed our issue with the dish.  We decided to cancel the rest of our order (salad and pate) because we didn't want to risk additional bad dishes.

5.  When the bill came out, I was a bit surprised that we were charged for those dishes; however, without wanting to create a big issue, we paid our bill and even added gratuity (for the other young waiter who was nice - - I feel that waiters should never be penalized for poor food).

6.  As we were leaving, I told the waiter (who may have been the manager or the owner) that those dishes were not what he represented before we ordered.  I couldn't believe his arrogant response of (e.g. \"well, no one has complained about that dish in 4 years\").  He was defensive and should have simply said that they apologize - the restaurant should be embarrassed to serve a dish like that.

There is great food and so many wonderful restaurants in Montreal.  Save your hard earned money and calories for something other than this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here while on a trip to Montreal. The escargot was wonderful,  the lamb chops delicious and the steak decent. Hard to mess a lot of this stuff up. Our waiter was very lovely, though. I would go there again if I wanted to splurge.  The decor was very nice, but cluttered with flags and other strange things. They can't have lasted 40 years without some decent eats, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Fresh ingredients. Good cooking. Good service (you do need some sense of humor to enjoy, though). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"That restaurant is a joke in a fancy environment.
Don't get tricked and go somewhere else, your wallet and your friends will thank you

As a French family, we decided to go to L'autre Saison for our last evening.

Overall, the entire evening was so bad that it's now a family joke!

From the presentation, to the food or the service, everything was beyond disappointing.

The two really misleading points for me being :

-assuring me the dessert was sorbet when it wasn't. I agree mistakes may occurs, but after double checking, the annoyed waiter persisted on his sorbet story. Being allergic to ice cream, their misleading answer was a big deception that could have had severe consequences if I'd eaten it. That would have made me leave the place, would it have happened in the beginning of the dinner.

-serving the tap water in glass bottles with tags in order for you to pay mineral water. That was not OK.

- the gazpacho was Clamato. Seriously?"}
{"text":"ZERO stars if possible! Worst experience possible and I did not even visit the restaurant. Restaurant is open until 11:00pm. Called to make a reservation for 8:30pm and I'm told that it's too late. Upon inquiry, the person answering the phone tells me that he wants to go home early - it's too cold outside and that I have no business telling him when to work! WOW! Maybe he should choose a different profession."}
{"text":"We found this gem restaurant while just walking by and I'm so glad we did.  It was beautifully decorated,  very authentic looking, staff was wonderful and food delicious. Would recommend anyone to try it out"}
{"text":"The table d'hote menu is great, for CA$29 I had half avocado (yes, that's one half of a big avocado) topped off with small shrimps, lamb shank, and desert. The food was absolutely wonderful. I think it's the best tasting French meal I had so far. And the portion size was generous. The foie gras my wife ordered was also fantastic - I decided not to take too much cholesterol but after tasting a tiny bit of the liver I shamelessly asked for more...

The restaurant is in a lovely neighborhood. The inside decoration is very nice, although I chose to sit outside, which was perfect for an early summer evening."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to this restaurant on a Saturday night to have some authentic québécois food. We were not disappointed. It was a night to splurge for us, we are in our 20s so it was pricey for us. It was worth it though, our waiter was great and the owner came out and gave us a free drink to show his appreciation for us young folks coming to eat. It was also one of the best meals I've ever had. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"L'autre Saison definitely transports you to a different time and place...

It's nestled on the quieter part of Crescent and we were greeted with warmth and attentiveness the moment we stepped in.

We had reservations at 6:30 and were there to celebrate a birthday.

We were seated by a bright, sunny window and it was on the quiet side, so we were able to talk easily which was nice.

I'm not usually in the mood for French food these days, I generally find it too heavy but the birthday girl had been here before and enjoyed it and I trusted her epicurean judgement:)

Our waiter was very kind and gave us amazing service from the moment we were seated till we paid our bill.

Water was served, wine was ordered and piping hot crusty bread was quickly brought to our table.

The quality of bread always makes a strong impression on me and this bread was truly delicious! I wasn't in a meat eating mood although the rack of lamb tempted me.

I wasn't starved so I skipped an appetizer.


2 people were really hungry though and started  with the escargot, it was served in a cream sauce with mushrooms, nestled in a puff pastry shell. I had a few bites and it was very tasty although I prefer it in garlic butter.

I had the giant scallops served with cremini mushrooms and spinach.

Others order the veal, the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce and a surf and turf of steak and scampi.

Our food soon and arrived and it all smelled and looked amazing.

My scallops were in a cream sauce, tasty but very heavy like many French dishes are. The scallops were tender and perfectly cooked, with a generous amount of sautéed cremini mushrooms. Buttery and salty mashed potatoes, brocoli and spinach all complimented things nicely.  

Everyone else really enjoyed their choices as well.

A delicious meal and although it was very enjoyable, imo, their food is way too heavy to be eaten on a regular basis.

Quality food and service, a good choice for those who enjoy traditional French fare."}
{"text":"L'autre Saison almost seems out of place when you compare it to its surroundings. Located in the middle of a decently populated street, its quiet and unassuming exterior offers one of the best fine-dining gems in Montreal.

While the concierge at our hotel told my fiancé and me that dressing up for fine dining in Montreal meant wearing jeans, we felt that it was more appropriate to wear dressier clothing. Not only did it enhance our overall experience at L'autre Saison, we felt it gave this restaurant the respect it deserved.

While it may have been on the pricier end, it was definitely worth it. The owner greeted us and instantly made us feel welcome from the moment we walked through the door. He went over some of the specials on the menu and gave us a bunch of recommendations.

We each got an appetizer with our entreés, as there is a sharing plate fee at the restaurant. However, I was incredibly glad we did. The duck foie gras was silky and unbelievably good. It was definitely one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. My fiancé got escargot and as the owner joked, \"you will always remember your first time.\" Needless to say, he will definitely remember that dish.

For our entrees, I got the duck breast with bigarade sauce which was just as delectable. The duck was a perfectly cooked medium rare and the rich sauce complimented it well. My partner got the rack of lamb with Dijon mustard and bread crumbs. While I, personally, do not care for lamb, I agreed with him that the melt-in-your-mouth lamb was impeccably cooked.

For dessert, the menu stated that the waiter will assist us with our selection and sure enough, the owner made his recommendations. The desserts were just as mouthwatering. Normally we never get three courses each but we kept wanting more. As soon as the desserts came out, we shamelessly decided we could be tacky and took a picture of each dessert.

L'autre Saison exceeded beyond our expectations. The waiters were nice but seemed a bit inexperienced but the owner's warmth and personality more than made up for it. It was truly refreshing to see the owner make his way over to each of the tables and interact with every diner. As I later told him, this was one of the best restaurants in which I have ever eaten. I am incredibly glad that we found this place as it was the perfect end to our Montreal adventure."}
{"text":"Knew we wanted to experience rue Crescent and walked the two blocks and spotted this little french restaurant on the quiet end of Crescent away from the young beer drinkers.  What a delight!  Good attentive waiters, nice linens, fabulous wine.  There were four of us and we each ordered different.  After the wonderful bread and salad, I had the lamb shanks, best ever.  Others had the rabbit, steak and lemon chicken.  We took advantage of the excellent price for table d'hote so each had an appetizer, entree and raspberry sorbet as dessert.  What a delight for our only evening in Montreal.  Of note is the pate with salad."}
{"text":"What a great place! We read the reviews. We were fascinated by the review about male lambs. We thought an epicurean restaurant with a sense of humor worth trying. I called for a reservation speaking French. My kind. Je parle francais comme un vache Espanol. The maître de said hé did not understand Chinese. Lol! 
The restaurant is beautiful and quiet. The food was fabulous. Escargot Au vol-Au-vent was terrific. The cote de Veau was tender and tasty. The Lapin was quite nice- no bones.  A just and ultimate French meal in this wondrous City. Our last.

Waiting for the souffle. 

The maitre de was very funny."}
{"text":"Great service super friendly and spoke 4 languages.  The decor is super cute makes you feel at home.  
  The French food was great.  I had the rack of lamb and french onion soup.  The lamb was super tender and served a perfect MR.  The lamb also had a super tasty mustard sauce on it that gave it a nice kick.  The soup was great with a ton of cheese.  Dessert was creme brule with fruit very tasty. 
  Wine list is impressive however had too many $$$$$$ wine and not enough choice on more cost friendly wine (50$-100$) range.  Most bottles were 150+.  Would have liked some by the glass tasting options to try too."}
{"text":"I've returned here and once again I am impressed with the service.  I like how hospitable and nice the owner, Kazim is.  He is very hands on and he knows his wine list.  For this visit , I had the Poached Salmon with cream.  It was impressively plated and the food reminds me of homecooked meal.  Really amazing!"}
{"text":"We had one of the most hilarious and memorable experiences at L'Autre Saison. One winter night my two girlfriend and I decided to go for dessert and found ourselves in front of L'Autre Saison. We went in and looked around. Wow this place was fancy! The gentleman at the door asked us how we knew they serve dessert. We said well, we just assumed.

So we sat down, and were served tea and coffee, and he told us the dessert menu list. That's right. They dont have a menu per say for dessert. They only know it and can tell you if you ask them. Two of us ordered creme brulee, while our third friend ordered the souffle. 

When the desserts came, turns our the souffle was a 2-souffle combo! We thought it was hilarious that our friend was now stuck with 2 dessrts, but we all pitched in and helped her finish it. Everything was delicious! 

When the bill came,  turns out the 2-souffle combo was 40$. It was a shocker alright, but also pretty funny that my friend had just had a $40 dessert. Anyway, the owner kept coming to us, entertaining us with jokes. We stayed late, and the owner brought us shots of warm sambuca with coffee beans in it - on the house. Delicious! And what a nice gesture! You could tell he cared that we had a good time.

Good place for a romantic date, or to catch up with girlfriends for sure. 


28/30"}
{"text":"Giving it 4-stars because the server was a little arrogant and could learn a thing or two about the wine list, otherwise I would've given it 5.

HOWEVER... 

They introduced zucchini soup into my life and I am officially obsessed. Not sure why I never thought of the dish, seeing as how I cook with it often and absolutely love it. Now I'm hooked on it like it's crack. 

The duck confit was delicious too, not \"too ducky\" which I find is usually the case. I'm more of a chicken/beef type, but I wanted to try something I wouldn't make at home... I was beyond happy!

Their lunch time menu/table d'hote is great and definitely affordable. I hear their salads are a knockout, they looked delicious and came loaded with yummy toppings! Unlike your typical plate of boxed lettuce with a simple vinaigrette charged at $20. So I'm going to have to give that a try next time I go there, that's for sure! You should too."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my coworkers for Holliday dinner. 

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the host who also provided coat check service. The decor is very classy with stylish mouldings and fancy paintings. 

As it was an office event, we had a fixed menu which was properly explained by our waiter. Both the food and the service was perfect. I would give a five star rating! 

The reason for the four stars is because I don't know the prices. 

This place is definitely worth going for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful elegant delicious restaurant . I chose it for my birthday lunch . I chose between a shrimp avocado or a lobster salad amongst 6 other salads all listed at 18.00$ . Everything was perfect until we received our bill which was 34$ for this salad instead of 18.00 . The price was a shocking surprise which we were not informed about the difference in the price that was not listed on the menu and because we only saw 18.00 salads . Sadly I insisted to pay for my own birthday lunch because it wasn't fair to my friend and they did not budge on the price just kept saying they should have told you. Needless to say not very fair to me ."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on New Year's Eve and it was amazing!

The entire experience really made for a great night. The decor was lovely and felt very warm & inviting. I'm not sure if this happens regularly, but there was live music playing - it sounded like there was a piano player on the first floor, and they alternated performances with a violinist and guitar player on the second floor (where we were). The violinist was very engaging and walked around the floor during some of their songs. They were greeted with applause from the restaurant after every song. 

The food was delicious - we had the duck confit appetizer to start off which was a good size. For entrees, we had the rack of lamb (suggested by the waiter) and the catch of the day (Cajun cod fillet) - both were great. We also had a bottle of wine.

Our waiter made sure to come back frequently and refill our sparkling water and wine - we were never left with an empty glass. We definitely felt well taken care of.

We were so full by the end of our meal, or we would've tried some dessert. I'll definitely be returning the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The worst dining experience of my life. The owner told a group of my friends \"I have never been racist before, but tonight I'm a racist\". Racism from anyone, anywhere is never tolerated especially after have already payed you for your mediocre food and lazy service. If I could I would give this a negative star. We called the police. This place is purely disgusting."}
{"text":"We came here on New Year's Eve and it was an excellent choice. The prix fixe $95 for 5 courses was well worth the price. We had the lamb and surf & turf, both were excellent (filet slightly over done) the lamb was the better of the two.  The creme brulee was  the best I've had.  They had live entertainment consisting of a violinist, accordion player, and guitarist which was an extra nice touch.  The decor was lavish but comfortable and the servers were very attentive.  

P.S. As others have mentioned we got a little bit of a look for wearing jeans, however we didn't wanna ruin good shoes/clothes with all the slush and salt!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is crazy good down to the smallest details.  Fresh flowers, made-from-scratch elegant cuisine, great selection of wine, heavenly desserts....all in a beautiful historic building in the thick of upscale Montreal.  Reasonably priced and superb service."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one. Sat outside on Grand Prix weekend, nice atmosphere, food was tasty, even if a bit strange, one piece of asparagus, one thick carrot, a scoop of what appeared to be mashed potatoes that hadn't been mashed, although the steak and red wine sauce were delicious. 
Service was a bit strange, maybe the waiter was drinking too much, or doing it on purpose but he asked if we'd like to see the menu after we'd already ordered (with him) and then after we'd finished appetizers asked if we were done with our entrees.
Maybe he was trying to be funny - it just felt weird.
He'd also go missing for periods of time."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this. If there was a 10 star button I'd press it. The staff and Owner are great, and the food if off the charts. I think I had the best dinner in my entire life here. If you go to Montreal, and you want a nice French dinner, go here."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. It was very quiet the night we were there, so we had the place to ourselves really. Food was decent, but we had the avocado with shrimp appetizer and the avocado was not ripe enough and was hard. It would have been better if the avocado was ripe and cut up and mixed with the shrimp. I've def had better French food in DC, but it was decently priced. Also the creme brulee was just ok, although quite large."}
{"text":"Thank you for a great dinner, Kazim!  Coming to Montreal on a biz trip alone from California and just happened to walked into the restaurant but, you made me very special.  I had a beef tartare as an appetizer recommended by a waiter and I never had a tartare tasted so good in my life.  I lived in California where numerous multinational restaurants offer similar dishes like Italian carparcio, Japanese tataki and Korean yukke but, this place blow them away. It was spiced just right and no argument.  For a main course, I also decided to take their recommended veal chop with the mustard sauce.  Veal was so tender and cooked right.  The sauce was incredibly good with the bread and I had to take an offer to get a second basket of breads!!  The waiters are all well trainned.  I don't need to ask or beg for anything.  They asked me whether there is still a little space for their dessert but, I had to turn them down because, I was full by then. There were tables with families and groups of friends but, the manager/owner constantly came by to chat with me to feel at home.  The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic.  We were in Montreal for a weekend away with friends.  We went on Yelp to find a good place to go for dinner on Saturday night.  After reading the review about the male lamb, we just had to go.  We walked in with nice jeans and dress shirts and the staff gave us no problem (my impression was that most folks don't wear jeans there).  We were seated at the manager's table and he was very friendly and contributed to our great experience.  Everyone got the special lamb dish.  It was delicious.  We had great wine, great food, and a great dessert to top it off.  The physical surroundings are beautiful.  The service is excellent.  The price is slightly higher than I was expecting, but it was worth it.  If you are looking for a fantastic fine dining experience in Montreal, you must go to L'autre Saison!"}
{"text":"Racist owner. This is the most horrendous experience I have ever encountered in my entire life. 
After a misunderstanding about an order, the owner came to us and said to us black women: \"I wasn't racist before tonight, but now I am.\" 

I've never felt pain like that in my entire life. He said it so cooly, so naturally, while pointing at us as if he were offended by our presence EVEN in the back of his restaurant where we were seated despite its emptiness. 

Even if they weren't racist. They're shady!! They told me the oyster special was 18 dollars, but my bill magically said 24. We had to beg for bread. Things like that will also leave you unsettled.  

If you really care about the issue that caused this man to wave his racism in our faces here it is: My friend ordered the salmon tartare which is honestly not the best. So she asked for it to be exchanged for the coq au vin. The waiter said it wouldn't be a problem at first. When he came back he said \"I can't change the recipe, I can't change the plate.\" Cool, nobody wanted it anymore anyway so I figured it was a language barrier, and we pressed on after the brought the coq au vin. However, when the check came my friend had been charged for both meals. We asked if it could be handled because it was clearly a misunderstanding. \"Do you even know what tartare is?\" We absolutely did know what it was, but it was hard to digest in that poorly prepared state, my God--blasphemy. Then they said absolutely not to it being removed from the bill, sent 3 waiters for back up until we asked for the manger, who hesitated to come forward. When he did, he made a scene and ultimately, my friend got the tartare removed from her bill. After we had all payed, the manager walks by and says that we made him racist. (see quote above). 


If you care about humanity, fairness, and good service--don't ever even look at their menu."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem as we were walking up Crescent Street to find something that appealed to both of us. The menu below the steps of the restaurant looked appetizing, and as soon as we entered, we knew we were at the perfect place we were looking for!
We each had the French Onion soup, shared the pate de foie gras, and we both had the filet mignon. Best steak we've both had! Melt in your mouth goodness and the béarnaise sauce - to die for! We had the chocolate and Grand Marnier souffle for dessert which rounded up the evening. Decor was lovely, ambiance superb, service excellent, music tasteful. Great place for a romantic meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Situated in a townhouse, and decorated in a flowery French motif, we weren't sure of our choice.  We prefer modern and hip, whereas this appeared to be from a bygone era.  We were, as well, the youngest people here (by three decades). With that said, we were more than pleasantly surprised.  The owner (of over 30 years) was on hand to personally serve us.  The menu is classic French, but with a rustic simplicity and slight updating that we truly enjoyed.  We started with the snails in puff pastry to share - which they split in the kitchen without asking; a nice touch of customer service.  The salads, one mixed and one of watercress and endive were fresh, crisp, sizable, and lightly dressed with a cool, light dressing - delicious.  My steak frite was a beautiful piece of richly flavored beef, ensconced in a pepper sauce, with tasty (if not crisp enough) French fries.  We loved every bite!  My wife's rack of lamb, with a touch of mustard and a thin breadcrumb layer on the edge, was spectacular.  For desert, he made a berries bowl for my wife, with just a tad of cream at the bottom - again, great customer service.  Despite the flowery interior and stuffy look, don't hesitate to stop here - it was a dynamite meal!"}
{"text":"This was such a wonderful surprise!! We were walking around Montreal looking for a nice place to eat & came upon L'autre Saison! What a delight!! Delicious French food, beautiful decor & very friendly & professional staff! And the prices were very reasonable for such a memorable evening!!"}
{"text":"Returning to Montreal two weeks after my first experience with L'Autre Saison, I went by the day after Easter, and sadly they were closed. Returned the next night, expecting another pleasant experience, and it was even better. The owner, who also works the bar, remembered me, and even what I drank last time. Ordered the filet mignon, medium, and asparagus. Both were incredible. The other veggies that came with my steak were amazing. For dessert, I had the lava cake.
   The music int he place is always great. Sounds like something you wouldn't care about, but it's a sort of easy listening yet adult soundtrack, with some classical thrown in. Actually adds to it.
   The old world feel of the place is very comforting. I also (once again) met a cast of characters in the place, including local real estate moguls and the owner of the Chinese Orchid restaurant down the street. Amazing coincidence, I ran into THAT gentleman in the airport here about ten minutes ago. 
      I got to hear stories about the owner from other people at the bar. So not only is the food and service top notch, they attract a very eclectic and interesting clientele.
     I had another, slightly lesser dinner with colleagues last night, so I popped into L'Autre for dessert for my last night in town. This time even the waiter remembered what I drink. Had coffee, Grand Marnier, and their apple tart, which was unbelievable.
      I travel a LOT. I eat in hotels, dives, restaurants, a LOT. This is my absolute new favorite place in the world. No, not cheap. But very, very, very good in all aspects."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at L'Autre Saison this evening.  It was very convenient for us ( around the corner from the Ritz Carlton) and highly recommended by our concierge as well as Yelp.
We were thoroughly impressed with not only the elegant decor and ambiance but the service was second to none.  Most importantly however, was the exceptional quality of the food.  
For appetizers my husband had the Confit of Duck with raspberry vinaigrette and I had the Escargots in pastry puff.  Both were to die for!  I especially enjoyed the escargots and mushrooms which were finely chopped in an exquisite garlic butter sauce. Truly delish! The portions were so generous, we were completely surprised in comparison to the other restaurants in the area.

For dinner my husband had the Surf and Turf. The Filet Mignon melted in your mouth and the Stuffed Shrimp were beautifully done in a scampi sauce.  Both were served with rice and also lyonnaise potatoes as well as deliciously prepared vegetables including broccoli, carrots and squash. Again,very generous portions for the price.
 I had the \"Champagne\" salmon poached in a cream sauce served with the same vegetables as my husband.  Best salmon dish I've ever had.  Wish we could duplicate the sauce at home! 
Our waiter suggested a dry crisp Sauvignon Blanc which went very well with both dishes.  We did not have dessert although we were tempted as we watched all the delicious looking desserts being served to others around us.  Unfortunately we were so full we just couldn't indulge.  
The owner was also very friendly and personable too. Spent time chatting with us since it was a Monday night and not so crowded.  This was by far the best dinner we've had during our stay in Montreal.   Wish we were staying longer to go back once more.  Oh well, there's always next time.... And I promise to save room for dessert next visit.  Don't miss the chance to try this restaurant if you can.  You won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating more than this I would.  We were walking by the restaurant and considering whether we wanted drinks and appetizers or just dinner.  We sat down at the bar because we were undecided and asked what kinds of red wine they had by the glass.  The bartender said only merlot and shiraz by the glass (which sort of surprised us - a French restaurant with only two choices of red wines by the glass?).  So we politely said we would just try some other place.  While walking out, my husband suggested we just have a regular drink so we went back in to the bar.  The owner came down and demanded that we \"leave his restaurant\".  The bartender looked very embarressed and said \"he's just kidding\" so that's what we thought at first but then he came back to us and said he wanted us to leave immediately.  We were so shocked we didn't know wha to do.  We hadn't been rude or loud at all and were dressed well.  One of the employees walked us out and apologized over and over saying he is leaving the restaurant because this guy is so rude.  Here's my recommendation to the owner - you may have great food (which we never were able to try) but treating people like this comes around to bite you.  We live in Las Vegas and travel all the time, eating at the best restaurants around the world.  We are fortunate to be able to afford eating anywhere we choose.  This owner should be ashamed of himself for representing Montreal in this way.  He depicts the stereotype of a rude frenchman which reflects negatively on a beautiful City."}
{"text":"What took me so long to discover this place? It's only been open for about 30 years! All around fabulous dining experience that doesn't quite exist anymore in Montreal. French cuisine at its finest, with service and ambience to match. 

First visit was for lunch. Started with the home made pâté de foie. Wow! Beautifully presented and even better tasting. Smooth like butter. Melted in my mouth. Nice veggies on the side, too. Main course was their Coq au Vin, a dish that's rarely seen in restaurants today. Again, it was over-the-top delicious. Beautifully braised chicken with not a bone in sight, with a sauce that was exquisite, sides of veggies and a generous scoop of perfectly mashed potatoes. 

I returned alone on a Friday night and sat at the bar (tended by Kazim the owner!). Cocktails were great, the steak was super tender and perfectly cooked, and the bonus was Alexander playing the baby grand throughout my meal. 

This place is a gem that needs to be discovered by anyone who enjoys the charm, service and craftsmanship of the fine French dining establishments of the glory years. And the biggest surprise was how reasonably priced it was. I will definitely be returning soon... and often. I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great French place in the heart of Crescent. Sat outside on F1 weekend, just far enough away to have a conversation without having to talk over the music from the stage where various groups performed. The waitstaff was excellent throughout the whole night, giving food/drink suggestions and great storytelling. Ordered the escargot, and the prie fix meal special of avocado/shrimp salad, pepper steak w/ frites, and mango sorbet. Everything was outstanding, especially the escargot. So savory, rich, and full of flavor; good thing you get a basket of bread to get all of that delicious sauce."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to try this restaurant with my parents. 
The decor is absolutely lovely and made a great impression on everyone. We thought we were being forgotten when, right after opening the wine, their waiters hovered around us like crazy to bring butter, bread and appetizers (great thought). In the evening, a pianist will fill the room with a jazzy mood as they dim the lights really low...
My paté de foie was delicate as can be and my father loved having an avocado smothered in shrimps. I had the lamb shanks and my mother ordered the duck. Hers was so crisp yet tender, while mine was, well, enormous. I had an ENTIRE lamb shank. With vegetables. And pasta. I still finished it, it was definitely worth it.
Our desserts were raspberry sorbet with a hint of alcohol (that's what I'm talking about).

Now, you may be wondering, if the diner's so great why only three stars. Ah. Well, I guess it's my fault: I should've gone for the lamb rack and escargot, like everybody else said.
But, first off, my parents are francophone, and the staff clearly isn't. Not \"Communication Breakdown\" yet, but, you know, in a restaurant that prides itself on fine French cuisine, in Montreal...  

Now we are a really old-fashioned bunch, so my father was a bit mind-boggled when the waitress preferred toying with the wine bottle's cork rather than hand it to him. Speaking of wine, they only have 2 half-bottles available. My parents, being their conservative-euro selves like to hear about their meal as much as eating it, you know the subtle flavors, the accompaniments and all...But even I raised a brow when the waiter answered to \"How do you serve your rabbit?\" with \"With sauce and vegetables.\". I'll give it to you, I'm no rocket scientist, but I can read a menu. And I'm glad to see that so can their waiters. 
It was a bit heart wrenching, us coming from a French background, to have the waiter recommend Apéritif wines by brand rather than by flavor.. But my heart really skipped a beat when we realized that we were not given a dessert choice along with the Table d'hôte, which I've never seen done (in a 3 course meal that is). As a matter of fact, we didn't even have a choice of tea..

You know, little details that add up..."}
{"text":"Un-be-freakingly good steak. Incredible! Service was a tad slow but I'm American so maybe I'm just not used to French service. I'd definitely go back next time I visit."}
{"text":"If you're in the art district of Montreal, you should stop by for some lunch or dinner here. I chose to eat inside, and the the walls were filled with some paintings, fancy moldings and some good floral arrangements. Very appropriate for this part of town. 

Good wine selection. Beer too. 

Place seemed fancy, but has a casual feel to it too, and not at all pretentious. It's a little bit more quiet in this restaurant since its away from the more popular downtown bars and restaurants.

If you eat outside, you get some great views of a lot of activity with shoppers, diners, and local art on the street."}
{"text":"Our group had the table d'hote as I expect many do. The first courses were all good. Plentiful salads and a tasty avacado with shrimp were both hits.  The lamb shank lived up to its reputation and the grilled salmon wit asparagus was delicious.

The dessert was a dissapointment.  After multiple choices for course one and two, there is only one dessert selection but they sort of show you the other menu choices hoping you will add on.  

The service was friendly and helpful throughout. Our guy was a pro although he did knock over a couple of things on the table. The only real flaw in the evening was a glass of red wine that can to the table cold. Not chilled - cold. Really?  ."}
{"text":"It's a bit upmarket but boy, it was worth it. 
I felt a little bit under-dressed when we arrived, even though I was wearing an actual shirt. However despite not having a reservation, we were welcomed and swiftly guided to a table in the crowded dining room beside a couple of guys in jeans and T-shirts, so I stopped fretting and settled down to enjoy my cocktail aperitif. A delightful Margarita it was too.

The noise level from the other diners was quite loud making conversation difficult, and it was clear that our fellow diners were rather more advanced in their alcohol consumption, but we did our best to catch up with a lovely bottle of white wine from their extensive list. As I'm not all that familiar with the local wineries, I asked our waiter for a recommendation. Somewhat surprisingly he suggested an Italian white, but it did turn out to be delicious.

The starter of asparagus arrived in a very practical rectangular dish and contained some of the largest and most succulent asparagus shoots that I've ever tasted. Just yummy. 

We followed that with pan-roasted Digby scallops with Morel mushrooms, spinach purée and mashed potatoes. These again were just perfection, practically melting on the palate. Heaven.

It wasn't cheap, but the standard of food and the quality of the wine list certainly makes this place worth it for that special treat, and the period decor makes for a lovely romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"The table d'hote was what my whole table ordered, and it was a very decent price for high quality food and pretty good portions.
I myself had the rabbit confit (quite good, first time trying rabbit) and it was a large amount of food with delicious sauce.
The bread was very good although it took awhile for them to reload the basket and by that time I was no longer down for bread, plus they took away my plate without asking if I was finished despite having some food on my plate lol.
The soup of the day and pate appetizers were very good.
The service was excellent, the waiters were very nice and always attending our water.
Overall, 4/5 because they took my food and the food wasn't absolutely amazing but was still a very high quality, would recommend to others if money ain't no problem baby!

{"text":"AVOID THIS RACIST ESTABLISHMENT. THE OWNER TOLD MY PARTY \"I've never been a racist until tonight\" because he messed up our Bills. The most disgusting experience of my life."}
{"text":"Cute little french bistro. The food here is very consistent at a fair price. They have an extensive wine list for all your expectation($~$$$$$). The reason why I give 5 stars is because they have a pianist in house every night (I believe), love the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"The following review contains mature subject matter and is suitable for adults only.

I went to L'autre Saison on a recommendation from some coworkers, thinking it would be a fine French dining experience... but it was so far from the mark. I ordered their lamp chops, which are supposed to be famous. When they came, it looked pretty good although the lamb was loaded with an inch of panko. Then came the horrific part... while I was taking a picture of my plate, THE WAITER AND OWNER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HILARIOUS TO PLACE A RUBBER MINIATURE PENIS ON MY PLATE. He said, \"Look, it's a male lamb!\"

WHAT THE BLOODY HELL.

This was beyond disgusting. I gave the owner a strong lecture and he apologized; but he didn't really understand, just kind of shrugged it off like I didn't get the joke.

Tips: Don't bother. There are some sick and twisted people here."}
{"text":"This French cuisine located in downtown Montreal, very convenient and food is amazing, and the staff is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretentious, racist staff, but maybe that is the public they cater to. Food was mediocre, with so many french food options around, why settle? look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day. The owner was very accommodating, and the food was presented well (albeit a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for). The French onion soup and oysters were good. The cocktails were nice. The wine suggestions with the rack of lamb and the remainder of the meal was excellent! Very quaint, and chic!"}
{"text":"Happened by this place with my girlfriend while in Montreal (from NYC). I was actually wet and wearing jeans, but they weren't fussy about it. Super-charming French in a restored or just well-preserved old house with food and service that are frozen in the past (in a good way)."}
