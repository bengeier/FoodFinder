{"text":"Came In today right before they closed and they were super nice and had an amazing tres leches cake as well. Definitely recommend this cute bakery with great service."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Outstanding items made with imagination and skill.   OWNERS WERE BEYOND FRIENDLY. Black Licorice was amazing and I hate licorice.  Visit this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been here a number of times, but I've only tried a few things. They're all so good that I just keep getting the same ones.... Nanaimo peanut butter pie, John and Yoko and the creme brûlée croissant. They're all amazing!  I keep telling myself I'll branch out and get something different, but I cave to the John and Yoko or peanut butter pie every time. Tried a sandwich most recently and it was also great. I really have nothing but good things to say about this place. The ONLY negative is that sometimes it can be hard to find parking in old town."}
{"text":"They have some of the best desserts I've ever had. The John and Yoko and the mesquite chocolate chip cookie are amazing. I could easily eat here every day."}
{"text":"Super Chunk was one of my first cafe experiences 8 months ago, when I moved here from Boston, and it's still one of my favorite places.  I enjoy their amazing homemade bagels, sandwiches, salads, and sweets in some capacity almost every weekend. Everything is made in house and is fresh and fabulous.  The owners, Country and Sergio, are kind and fun people and always make me feel right at home.  Super Chunk is one of my go to places and I don't see that changing - I really love the cafe and the owners.  Definitely check it out and enjoy some of the best bakes and food in the area.  Dottie"}
{"text":"This is the only bakery where I have ever seen a cannele! Oh, that caramelized crust and tender, custardy bite inside is like nothing I've ever had before! It's worth the stop just to give them a try! The sprinkled birthday cakes are charming and delicious. Today, I bought bagged choco bacon popcorn, gourmet caramels and cannele as a gift which was so happily received!!

My new year's resolution is to stop in here anytime I'm in the area and eat my way through the menu. The owners are just as sweet!"}
{"text":"Great pastries love them all! Great canneles well balanced the sweet and consistence, soft and nice outside crunch coat. We love the barks, the pop corn with bacon, the semi fredos, fruit popsicles, coffee drinks are a must, plus all the cakes, bagels, and breads!"}
{"text":"\"Oatmeal cookies\" are my thing.

Super Chunk's are unavoidably memorable, as in mind bendingly great IF you like, no love oatmeal cookies.

caveat:  they do not have raisins, but somehow they are still magnificent.

PLUS this business devotedly feeds the \"neighborhood cat\" without prompting from anyone.
Won't someone please adopt this talking tabby?  (hence the name \"Taco\", short for he talks alot)"}
{"text":"So so so good! Their sandwiches are amazing and their peanut butter cookies are the best I've ever had--definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Again I'm amazed by Country and Sergio!  In the last month I've tried both breakfast delights: green egg sandwich and the ghee fried egg!  They are a must try!  The latest I tried is the Samoa cookie dessert with pineapple cheesecake!   My tastebuds and palate are always amazed.  Thank for your awesome choices I continue to come back for super chunk & new market items!   You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Loved the lihing pineapple and the toasted coconut ice pops!! Sergio was so kind and passionate. Had a wonderful experience learning about the variety of chocolates they had in-store. Couldn't resist leaving  without a John and Yoko tres leches cake too. You can definitely taste the love that goes into their sweet treats!"}
{"text":"Great food with fresh ingredients. Their gift store has great items as well. I had the frittata with avocado and goat cheese, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have to make sure I share this treasure in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  Super Chunk  has amazing treats and cakes and all things sweet, but their sandwiches are delish!  Not only do you get smiles and hospitality with every order....your bag is complete with a pickle and caramel!  Nice touch. They are expanding their space and will be a special hang out for sure!  Please stop by and try this special place and say hi to Sergio and Country."}
{"text":"The ladies and I stopped by Super Chunk while we wandered around Scottsdale after a late lunch at Diego Pops. Cute shop with lots of baking accessories and unique items like masala peanut butter. Lots of options in terms of baked goods. I only tried the mulled rosewater gum drop and it was very good - sweet, tangy, and very soft."}
{"text":"Ellen and I visited Super Chunk for the first time, discovering one of Scottsdale's finest new additions to the food scene. It's unique, creative, inviting, and exciting!

We had two unusual breakfast dishes. Ellen had the Green Egg Sandwich, which does not include Dr. Suess's ham. It is made with a perfect house challah roll, fried cage-free egg, fresh pesto, AZ cheese curds, and an arugula salad on the side. She loved it! 

I had perhaps the best French toast ever, made with Hawaiian bread, blueberry balsamic jam, mascarpone whipped cream, toasted slivered almonds, and brown sugar streusel. WOW! It was just amazing. I salivated as I wrote this paragraph.

We noted that Super Chunk has been awarded The Best of AZ Republic Phoenix New Times distinction for desserts. They're likely to get a similar award for breakfast in the near future. 

The cafe has both outdoor and indoor tables. Their pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats are mouth-watering. The cafe is stocked with interesting food and related products for entertaining. 

Our next stop at Super Chunk Sweets and Treats will likely be for lunch, and it's certain to include one of their enticing desserts at the end. 

We have added Super Chunk to our rotating itinerary of great places to stop for breakfast, lunch, or just coffee or tea with a sweet treat in Downtown/Old Town Scottsdale. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Cute place although i am not all to fond of the cookies the popcorns are fantastic
I came here when they first opened 
And i am happy to see them thriving"}
{"text":"Everything looked so good, it was hard to decide what to try! We ended up sharing their signature peanut butter and chocolate pie, which was rich but not too sweet. Next time I'd like to try their brookie and candy corn."}
{"text":"Delicious cookies! Make their own ice cream. 
Some small tables out front to enjoy your treats. 
Will be back."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a snack. AMAZING! The John and Yoko cake was one of, maybe the best, cake I've ever eaten. There is a Great selection of interesting,eclectic ice creams flavors, as well as special cakes and candies. Everything is made from scratch and looks and tastes like high end pastry work. The service was also top notch."}
{"text":"You can smell the deliciousness from down the street! Everything always looks so yummy and my accounts love it! Nice selection of baked goodies, mini cakes, toffees, and popcorns. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden.  I have walked by many times and never even noticed it!  I stopped in an ordered dessert with friend.  I had the Tres Leches---it was so very good!  Great portion too---big enough for sharing.  While I was eating, one of the employees offered me a taste of there carmel bacon popcorn---it was so good I bought three bags!!!"}
{"text":"Its been awhile since i was here and they are still open serving basically nothing new. Well they have sandwiches now, but the cookie flavors have not changed. The peanut butter parfait thing was really good though. I will focus more on the right side of the bakery case going forward. ...the mini cakes and parfait stuff."}
{"text":"We came here first on a food tour. Went back today. The cookies are among the best I've ever had. The mesquite chocolate chip is awesome. The cakes look great too, but I was afraid to get too much stuff. The dark chocolate jalapeño cookie is my other favorite. They also make their own ice creams. The place is dangerous."}
{"text":"Get the Ice Candy from the freezer! It may just look like a stick-less popsicle, but I assure you this is far more delicious! It's more like a creamy sorbet in a squeezable tube. The gentlemen working the cash register told me it's a Filipino specialty. The mango one was so yummy!! 

The Fleur de Sel (French sea salt) caramels are another must-have!"}
{"text":"Super Chunk is one of my favorite places in the whole entire world. That's only a little bit exaggerating. Owners Sergio and Country are the friendliest, nicest people who genuinely love what they do and care about their customers. Because it's fairly close to work, my coworkers and I frequent Super Chunk pretty often. Sergio knows/remembers us and our normal orders, always making sure everything is coming out exactly as we want it. 

I know this is a bakery with phenomenal desserts... but for real, guys, don't sleep on the sandwiches. My personal favorite is the dynamite tuna--I'm pretty picky about tuna, but this has just the right amount of spice, and the pickles balance it out nicely. The BLT is also fantastic, served on their Hawaiian bread. And for days that you really wanna treat yourself, I'd highly recommend the smoked salmon bagel sandwich (I would get it always if I could, but it's $12 and I'm ballin' on a budget). The sandwiches are a good size, hitting the spot with just enough room left for a tasty dessert during lunch. 

My absolute favorite dessert they offer, hands down, is the canelé. I haven't found a single other bakery in the area that makes them, and they are one of my favorite desserts of all time. For anyone that hasn't tried them, I like to describe them as hand-held creme brûlée. The outside is caramelized and crispy, and the inside melts in your mouth into buttery sugary goodness. The texture is vaguely reminiscent of tapioca flour. My favorite cake of theirs is probably the Blackout Cake, and I'm not even a huge chocolate cake fan. My issue with chocolate cake in general is that it's pretty dry and one-dimensional, but this cake is fantastic, not at all dry, with layers of chocolate frosting in between and topped with Oreo cookie crumbles. Also truly amazing is the peanut butter pie. Like, probably in my top 10 desserts of all time. It is smooth peanut buttery deliciousness sitting on top of an unbelievable crust and then covered in dark chocolate. Seriously, don't miss out on it. 

Things that I personally thing are either not really worth the price tag, or otherwise forgettable: any of the cookies, and the birthday cake. The cookies taste great, but are pretty crumbly and a little dry. The birthday cake, while adorable and covered in tiny ball sprinkles, is fine but nothing to write home about. The chocolate cake is still great, but I'm personally just not a big fan of buttercream, and the buttercream:cake ratio is pretty disproportionate. 

Also, for anyone with a gluten sensitivity, they newly have gluten-free ice cream cones and a handful of gluten free ice cream flavors. Don't get distracted by just all of the pastries, the ice cream is stellar too. 

I strongly recommend Super Chunk to anyone who's going to be in the area, just with the small disclaimer that it's a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and offers delicious treats! The pastry chef and co-owner is also the pastry chef at Cowboy Ciao. I tried the \"junk food\" popcorn and the chocolate brownie and both were amazing. The brownie might be the best one I have ever had (don't tell my Mom). This is a place you definitely need to stop in to get your sweets fix! Shop local"}
{"text":"Ordered a cake for graduation and it was a hit! Everyone absolutely loved it and I will be ordering from Super Chunk again for my next occasion!"}
{"text":"Cool place in an awesome location.. The place is clean all over and smells wonderful l, which I really appreciate.  The service is good, deserts are all spectacular.  I will try one of the sandwiches next time I'm in the area.  Glad I found this secret place."}
{"text":"We go the John and Yoko as a birthday cake.  It was a huge hit!!!  Everyone was asking where we got the cake.  It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"What a cute little hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale! I popped in here early one morning and had a DELICIOUS latte. The owners are a husband and wife team. The husband was whipping up delicious lattes in the front and his wife was baking away in the back. What could be better? Their small birthday cakes were absolutely adorable and I will most definitely be back to get one! I also admired all of their amazing sweet treats and since it was so early, I didn't try any of them but I will be back for those as well! They also carry other great local brands like Zak's Chocolates, which I absolutely love! It is so great to see local businesses supporting each other! I can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious goods soon!"}
{"text":"Terrific selection of treats, snacks and sandwiches! I am never disappointed with their terrific offerings. Come in for lunch and grab a sandwich, they're of the best."}
{"text":"I heard the great reviews about Super Chunk, so we decided to stop in and see what the buzz was all about.  I enjoyed the award winning peanut butter pie and my husband tried the carrot cake.  Wow - both were seriously delicious and made me excited to try some other sweets on my next visit.  Cute shop and really nice owner!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a gem. I hadn't heard of it before going in, but I'm so, so glad I did! I feel like the milk and honey cake changed my life!

I selected the chocolate cake for myself, which was delectable, but very sweet and rich. Luckily, my friend and I were sharing a cup of the creme fraiche ice cream, which was perfectly light and refreshing and contrasted nicely with the heavier cake. I tried a few bites of the milk and honey cake and it was heavenly - it's more delicately sweet than the chocolate and the honeycombs are a really nice touch of crunch texture with how soft and fluffy the cake is. We both ended up having about half our pieces of cake left to take home, so it's well worth the price!

The owner working when we went was very sweet and helpful. This is definitely the place to go when you're craving a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"While I haven't been to the store, my sister is getting married this weekend and her soon to be mother in law ordered a cake from here for a welcome party tonight. It was a lemon and fruit cake and absolutely delicious!! The frosting was like cool whip. I will definitely be trying it again soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing treats & eats!! I had a basket purchased for me for my husband for Valentine's Day, and Sergio the owner put it together. It was absolutely perfection. I especially loved all of the sweets!! My husband loved the bacon popcorn!! We can't wait to visit them over the holidays it's December for more!!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about the little gem of downtown Scottsdale. You can literally walk right past it without knowing it was there. It's across from Kelly's, next to Cowboy Ciao. They sell cakes, creative taffy and chocolates, brittle, popcorn and everything in between. Everything is made in house and made with the highest quality ingredients. My favorite is the Point Reyes bleu cheese and Mission fig caramels. Unbelievable! Their prices are very reasonable and they have a great selection of treats. I'm there weekly it's so good. Yummmmmm ;)"}
{"text":"This bakery/confectioner husband and wife team is great. They were very friendly and recommended some of their most popular items. We tried an admittedly large amount of treats and they were all just delicious. I have to be honest, the John and Yoko is one of the best desserts I think I have ever had. The flavors are amazing, I can't really describe it properly, its just amazing and I highly recommend trying it! 

We also had the Nanaimo Peanut Butter Pie and it is also just amazing. I'm really glad I don't live very close to this place because I'd be in trouble. Everything is so good. The cashew brittle is truly the best I have ever had. It is somehow light yet delicious and satisfying at the same time. 

This a great little place that's worth going out of your way to try!"}
{"text":"Came in response to that TV segment that my wife insisted I watch.  We tried the two showcase items, the John and Yoko and the Peanut Butter Pie.  I also got a sopressata sandwich to round out my inaugural visit.

Both sweets get points for creativity and execution.  I did think they were too sweet for my taste.  I had very high expectations for the John/Yoko but it came out too rich for me to crave on a regular basis.

The sandwich was solid and I would order it again if in the area.  Not in the same ballpark of Leoni's Focaccia or Pane Bianco but still good.

A good place with good ambiance.  The kind of place inspired by and made for the Food Network."}
{"text":"Excellently made sweets and coffee for a decent price.  Very nice and high quality service and care that Sergio gave from the moment we walked in to the last drop of coffee! I believe they use an Italian coffee machine and it tastes excellent! Come here for your boost of sugar and caffeine and say hello to the owners. Also don't forget to get the best Chocolate chip cookie in the states before you leave."}
{"text":"My family and I popped over to this darling dessert spot on New Year's Day. It exceeded all expectations. We had some tasty mini ice cream dishes, homemade gum drops, a very fresh cinnamon sugar croissant, a life-changing oatmeal cookie and a mini cake with homemade honey comb. We also took two mini cakes and brown butter caramel corn home for later. The owner was delightful and gave us free caramels. The quality of the food and the presentation was amazing. Highly recommend satisfying your sweet tooth here!"}
{"text":"This place has hands down the BEST chicken salad sandwich i've ever had which is awesome for me because I work & live close by. Nothing is half-assed here. Ingredients are top notch, never tastes old or rushed. I always order the chicken salad sandwich, a peanut butter cookie (tasty does this cookie little justice) & chips- I pay less than I would at Panera! Maybe next visit i'll trade in the peanut butter cookie pick for one of the mini cakes that are always taunting me in the window. Wont be straying away from that chicken salad sando though.. *drooling"}
{"text":"I am continually blown away by Super Chunk's customer service and quality! I first heard of them when we had their cake for a co-worker's birthday celebration at work. They allowed us to place a last minute order, despite their 48 hour rule. Our entire company unanimously agreed it was the best cake we've ever had. And we order and eat local treats a LOT. The cake itself was dense, moist, and subtly sweet and slightly savory. Almost like a light, dessert vanilla cornbread. The frosting was perfection, with the consistency of a thicker buttercream, but the light flavor of whipped cream. I went the following weekend to try their ice cream and other pastries, which were equally delightful. We got there 5 mins before they closed and debated even shamefully entering. But we were welcomed in with enthusiasm and no inclination of irritation whatsoever! We were offered samples, 1/2 off all pastries and cookies, and genuinely helpful, friendly attitudes. I plan to return sometime when I can take my time perusing their entire shop of gifts, housewares, and general foodie finds."}
{"text":"I love this little place.  The duck fat toffee and the brown butter carmel corn are soooo awesome!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've read all of the positive reviews for Super Chunk, so I'm sorry to give them only three stars. We ordered the Blackout Cake for my birthday, and none of the four of us (in my family) cared for it. We all prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate and thought this would be the perfect cake for us. Unfortunately, the only part of the cake that we enjoyed was the cookie crumbs.

The store itself is very inviting and nice, with friendly workers. The cake looked very pretty, and we appreciated that it was a moist, perfectly baked cake. For whatever reason, we just didn't like it. Perhaps if we try another flavor it would change our minds."}
{"text":"this little shop has some tasty treats but not a huge fan of the cookies (tried the peanut butter and spicy mexican chocolate). but a few of the desserts I tried were fantastic, we had the john and yoko which was so unusual but delish, the peanut butter chocolate pie was tasty and the carrot cake was great, not too sweet and no raisins, but could have used a bit more icing. it's a great place to check out if you're looking for some new and tasty treats"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the chocolate blackout cake...it was very chocolatey and pretty moist.  The shop has a very nice selection of desserts to choose from, as well as a gift shop area with products from other companies.  Customer service was great.  I'd like to return next time we're in town to try their famous peanut butter pie."}
{"text":"The service here is OUTSTANDING! The staff genuinely seem to care about giving their customers the best experience. What I think is such a great factor about Super Chunk is that you get home made ice cream PLUS homemade baked goods all in one place! The kitchen is on full display so you can see it all in action which makes the experience super awesome! My favorite type of dessert is ice cream so I went with a double scoop in the waffle cone I had honeycomb semifreddo and cake scrap. However if you do not have much of a sweet tooth I totally recommend getting the honeycomb flavor at the bottom that way when you get to the second flavor you're not over all the sweetness. To top it all off the staff brought us a sample of the junk food caramel corn and wow wow wow it was insanely awesome! The kettle chips in the mix makes it truly unique and delicious! You will definitely leave this place with a happy tummy and the biggest smile on your face!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to stop in for a cold treat and some iced coffee, especially in the Arizona summers. The ice cream sandwiches are divine, but they also offer deli sandwiches if you're looking for more substance. It's local, it's fresh, and it's fairly priced. In my opinion, those are all the mixings you need for a perfect downtown cafe."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the shop while it was opened.  The Super Chunk Carmel corn was to die four. The is also a Chocolates Bacon Carmel, and some other flavors.  My daughter had a dip of brown butter ice cream she said it was delicious!

We will be back for Saturday breakfast we were told they make their bengals and breads fresh!  Oh and don't let me forget the great customer setvice

When your in Old Town make this one of your stops.  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I'm revising this based on the excellent response from the management.  I am out of town and won't be able to try again in the near term.  Based however on their heartfelt and honest response I am upgrading my comments.  I look forward to someday trying them again!"}
{"text":"My mother and I came across this little shop this afternoon when we were in the area, and decided to pop in. I ordered the kombucha, and my mom got a pastry. They didn't have any food within my allergy restrictions (which is the case most places), and I typically have to come prepared. When I brought out my muffin from home, immediately someone (we believe the owner) came over and told us we couldn't sit in there with any outside food. We were both completely stunned at the tone and judgement, and I felt EXTREMELY embarrassed as I ran out. We will not return, and instead choose to support more compassionate businesses in the future."}
{"text":"New favorite cookie spot! Everything is house made. Today I got the Blondie cookie. It is really remarkable! tasted like it was just made, real scratch bakery! Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"My little sister found Super Chunk and demanded that we take her there after she won her karate tournament, and WOW I am so glad she did! Super Chunk is tucked away on 6th Ave in Old Town Scottsdale and the shop itself is so cute! There are tons of cute decorative items as well as party supplies and kitchen goodies to purchase, and then there are the SWEETS!

My sister actually wanted to go to Super Chunk to try their Caneles which they were sadly sold out of when we arrived! It was mid afternoon so that isn't too surprising since they are supposed to be an absolutely delicious specialty item. Regardless, we now have an excuse to come back again to try one, along with all the other delicious cookies we ordered! I picked the mesquite chocolate chip cookie which is so smoky-sweet and just absolutely delicious! It's also a super fun traditional southwestern item. We also tried the oatmeal rye cookie which they somehow concocted to not include any of the things a normal oatmeal cookie would have that makes people dislike oatmeal cookies! It's a must try! And last but not least, their peanut butter cookie is by far the best I have ever had. I wish I could convince myself that this is a health food based on how much peanut butter is in them, so I could eat them every day! 

They also have a wide section of gelato and lots of other cakes and baked items that we'll have to try next time we visit!"}
{"text":"3.5, rounding up!

Finally came in to sample Zak's Guatemalan ice cream, but fell in love with Super Chunk's Peixoto Coffee offering, instead.  (Not dissing on Zak's, but I was in the mood for a cup of coffee and had planned to stop at Cartel's afterwards, so I decided I'd just one-stop shop and get my coffee and sweet treat here.  After a quick look-see at all the chocolate bars, Wild Tonic kombucha, coffee mugs AND change purses with dog and cat graphics on them, and other baubles, I asked if I could sample a few flavors: Zak's chocolate and Peixoto Coffee, and I asked Sergio what his favorites were, to which he replied my two choices, plus Cookie Dough (loved the buttery dough bits!).  All were pretty great!  Most of the twelve flavors, which will be around \"for quite some time,\" sounded tantalizing to me, and these three flavors were such hits that I was surprised the last flavor I asked to try, simply titled \"Brown Butter, with Chocolate Bananas, and Buttered Brioche,\" was a miss.  Hmm... I'll have to return soon to try the other flavors and give the former flavor another try.

The brownie/blondie sundae with house chocolate (or caramel) sauce, fresh whipped cream, and a cherry sounded terrific, so I asked for the brownie, but Sergio said they were out.  Blondie, then?  (Brown Butter, white chocolate.)  Oh, OK.  No corn syrup, cornstarch, or powdered sugar in the blondie and house chocolate sauce, but the fresh whipped cream has, so none for me.  I didn't get a cherry, either, so perhaps the cherries contained corn syrup.  As you can imagine, the sundae looked delectable and tasted very good! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-chunk-sweets-and-treats-scottsdale?select=6PTVbVnMelqzzyIVPwnytg&reviewid=RrqydL_QVeK0E31hRZUZOQ  It was such a gorgeous day that I sat at one of the tables outside, and EVERYONE who passed by paid my dessert a compliment.

Bumped into a former Yelper (last review written in 2010!) here, so that's another plus!

Will return, but not too soon, or I'll be \"Super Chunk-y\" myself!"}
{"text":"We love Super Chunk so much that we had to share the joy with our out of town wedding guests. Country, the owner, helped us out with a special order of their popcorn bags in a variety of flavors (chocolate bacon is my favorite, but my husband is obsessed with the junk food popcorn). She even asked what our wedding colors were, so that the ribbon on the bags matched! 

Country went out of her way to help us, and we can't recommend Super Chunk more! It's almost dangerous knowing that a shop with so many wonderful treats is so close to us in Old Town Scottsdale, but when you need to satisfy your sweet tooth, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Incredibly cute sweet shop. Came in to try their cowpuncher cookie and brownie.

Cowpuncher was definitely a kick because of the jalapeño. It's really unique as the cookie isn't that sweet which I like and it gives you a nice tang.

They sell cutesy cups, sauces, jams and chocolate. Something nice to checkout while you're devouring the cookies!"}
{"text":"Excellent little bakery in Old Town. I had the peanut butter pie and it was to die for! I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST peanut butter pie I have ever had! No wonder it is award winning!  The caramel candies are also super amazing!  I can eat an entire bag of the Junk Food popcorn in one sitting.  Love this shop for special treats!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The owners are two of the sweetest people (no pun intended) and their treats have always been a hit with myself, family, friends and clients.  Truly a gem in the area and a must stop when you're nearby!"}
{"text":"I have discovered the answer to life, the universe, and everything, and Douglass Adams was wrong about 42.

It is the fig-bleu cheese caramel. For you, it may be the red jelly things or the fleur de sel caramels or the bacon popcorn. But it's in there somewhere, waiting for you.

The owner is totally charming, probably more than I appreciated (I'd botched my schedule and was mostly panting with relief about getting what I'd come for) -- I bet you could successfully start a conversation about candy. On my next trip, I might.

This is not candy that you pour into a bowl and nibble idly in handfuls. It is candy that you eat one piece at a time, in a proper statse of contemplation to appreciate your relationship to the candy and the candy's relationship to the universe and how that then creates a bridge between the universe and you. Feel free to quote Proust if you like, or your favorite lines from Grand Budapest Hotel.

The thing is, the candy actually justifies that level of intentionality and intentness, with flavor combos that are outright witty. One piece satisfies for quite a long time, as it provides much to think upon. (If you're on a diet and limiting yourself to one candy a day, come here! All other candy will pale by comparison anyway.) 

This doesn't mean you shouldn't stock up, as you'll want some to give to other people, who will thank you profusely."}
{"text":"We walked up to this cute shop (with adorable chalkboard signs) just as a food tour was entering. My sis and I waited outside for them to do their thing and reminded ourselves that if it is good enough for a food tour, it must be pretty tasty inside!

The selection was a little smaller than we thought it would be based on the other Yelp reviews. I ended up getting some Junk Food popcorn to give as a gift and my sister got a Chocolate Peanut Butter cake. There weren't really any options for someone like me who doesn't like chocolate. Oh well. Cute shop though, I'd recommend it to others to check out."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is good.  We had a small family birthday party for my son.  I bought 2 sprinkle birthday cakes and 2 John and Yoko cakes.   The sprinkle cakes were good but the John and Yoko cake was the best cake I have ever had.  It was amazing and I will definitely be back to buy more.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is super trendy and the treats are so yummy! I definitely want to come here for breakfast. The ice cream is very good too :)"}
{"text":"This place is a local, Scottsdale gem. Been in 3 times in one week. Their sandwiches and sweets are amazing and the owner is incredibly nice! Definitely going back for more..."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere new and fun to try with my daughter after shopping at Fashion Square, and we found this place tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale. Very cute and colorful, and the man who greeted us and served us was super friendly. Everything looked so yummy, but it was hot so we tried the ice cream and took a few baked goods to go. Everything was delicious. The mesquite chocolate chip cookie is interesting - has a smokey aftertaste. My Nutella ice cream was so good, but my daughter's plain vanilla was my favorite. Definitely a fun place to visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing, carefully prepared treats. We were agog at how good everything was. Seems like the choices rotate, but try the John & Yoko, the peanut butter pie, the frosted flake carmel corn...and the coffee toffee is top-notch.

If you are visiting, don't make the same mistake we did and overbuy treats to take home.. Their food is super fresh and won't travel well in the AZ heat."}
{"text":"I will be back for a better review BUT I have to say this sea salt caramels are to die for!!! I will be back for at least an pound or two!! Upset with myself for not having them sooner"}
{"text":"A charming little bakery in Old Town Scottsdale. In addition to their unique and traditional bakery selections, they have other sweet treats to browse. Also a cute, cafe-like sitting area to enjoy your purchases. Blondie bar was pretty good, lacked a hint of flavor and something special, not as chewy and dense as I'm used to. The Nanaimo Peanut Butter Pie was delish - so many delicous flavors molded into one decadent and beautiful presentation. Definitely could be shared with another, unless you're really looking to indulge!

Looking forward to trying the John & Yoko cake next time."}
{"text":"Love the little cakes, pies, toffee and popcorn.  Prices are very reasonable; Highly recommend this unique, neat place!!  Everything is hand made of the best ingredients; will go back once a month at least!  What a wonderful, unique place! The owner is pastry chef for Cowboy Ciao's around the corner.  Can't say enough good things about the owners and their sweets and treats!"}

Tucked away amidst the Turquoise and Silver shops of Old Town Scottsdale and about as \"mom n' pop\" as it gets, Super Chunk Sweets and Treats was perhaps the most eagerly anticipated stop on a recent trip South and with walls decorated in exotic chocolates alongside several housemade treats the experience really could not have been any better; each bite of eight individual items showing the combined effects of creativity and a serious knack for balance.

Owned by husband/wife team Country and Sergio Velador, both present and accounted for in the planning stages of new hours and a breakfast/lunch menu to compliment cakes, cookies, caramels, and more in the upcoming week, it was with pleasant chat that time was passed perusing the options, a best bet eventually found in asking the duo exactly what they would recommend.

Perhaps a bit more pricey than other shops in Arizona, but justifying costs with quality that rivals some of the best like-minded places spread across The United States, it was with seating found at one of several small outside tables that tasting commenced,  the $3 cups of \"ice cream\" actually more like a guilt-free semifreddo with rich flavors of candy cap mushroom and local honey bold and beautifully layered while Zac's local chocolate imbued the last with cocoa notes dancing with fruity notes.

Reportedly soon to offer Canele, Croissants, and Kouign Amann but for now highlighted by cakes, cookies, and pies it was with carefulness that the \"Cowpuncher\" was approached, the dark batter offering piquant flavor of Mexican Hot Chocolate while a candied Jalapeno packed a punch that made me thankful I'd saved some ice cream, the round brownie a bit more my speed with a smooth crumb punched up by sandwich cookie chunks.

Told by a friend that the cakes were special, the \"best selling\" status confirmed by Sergio while Country continued her work in the kitchen even as the hour approached six, it was with two suggested and one self-selected that the tasting reached its climax, the carrot cake using yuzu to accomplish what pineapple normally does alongside finely shredded vegetables and spices while both the Canadian themed Nanaimo Pie and John & Yoko stack were even more impressive, the later one of the most memorable flavors I've tasted in some time with cinnamon and honey tones quickly flooding the palate as bits of candy played textural chess with feather-light mascarpone cream."}

{"text":"Delicious and creative sweet shop!  The owners have a gift and have a variety of specialty chocolates, baked goods and other sweets on hand.  Their customer service is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"If you like sweets, this is your place. Amazing John and Yoko tres leches cake! You must try it. 
Very nice staff. Ice cream was equally amazing. 
Nice little tables outside to enjoy your treat. Even had a sweet cat purring around your feet as an added touch."}
{"text":"What a great little gem! The staff is so friendly and the treats are wonderfully unique. We tried the mesquite chocolate chip cookie (and got a few other things to save for later). I am not normally a huge chocolate chip cookie person, but this had a completely unique flavor to it. Super buttery with a deep flavor, and not too much chocolate. We'll definitely be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing peanut butter cake! Also had the honeycomb cake (don't remember the full name) and it was amazing!!!! The atmosphere is fun and the action figure case is a blast to the past!! Definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff unique inventive food. Me & Dad pop in for what to us turned into a memorable lunch. Thank you Super Chunk."}
{"text":"I came here because I wanted to buy local gourmet popcorn to send to a friend as part of a care package.  I first tried to go to Yuri's, but it was closed down.  Second, I tried this place.  It is located inside a shopping center and a little hidden away if you aren't looking closely.

The inside is cute and quirky with lots of treats laid out everywhere.  I was really happy to see they had lots of bags of caramel popcorn prepared for sale.  I was a little concerned that the popcorn would not stay good if I had to send it via mail, but the bag indicates that it should stay good for 2 months!  The packaging of the bag was really cute too.

The price of the popcorn was on the high side - more than $8 per 8 oz. bag.  And the flavor of the popcorn was just regular.  I got the \"junk food\" variety which came with caramel popcorn and caramel covered potato chips and peanuts.  Nothing about it blew me away (I actually did not like the potato chip bits), so I can't say I'd make the trip to come here again for the popcorn - but I would be willing to try something else on their menu. **Updated to add that two weeks later the unfinished bag of popcorn is still sitting in my kitchen, so it was clearly underwhelming. I decided to just toss the rest.

Also take note that their summer hours mean they don't open until 11 a.m. and close at 6 p.m."}
{"text":"Brought the little guy in today to check out the homemade goodness at Super Chunk and we loved it! We tried the creme brulee croissant, the cinnamon and sugar croissant and some kind of pastry that began with a K and ended with YUM!! The John and Yoko is still in the fridge but I snuck a bite and its amazing. The owner was present and told us about everything. There were cookies, gum drops, popcorn and ice cream all made daily. I cant wait to go back! This is an old town, locally owned company and these people are extremely talented."}
