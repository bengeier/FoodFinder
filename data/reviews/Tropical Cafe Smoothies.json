{"text":"I placed an online order. The sauce was out for my jerk chicken bowl. Instead of calling like their website advises they will, they made it and asked if I wanted ranch instead? I was also missing two sides from my order.   The food itself was tiny for the high price and generic tasting. The chicken was obviously frozen and nuked."}
{"text":"Even better than Jamba! This is my Go-To smoothie shop when I get a craving. Big cup sizes and pretty cheap yet delicious."}
{"text":"We have only ordered smoothies from them. Which have been good, however they usually take a while and they don't always get our order right. The staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"I have been to a tropical smoothie cafe before and I must say that this is by far the worst place I have ever gone to. The customer service is non existent. They are rude and incompetent. I understand that this may be their first job but that does not mean you can be rude to customers. I have only been to this one about 5 times and about 4 out of the five they have messed up my order. The first time I was not as mad because they gave me more food but it was the food I didn't order. The next time they messed up my order I was with my mother as sister, my sister ordered and apple and was given a banana. The cashier even came out and asked again what she ordered and still brought out a banana. All my orders have been wrong even if they are repeated 3 times. These people have no idea what they are doing and it shows. Luckily I go to school estrella and there is a much better tropical smoothie cafe over there."}
{"text":"Horrible service this evening! Had to file an extensive complaint to the corporate office because of this establishemnt. Don't get me wrong, I like their wraps and smoothies, and have visited other locations without any issues, but the service here is TERRIBLE! The representatives don't seem to have any kind of customer service skills, and the ones making the food seem to still be in training (for weeks now). Hopefully corporate can get this issue resolved, otherwise I don't see this facility being in business much longer."}
{"text":"so inconsistent with their food got the all American wrap this morning ICE COLD EGG AND CHEESE !! nasty!!! had more than a coupon smoothies taste like blended ice and nothing more :/"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I most certainly would ! I came to this establishment in hopes that it would surpass my expectations , however it did not. I came in early one morning and wasn't greeted for 15 minutes the employee was busy on her phone watching a video or something however, when she FINALLY greeted me I was greeted by the rude girl in a pink polo, she could not have cared less about me being there or any questions I had after finally deciding I got a smoothie and it tasted like ice so I asked her if she could make me another and I insisted on paying for it because I'm normally not the type to complain , after asking this small request she rolled her eyes and proceeded to remake my drink , she didn't seem sincere or care at all no apology or \" my bad \" no customer service at all it was a terrible experience and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Should have heeded the more recent reviews.  Customer service is still terrible and the food is not worth the wait.  I don't know that I'll bother with another visit.  A 24 hour \"healthy food\" place in our area sounds appealing, but as my friend said, \"If I want tacos at 2 a.m., I'm going to Filibertos!\"  In case you were wondering, we were not there at  2 a.m., but around lunchtime.  We ordered Thai chicken wraps (mine was made with the fake chicken), chips, and a kid's cheese pizza, banana, and strawberry smoothie.  The smoothie was delivered to our table.  Then one of the wraps.  And we waited.  A few minutes later, we are told that they are out of marinara, so they couldn't make the cheese pizza.  We switched to cheese quesadillas for the kids and waited some more.  Finally, the second wrap and the quesadillas show up.  No banana, no chips.  I had to go to the counter and ask for them.    The staff wasn't directly rude to us, but they were definitely not in any hurry either.  I don't know if they're confused or just move like turtles.  Three different workers interacted with us and no one seemed to have any clear direction or role. The one who took our order disappeared.  Then someone else brought us the food and informed us of the marinara shortage. Yet another person was at the counter when I had to ask for napkins and chips. How does it take 3 people 15 minutes to conjure up 2 of the SAME wraps, 2 quesadillas, and a 2-ingredient smoothie?  As to the quality of the food, I'd say it was average.  The fake chicken tasted freezer-burned and the wrap wasn't amazing at all.  The quesadilla had a lot of good quality cheese on it and the smoothie was tasty, but nothing special.    Weirdness:  There is nowhere in the restaurant for customers to get napkins, straws, etc.  Had to ask for them at the counter.   By the way, that \"fresh\" pineapple is canned Dole.  There were 8 huge cans of it stacked in the side kitchen."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the smoothies are great!  The drive thru is often incredibly slow And after sitting for 45 minutes was not even compensated for my time!  Another occasion I went on my lunch break and ended up being late coming back because service had taken so long! Just about every time it had taken an extended period of time!  I think that educating their staff on customer service and how to process orders quickly would benefit them immensely!  They have a great product, it's a shame it's not more accessible!"}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes to get two smoothies. Not including the first 7 minutes they had me wait in the drive thru mic to even place my order. Despite the inevitable wait, I still went there. Despite their lack of personality in customer service, I still went there. But now the consistency of my drink is different every time. It came out perfect once. The other times it was either too watery, to either tasting literally like sink water. Pretty sure there was some cross contamination because whatever I was tasting was not there before. I'm not too sure if I'll be continuing going here."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great, better than Jamba Juice. The food is not great. It tastes like everything is microwaved. I would have only given it 3 stars, but they got an extra star for being 24 hours. I get off work at 9pm so this is helpful."}
{"text":"They have a good variety of tasty smoothies. Their sandwiches are good too and we always get coupons in the meal for some good deals. Drive thru is pretty slow and I've had my order messed up a few times. Once they get their service issues fixed this place could be really awesome."}
{"text":"Good smoothies and food. A little time consuming, but it is worth the wait. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Food was horrible I ordered a Mongolian bowel here that had noodles and meat. I didn't get to try there smoothies."}
{"text":"We love Tropical Cafe smoothies and have gone to them from Florida to California, but the smoothies they make at this one are absolutely tasteless!  They taste like semi-flavored ice.  We have to find another place where they know how to make a good smoothie."}
{"text":"Yummy,  perfect for after a workout!   The guy behind the counter was very helpful but the girl was talking to him like a 5 year old in front of all of us.   Other than that,  great place."}
{"text":"I had the island detox and cali chicken club. They were great. You guys should consider adding wifi. It is unfortunate that a 24 hours place doesn't offer wifi."}
{"text":"Look, the smoothies are bomb! But the wait is absolutely ridiculous. The last like 5 times I've been here I've waited more than 25 minutes for 1 smoothie. Today I am waiting in line once more (not sure why I continue to put myself thru this) and it's been 28 minutes and I still have a car ahead of me. WHY IS DRIVE THRU SO SLOW HERE?"}
{"text":"Usually I don't write reviews about fast food places but my recent visit really stood out to me. I had a lot of questions about what goes into the smoothies I was interested in and Alex answered every single question. She was so patient and knew her menu. When I pulled up to the window she greeted me with a really warm smile, asked how my day was going. She's so sweet. My smoothie came out quick and it was SO GOOD. I hope her boss reads this and gives her a raise! What a valuable worker!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are really good but the wait time and service are terrible. I have waited 20-30 minutes for 2 smoothies on multiple occasions. I have waited 5 minutes just to order and then 15 minutes to get to the pick up window where they asked me what my order was again. I bought a Nutri Ninja to make my own smoothies now so I don't have to go back."}
{"text":"i've been too a few Tropical Cafes and this one has to be the worst. The wait time for one smoothie is longer than it should be. the routine they have going on needs to be modified to become more efficient. The staff is friendly, just slow if it's busy or not.   While waiting for my smoothie, i noticed many dirty tables and flies roaming around. The cleanliness is pretty bad all through the building while i came in. The smoothie tasted like it should which was a relief after waiting so long."}
{"text":"If I could give this store zero stars I would! Do any of the employees know how to make a smoothie!? I have been to other locations and ordered the same drink and they make it perfectly. I come to this location and they screw it up...every..time..no more chances for you guys! You suck! I will never recommend this location to anyone. It's annoying, a waist of time and money!"}
{"text":"Parker was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and customer service oriented. This was our first time here and she took her time answering all of our questions. We will definitely be back and we look forward to seeing Parker again ;) TY so much for the great service. Kudos to you and your work ethic. :)."}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are always great but the wait times are consistently long. On top of that, the paint marker they used to label my smoothie never dried and got all over my hands and clothing right before I had to go back to work. It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"I am always very fair and honest about my reviews. The experience I had today was horrible. The wife and I ordered 2 smoothies and it took half hour in the drive through with 2 cards a head of us. When we did get our drinks they were so thick they were almost un-drinkable. I had the blue- Lagoon and it was tasteless the fruit was horrible. I will not be returning if they don't get their customer service and quality of their products much improved."}
{"text":"We purchased two smoothies, Totally Green and Lean Machine (?) with berries and banana. Totally green was excellent, the other tasted liked ice water with bananas. The floor in the food prep area was filthy, food all over it. Don't know how soon we'll be back as the lack of cleanliness is disturbing."}
{"text":"The drive through at this location is consistently slow. Today I spent 20 minutes for them just to give the guy in front of his order. Calling it in and going inside is only slightly better. The only reason for the second star is because the smoothies are actually good, just not worth 20 min wait time."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times  The first time was great  The next two times they were closed... They have a sign that says their open 24 hours The fourth time they charged us for a sandwich and we didn't get it. I tried calling but to no surprise no one answered. The wait time was 20+ minutes  I don't know how they stay in business. Everything is so messy. Its a good place with good smoothies and food but damn get your shit together !!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times before. 25 min wait after I ordered my smoothie. Unacceptable!  What happen to speedy friendly service?  Told me all kind of excuses.. were short staff.. our computer is acting up.. the manager was off etc  The worst $7.11 I have ever spent. The drive thru sucks."}
{"text":"The smoothies taste great. Food is okay. Would be a higher rating if the wait wasn't 30 minutes. Seems like they're a bit under staffed"}
{"text":"I would love to give more stars because the smoothies are too bad but the service is why I'm rating this so low. it is always filled with teenagers who always complain about being understaffed and if you go through drive through be prepared to wait at least  20 minutes at the window if you ordered food."}
{"text":"Mannnnn I'm from the south so I was trying to find something close to Smoothie King... and I've found it in Tropical Smoothie !   Have y'all had the sunrise sunset ?? Jeeeeeez Louise just try it !!"}
{"text":"The recipes for the smoothie drinks are great!! I love that we are able to have this healthy option here in Surprise. I have been here at least 5 times in the past week and it seems like I have waited longer and longer each time. Today I waited 35min in the drive thru. I don't think I have ever waited that long ever in a drive thru. I have tried getting out and going inside and the wait is about the same. I feel like this is obviously I big hit here in town which is great but maybe they need a bigger staff to accommodate the flow. Also customers service is important after a wait of 35min for a smoothie and the guy at the window was rude and seemed to be annoyed to see so many people. I hope the wait time improves so I can keep coming back here because I don't always have time to wait 35min in a drive thru for a smoothie."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I enjoyed the food and smoothie. I had the tzatziki steak flatbread which tasted good. I forgot the name of the smoothie but it was tasty. I plan on going back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back to this location after a few not so great experiences but today I decided to grab a smoothie and a flatbread after my pedicure and in it was a great experience. I'm not sure if there's new management or what but the gal working was super nice and the smoothie and flatbread were made perfectly!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent decor.   I found the food to be quite salty (for a healthy place),  but I can't really fault this location since it's the chain's menu decisions.   Overall decent.   Note: no soda available.   Smoothies and water only."}
{"text":"Too long of a wait and they are always running out of fruit. How do you run out of fruit when all you do is make fruit smoothies! It's hit and miss with smoothie consistency."}
{"text":"Despite all of the bad reviews I tried it anyway, yum! Convenient drive through .. And the service was great!"}
{"text":"Called to see if they still had a certain drink and no one answered. When I got there it took about 5-10 mins for me to order as both employees were managing drive thru. (Cause that makes sense?) More employees are needed for a better customer experience."}
{"text":"So over the years, I have continued to patronage this business. But the customer service, quality of food products, and overall condition of the store has deteriorated.   Customer service is below par. Not personable at all. Like robots serving you.   They are trying to grasp at some \"healthy alternatives\" for their food. However, all the products are pre cooked and sealed in bags for the employees to piece them together, then warm them up in the microwave.  I always Time them when I place my order and the average time for me to place order and receive a supercharged smoothie is 13mins.     The place went from being great to being below average."}
{"text":"I went in with a few of my buddies after we got done hanging out at uptown alley. when we first walked in, we were greeted with a very unpleasant smell. the phone was ringing and the two employees I saw both said, \"don't answer it, I'm not.\" went to get our order (my first time at the place, so I have no idea what to get) and was rude rushed and received quite the attitude from the guy taking our order. after we get our order I asked the man, \"can we vape in here?\" (dont want to do it and have it be against policy) his response was, \"that's a fucking verb now? whatever, go ahead.\" very displeased with my smoothie, as well as the customer service. will not be returning."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE...AND I BLAME MANAGEMENT!  Why would you leave three teenagers without a supervisor?  They were not able to keep up with the minimal orders they had.  They had to ask us several times what we ordered.  There was no team work, they have assigned areas and they weren't willing to help when other staff members were behind.  The one girl helped a customer first who had walked in and out within less than 10mins b/c I believe she knew her...we were there for over 45mins, what's up with that?  I had to confront her just to get our orders done.  This is poor customer service so obviously some extra training in that area is necessary.  Also they were handling money and touching food with bare hands, they didn't wash hands or put on gloves."}
{"text":"Good and smoothies are pretty good, going to need to speed up service to stick around."}
{"text":"The teens working there are awful. Rude, lazy, and totally unprofessional. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I went to the cafe again today for the first time in a long time. I ordered 3 of the cilantro fish tacos. First of all, they were super small for $9. Second, one of my tacos had a hard piece of fish in it. Third, one of the tacos had only one very tiny piece of fish in it and hardly anything else. Not worth the price for what I received today."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never actually eaten any of the food, but I am always grabbing a smoothy from them. They have a good variety and friendly staff. That's enough to get them 4 stars. I gave them five stars for being open 24 hours and having a drive through window. A very rare thing here in Surprise. :)"}
{"text":"Meh...I came here for just a smoothie and ended up waiting probably over 20 minutes. There was no line, and maybe 2 people inside that had aleady ordered. It took almost 10 minutes to even take my order so I found myself a seat and stared at the employee until I was aknowledged. Lets speed it up guys c'mon they're smoothies not steaks. Mas Rapido!!"}
{"text":"AlI got to say is \"as a current Restaurant Manager \"  the smoothies are absolutely delicious 5 stars for the smoothies!! My issue is with the service I got from not just 1 employee but 2 who would not tell me there names after they took our order we drove to the window and wasn't greeted for the payment that we held in our hands for 15 mins!! Before the bigger girl of the two came to the window and repeated our order and told us \"oh by the way, we are out of lids for the cups but for 1 more dollar you can get one of our promotional cups that does have a lid\" Now as a current Restaurant Manager that was the most rude,unprofessional,even somewhat \"scandalous\" Service I have ever had or  heard!!..I then told her that was unheard of and then told her of what I currently do for a living and said they should of automatically given us the cup that does have a lid..and she just repeated herself and said \"for a dollar more\" and we just took the cups with no lids and food and she didn't say anything after we took our smoothies \"with no lids\" and walked off towards the shorter young lady of the two and started \"talking\"  as  we sit in the car outside the window with No Straws!! So now we spent almost $20.00 on a smoothie with NO LIDS AND NO STRAWS IN A CAR WITH NO CUP HOLDERS! Almost comical In a reality show kind of way\"\" It gets better we then shout out our window to there window to try and get there attention so we can get STRAWS for our smoothies with NO LIDS but no response for a few minutes,I then told my son to honk the horn so we can get there attention and so he did about 4 times within a five minute period, I then was getting upset so I got out of the car and went to the window and knocked and seen the two girls with a smug look on there faces just look at the window and the one girl that took and gave us our smoothies and sandwiches rolled her eyes and walk the opposite way and the shorter girl came to the window again with a smug look on her face rudely asks what we needed I then told her she forgot to give us our straws and we have been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to get their attention she then gave us the stars and said here and I asked her what the other girl's name was and she said \"we're not allowed to give that information away\" I said are you serious? I then  asked what her name was and the other girls and told her I was going to call corporate or whoever owned the place and tell them how we \" paying customers \" Are being treated she then said \" go ahead and we are just going to call our area manager and tell them what's going on..\" I shook my head and said \" this is not a joke , I will put this on all the places that show reviews and I will get ahold of someone that owns or has the authority to find out these two girls names and and confront these two unprofessional/rude girls that are representing \"Tropical Smoothies Cafe \" 13749 N Litchfield Rd, Surprise, AZ 85379 ...The date was 05/22/2016 \"SUNDAY NIGHT\" at around 11:30 P.M.                                            Sincerely,                   I hope this finds the right people                That takes pride in there  smoothies..                                           Robert B."}
{"text":"We ordered online so we didnt have to wait so long like we always do. Got our order and they forgot our smoothies. Again, we had to wait. We got home and my ladies order tasted like fish, ( i dont even think they serve fish there?) her smoothie tasted like medicine, which is now sitting in the trash. The sandwich I always get didnt taste the same. Next time we will be going to salad and go. They seem to never mess up, nor do we have to wait so long.  I will be calling corporate tomorrow for our money back for the fish and medicine order. Store needs better management, otherwise store will probably never survive at this location with the competitors surrounding them.  Huge disappointment and feel like i just threw money away..  if youre wanting to eat here, try salad and go. Dont go here."}
{"text":"Smoothies are good but the kids that are working need to be properly trained. When I get to the window and she asks me what I got when I already ordered and says \"it's gonna be like 11 dollars\" it doesn't seem like they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Updating my review because for the last six months or so the service has been much better, and I come here way too often to be giving it less than 4.  Smoothies are much better than Jamba and the food is good too."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today and tried a smoothie. I got the island green and it was great! Huge size for the price too. The place was very clean, friendly staff. They have food here also which I didn't try but whatever was cooking smelled great. I'll be back soon to try more."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim ironically on the to Jamba Juice and they did not disappoint. Great food and smoothies and very reasonably priced. I'm excited to taste a lot more of their menu items."}
{"text":"I usually don't order 6 follar smoothies but i had promised my daughter I'd get her some. I've been here before and have had alright experiences. The last few smoothies we've had seemed watered down and not flavorful. The place looked clean but as we sat and waited, the table was filthy. I doubt i will give this place another dollar."}
{"text":"So this has happened a couple of times and now I decide to leave a review. I am have been in the drive thru line waiting to order for over 15 minutes. They need to understand customer service is key now of days. So I finally get to order thinking since I have been waiting for so long maybe a discount or even sorry for the wait. Neither of them happened, I guess that's what happened when you have kids running your business."}
{"text":"Okay so I think I have been here once before but in Mesa. I could be wrong. It's amazing. I have now been 4 times if I am right about the Mesa location. I have had 2 green drinks, Island Green and Totally Green as well as one of the indulgent smoothies called the Mocha Madness. All have been very yummy. Especially the green drinks. And from the looks, the food seems yummy. I can't wait to have a meal there and of course recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"Another new business in Surprise!!   Tropical Cafe offers smoothies, sandwiches, wraps, tacos, and salads. Great selection if you want options besides burgers, and pizza. Reminds me of Subway, except has a tropical influence.   I had the Korean BBQ tacos, I really enjoyed this. The tacos are in a soft flour tortilla, filled with vegetables, lettuce, and your choice of steak or chicken.   Wife had the chipotle chicken wrap, this comes with vegetables, lettuce, rice, and chicken. Had a couple of bites on this and it was very good.  Smoothies are really good also, I had the strawberry and banana smoothie, while the wife had the pineapple, orange and banana. TIP!! Hers was a lot better!!  Glad they opened this place up, it's in the same square as uptown alley, and Digiplex theater. Always nice to have something new to choose from, and I will diffidently come by more often."}
{"text":"I was craving a smoothie and this place is close to home so I decided to give it a try!  The place is open and fresh when you walk in. I must say I haven't had such a fresh smoothie in awhile! We tried the Sunrise Sunset and Sunny Day and absolutely loved the flavors in each. Great customer service.  We will be in after another workout very soon!"}
{"text":"We arrived in the drive thru  at 6:23pm. My first time at this location. Only 3 cars in the drive thru. Lobby empty. I ordered one smoothie! I sat in the line for 29 mins!!! One car at the window and two in line. Omg. I will never come to this one again."}
{"text":"I always have a different experience when I go here and they're usually bad. For some reason it takes them over 10 minutes to make a smoothie or a sandwich and I always have to check it before I leave. Sometimes my smoothie tastes like crap, either it's not sweet or it's very watery. I order the same sandwich and for some reason it's been on a different kind of bread and I never asked for that. One time I drove over there just for them to tell me that their register isn't working so they can't take orders. And the last time I went there I sat in the drive thru at the menu waiting for someone to take my order and it wasn't until I honked that they answered. Then I had to wait a good 15 minutes in line. They should look into hiring more than just careless teenagers"}
{"text":"The food is awesome but every time I come here I wait 20 - 30 for food. They are always rushing around but everyone waits . It's not too busy so I don't really understand ?? I hope they can get more organized because it's awesome smoothies and food"}
{"text":"They take over 10 minutes to make one smoothie. The employees have been rude almost everytime I come. The smoothies are usually good, but sometimes have been terrible and I get the same thing everytime. I've had a time when I waited in the drive thru for over 20 minutes and there was one person in front of me and here I was thinking they had a car full of smoothies, when in reality they had ONE smoothie."}
{"text":"1 star because the smoothies are great but the service here SUCKS! Every time we come here which is about once a week average the service is consistent... Consistently crappy, rude and uneducated in their own menu. I have been ordering Caribbean Luau flatbread since I first started coming here which is delicious! now they changed the menu and its hit or miss if they'll make it for me. The times they refuse they claim not to have the ingredients but they do because there are other times they will make it. Because service here seems to be getting worse with all the new hires I notice on board, I don't think I'll be back... On to Jamba Juice we go!"}
{"text":"The only downfall is the wait during lunch through the drive thru.  I have always had a long wait but today was horrible.  Only 2 cars in front of me and my wait was over 15 minutes after ordering.  This was for a simple sandwich and smoothie nothing crazy or extreme.  The service is getting slower and slower every time I go.  It's really making me consider avoiding it in the future and it used to be one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The smoothies are good, but the staff takes WAY too long. Last time I went I waited 13 minutes for ONE SMOOTHIE. The teenage staff doesn't have enough sense to acknowledge the long wait when they open the window, so I asked why it took so long and the girl said they only had three people working.   Taking too long to make smoothies is a consistent problem for them, and if they're backed up (which happens) a polite apology at the window would be nice and a discount would bring me back. The long wait and then the lack of trying to rectify the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. I mentioned that they should discount the smoothies that day because of the wait but nothing was done.  Go if you have lots of time to kill."}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings. They've improved their wait times at the window most of the time (depends who is working), but several times I've come they are unable to make certain food items. The personality of the guy tonight is not particularly friendly. (You don't have to chat me up, but a smile wouldn't kill you:/) on the other hand, the young girl was delightful. The smoothies are inconsistent but I'm glad for the option. If there was any competition I'd go there, but then again, maybe it would force TSC to step up their game..."}
{"text":"So... smoothies are great but service is awful. Ordered 3 smoothies (all the same) waited twenty min at the drive thru window to not  even be acknowledged and when I was the teenager said my order didn't go through.  Ordered again waited another 10 min for a girl to come out asking if I ordered something completely different.  All I get \" we're short staffed\" not even an apology. This place is ridiculous get it together"}
{"text":"One of the worst experience I have ever had. I had to wait 45 minutes for a smoothie. The manager, I am assuming because she was the one in yoga pants and on her cellphone, wasn't paying attention to anyone or any of the orders that were piling up. One of the workers walked out with three smoothies and never came back. The other two workers looked lost. I will never be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Good smoothies... Long wait time. Understood that it takes a few minutes to make an order, but in the drive thru you would assume they start it as you order. Not the case here. They start about the time you get to the window (after waiting behind 3-4 other cars). One time I was even asked to remind them what I ordered. That's what happens when there's nothing but 15 year olds working there I suppose."}
{"text":"Great smoothies and lunch food! Customer service is horrible and it takes forever. The drive thru is so slow and they do not communicate. I had three different people come ask me what my order was and if I paid for it. I waited for 20 minutes and then they said they were out of one of the ingredients and if I wanted it replaced with something else. This place could be so great but it lacks customer service so badly I can't give more than 2 stars! I hope they figure it out!"}
{"text":"I went by here today for the first (and probably last) time. I was on my lunch hour and though I'd stop in to get a smoothie real quick. That's where I went wrong! It was 11:20am, after waiting about 5min to order, I noticed they seemed a little backed up and asked what the wait time would be to get my smoothie. I was told about 10-15 minutes. I didn't wait since I was on my way somewhere else but thought maybe they'd be a little less busy on my way back by and I'd just drive-thru. Wrong again...   I arrived at 12:10 and there were 4 cars in line, two waiting to order (I was the 3rd) and two waiting for food. It took 7 minutes for them to take my order, and it was another 12-13 minutes after that to actually get my smoothie. That includes the 3 minutes I waited at the window to be greeted while they discussed if I had been helped and tried to figure out what I ordered before opening the window and asking me what I ordered. Then I was just given a total and then my smoothie. No \"hi\", no \"thank you\", no greeting or interaction at all. I pretty much wasted 30min of my life here today and was late getting back to work.   I don't think I'll go back unless I have an hour to kill and don't want anyone to talk to me.  *** Reached out to the company as well and never got a response, so bad customer service must be a common thing with them. Will never visit one again."}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious!...if you can wait long enough to get one.   I've been there three times so far and each time they take longer and longer.  Last time I went through the drive-thru at lunch time and I had to pull up for them to bring it to me in the parking lot - it took almost 15 minutes for three salads and three smoothies!  They were out of large containers, so they split each salad into two small containers and they were out of the large smoothie lids so I was offered either two small smoothie containers - which, per smoothie would have been six cups to carry!) or I could 'upgrade to a reusable Tropical Cafe cup with lid for an upgraded price and bring in the cup to re-use, saving money in the future'.      I really hope that they hire more people - the food and smoothies are good but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have tried this place on more than one occasion, they are extremely slow and often make errors on the order.  I love a good smoothie, however this is not the place to find it! Smoothies are lacking flavor and so is there service."}
{"text":"We've been here MANY times, at least once a week. This was the first time we had a bad experience. When we walked in we were the only customers. I ordered the detox smoothie and my husband order chia banana with pb. Both extra blended. The 3 employees were goofing around and acting like 6 year olds. A young girl came in as a customer and the boy at the register handed her coupons and told her to give them to us. She brought them to our table and said she was told to give them to us. She looked confused. Then right before we got our smoothies we heard the other boy, that was making the smoothies, say out-loud to the girl running the drive though \"I don't know what I'm doing, but they're close enough\". Then he brought us our smoothies. So we left with our almost $15 \"close enough\" to what we ordered smoothies. They were not extra blended, but chunky instead. Like there were ingredients that we couldn't suck up through the straws. Seriously pis-sed-off."}
{"text":"That's it. I can't do it anymore. I tried and tried to give this place a chance.  Despite their 15-20 minute wait time at the drive thru and despite their many mix ups on my order(s).   Last year, 2016, they came out with a flatbread called, \"chicken apple club flatbread.\" I was obsessed. I order this every single time I come to this cafe. Which isn't often, but when I do, that is my order. Now, because I don't go there often, I go once every month and a half, I couldn't recall the name of the flatbread sandwich. I would just tell the employees what's in it, and for a while-they knew what I was talking about. I actually had to google the name of the sandwich in order to write this review.   Two weeks ago. A certain employee got it completely right. They didn't have all the cheese the flatbread recipe called for, so she gave me options of cheeses they currently have available and I chose Swiss. It was delicious. It was worth it.   TWO DAYS AGO, I mentioned I wanted a flatbread that normally came with apples, chicken, bacon, and cheese. The woman at the drive thru said, \"oh. So a chicken flatbread?\" My response, \"is that what it's called?\" The employees response, \"yes. I'll have your total for you at the window.\" I paid. Of course, since they don't have enough people on the floor, (I'm assuming), it did take around 15 minutes for me to get my order. And the wrong order to be exact. They handed me a flat bread with chicken, some white sauce, apples, walnuts, and grapes........... ok........... it was whatever. I drove off because I wasn't going to wait another 15 minutes for them to get it right.   I come in today. I made sure to mention that I wanted a flatbread. I ordered it all the time - in this specific location. I mention what I wanted in these exact words - \"hi. You used to have a flatbread on the menu that had chicken, bacon, cheese, and green apples. Could I get that please? The flatbread?\" The employee replies, \"the chicken flatbread?\" My response, \"I don't know. It has chicken, bacon, and green apples... and cheese.\" The employees response, \"yes. (Says something inaudible)\" my response, \"thank you.\"   When I got to the window I got my smoothie, I always get the Bahama Mama. I paid. I'm guessing the employee making my sandwich said to the other employee charging me, \"flatbread?\" The employee taking my money says, \"yes. Flatbread\"  Low and behold!!!! I drive off with a cold WHEAT bread with the same darn thing they handed me a few days ago. Chicken, grapes, walnuts, apples, and white sauce....... WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUNKNASTYYYY!!!!  I turn around back to drive thru and mention FLATBREAD!!!! WITH CHICKEN, GREEN APPLES, CHEESE, AND BACON!!! Of course I'm just expressing my frustration and irritation through my caps lock, but I was kind, calm, and collected when I repeated my order back to the employee. She was so over me by the way. She didn't even deal with me. A different employee did. I gave the cold WHEAT BREAD SANDWICH back to the employee and she's like, \".... did you want me to throw it away?\" I was like.... \"well.... I guess. I'm giving it back to you because it's not what I ordered.\" In the nicest way possible of course. I even said THANK YOU!   So the OTHER employee who was very nice, trying to make my order right gave me my flat bread. I said thank you and parked in the parking lot to look it over. Sure enough. It was a darn flat bread with GRAPES, WALNUTS, CHICKEN, WHITE SAUCE, AND APPLES!! IS THIS A JOKE? WHY JESUS?!?!?!!??!!??!!?!?   I really wanted to give them a piece of my mind. Instead of guessing what I want without even putting the correct ingredients in the sandwich, which, by the way, I've mentioned time and time again what I want INSIDE the sandwich........... NO FREE-KING CLUE!!!!!! Please just tell me NO! FLAT NO SO I CAN MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE, INSTEAD OF GOING OM YELP AND EXPRESSING THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME I HAVE ON MY HANDS!! .... ugh. (Eye roll)   So I go inside the cafe. Like, inside the lobby. Ask for a refund, and returned my sandwich. The woman at the register (that took over the employee who didn't want to deal with me at the drive thru window) had to go in the back and ask her boss if she can refund me.   She said they don't do refunds, but she can write my name in a book so I could get a free item next time or something of that nature.   WRONG! She assumed that I would be back in to their cafe for whatever reason to utilize the \"free\" offer.   NOPE! I told her NO! I would like a refund. Of course, I'm still extremely nice. She gave me $5 and some odd change. Her response, \"sorry about that.\" My response, \"it's ok.\" My REAL RESPONSE GOING THROUGH MY HEAD, \"ajsjcoejfjgjdkfjfhf(censored)ddkcodjehfhf!!!\"   Moral of the story. Check your food before you leave the drive thru. Remember sandwich names and ingredients. Repeat several times at the speaker box and at the window. Don't ever go back to tropical cafe smoothies AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are great! If we have to compare to Jamba, Tropical Smoothies Cafe is definitely better. Just like many others have mentioned the service has been very slow every time I've gone there (even if I'm the only car). However, the smoothies have always been perfection. 5 star smoothie and just lost one star for wait times. Had a breakfast sandwich that was definitely good as well. I'll continue to go there especially after a good workout. Can't forget, it's 24 hours and has a drive thru! Enough said."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great, but who has time to wait 35 minutes to wait at a drive thru? No one. If theirs more than one person on line at the drive thru, don't go. =\"}
{"text":"This place is so slow!!! And rude they make you wait 10 min to order.  Save your time and go to another location"}
{"text":"Clean store, friendly staff, convenient location. Drive through is now open from 5am-12am so the hours are convenient. Smoothies are tasty and this place has a diverse menu."}
{"text":"Just sat in line (3 cars only) for 25 mins on my lunch break. Very slow service here, always."}
{"text":"Horrible service on Halloween day. The lobby was closed from 3 to 4 PM due to short staff. I went through the drive-through and it took almost 15 minutes to get one flatbread and one smoothie. The food came out in about eight minutes and by the time I got the smoothie my flatbread was cold. The smoothie was horrible. Almost tasted like it was watered down. I happened to be on my lunch break and sat across the parking lot while I ate and I could see the drive-through. In my 30 minute lunch break only five cars made it through and two of them left without even getting to the window after placing their order because it took so long. I would not recommend this location. I've eaten several times at other locations and had much better service. If the lobby wasn't closed and there weren't people in the drive-through I would ask for a refund, but I don't have two hours to wait."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food and great smoothies. Only problem is they frequently appear under-staffed for the lunch rush. Food takes 20 minutes to come out and you need to remind them about the smoothies (another 20 minutes). Makes you feel bad for the stressed out employees. Could just be unlucky timing on our part but I hope they start staffing appropriately."}
{"text":"The back room floor was disgusting and looks like it hadn't been swept all day.  The employees look like they have no sense of urgency or care.   The 1 star is for the smoothies which weren't worth the extremely long wait."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 visits now and unfortunatly this is my last. Went to the drive through and wated 20 minutes for 3 drinks. I understand that it was busy and had no problem waiting however I got no assurance that it was going to be a little bit longer to receive the drinks. Finally someone rushed to give me the drinks and revive payment for them which wasn't a pleasent experience. I drove off and tried them and they tasted all wrong. I get that it is busy but consistancy is important."}
{"text":"Delicious food! You wouldn't think that a smoothie joint would also have good lunch/dinner items, but Tropical Cafe does! Try their Chipotle Chicken Club  - it's really tasty!  I have only ever had their Triple Berry Oat smoothie - and it's delicious. Very filling, as well!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been to this location plenty of times. Never had a problem however I was there two weeks ago getting a protein shake after the gym and it will be my last time. The person taking my order was not professional at all. At least say \" please pull forward to the window\". When I received my smoothie , the lid wasn't even placed right. As I drove away with my friend, my smoothie was spilling from he exposed side of the cup. It's not that hard to close a lid on a smoothie. It's common sense not to give a customer a sticky cup for their drink. I went back around the drive thru and asked for napkins. I showed her the smoothie and she just got me napkins, gave it to me then shut the window. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I love this place because the food is healthy and reasonably priced, however - the service is always terrible. The drive thru always takes at least 10-15 minutes. When we go in the employees will be sitting down eating, or too busy talking. They have zero customer service skills. I have been given the wrong smoothie more than once, they forget to put items in my bag and don't care. It's sad that the employees make this place look bad because I really do enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"This location has excellent staff and the food is exceptional. I am allergic to dairy and they can accommodate that for me which is very difficult to do normally when going out to eat. They are quick and make it easy to get food during lunch time. The restaurant is very clean and quiet so it's a nice place to sit and talk or catch up with a friend. The smoothies are delicious and I get the chicken pesto flatbread without the dairy products and it is phenomenal. I definitely recommend that everyone come here and try this place especially if you have a dairy allergy and can't get anything at those other smoothie places."}
{"text":"The wait is always a bit much.  Maybe a drive through and a dining room needs more than a 2 person crew.  Smoothies are good.  Lots of flavors to choose from and you can get add ins also.  The food is fresh too, but i don't think it was too much to ask to have my flat bread WITHOUT the flat bread.  Simple,  right? Nope. The veggies were missing,  too."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great. Customer service not so much. From the moment you walk in the door the vibe is not the best. The workers don't even greet the customers or smile much. I walked up to the counter and stood there for about 4 mins before anyone acknowledged me...someone even went out to give someone their order who had been waiting for the drive thru then walked right back in and still nothing. He went right to the window to give someone their order then came over and took my order. I'd come back for the smoothies but workers need to get it together and work on their customer service skills badly!!"}
{"text":"I like their berry oat smoothie and they California flat bread. I think their salads are too small for the price but they have nice people working, convenient hours and some interesting items"}
