{"text":"This is the worst. My wife and I went to eat here, it's a bit of a trek but I hadn't bee in in 20 years or so and was saddened by the lack of care and cleanliness.   Worn out and dirty. The old owners took pride in their business. Not this crowd.   The food I ordered was supposed to be beef and noodles and was on the specials. However, what I got was canned cafeteria grade over cooked gooey noodles and what amounted to canned dog food grade beef & gravy. I found a LONG curly hair in my gravy.   My wife had the salad bar and it had gross browning lettuce, the cheap kind. Tomatoes were soggy. No variety. Not worth the cost.   The waitress was nice and extremely helpful and actually apologized for my food, saying the cook had a bad day.   Basically this place is supposed to cater to small town charm, well, it fails at that. It's also supposed to be \"home cooking \" , but I don't remember my granny serving nasty cafeteria/prison grade over cooked food and charging as much as a nice restaurant.   I felt sad after being there, especially when I had fond memories with my granny of road trips out there 20 years ago."}
{"text":"O.k.....  I have read a few reviews claiming stares if your are not WHITE.  Remember we do have a top 10 university! Trust me, we have seen it all.  Since you are not from around here let me explain.  This is a small place where farm families and our older townies go eat.  They are not staring at your color by any means. They ALL stop, look, every time the door jingles.  That's it I promise.  Maybe the wives are checking out the cute outfit you have on or how handsome a gentleman is.  Remember they farm.... not much to see.  To those complaining about wait times, lunch is crazy busy so call in an order for takeout.  Also, try the specials they take 15 min. max.  They are sweet people and have been around for years.  If they treated people bad, Urbana would throw a hissy. Give them another chance. Yes the food is down home nothing low cal, so if that's not what you are craving then maybe campus has something more your speed. The noodles are awesome and I am actually not a fan of the dessert apple dumpling, I order the peach pie! Oh my I almost forgot to mention the fresh rolls, the hash browns with gravy, the swiss steak, the hot beef sandwich, the fried chicken..... sigh.  You cannot share a meal because of the \"all you can eat\" options."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has decent food.  Well, depending on the day.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.  However, for a small mom and pop place, they don't seem to do much to make people feel welcome.    The last time I ate there was the last time.  I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside.  We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.  My friend said \"I'd love it on the side, please\" only to be told \"No.\"  When he said \"no?\" she replied \"Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy.\"  I made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back.  Problem solved, all dishes are clean!  Skip it and go to Sam's cafe."}
{"text":"Was there for Saturday dinner. Beef and noodle was very good and the fried chicken was very juicy. Salad bar was ok and the apple dumpling with ice ran was good but the sauce was very soupy."}
{"text":"If you like homemade cooking then this out of the way eatery is for you. Real mashed potatoes. Fried chicken and beef and noodles are taste bud delights. And of coarse the apple dumpling. It was hard to leave room for it. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Definitely worth the trip. A repeat is in order."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in the doors of this  restuarant I was transported to a simpler time.  When the owner who does all the cooking herself was asked what her secret was she responded, \"I know how food is supposed to be cooked.\"  I have no argument with that statement my BLT was simply the best every!  From the patriotic themed benches that the staff helped an elderly couple sit on, to the simple pictures that protray scene?s of life from days almost forgotten. I was truely blessed to enjoy, a beautiful restaurant and very deliciously prepared food!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great homemade food at a great price Cons: Location My Advice: Go on a Friday or Saturday night, when you can get a Twice-Baked Potato  I have been living in the C-U area for a little over 2 years now and I made my first visit to The Apple Dumplin' just 3 nights ago. We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went again last night.   Their twice-baked potato was fantastic, one of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. The only bad thing it that they only serve it on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you go any other time, you're SOL.   On our first visit, my son, my step-daughter-to-be and I all got beef and noodles. The children's version is served with mashed potatoes on the side, while the full-size meal is served over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also very filling. Even though it was the nightly all-you-can-eat meal, I was only able to eat one plate. My fiance ordered fried chicken and it was very good. Lightly breaded and juicy, just the way fried chicken should be.   On our second visit I got the all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp, the Saturday night special. Paired with the twice-baked potato, my meal was excellent. This was no tiny, marble sized shrimp; they were plump and perfectly fried. Not to mention, all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $8.75? Are you kidding me? My fiance got the beef and noodles, which was just as tasty as the first time. The kids got chicken strips and fries, which were just what you would expect, but the portions were huge.   The staff is very friendly and they remembered us from the first time we were there. Our waitress even commented that my son had gotten a haircut in between. The salad bar is nothing super special, but it's adequate. I loved the cucumber salad and the kidney bean salad.   Almost everything made here is done so from scratch. I don't know if the popcorn shrimp was, but the beef and noodles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes definitely were. According to the menu we brought home, they peel about one ton of potatoes a week. The homemade rolls are heavy and very good. Even better, they have apple butter in a squeeze bottle right at the table. I could almost make an entire meal of their rolls with apple butter.   The only bad thing about The Apple Dumplin' is their location. They are located a few miles outside of town in the last place you would expect a restaurant to be. There is a reason it took me so long to come here....... because I didn't even know about it. We found it quite literaly by accident."}
{"text":"Emphasis on the family restaurant, with family (whose?) photos on the walls.  Open, clean, bright ambiance.  Servers were efficient and friendly.  The breakfast menu was limited and not very appealing.  The coffee was okay.  I ordered the Giant Cinnamon Roll but was told they were out.  This was at 9:00 AM.  How do you run out with two hours left of breakfast?   I then ordered the Loaded Omelet.  It was, indeed, loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, veggies, and cheese.  It needed some seasoning and a bit more flavor but wasn't that bad.  On the side was fried potatoes and gravy.  It was good, but my doctor would kill me if she saw me eating that.  Definite artery clogger.  In all it wasn't bad but also not someplace I'd return, even to taste the elusive cinnamon roll.    NOTE: There are references in the other reviews that hint at prejudice, such as \"be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian.\"   While I was there, a black couple came in and seemed to be known by the staff and was greeted warmly.  An interracial couple later came in.  I saw no \"staring\" or any such behavior."}
{"text":"Always good home cooked food. Simple just like on the farm..... meat and taters with friendly family service."}
{"text":"We tried to go here on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant was full of people who had just gotten back from church.  I am an Asian lady and was stared at by most of the people in the restaurant as if my partner had bought me on the Internet.  If you are at all sensitive to social ambience and are not white, I do not recommend this place.  I felt too uncomfortable to stay, which was just as well because nobody tried to seat us or acknowledged us in any way, so after standing around uncomfortably for a while we left.  which is too bad because I like apple dumplings."}
{"text":"Apple Dumpling is about 10-15 minutes outside C-U proper, on the wild edges of town, and it's a plain, unassuming little spot.  It will serve you the friendliest of calorie-laden, heart-attack inducing greasy breakfasty diner foods and the like, and for that you must love it a little bit.  The country kitsch works here, and is worth a stop in.  I really did enjoy their biscuits and gravy for breakfast, which are filled with carbs and fat and love and all that one can ask for in Middle America.  Their Sunday buffet is a little disappointing as it lacks any breakfast options, but the fried chicken is spot on.  It's worth coming once for the kitsch, twice for the biscuits and gravy.  Then you go to the gym and cry salty, buttery tears on your treadmill."}
{"text":"I've lived here all my life. I don't know why I've never eaten here.   This is comfort food. I had the beef and noodles served over the mashed potatoes. Real mashed potatoes, not the box kind. You also get a big soft dinner roll that you can slather with butter or their housemade apple butter or both. The server made sure we never ran out of drinks and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The apple dumpling, we (4 of us) shared with a scoop of ice cream. A really filling meal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there with my Wingman before and I had the Old Country ham with mash potatoes and corn. It was delicious. It wasn't to crowded but we were waited on quickly but our waitress was really nice to us and the service was excellent. We will be back again soon you guys should check it out."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and everything was great! The food was so delicious (the fried chicken is fantastic), and topping it all off with an apple dumpling for dessert was great. Service was friendly and the food came out super fast! 10/10 will come again :)"}
{"text":"I been there twice the first time they had a buffet and it was very good ,the second time we had to order of the menu and I am telling you like night and day ...never again. Had chicken and noodles my noodles where not done at all . The place looked clean ,service I had better too. I guess twice was enough for me. Wish them good luck."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in the area to get a taste of what people were eating in central Illinois 50 years ago.  The beef and noodles (all you can eat on Thursday) are exactly like what my great grandma used to make us, and the biscuits and gravy always take me back to mornings before fishing.    Be warned-the Apple Dumpling doesn't pull its punches.  The food is not healthy-it was designed for farm laborers, not office dwellers (or tractor riders), and is consequently heavy, hearty, and massively caloric.  You might think that some of the noodles are underdone.  You are wrong.  The noodles are made to different thicknesses on purpose, and some of them need to have more texture.  If nothing else, think of it as proof that a person made your food, not a factory.  Here's the skinny (irony!).  If you grew up in the midwest, you'll know what's going on with one bite.  If you're from some other place, give it a taste and expand your horizons, but check your baggage at the door.  Like it or not, you'll leave a more cultured person."}
{"text":"The Apple Dumpling claims to hold the world record for most Apple Dumplings served.  Well - maybe not - but they have served like 200,000 - and that says a lot considering that this restaurant is literally in the country - on a highway - not near any major exit from an interstate.  Best Fried Chicken in town. Period!"}
{"text":"So someone my girlfriend knew said that this was THE place to try.  Well with this advice, my girlfriend and I went and spent a good half hour trying to find the place.  After the drive we were starving so we needed food.  The place looked incredibly tacky as well as the fact that it was all white.  And considering the fact that I have a dark complexion, I stood out like a sore thumb.  The food was alright, but it was not worth the drive nor the stares.  So if someone says that you have to try this place, just assume they were high and didn't know what they were talking about when they went...I obviously learned the hard way."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my Grandma's cooking...and my grandma can't cook.  We had the beef steak, fried chicken, and ham and beans.  It was all pretty mediocre and not worth repeating.  Even the apple dumplings were just okay.  Too bad...guess if I want a decent home style meal I will have to do it myself.    We are also a mixed family and didn't feel uncomfortable eating at this place as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I'm originally from Iowa where my family made a lot of country comfort food. Perfect turkey and noodles! Looking forward to traveling back."}
{"text":"Wow, real feel of country time out here, just as soon as you walk through the doors. Service was friendly and we got seated right way, during the busy weekday lunch traffic. It was crowded and they have weekly specials so people might have been here for the Thursday meatloaf.  I tried the two piece fried chicken which was quite delicious.  It came with a huge mound of mashed potatoes smothered in gravy and a choice of veggie side ( I skipped the salad bar because the portions were already looking too big). The choice of sides were green beans or glazed carrots. The overcooked carrots were served in a bowl of sweet oil (probably melted butter) which tasted decent but looked like a heart attack. You can chose to get only white meat for a higher price, but otherwise you get a drumstick and thigh piece.  The meat loaf was decent, though not quite that flavorful. It also came with the same options for sides.  The breaded chicken sandwich was a huge portion with tomatoes, lettuce, pickles you can add in, plus a side of fries and let's not forget the enormous dinner rolls with the apple butter.  Definitely huge portions, as the waitress said \"if you leave here hungry it's your own fault\" For drinks I had an apple juice which tasted like syrup so I had to switch to water. They had plenty of sodas to chose from, and coffee and tea.  We split an apple dumpling because we barely had room. It was enormous too, which two large scoops of ice cream (you should get it a la mode). I was a little underwhelmed for noting it was their namesake. It wasn't that flavorful or sweet. It had this sticky stringy consistency that was a little off putting, like cheese polymers or slime.  Nevertheless I would definitely come back for the fried chicken and maybe try out a daily special.  They also do a full breakfast, which I imagine is also quite popular.  Plenty of parking around the building. Pay at the cashier but don't forget to leave a tip and the table for the waitress. Apparently you can order over the phone for a pick up, if you just want to stop by and take it home to eat."}
{"text":"Great friendly service we felt at home while traveling and the food was delicious and very plentiful"}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect when I entered  but I already knoew it could not be too bad as the line up for a table was manageable but there were definitely people coming out to eat there. The first thing I noticed was the kitchen and you could eat off the floor. Spotless . I then touched the salad bar wagon - ice cold.. I already new that this is a place that takes pride in not just the taste but the preparation. The food for the Sunday brunch felt like you were eating a home made meal. The chicken was  the best fried chicken I have ever had and the pork loin was outstanding.  MY only complaint is that there was not room on my plate by the time I got back to sitting down and coul not try everything. You will walk out of there feeling you have had an amazing home cooked meal and you will not need to eat any more. Congrats to Jim and Kathie for providing and outstanding venue for people who want to eat the real deal..  This will definitely be added to our list of recommended pla"}
{"text":"Someone told me that I absolutely HAD to try this place before graduating from U of I. That being said, I spent about half an hour trying to find this place. Walking in with my boyfriend (who is half Mexican, half Greek and very dark), the stares made it obvious that he was the most exotic being to ever step foot in the place. The food was alright, not good enough to justify getting lost trying to find it for thirty minutes. Call me a simple gal, but give me the Cracker Barrel over this place any day."}
{"text":"We came in for a nice family dinner this past Saturday. It was absolutely delicious. The prices are very fair too. I had an amazing BLT. It was perfect. Everyone else enjoyed their food, the menu is rather small, but everything is good! I think between the 9 of us, we tried everything on the menu. The salad bar is nice, everything looked fresh. The service is great, everyone is friendly.  But...the high light of the meal, was DESSERT. This is not a place to skip dessert. I don't care if you are counting calories, today is the day to cheat on that diet!! The apple dumplings, are just amazing. I don't usually go for desserts, figured I'd have a bite or two of my husbands though. Well, a bite or two turned into me eating at least half of his apple dumpling, even though I was full already! It is that good.  I want the recipe!"}
{"text":"It's fairly difficult to find Apple Dumpling, so if you're willing to:  1) make the trek to far away Urbana, 2) be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian, 3) subject your arteries to a deluge of fat, and 4) eat in a large cafeteria-like room with the glaring white walls of a hospital,  then this place is for you.  The homemade apple dumplings are quite good actually. The beef and noodles (with LOTS of mashed potatoes) was great, but it got a little overwhelming after a couple large bites...I think my body was rejecting the sudden influx of calories."}
{"text":"I always get the beef and noodles or chicken and noodles. Absolutely wonderful, home cooked meal. The noodles are served over real mashed potatoes, come with a side or salad bar, and a roll. I've never had a bad meal here. Since it's so hard to make room for the Apple dumpling- I always get it in a to go box. Makes for great left overs!"}
{"text":"This is such a clean restaurant..great home made foods..best waitstaff..fair proportions..clean bathrooms..glad its in tbis area."}
{"text":"Great HOMEMADE comfort foods, and of course the apple dumplings. Not at all fancy, just plain good food."}
{"text":"This place is figuratively and nearly literally a million miles from the rest of the dining choices in CU and a great change of pace for those looking for good, down home food prepared in a traditional way. The menu is limited, and specials change from day to day, but you can expect to find fried chicken, pork tenderloin, meatloaf, Salisbury steak, and beef Stroganoff, pot roast and other Midwestern standards. Mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, and corn accompany. They have excellent rolls and serve them with a squeeze dispenser of apple butter, making them ridiculously addicting.  The eponymous and enormous apple dumplings are divine. Save room, you will not regret it. They are essentially cored apples, stuffed in cinnamony goodness, wrapped in flaky pie crust and baked. They are worth a trip in and of themselves.  The decor seems a bit odd, but is well-suited to the restaurant. Country effects and pictures of family worthy of awkwardfamilyphotos.com adorn the walls. The walls are light, and the fluorescent lights are bright. Do not expect an intimate or quiet meal, but this works as this is primarily a breakfast and lunch joint (traditionally, farm families eat the biggest meal of the day at noon, and call it dinner, with supper in the early evening). The dining area can be crowded and loud, and there is a huge open entryway into the kitchen, so the curious can literally monitor everything that goes on in the restaurant. All this fits, however, as this is restaurant's honesty is bared for all to see and what is revealed is pure.  What separates the Apple Dumpling from other restaurants is not just the menu items and decor, it is the sense of family. Servers, cooks, and other staff are clearly all from the same extended family and/or social group (probably the church across the street). If you happen to be of Midwestern stock they will serve you food that is exactly like what your mother and grandmother made, and that is a big compliment in my book.  5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for a complete dearth of vegetarian and/or healthy options (other than a half-assed salad bar), a smallish parking lot, and limited hours of operation, minus another for no alcohol, but plus a star for the great prices."}
{"text":"So this place is interesting. It is definitely rural Illinois favorites from the last century that predominate the menu. I have had the chicken and noodles, the beef and noodles, and the fried chicken. The food is pretty good. The quantities are nothing short of ridiculous. The bread and the biscuits are huge and just ok.  (Seriously, who can eat that much food?)    I would give it another half star if I could, but not another whole star. The salad bar is just ok. The atmosphere feels like 70s country kitsch, and one should redecorate at least once every 50 years.   I am sure I will be back because there are folks in the family that love it. I enjoy it and endure it.    This place is sort of a culinary Rorschach test: if you love it or hate it, you are reading things into it that aren't there."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday for the buffet which had a pretty modest look to it. Today, it consisted of meatloaf, fried chicken, biscuits, corn bread, chicken and noodles, and assorted gravies. There was also a salad bar. Everything in the buffet was very average except for the fried chicken. After eating the other very average items, I was definitely caught off guard by the quality of the fried chicken. I can say without a doubt that it is the best fried chicken in town! It doesn't have that gross soggy thick batter. It's got a light coating that is perfectly crisp. I would come back just for the fried chicken! We also had the apple dumplings and ice cream. It was amazing! Imagine a whole apple, wrapped in dough and covered in caramel sauce. It was also a ridiculously huge portion. The caramel sauce had a good flavor but had a very strange gooey texture. I'll definitely make a point to stop by more often!"}
{"text":"Just what I needed today - a place removed enough from CU that I could forget about reality for awhile. Maybe 15 tables in the whole place, country cooking, and a quaint atmosphere. Just north of Aldi and Wal-Mart in Urbana.  Pork tenderloins were perfectly cooked. Minus one star for a combination of trivial factors: 1) 35 minutes for a take-out order at 2pm; 2) regardless of describing the sandwiches as coming with lettuce, onion, and pickle, the loins were bare on tiny buns; and 3) chips, not fries for a $4.40 sandwich.  Enough menu items that you have a small choice, but not so many as you will want more than one thing. The menu boasts fried chicken, country fried steak, mashed potatoes, and the like. $5-8 for lunch or dinner. ... Undecided on the employees' denim overalls and bright red t-shirts..."}
