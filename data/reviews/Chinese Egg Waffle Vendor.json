{"text":"This was simple and exactly what I was looking for! I'm amazed it has been so difficult to find this treat downtown. It's just a little cart near the entrance of the Dragon City Centre and the smell will lead you right over! The cost is $3.50 for one bag or $6.00 for two. Now that I know where it is, I will probably go all the time! Cash only, of course."}
{"text":"Love coming here every time I have take the streetcar to Eaton's centre. The egg waffles are always made fresh and taste delicious. The Chinese egg waffles sell for $5 for 2! The smell is so good, just have to have them."}
{"text":"I absolutely love these delecious and warm waffles. No eggy taste. Always made fresh to order by hospitable, cheerful, and efficient ladies. Only $5 for 2 large yummy sheets of heaven. I buy these all the time. While enjoying these Lovely waffles, I love sipping on a delecious Milk Tea that can be bought from the friendly cheerful gentleman who works in the vendor booth opposite this waffle booth. Located in the DragonCityMall, in the heart of the vibrant Chinatown, literally at the doorstep of a streetcar stop. I find these to be the best waffles, ever. My sincere best wishes to you wonderul waffle ladies and I look forward to continue enjoying your waffles from your nice booth again and again. God bless."}
{"text":"Whenever we are by the old dragon city, the smell of waffles get us every time! $5 for two sheets of egg waffles to tear apart and pop them into your mouth while they are still warm. Delish!!!! Bet you can't resist them either :)"}
