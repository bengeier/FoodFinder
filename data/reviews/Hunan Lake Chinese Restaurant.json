{"text":"ordered from here last night.  food was OK at best.  over priced for the amount we got.  their fried rice is just rice with soy sauce.  I'm sure I could have produced a better product with stuff bought at giant eagle for half the price.  I most likely will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Good takeout place. Food is fresh and portions are huge. Spring rolls are outstanding. I highly recommend this for a takeout, specially if you need a leftovers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I first started eating from this location about 5 years ago. At that point, we both would have given them 5 stars. This place was amazing!! Over the last 2 years, they have taken a deep dive in their quality. Orders are routinely wrong and when we call to ask for a remake, the lady on the phone argues with us. If the person writing the order down wrote it incorrectly, it somehow is our fault. They refuse to remake an order the correct way without us paying for it again. The one time the order was so wrong (allergy issues wrong) and I was asked to dig the plate out of the garbage and bring it to them. The chicken is often undercooked, the shrimp overcooked, and the wonton watery."}
{"text":"Great little local place never tried till recently. Some items seem very generic or premade but over all great value and portions are reasonable. Hope they get non stale shrimp chips soon, twice stale."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese takeout restaurant.  I have been there several times and haven't had any issues.  The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.  Their Pork Lo Mein is excellent (I haven't tried another dish yet)."}
{"text":"Have gone here 3 time and it was not good. The first time it was great the size you got and the taste was really good but... then we went back to next week and ended up getting msg that made me and my husband very very sick. We thought maybe it was something else that we ate so we returned over 2 months later and again got msg very bad I tried to tell the employees this and they just started yelling in Chinese and I don't know what it was about I won't be going back and I have told many people I work with about this I don't want anyone getting sick like me and my husband"}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Quick service. I've lived in a few states and their food is one of the better Chinese places I've eaten at."}
{"text":"I usually go to a different Chinese place, a little farther East, but was tired from working all day and thought I'd save the extra 10 minutes, since this is closer to home.   I used to work for a Chinese Restaurant and could reasonably say, I can identify halfway decent Chinese food. I've now come to the realization, the place a little farther east-Imperial Dragon, is the only decent joint around.  I really was hoping I'd find a place on my direct route home, but not so.  The Won-ton soup was so watered down, even a pack of soy sauce couldn't give much flavor. There was just a few chopped scallions floating around the luke-warm broth with not a sliver of sliced pork to be seen. I was still going to eat it because I was hungry, until I realized the ground pork in the middle of the won-tons had turned bad. I ended up dumping it down the toilet.  The Shrimp Egg Foo Yung was greasy and filled with white onions. The shrimp was over cooked, rubbery, and overall, flavorless with no seasoning. Even the side of white rice was gelatinous and unappetizing.   Over-priced & poor quality; I've learned my lesson and will not go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for as long as i can remember. At least once a month. It's everything you want in a chinese take out spot. The food has changed little and the decorations even less. I have never had a bad experience here and i will continue my patronage."}
