{"text":"We recently checked out The D.C. Pasta Company in Strongsville with a group of friends and had a wonderful time. We've been to Dante's other restaurants and were excited to try his Italian concept.  D.C.'s wine list has a great variety and features an extensive selection of \"under $25\" bottles. We started with the Rubus Zinfandel (lush) on the menu, but our server alerted us to a special bottle of Tempranillo (El Cortijillo) that was out of this world. It has the most amazing cherry finish. D.C. had bought the last 2 cases of this vintage, and after a glass, several of us bought bottles to take home!  The food menu is an adventure, in that there are many ways to mix and match. Pastas come as a $5 taste, $10 appetizer, or $15 main course. There are soups, salads, antipastos, and various meatballs (even ricotta for us vegetarians) to add in. Everyone at our table pretty much started with a Tuscan bean soup, ordered 2 pasta \"tastes\" with a \"meatball\", and ended with dessert. This seemed to be a good way to order and was plenty of food with great variety. The pastas were all perfectly al dente and flavorful and the desserts were fabulous. We will definitely return to try more combinations!  The wait staff was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating - especially to the various dietary needs in our group!"}
{"text":"TL;DR - Ordered simple spaghetti and meatballs, got food poisoning and a trip to the ER.  Ate here for the first time looking for good pasta. Ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and the waiter offered freshly grated cheese. I accepted. 12 hours later I had explosive diarrhea and was vomiting every 10 minutes. Eventually got to the point where I had to go the emergency room.   The pasta wasn't very good. It was chewy. The meatballs were good though. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We had high hopes, but they were quickly dashed by the blaring classic rock music!  What the hay-hay?  I really tried to get past this and moved onto our appetizer which was decent.  However, the main course(s) were sad.  We each ordered two of the smaller portions so we could do a tasting. The flavor was lacking and the presentation on the carbonara was awful.  It was a soupy mess!    The service was decent, but I am doubtful this place will make it in a tucked away location with that awful music.  Sad face.  I wanted to like, I really did."}
{"text":"Not a great location (hidden) but really had a nice dinner there this weekend. Will return!!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely a new fan of this little (south)westside gem.  We went for a late lunch for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  The decor and atmosphere are pretty simple and low key but fit the location of the restaurant.  No complaints from me for a nice lunch spot.    I immediately grabbed the cocktail menu (it was my birthday so I was getting a good drink!).  Our waiter noticed right away and suggested the Milan Mule.  If I remember correctly, it was vodka, simple syrup, basil, and lime.  Very good.  Another member of our party wanted a beer and the waiter suggested an Italian amber which I LOVED.    We wanted to share some olives but were not sure what to order.  I really like olives but I'm not necessarily a connoisseur and asked the waiter for a suggestion.  I actually cannot remember which variety we ended up with but they were good and we enjoyed gobbling them up with our drinks.   Our main dishes were the carbonara, the bucatini with lamb, and strozzapreti.  ALL were very good.  We ordered the entree sized portions and took half of everything home.  Next time, I would probably order the appetizer portion if I didn't want to eat it again the next day.  I had the carbonara and really enjoyed it.  Having the poached egg on top and breaking upon being served made it taste even better.  I did have the waiter add a little bit more cracked pepper but otherwise the flavors were quite good.  I reluctantly tried the bucatini because I'm not a fan of lamb at all.  I think I liked it just as well as my carbonara.  The fresh mint in the dish made it taste so much better than any other lamb dish I've tried.  The lamb was roasted quite well and having it kind of shredded in the dish was just right.  I would never order a lamb dish when out but when I return to DC Pasta Co. I will order this dish.  The strozzapreti was delicious!  It tasted fresh and...perfect for a vegetable pasta dish.  All three of the entrees reminded me of the fresh, rustic meals I had when visiting Italy (and Southern France).    We were going to skip dessert but the person who made the reservations (online) made a note that it was a birthday celebration so they brought out a chocolate mousse type dessert that was good.  I'm not a fan of mousse but this was still good.  And a very nice surprise.  The service was great!!  Our waiter was funny and engaging, made great suggestions, and didn't hover.  This exactly what I like when dining out.  All in all a great meal.  I didn't want to fuss with going to Tremont and either trying to find a parking spot or using valet but I really wanted a good pasta dish for my birthday meal.  The DC Pasta Co. was a great place to get a great meal without having to go to Tremont or downtown (even though I love both places!!)"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food, reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere. I even tried dishes with foods I normally wouldn't like (example: snails, mushrooms, anchovies) but everything was amazing! Staff is extremely knowledgable, you can tell they love what they do."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Dante's restaurants and I was not disappointed by the DC Pasta Co.  My advice is to order the tastings so you can try several different pastas. Skip the meat balls as they weren't amazing and they all tasted the same.  We were served bread with white bean hummus. The spread was amazing. We then ordered the arancini which was made with cauliflower, a nice touch. We got tastings of the linguine carbonara, gnochetti, pumpkin ravioli, and the cavatelli with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe. All were fantastic. We ordered one of each meatball and were disappointed (see above). We skipped dessert.  We had the Red Zephyr wine to drink. The Red Zephyr is Dante's own variety. It was light to medium bodied and neither too sweet nor too strong. Highly recommend.  The location of this restaurant is a bit weird. It's in a strip mall in Strongsville. It could definitely have a better location, and hours too, since it is barely open."}
{"text":"Lifetime ban.  A combination of horrible food and way overpriced.  We had high hopes for this place but it did not deliver. Service was sub par, and myself being Italian was really let down. I have no idea why they are charging what they are for food that is clearly made without standards. Lifetime ban declared - we will never go there again, nor take any of our out of town guests or friends."}
{"text":"Even the garden salad had me smiling. The pasta is hand made in the restaurant, prepared very well, and the flavor was 'perfect'. The service was courteous and well timed. Good menu choices for lunch and reasonably priced for the quality. The music was a little loud for the light lunch crowd, but that is the only critique I can offer outside of terrific."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night.  We were looking for a nice italian restaurant and this place was perfect. All the pasta and sauces are made fresh. We split a few appetizers and 3 small plates of the main pasta dishes.  Everything we had was delicious and the wine is reasonably priced, under $30 a bottle."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant with very affordable prices! I usually order their secondi main dishes. I've tried their pork chop and chicken cutlet. Both were delicious! The serving size was perfect for me, as I'm usually unable to finish the side of pasta. My friends usually order their meatballs, and those are consistently great!   The service has always been exemplary. Although the location is obscure, definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Can't decide what to have? Don't! Do sample sizes of the things you want. We each ordered sample sizes of two different pastas and shared. We also each ordered one each of the cheese, lamb and pork meatballs and shared. There was plenty of food to go around.   We didn't try appetizers. We instead went for the meat platter (you can build your own) and some olives. Again, top notch.   For dessert we tried the tiramisu, chocolate mousse & pine nut tartlet & all ate from each other's plates (trust me, you can't resist), and glad we did, because again how could you choose just one?   You can tell everything here is scratch made & the use of fresh herbs really make the meals. The staff is very good at stepping you through the menu and answering any questions you may have.   We can't wait to go again and again to keep working our way through the menu."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! We loved the fact that you can get different portion sizes-everyone can have a taste of everything! I would compliment the specific dishes but I can't pronounce half of them (authentic Italian names).   The service was good but our server was actually kind of abrasive. I appreciate a server with a sense of humor that likes to interact with the table, but his humor was pretty sarcastic and even rude at times. Kind of put a damper on the night a little.   That being said, I give dinner 5 stars and the \"show\" 1 star."}
{"text":"Lots of very good Italian food choices from pasta to paninis & soups in different portion size.  The service was very slow (lunch time).  When I came in there was nobody at the front and I had to wait 5 long minutes to finally have someone getting me to my table.  I was very disappointed by the decoration of the restaurant for a Boccuzzi's one."}
{"text":"So fresh homemade bread comes with dinner?  Every table at dinner had bread but ours. We were asked by the wait staff and head of house how everything was?  Everything was delicious. But no one saw there was no bread at our table. We do not want to have to ask for bread!  Dante. What is wrong with your wait staff??? Do they need training?"}
{"text":"I used to always eat at Oggi's Ristorante in Broadview Heights which was owned by Carmella Delbusso. Unfortunately, she sold the restaurant and is now cooking only at her other restaurant, DC Pasta Company,  which she owns with Dante Bocuzzi. Thus the name DC. My wife and I went to eat there last week and I cannot stress enough how perfect her dishes are. The mushroom appetizer she had that evening was unbelievable. Especially since I am not a mushroom fan at all. But that dish, I would eat every day. Her pasta is made fresh with her own hands. Something most other restaurants only claim to do. Her sauces and salad dressings are all made from scratch. We had a great meal and just have to drive a little farther to get the best and definitely most authentic Italian cooking that I used to get at Oggi's. If you know real Italian, then you know what it should taste like. Not the sugary sauces and store bought pasta noodles. Real homemade Italian and worth every penny!!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place on the Internet and was determined to try it while on a business trip to Cleve. What a huge disappointment!  Calamari was terrible, tuff as shoe leather. The pasta was ok but the sauce was too thin, more like seasoned tomato soup. Lastly, service was good but overall, the product is very over priced."}
{"text":"Love this Strongsville gem. Great Dante created dishes, and when combined with the 30 bottles of wine for $30 or less, you can make any meal a fantastic night out."}
{"text":"Nice and easy spot for dining. Service was efficient and fast. Food was very good. We enjoyed the mushroom appetizer with cheese and butter. Family ordered three small pasta dishes which were filling. I also ate a lamb meatball and kid had a ricotta meatball. Flavored were solid and tasty. Would recommend if you're looking for good food, reasonable prices and decent service."}
{"text":"The taste size portions are now gone, and the pasta my husband got 2 of in the medium dish was such a small portion you could see the bottom of the bowl.   This place has consistently gone down hill since it's inception.  The carbonara and bolognese are the best dishes on the menu, stick with them or don't bother, oh and get the largest size unless you're a 10 year old."}
{"text":"We gave this place one more try, the food was average and the portions are small. I had the pan fried trout $21 and my wife had the chicken piccata $20. The trout was small and only had greens on the side. My wife's dinner was better, but neither entree was worth the price. During our conversation with our server while trying to order dinner, the owner yelled at our server and told him to get somebody else's food out to them.  So our server excused himself and obeyed and came back 5 minutes later. The owner , John, was very unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable. I will not be going back, ever!"}
{"text":"This place is really good if you know what to expect. It's not modern looking like Dante or dba...it looks like it is in a strip mall which it is. Once you get past the decor, it's a fun spot with delicious food.   We like to go with a lot of small plates here. Last night we started with three meats, three cheeses and the marinated eggplant. Everything was really good and went nicely with our wine.  Next, we all enjoyed some meatballs. I had a chicken, lamb and pork. They were all tasty, but I liked the lamb best. Pasta was our final course. I had the taste of carbonara...amazing!  You can get the pastas in three sizes which is nice if you want to try different ones. If you get multiple tastes, they bring them on a platter so it seems more cohesive.   The lamb pasta was delicious too.   We had a great time. If you enjoy trying lots of different things while you linger over a couple bottles of wine, this place is for you.  Oh, I should add that the wine list is really reasonable which makes me happy."}
{"text":"Hate boring Italian food. Love this place. Nothing is worse than a giant bowl of the same flavor. Every bite the same. Best part about DC pasta I get to pick a variety of tastes and a variety of meatballs. Can't recall a pasta there I didn't like. Favorites are the carbonara (best I've ever had) and the pesto pillows."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had an amazing experience at Bucca last night! The atmosphere was an experience unto itself. The service was phenomenal,  S/o to our server Adam!!! It's definitely one of our new favorite spots! The food....oh the food!!! The  prosciutto stuffed chicken is hands down the best chicken I've had in years!! Bravo Bucca di Beppo....5 stars"}
{"text":"Seems I visited DC Pasta on a off day (they were beyond short staffed) but Wow, what a disappointment.  Featured on the cover of Cleveland Magazine food issue, we had really high hopes.  Location:  Tucked away in a strip mall on Pearl Road; OK not the end of the world, but it all makes sense after our experience.  Atmosphere:  Terrible and outdated.  Based on the write up in Cleveland magazine, I expected a sleek, modern, happening restaurant.  Instead, we got a time warp to everything terrible about Italian restaurants of the 1980s.  Super cheap decor and seating.  To top things off, we had Classic Rock blaring during our lunch.  I love classic rock, but it did not fit the vibe of the sleepy restaurant at all.  Service:  The afternoon we visited DC Pasta, there were two employees on location, one preparing the food, the other doing EVERYTHING else; including part time food preparation. Took about 15 minutes to get our water and place an order for appetizers.    The restaurant was empty at noon for lunch, I cant be alone of these opinions.   Only made it through an appetizer, before I called it quits.  $35 for some cured meats and cheeses and a bottle of sparkling water.  I doubt this place will last another 6 months.    To the owners:  Spend some money, hire some staff!!!  Cut the music, it doesnt fit your restaurant in any way.  You are appealing to senior citizens at lunch with your decor (for better or worse) then you blast rock music???!!!"}
{"text":"Decent, but I won't hurry back any time soon. The food was good, service was a bit slow even though it was not crowded.  The wait staff is good and knowledgeable but the menus is a bit overpriced for the location and food offering."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Italian in Cleveland! The carbonara is mind-blowing good! Noodles cooked to perfection. Three pasta dish sizes to choose from. Five different types of meatballs. A killer wine list. Classy ambience. Superb service. Mangia tutto!"}
{"text":"We had a very good meal. We started with the zucchini blossom app stuffed with 3 cheeses. We then made our own antipasta plate with olives, peppers, and mozzarella. The Server was very knowledgeable about the olives. We had never heard of those types. Our Server was also very fun and had a good rapport with his tables. We then ordered 2 tastes apiece of the pasta. All very good. It's really a good idea to do that. This way you can get a taste of some different types of their pasta. We concluded with the chocolate mousse to share. Really a good meal. Plus we had fun with our Server. Now it is a bit expensive. It's not your typical casual price Italian Eatery. So just be ready to spend well over $40 for 2 people."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding. The server was engaging and you could tell that he loved his job! The food was amazing and his suggestions were right on!"}
{"text":"Took the family out with a few friends that wanted to try this new restaurant out. Kids got the \"lunch\" size portion of different pastas, and the adults got the \"dinner\" size portions. Ricotta meatballs were pretty good, though way overpriced at $3 each.  they're about 1/2 the size of Buca's meatballs if you're familiar with those. We got the cheese and meat plates - way overpriced for what  you get. The beef meatballs were just so-so. I got the Bucatini, flavor was about a 5/10. Macaroni Grille has more flavor. Very disappointed. They want to seem upscale, but sadly, just another place that serves over-priced pasta.  What sealed the deal for us not ever going back was this: the 'dinner' size portion was only about 30% larger than the 'lunch' size, and they charge twice as much! The bowls are bigger - why? To fool the customers?   DC Pasta - stop trying to trick customers! We can do the easy math, double price should be double portion, not 30% more! We should have gotten two lunch-sized orders. All of us, even the kids, walked away hungry.  Every business wants to maximize its bottom line, but trying to fool patrons is not the way to do it. Pasta is cheap. Ante up. We won't be going back or recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"Dante...what happened?  Some 1-2 years after I consumed your linguine alla carbonara at your Dante restaurant, I remembered it with fondness and nostalgia and realized you had a pasta restaurant in Strongsville! Sweet tears of joy. I got some friends to go with me, because they were probably sick of me talking about how great the carbonara was and wanted to try it for themselves.  We started off with bread, which came with some white bean hummus. The bread smelled better than it tasted, and the white bean hummus wasn't too tasty. We asked for some balsamic instead, and I readily dipped my bread in that instead.  We got 6 of taster-sized pastas (8 were available), some lamb meatballs and two appetizers. I thought the rice croquette was tasty. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. The meatballs were also tasty and highlighted the \"lamb\" taste that I love. Most of the pastas were forgettable. And worst of all was the carbonara. It was drenched in cream, and with an entire poached egg on top, once I broke the egg, it became a noodle soup. The egg totally overpowered the rest of the pasta and I was incredibly disappointed. Our entire table was vastly disappointed with the pastas. Our table agreed that the best of the worst were the ravioli and strozzapretti.  Unfortunately our disappointment in the meal extended to the desserts; we skipped it, got our check and left. I can't say I'm too interested in going to any more of Dante's restaurants after this experience either."}
{"text":"I love DC pasta and I think it's the best kept secret in Strongsville.  The ambiance and environment is always relaxing. I love that you can get smaller portions for food if you want which makes trying new things easier. We went there this past valentine's day and received a hand written letter thanking us for leaving a great comment card. That shows a lot in a business."}
{"text":"Simple, fresh, and delicious.  I've driven by this place countless times as I've gone about the usual drudgery of suburban life.  Never really giving it much thought except on the times I've had to stop into the Ohio DMV located right next door.  My girlfriend and I ended up here and were so happy we did.  I really like that they have half portion options to their pasta dishes as it allowed us to order a few different times and share.  We got three different types.    First, the special of the day.  It had a slightly spicy red sauce with squid and calamari,  and ditalini pasta.  The first bite threw me off as I got more olive than I did pasta or squid.  But each successive bite after that was better and better.  This was my girlfriends favorite.  Second, we got the pumpkin ravioli.  This was my favorite.  The filling of the ravioli was very nice.  The dish was accented with toasted pumpkin seeds giving it a nice texture to the dish.  The ravioli was served with a brown butter sauce that had the delicate velvety smoothness that such a dish is deserving of.  Lastly, we got the gnocchetti alfredo.  While the dish itself wasn't terrible it honestly reminded us of a baked macaroni and cheese dish.  They also have some great meatballs.  I had the lamb meatball, and she had a \"meat\"ball made of ricotta cheese.  Both were very flavorful, and just the right amount of density.  With all of that being said, we had a wonderful dining experience and will definitly be back for more!  Hopefully, the pumpkin ravioli will still be on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Must have been having an off night but our party of four only had one good meal among them all. Great service and nice location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Overall, the pasta dishes here are exceptional and the atmosphere is relaxed, with very attentive service and knowledgeable staff.  What is not to love about a restaurant that makes its pastas from scratch and allows you to create your own combination (not advertised)? As for the prices, they are reasonable for the quality of food that you get ($10 for a half order and $18 for a full). Portion sizes could be slightly larger, but the bread fills you up and not everyone has ferocious appetites like myself. Like Dante's other restaurant's, homemade fresh bread comes standard and is served with a hummus dip, which is spectacular!  I ordered the special, cavatelli with clams in an alio e olio sauce - DELICIOUS!  If you haven't been here yet, you don't know what you're missing!"}
{"text":"Greeted by (I think) the owner, who looks just like Tony Danza! Now for the food.,,delicious! Short ribs very tender, root vegs fabulous, brussel sprouts with polenta, were so good, and  lots of small plate choices. I wish our waiter was less abrasive, rushed us, we would have liked another glass of wine!  But highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! One of my favorite spots in Cleveland. The manager is wonderful, and the servers have always been great. Meatballs and pasta are out of this world. I love being able to order a few small portions and taste a little of everything. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a late post, actually went there over a month ago but we really enjoyed our visit. Our server was very knowledgeable and nice. Food was very good, would recommend trying this restaurant. Lacking 1 star because I thought the menu was a little limited but I also knew that going in, not that big of an issue. Can't wait to go back and try dessert next time!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute Italian restaurant in the suburbs of Strongsville. It's one of the restaurants from Dante Boccuzzi. This place is known to serve excellent handmade pasta (I believe the pasta is from Ohio City Pasta). I'm not sure what restaurant was here prior to DC pasta but it does have that Italian charm going for it. There's also a display case near the entrance where you can purchase raw pasta to cook at home.  I've been here twice, and each of the pastas I've tried were pretty good. You can sample pastas in taste sizes to see which one you like best so you know to order a larger one on the next visit. On the first visit, the three of us shared taste sizes of the linguine carbonara, spaghetti with clams, cavatelli with sausage, and risotto along with every one of the five meatballs. Our favorite was the linguine carbonara. It was a heavy pasta but with a very smooth and creamy texture. The poached egg gave it an extra burst of flavor. The pastas were all cooked al dente. The meat balls were quite good, but we didn't care too much about the chicken as it was tougher than the rest.   I ordered mussels, the appetizer sized linguine, and tried the gnocchi on the second visit. The linguine was good this time, but wasn't the same as the first visit. It lacked a bit of salt and the sauce was not as thick. The gnocchi was quite good even though I'm not a big fan on blue cheese. The table enjoyed the mussels as well.  Both times, the waitstaff was good and attentive. The restaurant is a bit hidden in a strip mall/business plaza. However there is a sign near Pearl road."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...what the heck happened? Two months ago I would have given it 5 stars plus!! I have been there at least 5 times. Always thrilled...then last night...ordered the ARUGULA salad...as we have done before. They brought out a spring mix salad- when we told our waiter...he told us that was the ARUGULA salad. Then he brought out a small bowl of arugula to put on the spring mix salad. Seriously!!?? Not acceptable...he then brought us the arugula salad. The pasta was good...but no more tastes...just the medium and large. We were charged for an extra glass of wine...I am so disappointed. What happened?"}
{"text":"DC pasta is an excellent place for people who enjoy pasta and sampling.  The verdure misti salad was crisp and clean--great if you want your daily serving of vegetables, but if you're there to maximize the experience for stomach volume, you'd be better skipping salad for pasta.  Don't miss the bread, though.  Their thick, pillowy slices of Italian bread with white bean spread were scrumptious.  The highlight is the pasta.  The media option is perfect for those with smaller appetites and those who want to sample more than one variety.  After the salad and bread, the media option was plenty.  I opted for the ditalini with english peas.  I adored the subtle sweetness and creaminess from the marriage of the peas and ricotta, while the light mint butter sauce made it both savory and refreshing.  Altogether, I'd definitely visit again, if only for the opportunity to try a new pasta flavor."}
{"text":"All around awful. The service was poor and the food was cold and mediocre. My husband got the chicken piccata it was two chicken tenderloins on top of 7 noodles. In addition it took 2 hours for my husband and I to get in and out when the restaurant was only had full. We had been there before and enjoyed it but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I had trouble deciphering the menu, and the prices aren't cheap by the time you order a full meal and a glass or two of wine. However, the food was very good and the wait staff (for my experience) was over-and-above what you find at most places. It's also kind of cool that you can order mini dishes \"to share\" (almost like an Italian Tapas), allowing you to try a few different pasta dishes, meatballs, or whatever floats your boat. I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was all high quality, with very distinctive flavors and reasonable quantities. I can't say I'd make this a regular stop; but every now and then it would be a good change-of-pace."}
{"text":"I had dinner here when in town for work. I'm usually uncomfortable eating dinner alone but Johnny and Walter made me feel very welcome. I had stuffed zucchini (with cheese) that was absolutely delicious. I then ordered gnochetti Gorgonzola a lamb meatball and the pasta with ragu. I am a very indecisive person so I liked the ability to order taste portions and try multiple dishes. Everything was delicious especially the lamb meatball! It was a ton of food and I took it all home. I also ordered tiramisu to go and was not disappointed! I would highly recommend this place especially if you like to share- it would be a perfect date place. Next time I'm back in town I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food is really incredible in my opinion. I got the Cavatelli with sausage and broccoli rabe. I thought it was great. Sauce was great and the sausage was perfectly cooked. We also got two appetizers: the calamari and the stuffed tomato/cheese rolls. The cheese rolls were the tables only gripe. It said on the menu that the tomato was put inside the roll...not the case. Also you only get 3 of them. That's a little weak, even if they were still pretty tasty.  They serve very good Italian beers besides the standard, meh-tasting Peroni...A++ DC. (Get the stout beer, it was very appealing and not so filling like a German Stout can be)  The other gripe, my brother got the $6 gellato which ended up being one scoop. Either make it $3 or hook us up with another scoop.  Service was great, the waitresses are all very nice and could joke around. I like that, it wasn't like they were robotic happy if you know what I mean.  All in all, I would go back to this place if anyone asked me. I'd like to go back and try some of their other pasta dishes. There are a few on there that I could definitely get my mouth watering to."}
{"text":"I had driven by DC Pasta a number of times on my way home from work and had been meaning to stop in. This weekend I had that opportunity.   I had the polenta appetizer with roasted Brussel sprouts, pancetta and Parmesan; followed by the linguini carbonara with truffled cream sauce; finished with the chocolate mousse for dessert. Service also included fresh bread served with a white bean purée with olive oil instead of butter, which I found interesting (in a good way).   The polenta was well-prepared, served in a warm bowl. There was enough for two. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but a little bit too much sauce for my liking. Not so much that I didn't finish all of it, mind you, but I would have preferred just a little bit less. The chocolate mousse was light and airy. Not particularly \"rich,\" which is what I was thinking, but still very good, with a hint of cinnamon. I was also told that the mousse is homemade.   Pasta dishes come in two sizes: Media $9 or Grande $18. Had I been thinking, I would have ordered two (2) media sized pasta dishes, rather than one (1) grande dish, so I could have tried another one of their sauces and pasta styles. This practice is encouraged by the staff (accept for mine apparently) as I had overheard many of the other wait staff make this recommendation to other parties (after I had already ordered).   On that note, a \"media\" sized pasta dish, along with the bread, and a small salad would be more than enough to satisfy most appetites. My girlfriend had the Vedure Misti salad (mesclun mix, Brussel sprouts, apple, fennel and a balsamic vinaigrette); and a \"media\" pumpkin ravioli and it was enough.   Overall it was a fine experience. I gave it 3-stars because it was good. And that's just it. It was \"good.\" It wasn't \"sooo good,\" or \"out of this world,\" it was just \"good.\"   I think Italian is one of those cuisines that is very difficult to set apart from the others. This isn't Olive Garden by any means, but it's not really any better than Bucca di Beppo or Bucci's J Bella across the street.   The food was good, the service was good, the restaurant is clean; I really don't have anything bad to say.  In fact, I would say that you will have a really nice dining affair at DC Pasta and I will go back; I am just not in a big hurry to do so is all."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! My water glass was never empty and the food, although I didn't love everything I ordered, was fresh and unique. I am not a huge fan of ricotta cheese but wanted to venture outside of my comfort zone and try their ricotta meatball. It was very good, not too wet and gooey like ricotta tends to be. It was one of the best things I ate the entire night. The idea of offering three different sized servings (sample, appetizer, meal) is great since many people share or split meals anyways. This way you get to taste several different entrees and the price is comparable to just one meal. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Second time here and i still love it! They got rid of my favorite dish here though, the escargo pasta, but i'm still amazed by the food here. Definitely make it an effort to try as many pasta as possible so take advantage of the tasting menu. I would say 3 tasting menu sizes will fill you up + 1 meatballs and you're good to go!   Two good pastas to try: Linguine alla Carbonara, Spaghetti Alla Vongole Not so good pasta: Lumache E Grancio (there were barely any crabmeat!)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In terms of fresh Italian food in the Cleveland area, you're unlikely to do better. I like to go with a bunch of people and share different pasta dishes - they are always flavorful and well executed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an impromptu date night on a July night.  I happened to ride my motorcycle and the owner greeted me asking me if it was really that cold out.  I laughed.  He must not be a rider.  We were seated immediately and greeted by our server.  He brought us waters with lemon and explained the specials while handing us our menu.  I was so hungry so started consuming the bread.  It was delicious however butter was better on it the tapenade they served it with.  I had a Saltimbocca alla Romana which was good.  It was rolled and stuffed and quite tasty, albeit a bit small in portion.  My date had a special rigatoni.  The rigatoni was tasty although it seemed a \"zing\" was missing. Overall a well rounded meal.   Price maybe slightly more than I would've liked, but a decent American Italian style meal."}
{"text":"We were a walk in on St. Patty's day, the place was slow but it was later and I'm sure business was affected by the ongoing festivities throughout the day. The food was pretty good and we would most likely return but I have to say it was very uncomfortable when it came to the service. The young lady that was our server clearly had a few drinks herself for St. Patty's day, slurred speech, stumbling, etc. It was absolutely unprofessional and awkward for us, we looked around to find a manager or atleast another server but no one else was around. We could only hope that she would get the order right, I would ask for a different server next time to avoid any other nonsense. Very disappointing, it's a business, run it like one."}
{"text":"If you are looking to taste Dante in Downtown but think it is too fancy for you? Come to DC Pasta! You'll have exactly the same great food for less and in a much less fancy environment. Staff here is even friendlier than downtown. I am not even going to say that the food is fantastic because that's what you should expect from a Michelin starred chef!  Stop reading this and come here already! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came in because of all the good things I read on Facebook   Our food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice too. We had 3 different pastas and they were all great: cavatelli w sausage, butternut squash ravioli and the linguine carbonara   We also ordered a ceasar salad and fried provolone-which was the best I've ever tasted.   At the last minute, we decided to have dessert. I had the Italian Cream Horn, which was ok and my husband had the tiramisu that he said was good  The servers were friendly as well  All that said, it's quite costly and the $20 pasta dishes don't come with anything - you have to pay another $7 for salad."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my husband and parents. We had appetizers, entrees, dessert, a bottle of wine. The bill was $200...amazing for the amount of food and quality. Service was great, pasta was AMAZING and they have a meatball menu so if you just want one kind of meatball you can order it."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service & quality of food on 9/20/14.  Pasta was over-cooked - mushy - the clam sauce was horribly salty - and our long-haired waiter arrogant in a stupid way.  The restaurant was nearly empty this Saturday night although the help in a hurry to clear our table & well, we will not return.  Grossly over-rated - choose another restaurant for Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"First, we went w 8 picky eastsiders Second, we ALL LOVED IT From the bread, to the great $20 bottle of wine, the apps, the pasta, all of it The pastas are incredible It was $90 a couple for a lot of food and lots of wine Our server, Scott, was wonderful We would drive the 30 minutes anytime I think these other reviewer were somewhere else Bravo"}
{"text":"We live in Strongsville but had never been to DC Pasta. Our first visit will not be our last. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. We had a table of nine. Everyone enjoyed their food and we had a lot of fun with our waiter! The specialties of the house come in three different sizes. A taste, appetizer and dinner. My wife and I each had two different taste portions. It is a great way to share and sample their variety. I have no complaints and will definitely go back soon. We enjoyed the bolognese, gnocchi, carbonara and linguine with clams."}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is unreal. Another amazing restaurant by Dante. The ambiance is romantic with a great wine list to go along with it. Great for a date night!"}
{"text":"I've always thought nothing could exist in this plaza in Strongsville, and have seen things come and go out of there, but I hope this restaurant stays the course. Not really visible from the road, so you have to drive towards the back to see it.   The food I got was really delicious. I tried 3 of the taster size pastas with one of their meatballs. The carbonara with the poached egg was by far my favorite and if I go back will probably just get that with a salad. The dessert left something to be desired and the drinks were a bit overpriced, but the pasta was so good that I'll most likely go back.  Service was a bit slow and there looked to be only one person waiting tables and another behind the bar. Decor is kind of cheesy but once you get past that, you're in for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"An updated review ... the food is still outstanding; the waiter (Kurt?) is still outstanding; the guy at the door / host is still a d&*k."}
{"text":"For a pasta place, this pasta wasn't good. I had high hopes, considering the chef's prominence and, well, being named after Pasta and whatnot. The salad was good, the service was lovely, the atmosphere was pretty. But it was overpriced and the pasta needs work. Bummer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"traditional\" Italian, keep looking.. If you're looking for authentic Italian, this is the place.  The food is amazing, with different size options so you can just try a pasta, or get enough to share.  You can tell that it's fresh pasta, not out of a box.  So glad that there is a place to get great food, and you don't have to head North on I-71.."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, eh, nothing too appealing! Close together tables! Bread and the \"dip\" was awesome! Linguini with Clams was by far the best I have had in any restaurant, that was definitely a 5 star!  Wine list, phenomenal!  The option to choose from the \"media\" and full order pasta dish was a great option! Should have done two different but so happy I stuck with what I decided on! Didn't care for the options on the dessert menu, opted out but my friends weren't fond of theirs! Coffee, old and STRONG!  Server was on his game! Professional and on point!     We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Our go to spot when we have a date night, everything is top notch!"}
{"text":"Has always been one of my favorite pasta joints. Definitely off its game tonight. Service slow ans lackadaisical. Pasta and sauce mediocre for this place. Nothing special tonight!"}
{"text":"Served cold food and raw meatballs here several times. Menu is jumbled and un-organized. Arm and a leg to get cheese and meat app. The bar they have is in a very illogical place. The bartenders are just the servers so forget good service or talking to your bartender at all. There website doesn't work. Oyyy...."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday last week. The concept was great, we were excited to try a bunch of different pastas!  Overall our experience was hit and miss.  Some really great highlights and some really bad misses.  Hits: Polenta appetizer was to die for!!!  So soft, creamy and delicious!  Pasta with lamb and mint -- we thought this was the best thing on the menu!  Incredible!!!    Linguine with clam sauce -- this was a special and was really great.  Super clammy :)  Pork meatball -- a little weird to be served a la carte but tasted really good!  Misses: No draft beer, which we thought was odd..  Carbonara was really soupy.  It tasted good but was the proportion of sauce to pasta was so off that it was tough to eat.  You almost needed a spoon!  Wagon wheels with pumpkin and browned butter sounded better than they were.  Dry with almost no sauce or seasoning.  Bolognese sauce was awful -- dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I didn't think this place was mindblowing at all, but it was good. Not amazing, but good.  With a group of 8 people, including fellow yelpers Young and Funglin, we set off in the 30 minute drive to Strongsville, just to try another one of Dante's restaurants.  We all ordered an appetizer size dish of all the pastas- including the special of the day, a lobster spaghetti one. It's nice- they have an extra menu explaining what the pastas are, complete with drawings of the pasta, so it makes more sense.  The flavors weren't really as strong as I would have liked it, nor was the pasta an amazing consistency, but overall, it was pretty good. We got:  - Linguine alla Carbonara con Tartufo- good with the poached egg- you break it once you start eating it.  -Pappardelle alla Bolognese- beef and pork was pretty good.   - Bucatini con Salsa di Agnello- meh.. I didn't really taste the mint?  -Spaghetti con il Meglio dei Mari- good, but there weren't that many mussels..  -Gnocchetti Sardi Verdi e Blu- that was my favorite. But I just really like gnocchi. A spinach pasta? I'm sold!  -Lumache e Polipo- Didn't have much meat?  - Lobster spaghetti- came out with very little meat. Like...4 tiny little pieces.  - Strozzapreti alla Norma- The basil definitely stood out, but it was good.  So, I was okay impressed with the pasta. But the MEATBALLS, were definitely good. Especially the lamb one.  For dessert, I got an affogato. My fave. It's definitely a lot smaller than I've had in the past, but it was good... espresso with gelato and they even mixed biscotti in it... in a flute glass. Nice.  So, overall, I still prefer Dante over this restaurant and that of Ginko... but still, a pretty good find in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Overall:  Really enjoyed our visit to DC Pasta.  Food:  My girlfriend ordered the truffled linguine carbonara - it was the favorite dish among the 4 at our table, and a great subtle twist on a typical carbonara.  I ordered the Lumachi e Polipo (snail pasta with garlic, octopus, chile flakes, broccoli) - it was spicy and really delicious.  We also had some \"marinated stuff\" (cippolini onions, artichokes, sundried tomatoes) which were nice.    Desserts - Lemon sorbet was refreshing and served inside a cored-out lemon.  The affogato was good, although it in comparison to one we recently fell in love with at Crop in Ohio City, which was transcendental.   Portion size: I ordered the \"taste\" size (I think it was $5 although the menu online shows $4).  We got the carbonara in the \"main\" size ($15) which was a lot of food - enough to have leftovers to take out.   Which actually worked out well as I was sharing food with the rest of the table and had ordered appetizers and dessert.    Service: Service was very nice - professional staff, very courteous, and our server had a great sense of humor. The vibe in the restaurant was nice - the furniture maybe could have been a little nicer, but it didn't take away from the environment.    Many restaurants have tried in this location and failed -- I really hope DC Pasta does well here, because it's the type of restaurant we need more of on the West Side."}
{"text":"Not sure why the comments on bad service. We had a waiter (who was excellent) and a trainee.  Another guy for our water and different guy to bus our dirty dishes.   And the host came by at the end to check on our meal. The service was really over the top and we were there at 6pm on a Saturday.   The pasta was awesome. The carbonara was excellent. The lasagna was perfect. The small pasta portion option is great to try multiple pastas.  This is really a nice place. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was good. The pasta portions are reasonable and I didn't feel uncomfortably stuffed after eating it all. If you are even less hungry or want to try two types of pasta you can order the half size, or two half sizes.   I got the Strozzapretti Bolognese. I liked the sauce. It was a bit sweet, and thick with beef and pork. The noodles were cooked perfectly. My expectations were exceeded with this dish.   The Misti salad was good too. Again, the portion was reasonable - healthy. I liked the big cauliflower piece in the salad mixed with goat cheese, whole cranberries, Brussels sprouts and lightly topped with a pear vinaigrette.  The Spumoni Gelato and Pear Sorbet were both good and creamy. Good texture and great for after dinner. The portions were again reasonable for 1 or 2 people.   The service was a mix of good and odd. It was good in that all the points of service that you would expect at a fine dining restaurant were hit. However, the servers were a big crass as they moved about the restaurant and a line of 5 of them at times blocked the entrance to the bathroom as they just stood against the wall.   The decor was a bit off too. I know this is a newer restaurant, and I'm not sure what was in the space prior, but the space doesn't really look new. It looks a bit dated, like family owned restaurant of the 90s dated.   Oh, and pull into the driveway slowly. The drain grate that stretches across it makes a rough entrance for cars."}
{"text":"I took my daughter's family here for her birthday last month. I read the reviews and was excited for the experience. I loved the concept and the staff was great. The food just didn't hold up.  The menu does offer \"tastes\" or a full dinner of various pastas. I loved this, as we have all ordered the wrong entree and sat back and had food envy for what the other guests ordered. No way to lose.  Just order 3-4 tastes and get to sample a good part of the menu.   Unfortunately, a good part of the menu was disappointing. When you find yourself searching for the silver lining, you must finally resign yourself to the fact that the food doesn't live up to the hype.   Sorry DC Pasta, I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"My parents have been raving about DC Pasta for weeks, so I chose it for my birthday dinner last Saturday, anxious to try it and also to have a place that everyone in the family would enjoy!   Although I can understand why other commenters gave mixed reviews, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The format of the menu alone, which allowed even those of us with smaller appetites to try several items over the course of the meal, is enough to win my approval.   Notable dishes include the polenta appetizer, the sausage ravioli, and the tiramisu. Though tempting at $2 extra, I found the meatballs unremarkable. The wine list was lovely and affordable. A moderately priced bottle of montepulciano paired well with everything.   If you're looking for a sublime fine dining experience you may wish to save your pennies for a meal at Dante, but for a more casual - yet lovely - dining experience to enjoy with family, DC Pasta is a wonderful choice."}
{"text":"Recently a group of 8 women went for our annual holiday get together. None of us live in Strongsville, but wanted to try DC Pasta.  The restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall on Pearl Road.  This makes it a little difficult to find, but well worth the look. It is a Strongsville hidden gem and almost seems out of place in this suburb.   Before even ordering our meals the manager came to our table and offered his assistance to one of the ladies whose battery had died in the parking lot.  It was so nice that he went above and beyond for her.   We all ordered the small plates and were amazed they were as big as they were. The pastas were all excellent and I ordered a beef meatball side which was very good.   We had such an enjoyable night and did not feel rushed. Everyone enjoyed their food and no one left disappointed.   Can't wait to go back with my husband."}
{"text":"Have dined here several times over the years and have nothing but great things to say. The staff is very friendly and the food is awesome. I love being able to order pasta that isn't the same old boring entrees you see at many other restaurants. Their polenta is some of the BEST I've ever had and the mushroom risotto is phenomenal. Love this place!"}
