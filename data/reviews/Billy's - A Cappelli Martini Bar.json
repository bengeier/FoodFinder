{"text":"Amazing place to enjoy a cocktail with family and friends.

The staff- very welcoming and friendly. Quick and attentive.

Food- quality selection and great tasting."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and Decour is very nice.  However I feel their drinks are way overpriced. Food is exceptionally average, and overpriced just like their cocktails. Walking into the men's bathroom, Felt more like entering a walk in cooler! For what they are charging for drinks and food, you'd think they'd have some heat going in the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Service and food are always great. Martinis are made perfectly and a nice, wide selection... exactly what one would expect of a martini bar."}
{"text":"I saw the duo Pickin' Rocks there several months ago and just found out they are back tonight.  I thought the atmosphere, service, drinks and music were all top notch.  I can't remember eating anything.  I'm going to try out the menu tonight."}
{"text":"Been going here for many years. Their food is good, portion light i feel but  the decor is great. It is certainly an outdoor summer place. I think some of the staff could use some polishing on several occasions a few of them act like your putting them out other then that bump in the road overall nice place to pop in and checkout."}
{"text":"I'd been to Billy's when they were in the hotel facility on the east side of rt 306 and always enjoyed it. I must say, with the move, they really reinvented themselves.  We rolled in at about midnight on a Saturday after a casino night charity fundraiser, dinner, Chinese auction.  Since we didn't win the coveted Booze Cooler door prize, we had to use our imagination for the \"after party\". One of the couples we were with suggested we try the new Billy's Martini Bar.  We must hang with these peeps more often!  But I digress...

Ambiance - Billy's is an Oasis in the ever present Mentor OH strip mall desert wasteland .  Having arrived after dark we were greeted with festive and inviting  white lights adorning the parking lot trees.  The sirens' song of music, laughter and animated discussion drew us the rest of the way in.  The place was well attended by an eclectic mix of ages, races and styles, but not overly crowded.  We sat ourselves at 4 chair high top table.  We had a choice of leather couches and chairs framing a casual but elegant fireplace area.  It appears sections can be made semi-private by drawing the wispy opaque ceiling to floor curtains. Music that ordinarily wouldn't be on my playlist, but I very much enjoyed, filled the place (albeit a tad too loud)  All in all a very cool cabana meets India vibe!

Service - We sat ourselves but were quickly attended to by Mike.  We spent a couple minutes perusing the vast martini menu and made our selections.  Thinking Mike was going to bring our bar filled glasses of nectar of the gods, we got a pleasant surprise and very nice touch.  The martinis are delivered in the shaker and dispensed in to the awaiting glass/s after a good table side shaking.  Your martini is poured into a classic glass and, as a bonus, into a tall shot glass sized \"sidecar\". I hadn't even brought my martini to my lips and I was already enjoying it. Throughout, multiple staff members made sure we had everything we needed.  We were well taken care of without being smothered.  

Quality - We adventurously ordered (2) Hot and Dirty and (1) spicy Bloody Mary vodka martinis.  After they arrived with all their regalia, we dove in head first.  This was the best martini I can remember having and my companions concurred.   Perfectly chilled, shaken and formulated!  Having the sidecar to pour in to the glass or sipped out of directly added to the experience.  Yuuummm...

Value - Of course you can make \"similar\" concoctions at home at a fraction of the cost.  However, you can't duplicate the experience of having a martini expertly delivered to you in such a great atmosphere.  At $8/martini I found it to be an excellent value (all things considered).  I say $8 IS a good value because I've been to self proclaimed martini bars serving'em up at $12-15 a pop.  

Bottom Line - if you haven't already , check out Billy's for a nightcap or to get a great evening started.   We didn't get to experience the other side and outside areas of the bar, so we will be back soon.  Maybe we'll see you there!"}
{"text":"The bartender was super friendly and overall a fun ambience. Tries Billy's Irish Cream which was on special and the Lemon Drop Martini. Both were excellent. Great list of other martini flavors also like snickers."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this 4.5 stars.  My experience was great!  The drinks, food, service, ambiance, atmosphere were a big hit.   I met 2 friends here on a Friday night after work.  I arrived at approximately 5:25p.m.  to a semi-packed room.  There is also a nice heated patio outside, on either side of the entry way.  The outdoor space was pretty full for a chilly night.   The martini list is huge!  I opted for a PomTini was poured tableside with a sidecar in addition to the main drink (nice touch!).  My dining companions ordered the White Grapetini and the Chocolate Martini and both thoroughly enjoyed their selections.  We also opted for appetizers.  We ordered the sampler platter which included chicken tenders, potato skins, egg rolls and mozzarella sticks, in addition to a variety of sauces and dips.  We also had the seafood flatbread, which was divine!!    The flatbread arrive hot, with a perfectly thin, flaky crust, topped with a garlicky sauce, cheese, shrimp and crab.   The portion size was more sufficient to share, especially with the sampler planner.   Within 30 minutes, the place was filled to capacity, but our servers never ever forgot about us.  They continually checked on us, cleared empty glasses/dishes, filled water glasses etc.   There was great music playing in the background.  This was a GREAT experience.  I can't wait to go back.....soon!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like a billly's you never know what your going to get. One night completely awesome , the next night total hillbillies take over. I live the martini section but the menu could use some help. 

I really wish they kept the old place. I loved the ambiance there !!!"}
{"text":"Monday night special is $6 burgers and 1/2 price bottle of wine. We shared  the blue burger medium and it was excellent!  The house made chips are also quite tasty. We shared a bottle of Malbec.   $23 later it was a nice Monday night out.  We will return.  We like the new location much better then the old in the hotel across the street."}
{"text":"One thing I don't love about this place is that it draws so many that it can be hard to find a seat on more popular nights! 

The atmosphere is fun, comfortable and uptown casual. The lighting effects and decor finishes are trendy and well thought out. The outdoor patio area, even though right alongside the parking lot, is equally inviting. Being heated and partitioned off with heavy curtains makes it usable even during winter months. It does draw a lot of smokers which makes it nearly impossible to be enjoyed by non smokers. Even sitting close to the door that the servers use can be bothersome as the smoke is pulled in with every opening of the door. 

The martinis are poured table side and each come with a sidecar which make them quite generous for their price points of $8-$12. There is a large wine and beer selection also. The menu has several sharing appetizer options for snacking while socializing. I've tried several of them from dips to pizzas and they've been tasty. I choose to come here though more for the drinks and atmosphere. There's also a smaller, but adequate dinner menu. I have not tried any of these dishes to comment on the quality, but they sound worth a try. The pricing is pretty much spot on comparatively. 

Depending on the night, it can get sometimes rowdy and loud with a younger crowd. I prefer weeknights for this reason.  This is definitely a popular location for all types of social gatherings though. Great job Billy's!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town. Awesome venue with good music, great drinks and plenty of fun."}
{"text":"No longer in a hotel bar?  Yes!  An old time fan of Billy's, the service and atmosphere is amplified from the old location with a high energy uptown feel.  Great drinks, crowd, and parking is MUCH improved.

I have not tried the food but that's not what this is about.  If you're sick of the downtown Willoughby scene I strongly recommend you give this a chance.  But beware - it's busy!"}
{"text":"Food is less than average. My dip came out luke warm, my chicken was dry. You have 10 different servers bringing you things. This place needs consistency! All 10 servers were nice, but i like having one server. May come back. $2 blue moons are a great deal tho!"}
{"text":"How a \"Martini Bar\" thinks it can claim such a title with only three gins in its arsenal is beyond me."}
{"text":"Opening night.
Bar was attractive.
Staff waiting tables was attentive we didn't have a reservation and had been following this 'brewery' for weeks...didn't know we needed one. Asked to sit at one of the many empty tables and an attentive waitress she would ask if we could sit in her section. No. 
Wait 15 minutes for a beer.
Got our beers 2 were the wrong beers..knowingly by the bar tender. The peach beer we were given not order tasted like a Mr. Brew home brew beer. And when we asked to have the beer we actually order she gave a ton of attitude and said no. 
Spoke with the owner after and he said it would be handled. Great guy and I'm sure it will be. Such a shame that some people don't know how to have hospitality. I severed for years and cannot understand theses types of people.
Looking forwarded to going back to for better experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried it last weekend.  In addition to a lot of martinis, they had an impressive collection of on-tap beers.  I tried one the server recommended (Third Shift) and it was an excellent choice.  But other than that, I couldn't particularly recommend the place.

We got a bunch of appetizers (small plates).  None of them were particularly creative, there was one that was very good (the fried zucchini slices), but the rest were a big, dull OK.  Nothing was bad, it just wasn't particularly good.

It is a very nice looking place.  The server was very friendly, but the kitchen was slow, particularly for appetizers.

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great martini list and a huge variety of beers for those who aren't into liquor. The food is ok...nothing special, but definitely not horrible. Very nice, modern decor with a pretty long bar. Pretty sizable patio as well!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The martinis were exceptional. Shaken and poured right at the table. Although The list is long, I'd love to see them add even more of them to the menu.  I had the seafood flatbread pizza to eat and it got rave reviews from the whole table. The Acapella salad looked fresh and wonderful as well. Service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and attentive but didn't hover. As a bonus,  I had emailed the restaurant because I tried to view the dinner menu on line and could open the menu link. I didn't really expect much in the way of a response but to my surprise they sent me a copy and told me they were aware of the issue and were working on it. That was good service in my book. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not a martini person but I like this place. My friend is a smoker and he likes the heated outdoor bar. It is much nicer than the old location. I was there and was impressed with the staff and decor. Last time I was at Billy's at the old location in the hotel I punched some young punk who was rude to my wife. So we said we wouldn't go back. We tend to avoid douchy 21 yr old hangouts now that I'm 42 (my wife hasn't aged at all since then). So, hoping the crowd didn't follow \"Billy\" to the new location. But I was there for happy hour and it was adults only, so that's good."}
{"text":"This was my very first visit, and I had a really great experience! My friends arrived before me and were a bit buzzed from the martini's they had ordered. They were full of suggestions as to what I should order. Being the driver of the evening, I knew I couldn't drink much. I ordered the blue lemonade martini. I loved it because it wasn't too sweet. I tried my friend's drinks as well, and they were all perfectly made. 

My friends ordered a few shots. As the night wound down, we were the only ones left in the lounge. The staff gave us free dragon berry shots, which was very kind of them. 

They made sure that those who were clearly intoxicated were not driving home, which ended the night on a very good note as I felt they truly were happy to have us as customers. 

5 stars."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend with my husband and another couple. My first martini was the Carmel Apple...not great. Instead of sending it back, I choked it down. Martini #2, the s'morestini....flipping amazing! The best part was the graham cracker crust rim. Martini #3, even BETTER, the snickersini. Omfg! Fist time my husband has ever been there, let's just say he could barely walk out of there..lol"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio. Good prices for beer, and a great environment!"}
{"text":"Very fun place came here with a friend. Upscale but we came casual and didn't feel awkward. Amanda is a excellent bartender. Inside heating was nice had a lemon drop martini which was decent. Seating was very cozy. I didn't get a chance to try the food but it's on a list of things to do next time. And I u understand there is heated outside seating which I will have to also check out."}
