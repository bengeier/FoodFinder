{"text":"I fell in love with pho because of this restaurant. I haven't found another place that makes it nearly as good! The service is really good - the only comment I would make is that you have to flag someone down when you want the bill. 

The restrooms are pretty gross but not bad enough to keep me from the delicious pho."}
{"text":"The price is reasonable and the taste is quite good
The waiters there are very polite and nice.
I like the decoration and it is a comfortable place to sit and chat with ur friends.
However, the stairs to the washroom and washroom are subpar."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in the willowdale area. The portions are big. I can eat a lot and I sometimes find it hard to finish a large bowl of pho. The location is close to north York subway station which is great. The food here is not expensive. It's great if you want to chill with friends and have a cheap meal."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time.
And i mean...ALL THE TIME. 

Is it because I love their menu? No, not really, it's because my boyfriend is hooked on pho this winter and can't stop taking us out for a cheap, hearty dish that's around the corner and, let's be honest here, probably one of the better Pho places in Willowdale that hasn't totally pissed us off with bad service (sorry Vietnamese Delight, my boyfriend will always stink eye you forever).

That being said, the rare beef pho with fresh noodle never dissapoints (i hate the vermicelli/thin rice noodle, I grew up with pho with thick fresh rice noodles). The cuts of beef are perfect and have no freezer burn (cough, Pho Hung) and the broth at the willowdale location is definitely alot better than the one on Spadina.

Cheap, consistent quality, decent service - this place will continue to get our service for a long time."}
{"text":"I love this place - very quick service, excellent portion sizes, and tasty food. 

Go-to's are spring rolls, pho, or crispy noodles. Some dishes can be a bit on the oily side, but its worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Been here a lot of times. The food is always fresh, and the service is always amazing. The food comes out really fast. The saut√© chicken pho is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Just-eat. Food came 2 hours after ordering and was cold and the beef noodles had no beef and the rest of the food was gross. Never ordering from them again\"}
{"text":"Decent prices. Service is ok , but can use some improvement. Overall satisfied."}
{"text":"While visiting my cousin in Toronto he took me to this place down the street from his living quarters. We walked there the first time and it was a bit further than we expected, but we made it. 

I was impressed at the design of the place. It looked like a fancy place to eat - especially for North York. When you walk through the double glass doors, it felt like you're entering a club with their techno-style music and their black upholstery. The service was decent - I've encountered or notices that not too many people in the restaurant industry around Toronto smile at their customers - anyway, they took our order and was very prompt. Ten to fifteen minutes later we received our food. I ordered the Vermicelli Noodle with Grilled Chicken and Beef, it was SOOOO good! (Typing that out right now made me really hungry for it). 

During my 2 week stay in Toronto, I came back to this place approximately 5 more times. I couldn't stay away! Of course I order something else every time and all were very delicious. 

Till next time Pho 88. :)"}
{"text":"Usually I don't leave a negative comment. But honestly this is the worst pho ever. Avoid it. So many good places around."}
{"text":"My friend had raved about their Crispy Noodles with Gravy for months. We finally decided to try it. I ordered - Fried Rice with Shrimp in Pho 88 sauce, and spring roll. My friend ordered- Crispy noodles with Chicken. To say my dish was revolting would be an understatement. As soon as the food arrived, I had to put away the shrimp in sauce because it smelled horrendous and had to cover it with paper napkin to mask the small. The spring roll- extremely oily, soggy..just not good. The fried rice were wet and just had an off-putting taste. My friend's dish was decent, not as good as the last time she had. 

I sent my food back, barely a couple of bites eaten. I really wanted to like this place as I love Vietnamese cuisine.I hope it was just a bad day but I would definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service, this place is super cheap on limes and napkins. Lol 1 napkin per customer and thay doesn't help when you order satay pho."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 5 years and this is hands down my favourite pho place.

The pho is always good (and well-priced) and service is quick & friendly. 

On the rare occasions I've had an issue here (slow service, incorrect order) they were impressively quick to correct it (rushing the order, quickly bringing the correct dish)."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: the place was modern and clean with lots of seating. Lunch time fills quickly with professionals from the local businesses. Make sure to get here quickly and maybe even before noon to guarantee seats.

Good: I ordered the pho satay - medium size and fried spring rolls ($7.75 for med bowl + $2 for satay base). The portion size is pretty fair for its price. The satay broth was spicy and full of flavor. There was an adequate amount of meat, but definitely not enough to fill up a hungry person. 

The spring roll was fresh and crispy ($4.75 for 2 rolls). Typically places have too much taro in their spring rolls, this one was ok. However the size of the rolls seem kind of small. 

*note: Pho 88 did offer a lunch special menu however this was only available from Mondays to Thursdays and 11 a.m. To 3 p.m. They did have a small pho special with a spring roll and a can of pop for $8. 

Overall this place was relatively decent as the food came quick and it was alright. I would recommend this place to friends and I definitely will be back again"}
{"text":"I love their house special pho noodles really good. I have tried their other dishes with rice and I enjoyed them. I would definitely come here again. Service was good, pretty efficient and fast. If your in the mood for pho or Vietnamese food in general I would recommend. Their various smoothies/milkshakes are yummy."}
{"text":"There's a classic line from Woody Allen's movie Annie Hall:  \"Two elderly women are at a Catskill mountain resort, and one of 'em says, \"Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.\" The other one says, \"Yeah, I know; and such small portions.\" \"

Well, our first visit proved to be the opposite: good food, and huge portions. The pad thai was big enough to feed 2, perhaps 3, people.  And even a small pho was enough for 3 of us to share.

The food was a bit spicier than we (Caucasians, sorry) were expecting.  For example, our thai red curry was almost too spicy to eat even though it sports only one pepper on the menu.  Lesson to us: ask for less spicy next time!

My treat for dessert was the cold espresso coffee with condensed milk.  It's delivered to your table in a drip espresso unit; you wait for the hot water to drip through, then add ice cubes and stir.  Delicious and sweet."}
{"text":"Been going to Pho88 for a long time, both this location and the downtown Toronto location (which closed). The soup broth is good, and the tenderness is exactly the way I want. My last visit was quite disappointing, first off, I don't recognize any staff here anymore, all changed. 

The washroom in the basement is extremely disgusting, worst then some I have seen in Chinatown, I noticed the kitchen is also in the basement close to the washrooms. I echo earlier poster's comments of how this place isn't clean, well does not look clean, both the washroom in the basement and the way they casually clean the tables.

Now the pho, P01 Small, I knew it doesn't come with a bowl of meat and packed with goodies, but I got three slices of overcooked meat and not even half a beef ball (half is standard for a small?), some tiny pieces of tripe, that's about it. I inhaled it in 4 minutes and felt a strong sense of emptiness both in my mind and my stomach.

Please add back that half a beef ball and clean up the place."}
{"text":"Every review I see online about this place has been pretty good, so every time I've had bad food, I keep thinking I should give it another try.  No more!

One time we ordered delivery and they just never showed up!  When we called, there was no answer on the phone.  

The pad thai tastes ok, but has almost no sauce.  The noodles at the bottom of my takeout container were completely dry and white - the sauce was only on the very top.  There were a lot of noodles, though.  Also, it was supposed to be shrimp pad thai, and there were only 3 small pieces of shrimp.

Once I ordered the penang curry, which is supposed to have peanuts.  Not only was it peanut-free, but it was gross.  The curry had no flavour, which they tried to hide behind a riduculous level of spiciness.  I LOVE spicy food, and could barely stomache this.  Also, it only had 2 pieces of chicken in it and was full of grey, mushy broccoli.

This last time we ordered, my husband got the sweet and sour chicken, and surprise! Only 3 pieces of chicken.  The rest was tasteless, undercooked bell pepper and onion.  I got the mango salad.  The mango was under-ripe and mealy, the coriander was off, and there were only 3 cashews in the whole thing.

Three terrible meals means I'm done listening to the other reviews.  In my experience, the food has been AWFUL and I won't order it anymore."}
{"text":"Pho 88 has consistently great food, I have eaten here many times.

They have nice tables and seats, this place can get busy during lunch times but the wait is worth it because the food is always great. I normally get fried noodles with tofu and it has always been great.

They serve you tea when you come in and food usually arrives fairly quickly, service is friendly.

They do not give you a knife and fork unless you ask for it but chop sticks are readily available on all tables along with hot sauce and other condiments.

Warning: Serving sizes like most restaurants nowadays is massive and way too much food for one person, but I always over eat and finish my plate :)"}
{"text":"If u want piss in a bowl eat here. .what a joke. Came late. Ordered a beef soup. It was yellow. They mixed a bunch of old soups to create one. Every other time. Soup was red. Now yellow. I will never go back again. Just say. Its late. In t mix a special bowl together. It was filled to the top with noodles. The only good thing was free tap water.

37 reviews. 34 5 star. This was a disgrace."}
{"text":"Pho88 chain has always been so-so but most of the time it does a decent job in getting rid of the pho craving; the many location has a lot to do with that.

For this location, it sits in the heart of north york/ willowdale business district so the restaurant is always business during lunch hours.

I have been this location plenty of times but only in a span of 5 years and this is my first time reviewing this location.  I really not nothing good to say about this restaurant only the fact that it is fairly clean and service is timely.  The good list pretty much ends there.

The bad.  Food is pricey but I guess that's expected for restaurants located so close to office buildings.  I have had the rice platter and their pho numerous times and have yet left satisfied.  Their rice platter is filled with rice, not bad, but little of anything else.  Their pho bowl is topped to the rim with their msg soup and very little of anything else.  Their profit margin must be terrific but they should have the decency to feed their customers properly like the rest of their chain.

Unless you're dying for pho and can't be bothered with walking north a few block then I suggest that you try to avoid this Pho88."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for take out at the suggestion of my hotel. It wasn't good but it wasn't bad. I waited at the front desk for some time before anyone came to greet me, the person I spoke with couldn't tell me the difference between two noodle dishes, but then I ordered something he suggested when I asked. I ordered a glass of wine while I waited but he had to go find someone to find the bottle although it was right behind him on the shelf with all the other wines. The wine wasn't very good but that was ok because my food was ready I about 5 minutes so I left. The food was bland...not good, not bad. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Came here after work with a friend of mine just before he was leaving Canada; we had a good time, good food an pretty decent price; authentically Asian :D their selection is quiet small since most of the items in the menu are actually side compliments an just replace 1 certain ingredient of the recipe. None the less, it was great food for a great price! great for a quick eat an go place when you're in the area."}
{"text":"I eat here and get take-out from here all the time.  I find that the service is usually very fast.  I highly recommend the glass noodle with chicken or beef, or the stir-fried noodle.  I've also tried their green thai curry, which was good.  Was not impressed by the Tom Yum soup.  The hot tea (a lotus or jasmine tea, I believe) they serve with the food is very calming.  Will keep coming here."}
{"text":"I once tried the special Pho, it was okay. Second time I went there, the food was disaster. My pork vermicelli was nothing similar to what I had before, and my girlfriend ordered a king prawn vermicelli, which was even worst. Probably not going back. Probably."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho in Toronto. Noodles is springy and the broth is tasty.
Size is so generous you can swim in it."}
{"text":"They really cheaped out on the portions. My boyfriend got pho with tripe and there was barely any tripe or meat. The shrimp on sugar cane was tiny and we paid around $6... Not impressed! I've had a lot better for the same price"}
{"text":"Pho 88 is a nice hot tasty bowl of authentic Vietnamese pho restaurant.

This is one of my favourite pho restaurant in the Northyork area.

Clean atmosphere. 

Very affordable on a budget."}
{"text":"Went in for a casual dinner last night and ordered the prawn vermicelli, the colour of the prawn looked a bit off when the dish arrived but I didn't make much of it and started eating the vermicelli. When I finally got to peeling the prawn apart, I realized the entire inside of the head was black, the intestine wasn't cleaned out and when I took a bite...the meat was MUSHY.....need I say more? The prawn was clearly stale. When I informed the server about this and asked for a replacement of the prawn, she put all the yucky head and shell I peeled off back into my bowl and said she had to show the chef first. She then came back and said they can't give me a replacement because I've already eaten some of the dish...and so I was expected to finish eating my vermicelli that now had all the dirty parts all over it. 

I wasn't asking for a replacement of the entire dish...I just wanted a new prawn, and even that they are not willing to offer for an obviously stale product. The best she could do was offer me a 10% discount off the bill, and even that she forgot so I had to ask again when I was paying. 

I don't expect the best tasting food from a restaurant but I expect its quality in terms of freshness to at least be at a certain level. Especially for products like seafood, I think it is very important for the restaurant to make sure it's fresh and won't cause sickness for their customers. Their unwillingness to fix the problem really turned me off from ever visiting this restaurant again. Clearly they don't care about the standard of their food or their customer's concerns - they would rather just fix the problem with a little monetary discount."}
{"text":"Craving pho on New Years, thankfully Pho 88 was open. I had ordered a medium sized P01 (which is the classic/special of pretty much all pho restaurants) and I'm glad I only went with the medium because these are big portions! The flavour was there, not too salty and not too bland. 

The restaurant was pretty clean and besides the screaming kid at the table beside us, the atmosphere was like being at your friend's mom's house. Overall, I would go again if I want pho... but it wasn't so special that I would deliberately go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"We ordered large size pho and rice with beef & pork.
The food was decent, and the servers were alright. There weren't anything noteworthy about the food, and maybe I wanted meat pieces to be bigger. It was overall alright for the price I paid.
The restaurant is in a convenient location, so I wouldn't mind coming back if I am in the vicinity and want a pho really badly."}
{"text":"The soup was essentially hot brown water.  it's almost as if they don't know how to make the soup.   The ingredients are numerous and complex...  It had none of the flavour like star of anyse etc...

The service was good.   when asked they brought the meat and the garnishing separately."}
{"text":"Reasonably cheap, and serves large portions. You can easily share a dish with a friend and feel satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"And I say that I live here...I didn't even know this place existed! I always thought if I wanted Pho or Vietnamese cuisine, my choices were limited to either Spring Rolls or a restaurant on Spring Garden (name escapes me now).

This place is actually quite large and long. Lots of booth seating yeah! The menu is extensive and I think if you want a Pho or Pad Thai fix, than this is your place. Because I was full, I had the Mango Salad. I prefer Spring Rolls' Mango Salad as the meat there is cooked western style (I remember I had BBQ-like meat). At Pho 88, the chicken is cooked \"Asian\" style and I have no idea how to explain that any further.

I ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls which is a dish I always order at every Vietnamese restaurant I go to. Not the best I had, but not the worst.

Prices are average and I now know where to go for my Pho fix. I didn't get the Pho, but my bf did and it satisfied him."}
{"text":"Cheap place to eat out, but average price point when compared to other Vietnamese joints. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all with all the other amazing restaurants at yonge and finch. We ordered the Special Pho, Spring Roll Platter, and Pork Vermicelli. The spring rolls were terrible. The skin was soggy and oily, I suspect the oil wasn't hot enough when they dropped the spring rolls in. The raw vegetables in the pork vermicelli were not fresh. The pho tasted good, but nothing special. Definitively will not visit again."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to this area, and being a huge fan of most Asian cuisines, I certainly had to try this place.   It also coincided with me catching a cold and really wanting a nice warm bowl of soup. :)  I was not disappointed!

This is quite possibly the best Pho I've had!  I've eaten lots of Pho since getting introduced to it a couple of years ago and I must say the broth here is by far the tastiest!  The meat is tasty but it's not as spectacular, though still very good, though the broth quality makes up for it completely!  The only thing I felt that was missing was the jalapeno  peppers on the side which is always a nice touch, but the Sriracha was there for the added kick I love.  Yes, I love spicy foods. :)

The portions were huge and the price was great.  I will certainly be coming back here to sate my Pho cravings and would highly recommend this to any Pho lover."}
{"text":"Great consistent service and food, clean and nice decor (although the washrooms are in a dungeon), springs rolls are 'meh', but the entrees and drinks are always great. The prices are very competitive as well. Definitely my favourite Pho joint in North York."}
{"text":"It's not blow your mind pho. But it's still pretty good. Lots of other Asian options. Good spring rolls. Cheap for lunch"}
{"text":"Great local Pho joint. The large pho is so massive my dinner companions have never finished it that I have seen. I stick with ordering a small if I'm having apps and the medium if I'm just having pho. I'm not a fan of the sate sauce broth option but my friends certainly love it. 

Service is prompt. No complaints. And I hear the local delivery is good too though I've never had it delivered yet."}
{"text":"Their beef meng is disgusting. Never going to order that again. Pho is most of the time good. Price is cheap. I have also tried phud Thai one time, not good, too oily and felt like they cooked it with ketch up."}
{"text":"Average pho. Spacious, quick and efficient. The service is average but not the greatest. It is decently clean with the washroom located downstairs (kind of creepy). The ambiance is quite relaxing and can get pretty full on weekend dinners. It's pretty close to the subway station and easy choice for comfort food (mainly pho)."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is a great restaurant. They sell great soups at a wonderful price. Their portions are huge and they have my favourite soup in the whole world. I absolutely love Tom Yum Soup and they sell it. It tastes wonderful and is a good size portion. I highly recommend this place.

It is a small restaurant and you may have to wait for a table as it's always busy."}
{"text":"Ive only had their food as take out or delivery, so can't say much about their dine in experience. Food is yum, especially the PHO on a cold winters day. The pad thai is good but not awesome. The springrolls aren't the greatest. But the rest of the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"The only thing I order is pho, and it is pretty good for the price(the soup is nice)! But the flavor is not as good as before, a little under seasoned for me. 
The avocado shake was good, and the tea there has a milk tea scent for some reason??? However I tried other things such as fried rice, fried noodles and other meals(fish/chicken/pork with vegetables and rice), they were bad! The rice was hard and the meat was not tasty at all. 
One piece of advice would be: DON'T ORDER ANYTHING WITH RICE!"}
{"text":"If you want Pho in North York, go to Pho 88. There's nothing better.  To be honest, I'm posting this review because they screwed up my order and I got upset. Without any hesitation, they apologized and comped my meal to keep me happy.  That is the epitome of good customer service.  Keep up the good work!!!  You are the best pho sure!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for at least 5 years, and I still cannot get enough of their pho! Very delicious, decent service even when its busy, and their rolls are very good! Highly recommand"}
{"text":"Came here with a group after watching Deadpool. I ordered the pho, which was so-so. I've definitely had better since the one I had felt like they put in a lot of salt to make up for the lack of richness that the pho soup should have. I felt really thirty after eating it and kept downing cup after cup of tea.

I will say that their staff was friendly and accommodating to our group, making sure we always had water and tea available. If you have to be in the area and want pho, sure go for this place, but there are better options to explore. I'd give it a 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Pho 88 is not as lucky as you might think. If you are looking for a quick hangover cure and are desperate for Pho then I guess this place will have to do. Like the previous reviews mentioned, the Pho Broth has something to be desired. They need to work on perfecting and improving the broth. It literally tastes like they put no love or effort into it...almost like it comes out of a package of Mama noodles. The broth is really thick and tastes bland. You will need to put a lot of Hoisin sauce and Rooster sauce to make it taste like something.

Their fresh rolls are decent but nothing worth mentioning. They do not provide the red chilli peppers and give you the cheap Green Peppers instead. They are pretty stingy with the Mint Leaves and Bean sprouts unless you specifically ask for more. 

If you are looking for a good place for Pho I suggest going to a Pho Dau Bo which is worth the trek or going to Angus Pho up the street instead. Pho 88 needs to really focus on improving their broth in order to call them a legit Pho place."}
{"text":"Yummy food! The staff were dressed up for Halloween when I went. Great place."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant is clean....
Went with my mom their for dinner a couple of time. We would never order anything else besides pho and the curry rice ... 
One time we ordered chicken skewer.. Waited forever but it came .. And it's cold. Like it had been sitting there for a while. And  also it was so hard we could barely eat it.."}
{"text":"As soon as you enter you will notice a spacey restaurant. Don't raise your expectations yet though.

We decided to share a large Pho 88 special. Pho here is reasonably priced and tastes A-OK. Not the most flavourful out there. Could be because their meat portions were not so generous. We stll finished the whole bowl as we were hungry. Service was alright.

Worth checking out if you are nearby. Or head to Angus pho. Your call."}
{"text":"This is a pho restaurant my friends and I often frequent. I only ever order their pho, so I am unsure how their other menu items are like. But their pho is pretty decent and it is fair priced. The noodles are good, but the soup isn't too strong. It isn't as awesome as \"Peach Garden,\" but still a lot better than many other places I have eaten at. They give you a plate of bean sprouts, basil and lime, and their sweet sauce isn't watered down. The service is quick and the waitresses are nice. The restaurant is also kept clean looking for the most part. So yeah, this is probably the most frequented restaurant I go to."}
{"text":"Love pho 88. So close to home and always good food. The sate broth pho is delicious and spicy. The broth has very good flavour and not over powering. I also like their grilled meat rice and vermicelli dishes. I wish the vermicelli noodles was not the thick kind but thin rice noodles. The friend spring rolls are also very flavorful and crispy."}
{"text":"For a table of three, they gave us one menu. 
Way to be efficient?

I ordered a tomato beef brisket noodle. They served me a curry beef noodle. 

I told them this is not what I ordered. 

They then ask me if I've eaten here before. If I have, then I'd know this is how it looks like at pho 88. 

I told them I have eaten here before and ordered the exact same thing but it didn't look like this. 

The server walked away. I was hungry, I ate it anyways. 

\" Excuse me, this is not what I ordered. \" I hear from the next table. 

They clearly switched our orders and the server responded the same way. \"  if you've eaten here before. If you have, then you'd know this is how it looks like at pho 88. 

I gave less than tips than usual and they chased me down to give a tip."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is a piece of bullcrap restaurant! There is no wifi and the pho tastes disgusting. Not everybody can afford data. The restaurant across the street named Tea Shop is more considerate with wifi and more scrumptious food! 

Sincerely,

Valerie"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Pho 88. The Chicken Pho was a generous size serving for a small soup dish and was flavourful with the fresh basil and bean sprouts. The Szechuan Beef with rice unfortunately was not as tasty and not very spicy. The vegetables did not seem fresh and the beef was not tender. Also, the sauce was overwhelming with a tomato flavour and a little bland. I would try their Pho again but I would pass on the Szechuan dishes next time."}
{"text":"Arrived right when they opened; service was great, broth was fresh, place is clean. 
One of my biggest peeves, when dining at pho restaurants, is when their cafe sua da (iced coffee w/ condensed milk) tastes like chocolate slush or bland watered down coffee - this location did not disappoint me.
Sizes are larger than usual and the prices are really cheap! I'd come back."}
{"text":"Chicken pho here is a huge disappointment. The soup is basically water with salt, and chicken Brest has no seasoning. This is usually fine with other pho restaurants but that's because they have rich and flavorful soup. The dish tastes so bad that I have to add tom yum soup to it to add flavor. Haven't try its beef pho so don't know about that. 
Tom yum soup was average and the fried shrimp roll was ok.
Staff was friendly and the environment was good.
In general this is below average pho restaurant. I used to live in downtown and tried many pho restaurants there. Please don't order chicken soup pho."}
{"text":"Really lacking compared to other pho restaurants I've been to. I would avoid this place unless you're absolutely desperate for pho in this area. 

Their customer service really sucks. They're not consistent with food quality either, we ordered a large house special to share and we didn't get any rare beef or hardly any meat really for such a large order. We got 1 pc of tendon and no rare beef and mostly brisket. After bringing this to the waiters attention (who was not attentive whatsoever. And rushed passed ppl who wanted something. ) came back up with a lil bowl with broth and the smallest two pieces of rare beef you can imagine. Barely two slices. That pretty much pissed is off. How is that substantial to making it up to us when YOU guys were the ones who didnt give us any meat in our pho? 

Their waiters seem to always be rushing and non present even when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Won't go wrong for signature dishes of Vietnam: vermicelli with roast beef(or anything else, love the sweet chili & white vinegar dressing) beef noodle soup with a bit of everything. Worth coming back for some appetizers recommended by others. Not a fan for their curry though."}
{"text":"Could use improvement. The food here isn't too bad. Pad Thai is overcooked and a little mush but very flavourful. The place isn't the cleanest. Windows and doors are full of finger prints and washrooms could use better maintenance, as well. Service is slow but friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here several time. I like the selection of both Vietnamese and Thai food, I enjoy spicy food, and they have the option to making any dish spicy.
The Vietnamese soup is big even the small bowl, plus it comes with noodles so it's a lot make sure your hungry. The Pad Thai is very good as well. 
The service is usually pretty quick and the staff is friendly. I always order something different every time I am there, so far I have not gotten something I did not like."}
{"text":"Service is consistently Terrible, which is a shame because the pho is actually great. My husband asked for Extra limes and our waitress had the audacity to tell us it would be $5 extra!!! For limes!!! We are regulars at this spot, and have been putting up with the terrible customer service for years Only because the food is so good..and after this we will not be returning. 

They genuinely don't care about their customers, and have a terrible \"roll my eyes\" attitude."}
{"text":"Great to fulfill that pho craving but definitely more fast pho food than authentic Viet cuisine 
The deep fried spring rolls are always delicious but last time I went and ordered the vermicelli with spring rolls and pork, the noodles were a bit stale."}
{"text":"The order came very fast. Won't say they have the best pho, but it's decent. I would suggest to try there."}
{"text":"I love this place. After a night out, this is the place to go for some nice hangover pho. Although their portions are a bit smaller than other places, their pho is fantastic. I usually order the medium sized P01 and spring rolls. I would definitely recommend ordering a large if you are really hungry! Their bathroom is a bit sketchy as you have to go downstairs and it smells a bit. However, the restaurant is pretty clean and the atmosphere is very casual. I would recommend if you are looking for some reasonably priced pho in the North York area. I heard that it gets quite busy during dinner time so if you have a large group, make sure to get their early!"}
{"text":"We got the delivery service. It took an hour and 20 mins for the food to come. We got the pho and grilled chicken and beef with rice. We also got the shrimp rolls. The rolls were not appetizing.  Inside was extremely dry. The chicken and beef was good. I've had better pho though. Probably will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Pho 88... I been trying to check this place out for a while finally I had the chance. I really liked the design of the place organized and tight. The heat was a bit over and felt warmer than it should. We ordered the special pho and spring rolls. The spring rolls were decent not that impressive but not bad either. The pho was good I liked it not the best pho I tried but good pho I will definitely come again for it. The washrooms were not impressive. I had to go all the way down to get there and it is kind of cold thought the way although it was extra worm inside the place. Inside the washrooms they get the job done I guess but is about it. Over all the place is good."}
{"text":"I usually go to Pho 88 whenever I am craving some pho or happen to be wandering around the area. The place has some amazing service and their deep fried spring rolls are to die for! Their pho, in my opinion, can be a bit inconsistent. Sometimes the broth is too salty and sometimes it is too plain. Overall, their pho is generally very tasty. The atmosphere is very warming and the interior design is very appealing. The washroom wasn't to great to be honest. It had a very strong smell of chemical products and the washroom was kind of like a dungeon. The pho dishes are quite cheap as well. If you happen to have a small amount of cash on you and want some pho, you should try this place out! The real downside would be no wifi however. But, good food is all that should matter! Regardless of its flaws, Pho 88 is my favourite pho restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place, have been coming to this restaurant for years for their Pho and the taste and service has been pretty consistent.
If you're not a huge fan of cilantro OR the bit of sweetness in phos, I definitely recommend this place. 
Overall, good portion, price, and taste!"}
{"text":"Solid pho. It won't blow you away, but it should satisfy you.

Spring Rolls were good, but not amazing.

Prices are dirt cheap. Portions are huge. Excellent cheap option."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Massive bowl of soup for $7. Some amazing spring rolls, got the plater. I will def be back on a reg basis."}
{"text":"This is really the most bland pho I've ever.had in my life. Had to squeeze load of condiments to swallow. The cold shirmp roll is also tasteless."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with lightening fast food service at peak hours. 

I often come for the 01 Pho (Classic/Special/Whatever you call it), which comes to under $10 tax and tip included. The satay broth add-on is definitely worth it (+$2.50) and is a great twist on pho for those loving, but tired of the standard broth flavour.

I also love the Beef/Spring Roll Vermicelli, which has great flavour an is $10 pre-tax. 

It's not the best pho in the world, or the fanciest place. But it's great for lunch hour rushes, and is comfort food at a great price."}
{"text":"I have been here on numerous occasions and I have never been disappointed. I usually have the Special Pho and it is nothing to be impressed about but it is not a disappointment. I would come here again and again.

My favourite here is the cold shrimp rolls :)

The service is really good, staff is friendly and makes sure everything is good with your food and if you need anything else."}
{"text":"Service is alright, though the staff kind of gives off a snobby vibe. Food was only decent, nothing spectacular. Variety was quite large and good. Wait time was a. It ridiculous, relative to other pho stores. The restaurant interior design itself was nice, but doesn't really give you that nice sweet welcoming feel that you get in other Pho stores."}
{"text":"This place is annoying. I've been here twice and both experience wasn't that great. 

The first time I came here, I pointed at an item #2 on the menu to order, and my server took a very quick glimpse and said okay. His face honestly looked like he didn't give a crap about his job and I could tell he just wanted to get off his shift. So I was skeptical whether he got my order correctly, so to make sure, I said \"I want #2.\" And he said okay. Then of course, to my worries, he brought two #1's, instead of one #2. They offered to switch it to the correct dish but I said that's okay. 

The second time I came here (tonight), I wanted to get a takeout. I initially ordered a large pho and added extra noodle, then as soon as she entered the order, I changed my mind and asked for extra meat instead of noodle. She said okay. As I was making the payment, I reconfirmed \"extra meat, right?\" and she said yes. Well... when I came home, I was so annoyed to find extra noodle, not meat.

Like geez can't these people give a bit more effort when taking orders? It's not that difficult. I don't think it's my communication skills because I don't have such problems at other restaurants. 

So does their food make up for their careless service? No. Even their food is so mediocre and ordinary - can't really say anything too nice about this place."}
{"text":"One of the first authentic Asian spots I've tried on my business trip was not a dissappointment.  They advertise as being Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese so while one can be wary about fusion places, this wasn't bad.

Service was slightly slow, but it was a busy lunch hour.  Ordered a Chicken Satay and a large bowl of their 88 Pho - both recommended dishes per their menu.  Chicken satay ($5) could've used some peanuts on top of their sauce for some texture.  The large bowl was HUMUNGOUSly awesome and I had to give it an extra star for that ($7.50).  Broth was great, but the so much noodle it started to taste starchy.  I'd stick with a medium next time."}
{"text":"star #1: ENORMOUS PORTIONS. I couldn't finish my small.
star #2: Good prices--small pho was 5.75.
star #3: Fast service.
star #4: Roomy seating.
star #5: Was there for my pho craving.
star #6: my 100th review.
star #7: it made me run out of stars."}
{"text":"I would say their pho noodles are decent. Not quite pho-tastic and not much variety in their soup base other than sate soup but their chicken and pork rice combo is mm mm good. Nicely grilled on the outside and juicy but not dry on the inside. It comes with great Pho 88 fish sauce (not diluted) and goes well with their spring rolls. Portions are great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The good thing about Viet places is that they usually have a very big food and drinks menu to choose from. At Pho 88, they also had a dessert menu, which stood out for me.

 Most of my friends got pho, but I got a grilled pork + cha rice dish instead. I frequently get this at Vietnamese restaurants, so I didn't expect too much. It was pretty delicious considering I haven't had the dish in awhile. The prices were pretty good for the portion amounts, and they had quite a bit of variety for their beef noodle and rice dishes. They also have a Thai menu, with your typical pad thai stuff. 

The place had nice decorations and indoor lighting, which created a good atmosphere. This place would be 4 stars if it wasn't for the meh service. The people were friendly, but the server barely came by our table. Our tea ran out 20 min into our meal, and no waiter bothered to refill it throughout the rest of the meal. We went on a Fri night, but it wasn't too packed."}
{"text":"It's not bad food.. I tried the red curry chicken I will go with 3/10. I ate way better curry chicken than this one, it was too light almost no flavor of the curry.. and also the chicken with shrimp grilled. It was good... 
Would I come again? Maybe in 2 years ... atmosphere was welcoming..."}
{"text":"Love this place..always have!

Just noticed that their menu is nowhere to be found online since their site shutdown!

I posted pics of the menu...you're welcome PHO 88!!! You're welcome!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty decent, I would come back again. I ordered cold rolls without shrimp hoping they will add more veggies or tofu, but they just filled it up with lettuce, cucumber and noodles. But the peanut dressing was delicious. Still, over $5 for 2 small lettuce rolls (that I make at home in 2 minutes) is a bit too steep.
I also ordered vegetable curry which was pretty good (and spicy). It was nothing special, probably would not order again, but it wasn't bad either. What I liked about the place? The Pho was really good! And the employees are also very friendly and nice. Would come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I only tried their avocado smoothie because I was stuffed from holiday eating previous nights. The avocado smoothie was rich and creamy. I can definitely taste the avocado. Definitely will be my preggo craving list."}
{"text":"The food is average. The Pho has lots of noodle and little meat. Severs are not paying much attention to customers unless you call them then they are very attentive. Need to clean up the steps to the bathroom."}
{"text":"Their Pho is not bad. I'm the kind of person who only eat Pho when I go to a Pho restaurant and I wouldn't order anything else, so I won't be able to say whether their other items on the menu is good or not. 

The service is pretty good, even during busy times. However, my mom had an order of tofu once that had bad and close-to-rotting lettuce stacked on the bottom though, so that was a little nasty. when she pointed it out to them, they acted like it wasn't a big deal, so that wasn't that great. Now on to the pho

The broth isn't as flavourful as I've had. The meat portion isn't too big, but they put a lot of noodles in. It tastes great on a cold winter day after walking in, but when I compare it to some other pho places i've been to, it's reall the broth that isn't up to par; or else i'd give it a 4 star. They also don't have the raw hot peppers with the condiments i kind of expect Pho restaurants to have. 

Parking is a pain in the butt. You can park at the back, but there's the Korean store guy next store who will threaten to call a pick-up truck and saying that that whole parking place is his property :/. Walking is the best option.

with all that said though, I go there quite often....around twice a month? which is pretty often for me :D. Their food overall is decent and I'd keep going to fill my pho cravings."}
{"text":"2.5. Wasn't too impressed with the food. Everything was very bland. It is definitely not the best pho place in North York. Price was alright and it's at a convenient location to meet up with friends. However, there is no parking unless you want to pay. Service was quick though.

I ordered the vermicelli with pork, spring roll, etc. There was so much noodles in there. The pork was good but they served very little. 

If you need something frugal around the area, it's definitely the place to hit. But don't expect your palate to be overjoyed."}
{"text":"Came in for pho.  Not sure if we happen to get the bottom of the pot or something but it was way too salty.  And I'm not saying that cuz I'm older and that I complain everything's too salty.  I verified this with the young person beside me that the pho broth is indeed way too salty.  I should have asked for some boiled chicken to dip in it."}
{"text":"I'll have to admit, even though my spring roll and herbs weren't great, it's still better than Viet Delight. 
Their lunch menu is quite good. $8 for a 3 course meal. Spring roll, either rice or pho and a pop drink. With tax it comes out to $9.04. 
It can get pretty hectic during the lunch hour but that's probably because they're the only pho restaurant in the area and their lunch deal is a bang for your buck. 
I love my pho but I'm going to try to pick another meal to review for next time :)"}
{"text":"Nothing to special about this place. Went there with my sports team and had a variety of stuff from the pho to the satay to the spring roles. Spring roles were very nice but the rest is honestly pretty boring."}
{"text":"As I've said in other Pho reviews, it's not hard to mess up pho. This place is simply bland in my opinion. The broth is watery, meat portions are weak. The staff is ok. I don't have much else to say... a bland review for a bland bowl of soup."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the nice Asian manager that smiles at me in a 'Hey, I remember you'' kind of way, I would have given this place 1 star. 

This place is definitely not the best for pho. I had a small rare beef noodle. The beef:noodle:soup ratio was out of wack. There was a never ending amount of noodles and little soup to accompany it. It was almost as if I ordered a medium size, but they placed it in the small bowl. On top of this, the 'rare' beef came not so rare. It was also very chewy since the cuts were thicker than usual places and had a slightly bad odour to it. Yikes. The broth was a bit too oily for me as well and doesn't even compare to Pho Hung's in Chinatown. 

Overall: I didn't finish my bowl, but luckily my friend was paying that day, ha! Trust me, you've got way better options from Finch station to Sheppard-Yonge station."}
{"text":"Whether I go to the spadina downtown location, out west in etobicoke/sauga or up at Yonge n Shep ... this is a for sure no doubt damn good pho spot.
Of course all of the other options on the menu like cold shrimp rolls, deep fried spring rolls, vermicilli or rice/noodle/meat/veggie/seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Went there to satisfying a Pho craving and came back out mind blown. The Saut√© Broth was awesome. Spicy and tasty."}
{"text":"Based on a handful of trips to Pho88, I can say that the food is consistently decent and the service is quite efficient. You get tea as soon as you are seated, and food is served very quickly. The restaurant is clean and the leather booth seats are very comfortable. 

The portions are freakishly large. A medium pho is plenty for me. The cold shrimp rolls and satay are definitely worth trying. 

I would rate this higher except that I found a big lump of fat in my raw beef pho the last time I was there, which was gross and made me gag. Vomitrocious!!!"}
{"text":"One favourite thing about Pho 88 I always liked is their consistency of their food. You always get the same portion, and quality.. 

My favourite menu item that other places ALWAYS mess up is their rare beef sate pho. I find most places uses the same soup as the regular pho but they add some sort of sauce. I like their sate soup at pho 88 because it's thicker and way more flavourful than most places I've tried in the past.

Though I find many of their rice dishes overly dry. But you can always ask for a complimentary bowl of soup!

Price point is average as you would expect from all pho places. They don;t over charge because of the location and the limited competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Decent prices for Yonge St, Decent quality food. Decent staff. It's hard to find anything to complain about Would totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the rare beef Pho, spring rolls and crispy pad Thai dish. Portions were huge, food was quick, fresh and hot but seemed a little bland. Had to add sauce or dip to make it taste better. Not sure if it was the portion size or all the sauce we had to add, but I went home with a belly ache after eating here.  

Overall, the Service was great. They seem a little stingy with napkins though.  When we would ask for more napkins, the waitress would only bring out one.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great pho place for lunch! Their sate broth is the perfect spiciness and the service is fast. Go early to grab a table because it gets busy. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pho is one my favourite foods.  I love pho's broth!  Its about the broth, the aroma of the anise and the tang of the beef bone flavour.  I could have the soup and noodles only.

Every time I order pho I go through steps before I get it in:

1. Pinch apart the cinnamon basil and put it in.
2. All the bean sprouts.
3. Squeeze the lime and throw the wedge of lime in the soup.
4. Fold the noodles at the bottom over the sprouts, meat, cinnamon basil and lime.
5. Take my spoon and take a sip of the broth.
6.  And finally get it in!

After my steps, I sipped into something really disappointing.  The broth was clear and a yellowish undertone.  The taste was essentially chicken broth flavoured with the beef pho flavour cubes.  Really below average.  I did try this same location a year ago and had the same feelings.  Its is busy at this location because there is no other pho place close by and its convenient.  I still finished it and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"It was cold day and my fellow coworkers were starving for something nice, simple and hot. So pho88 was proposed and it was almost an unanimous decision to head there for lunch.

Pho88 is a popular choice amongst toronto pho lovers and there's one that located along yonge just north of the north york centre ttc station. It's a nice place that's packkeeeddd, I say again packkkeeedd for lunch. Beware of fridays - true story. The decor is nice and modern and the service attentive even with the sheer numbers at lunch. If you can, try and make reservations and even order ahead of time as we've been here a couple of times and this strategy worked best.

Once we got there, we got our seats and our food came in about 5-10 mins. This was great as we had to head back to work for meeting. As a heads up, it was a table for 12. So this strategy still works for large tables. I ended up ordering a large beef pho and it was just right. I would normally order an XL but I can't afford to fall asleep soon after. If you're a relatively big eater I would recommended a large or even an XL. And definitely use the hoisin sauce with the pho. The broth was good and exactly what I wanted.

Overall, I do like pho88. It's a good choice for the quick work lunch on a cold day, the prices are reasonable and the guys there couldn't help themselves with the level of eye candy. Do note, make sure to order your pho with the dry noodle type. I believe that's how pho was intended to be like."}
{"text":"The absolute rudest servers, ALL have a really bad attitude  and are very short and snarly with patrons. Today's experience was my last one there. I ordered a pho sate beef and it come out with tripe, the date came out extra grainy and at the very end there was something on my bill which I didn't order. Go to the Scarborough location, this one is a write-off."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap food or pho withe average service, then Pho 88 will do. Their pho small size is like a snack so best order a large if you're hungry. The one thing I didn't like was the smell of cleaning detergent and washroom odor once you enter the restaurant... Such a huge turn off."}
