{"text":"While One Life Raw Juice Bar will be opening soon in Selwyn, I have sampled some of the selections that will be on the menu...AMAZING food selection!!!!! I can't wait for opening!!! Organic, way to go :-)"}
{"text":"I never thought I could love a beet burger so much! Their Dirty South Burger is very delicious with the perfect blend of sweet and savory and packed full of flavor. The food is amazing and the owner is AWESOME! First time here and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"BEST JUICES IN CLT! I've had them all, and no where else can you find better, ALL ORGANIC, juices for this size and price. The juices are so good I decided to try the food. It's equally as good and has inspired me to try more vegan cuisine! I've had the sushi roll and the beer burger. Both fantastic."}
{"text":"NOTE: Winter hours posted 8-1 M-F, 8-3Sat, Closed Sun. Tough review to write. I typically only review businesses that are under the radar and which have yielded a good experience.  One Life is a tale of two businesses. The product is five star, A+. Most of my experience has been with the smoothies, which are the best in Charlotte. With Green Brothers, Carolina Smoothies, Berrybrook Farm and Luna's all in closer proximity, One Life is still worth the drive. No canned nut butters. No juices or milks out of a jug. Great consistency and ingredients.  However, which brings me to the negative aspect, good luck getting them! The business is almost never open, and their hours change on a whim. Their Facebook is not ever up to date (note winter hours). The last four times I have gone there they have been closed, despite checking their Facebook first. Four times. Not one random day where the plumbing broke or some force of nature occurred.  I hope they can establish consistent hours and stick to them. At present, with all the other options nearby, it's just not worth the risk/reward."}
{"text":"The lemon-ginger wheatgrass shots were delish and I am savoring the sweet carrot juice drink.  We plan to try the food items on our next trip.  The menus are on the counter top, we were pleasantly greeted by the owners and were very comfortable while we enjoyed our drinks.  The juices offered are unique - I have not seen the combinations available at Earth Fare, Whole Foods or Jamba Juice.  If you are in the area or want to support a small, local business, One Life is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I was not impressed. No menu on the wall which I thought was odd. They did, however, have one menu available that was a few pieces of paper stapled together that you could certainly wait in line to review (and feel rushed while doing so with people waiting behind you). Staff were not overly helpful or friendly. My smoothie was fine, nothing special, and certainly not worth the $9.00 that I spent on it. From now on I'll stick with the Juice Bar in park road shopping center."}
{"text":"2nd time I've tried to come here during \"open hours\" and they are closed. Their sign says they are open but the doors are locked."}
{"text":"I was on Selwyn running errands and wondering where I was going to eat lunch. Eating out now that my doctor put me on a dairy-free, hormone / soy-free, gluten-free, and corn-free diet is a bit of a challenge so I've been frequenting the \"safe\" places a lot and was hoping for something new to pop up. So when I was across the street and about to turn and saw One Life Raw Juice Bar I thought it would be worth a shot even it it was a \"liquid\" lunch.  Much to my delight, not only did they have creative juice and smoothies but also a few solid (you guessed it) raw food items too. I ordered something called the \"Un Stir Fry\" which was like an asian stir fry but thankfully made with their housemade almond butter (very creamy) instead of a soy-based dressing. It also had rice from turnips and delicately seasoned avocado, veggies and mushrooms. It was exactly what I needed and it's so nice to have another option.   Turns out I hit them during their \"soft opening\" (they gave me a first timers' discount) and it looked like they were adding menu items like \"taco tuesdays\" and more so I look forward to trying more things there. They clearly are very health-oriented and the menu explained various health benefits but the menu also didn't denote what things were organic and which weren't, so I suggest adding that.   The place is small but has a few tables and a counter at which you can sit. I wish the best to One Life!"}
{"text":"Husband and I moved back to Charlotte after 10+ years in Boston, NYC and DC where raw/vegan/organic cafes have been popping up. We love it and are so glad this is available in Charlotte. Vibrant, real and flavorful food that is clean, fresh and actually delicious.   We are both busy omnivores and try to eat a balanced diet when we can -- quality of ingredients + taste = everything and One Life does a great job.  From fresh juices, smoothies (allow customization and you can also choose from a list of add-ons with an up charge) to the amazing classic beet veggie burger on gluten-free toasts, I've loved everything, and I am not a beet fan. This is as real as delicious food gets, y'all. Go and support this local biz!  Two suggestions to get the fifth star: -website content should match store display so everything is seamless, e.g. hours, menu and maybe add a little bio or tell us the One Life owner's story! -it can get busy and the wait is long (you can always call ahead of the menu is updated on the website), but it never hurts to interact and catch up with the customer / fans :)"}
{"text":"Loved the raw beet burger! Delectable and very filling! One Life Raw Bar's food is thoughtfully constructed and so yummy! The atmosphere of the restaurant is bright and invited; a great quiet place to get some work done"}
{"text":"Yum!! Love to have options for healthy food on the go. I ate the blue tropic bowl today and I am in love . Coconut, bananas, granola, and more. The workers were kind and the atmosphere was clean & welcoming. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I travel to San Diego a lot for work and often hit up local juice bars. This was my first time here at this place and I must say my experience was memorable but not for the right reasons. No one greeted us upon entering the premises. No one explained how to order or what they offered as there are no menus hanging on the wall. There are a stack of menus on the counter and none of the employees were eager to point them out or walk us through it. Huge opportunity here for them to have better customer service. So I figured out the menu myself and placed an order. No one asked for my name or said how long it would take...  I sat and waited and my juice was brought to me. It was delightful - not as cold as I would have liked but delightful none the less.  They do serve food here - again, had no idea b/c no one mentioned that and they also have free wi-fi.   This could easily be a five star location - music should be playing, the chalk board should have specials on it and it should be on the side walk, the employees should be more friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have now been to One Life twice and I am in love with this place! For starters the location is very convenient and the restaurant is beautiful on the inside.  Chef Sean is amazing and will make suggestions to make sure you find something you like, which was great when I took a newbie to their first raw vegan experience. And the lady working the register, Tameyka, was an absolute delight!  So far I have had their raw vegan sushi, which was amazing. My two favorites however have been the beet burger and the overnight oats! The beet burger was outstanding and the overnight oats came with a great variety of fruits on top and was extremely filling.   Also have enjoyed the beet juice and the green juice, also amazing. I can't wait to try some of their shots!   I can't recommend this little gem enough!"}
{"text":"They were all out of cold press when we went... But made us a fresh juice right there. It was nice to see a menu that offered low sugar/high veg options as well as the usual mainstream standard high sugar flavor profiles.   Would love to see them add outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Had my first visit here. Tamika is a brand new owner and  very knowlegble.  Please come in and support her new business.  She also serves food.  She even customized a drink for me based on mu dietery concerns."}
{"text":"If you are raw/vegan/just like healthy food AND in a bind then this is an option. Overall customer service needs MAJOR improvement. When you are out of something and substitutions or omissions need to be made, please TELL THE CUSTOMER, especially on an item that clearly states on the menu that it cannot be modified yet you modify the heck out of it. Please train your workers to be enthusiastic as the whole reason I come to a juice bar is for vibrant energy both in my foods and ambiance. I asked what a specific berry tasted like and I got the response, \"berry\". The juice I originally ordered wasn't available and no suggestion of a comparable alternative was made. Doubt I will be returning based on lack of customer service."}
{"text":"The latest juice addition to the neighborhood. Stopped in on Sunday afternoon post workout. They've only been open about two weeks. Minimalist yet fun decor. The staff was friendly and helpful, answering questions, making suggestions and providing samples. They make the juice fresh when you order it, which is great but time consuming. If you're in a hurry and want to grab a quick juice that's ready to go this is not the place (at least at this time). The rest of the menu sounds fun and delicious, all vegan. I look forward to returning for smoothie and maybe their taco Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Knew this Sunday would be a day of unabashed gluttony, so decided to do a juice fast today. Googled \"juice bars\" while Uptown early Sat morn and results produced a spot I was completely unaware of. Read a few articles online, saw photos of the owners, and excitedly decided to make my way there in support. Yay. Stopped by around 9am for carrot juice.   (Sigh)  After leaving with my 20oz carrot juice ($9+) I pulled up some yelp reviews to see if perhaps I'd just caught them on an off day. As it relates to previous criticism about their customer service,  I wish I could offer a different perspective.  I had originally intended to stay, as the decor is very nice, but, left.  The first few years of running a business are massive learning experiences. I hope they monitor and act on customer feedback. No regrets in giving them a try. I got my juice."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have found this place!  What a great addition to Charlotte!  If you are in to tasty vibrant vegan food, you have arrived...  is it a bit pricey, yesterday you absolutely get what you pay for.  The tropic blue bowl is heaven and my absolute favorite thing on the menu.  Chock full of coconut, almond butter, mango, banana, blueberries granola and all delicious.  The veggie burger is amazing too!   The location is right on selwyn in the same strip as Winnie's bridal which is perfect, as you keep eating here, you will look amazing in any gown!  I have only gotten take out orders but would love to dine in one day as the dining area is cute and cozy.   The service is warm and friendly and the young lady who make the bowls in the morning made me feel like a regular after coming in the second time.  I really hope this place stays around and maybe expands the menu as everything is just so tasty"}
{"text":"I tried One Life Raw Juice Bar during their soft opening and I was impressed! The beet burger was filling and delicious! I wish that the burger came with a side though. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to get because everything sounded so good! I will definitely be returning to try other items on their menu! The store itself was quaint and cozy and I can't wait to come back to eat yummy vegan food and enjoy the lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just dropped in to see what they offered and my eyes went straight to the cookies and creme. The ingredients were all healthy(no actual cookies or creme) and I will be returning, my drink was great!"}
{"text":"Love this place but not impressed at all with management. Went in at 5:15 on a Tuesday (they close at 6:00) for a bowl and was told by the owner \"Sorry I already closed the kitchen\"... you close the kitchen and turn away paying customers 45 minutes before you close? Doesn't even make sense. Really disappointed with this experience and doubt I'll be going back. You just lost a loyal customer"}
{"text":"We needed a raw organic juice bar on this side of town!  Great people, quality food.  It does take 15-20 minutes to get your order so be ready for that, but the upside is everything is made fresh to order.  Who can argue with that?"}
{"text":"Sitting here in the parking lot on a Wednesday at 1pm and they are closed. Two other people have come and tried to open the door but it's locked and there's no note. I'll not be coming back but wanted to try them out."}
{"text":"As a vegan with limited options in Charlotte, I wanted to love this place. But I don't. The store itself wasn't very inviting, nor were the employees. The juice was just ok, and expensive. Haven't been back to try any food items and not rushing to either. I wish the atmosphere was at least more enticing, I might give it another shot."}
{"text":"8.50+ tax for a smoothie but it was delicious! It's more of a treat than a regular purchase. I got the tropical pineapple green smoothie to go and the cashier was very nice. The place is really cute and clean. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Amazing service, with even more amazing smoothies! If you're in the area, this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I just got the Tropic Blue bowl and it was so good! They were fast and friendly, the place was clean, the smoothie was the perfect consistency, had a great topping to smoothie ratio, had amazing flavor, BUT it was a rather small bowl for the price (ended up being $13.50 after tax). I get that it is organic, so that's probably par for the course...but it seems a few dollars too expensive to be worth it. I'll be back, just not very frequently :)"}
{"text":"First time to one life raw juice bar and I am very happy and impressed! Beautiful inside, clean, and good location. But the best part of it was.... the maqui bowl! The presentation itself was beautiful, and the taste and quality were outstanding. Highly recommend. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This one man show is the real deal. Food and drinks are on point and all natural raw vegan... since when did uncooked food taste this good!?!  The owner is super nice and friendly.   The location is tricky to find with GPS (in strip mall directly on street). Pricing is expensive, but I'm sure rent and overhead costs are a pretty penny in this neighborhood.   Come experience healthy treats to reward yourself for a hard day's work."}
{"text":"The Tropic Blue Bowl was amazing! One Life is in a great location, very clean and accommodating and the music selection was perfect. I'd recommend them to anyone that appreciates fresh smoothies, bowls and delicious veggie burgers. There's really good stuff in here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and have never been disappointed!!! The beet burger is fantastic, so much flavor and is filling for lunch. I also love the maqui bowl - it's my favorite breakfast treat! So happy this place is in the neighborhood. Will definitely be visiting often!"}
{"text":"The menu has changed, reduced to only 4 food items, but this is not posted anywhere (website or FB). So note that the picture that another yelper posted is not accurate.  All they have are the two burgers, sushi roll, and the stirfry.   I got the dirty south vegan burger and it was overall OK. It didn't blow my socks off or anything because it was a little dry, but granted I couldn't do any better. :) Nice burger concept. The salad that comes with it is wonderful though! I liked the colorful carrot curls and avocado on the side.  My order was ready when I arrived. Staff was friendly. There is adequate parking. It looked clean.   I'm not a juice person so I probably won't be coming back, but if you are vegan or like juices, I would certainly give it a try."}
{"text":"Cute little shop I've been meaning to check out. I looked at the smoothie options and was recommended and also drawn to the Rosemary Orange. Flavor is awesome but the smoothie was a little chunky. Definitely need to floss after this one. Probably needed a little more blending time. Other than that, I loved it and will be back!"}
