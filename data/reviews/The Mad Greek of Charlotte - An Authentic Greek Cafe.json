{"text":"The Mad Greek will not wow you from the outside.  When you pull up you will undoubtedly think the place is going out of business.  However, they just opened up and the decor reminds you of an old diner.  I mean a really old diner.  

Enough of the aesthetics.  The food is good.  I had the gyro sandwich with fries.  The gyro was STACKED with meat and the veggies were fresh.  I must also say the pita was fresh and hot.  The tzatki sauce was good.  I prefer a little more garlic in my sauce but this was good regardless.  My wife had the Philly Cheesteak and it was great.  

Again, the decor is weird, the parking lot looks run down, but the food is good.  Try it - you will be surprised just as I was."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Greek food I've had on the road during my 7 years of travel. Mind you, I am mostly vegetarian, so my choices are in that genre. The Village Salad was just like I remembered from my honeymoon in Greece: beautiful chunks of veggies with a light oil dressing and spices.  Superb!  I know spanakopita is not on the list for road warriors watching their waist line, but it was the best I ever had!  No kidding.  I usually only eat half off meals on the road. Polished it off. So tasty.  Homemade too. I think that was one of my top ten best meals ever on the road for work."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to grab a quick bite before going to the movies.  We have passed it several times and kept saying that we were going to try it.   Well we tried it and loved it!   We loved it so much that we went back the next day.   The food is good and service is good.  A great combination.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good value for all the food you get. I got the gyro with fries. It was a bit on the greasy side for me but the flavor was still delicious. I really liked how they grilled the pita bread."}
{"text":"I could not find a Enjoyable Authentic Gyro in NC until I found The Mad Greek cafe.Thank you Mad Greek cafe for knowing the importance of cooking lamb meat on a spinner grill!! If the meat is cooked on the flat grill I do not want the gyro. The Mad Greek Cafe lamb meat is cooked the traditional way, it's flavorful, tender, and juicy with a slight crisp on the edges. Tzatziki sauce was tasty, the tomatoes was fresh, the lettuce was crisp, red onions were cut perfectly thin, the darn pita bread was soft and perfectly wrapped around all the scrumptiousness. 

My perfect \"cheat day\" meal!!! I've been telling so many people about this Cafe!! Awesome Job Mad Greek!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and authentic Greek food! The portions are huge, and the prices are inexpensive! Left with a full Togo box, since we couldn't finish our lunch. We got the hummus appetizer, Kebob dinner platter (two large pieces of meat, about 8-10oz, fried, pita and a Greek salad), and a Greek salad with chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful! The dressing had a mustardy twang which was new but delicious! I'll definitely be back. Totally worth the drive from Noda."}
{"text":"Drove by the Mad Greek one Sunday about lunch time while running errands and figured, 'why not?' Pulled up some Yelp reviews while we ran a few last errands and read about their fantastic gyros..we were in. The place doesn't look like much from the outside...or really the inside, but it's the food you're here for. We ordered two gyro sandwich platters and were thrilled with the results. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, the tzitziki sauce was super garlicky and thick, and the lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and crunch. The pita was also delicious and soft, but held up against the sandwich fillings and that makes a big difference. We left with very happy bellies and will return."}
{"text":"I ordered the small greek salad. When it arrived, you would have thought it was a large. The ingredients wwre fresh, as well. The restaurant is very clean, and the staff is great. If I had to recommend a Greek restaurant, this would definitely be it."}
{"text":"Summing this up in a few words: a slightly better Waffle House. I haven't tried the Greek stuff yet, so that might elevate the rating - I've gone with the burger and hashbrowns both times I've been. The staff service can best be described as interesting."}
{"text":"With Charlotte lacking late night eats, I was excited to grab a gyro here after seeing all the decent to great reviews.  Anticipating that they're open until 3:00 am, as stated here, I was totally bummed when I drove by at 10:45 pm and saw that they were closed.  If I ever get to try them when open, I'll update my review."}
{"text":"The fly swatting by the guy behind the counter threw me off a little but good http."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro and chicken souvlaki pitas!! Also the staff is very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Greek food in Charlotte and the surrounding area, and none of it has been good, until this place. Just the other day we gave Greek Isles one last try, and our meal was still only partially decent (we won't go back again). But then my fiance brought home some spanakopita, gyros, and a salad from The Mad Greek, and it was all terrific! Best spanakopita I've ever had- I can't stand dirty-tasting cooked spinach, and there isn't a bit of that taste in theirs! Not a ton of feta in it, but just enough nice sized chunks, along with a good garlic flavor. Even tasty the next day! The greek salad was perfect- feta was very tasty (huge feta fan, have had many, this one was great!), the dressing wasn't sweet (thankfully!), but it wasn't too tangy either. The boy said it was the best gyro he'd ever had. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I've ever had! This place looks mad shady from the outside. But after many friends referring me to this place I finally gave in. So know I'm convinced its scetch but will still come for the gyros! Lol! It was a little pricey but all was homemade, yummy!"}
{"text":"Great real Greek food! 
I have been to Greece 4 times and food offered by The Mad Greek reminds me of what I have tasted there. 
I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have gone here for years and always get the same thing.  The gyro platter.  It is too much to eat.  The gyro meat is delicious as well as the greek salad and tzatski.  I have been wanting to try the deserts for years, but always over endulge on the main meal."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but $14 for a carry-out Greek salad seemed kinda pricey..."}
{"text":"What a good find! Really authentic Greek food. I had never been there before and the cook came out and gave me suggestions, showed me how things were cooked and even gave me a delicious dessert for free because I had never tried it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch today. We both got a gyro and it was amazing! I'm so used to eating at Showmars that I was blown away by how good the gyros at Mad Greek are. Top NOTCH!  It also looks like they make their own deserts as well and if they taste as good as they look I'm sure I would be HUGE fan. 

Service was good, no complaints, but the food really makes this place. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food and the Mad Greek did not disappoint. Loved the casual atmosphere, the salad was phenomenal, spanakopita was amazing and the Kebab dinner was exceptional!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek salad I've ever eaten in my life. All the components come together in perfect harmony. The pita bread was fresh and delicious and I couldn't get enough of the Tzatziki. However, for my entree I ordered the $16 Lamb Chops, and ended up getting four 1cm thick slices of gristle. Definitely NOT lamb chops in the first place, and what they gave me was 100% gristle, not a single fleck of actual meat. Completely unacceptable to serve a customer, in my opinion. They were pretty nice about allowing me to switch it out for something else, though. I got the spanakopita and it was delicious. The other people I was with got different types of gyros and everyone was pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"Our party had gyros, which were delicious - and filling. They definitely do not skimp on the ingredients. Tasty pitas, large portion sizes, affordable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Friendly and welcoming staff! The hummus, gyro, and chicken skewers were great. The grape leaves were the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Y'all...they refrigerate their ketchup. Tell me, how many of you fools refrigerate yo ketchup at home, but then go to some dining establishment that don't refrigerate their ketchup? That's just not right.
The folks here at Mad Greek know what's up. Crispy fries and cold ketchup and good food."}
{"text":"The plethora of choices from this menu along w/ the accommodating late night hours are the two biggest reasons why I give this place four stars. Otherwise, I'd give it 3. The food is good, but doesn't cause me to dance or hum while eating it.

The owner is really friendly and is well acquainted w/ his customers, as this place has been opened under different names for over 15 years. Its appearance is extremely modest, but it's far better than any late night chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Greek in Charlotte, hands down.  Not even close.

The food was excellent, and so was the service.  Where I grew up, gyros was a way of life.  We had them all the time.  You couldn't drive five blocks without passing a gyros place.  But in the Charlotte area, I hadn't been able to find a decent purveyor, until now.  These were top notch.  Well seasoned meat.  Great pita.  Tzatziki sauce was outstanding.  The Greek salad was generous and fresh.  The dolmades were excellent.  Fresh cut fries, too!

We loved everything about this place.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow !
I'm a bit backwards and my wife talked me in to eating here. 
It is amazing. The food is fantastic and the service is good. Very nice atmosphere with a friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I like Greek food, but I have to say, this is some of the best I have had outside of Greece.  I can't wait to come back.  Had the Gyros and it was simply amazing.  I wanted desert,but the entree was so good I didn't leave any room.  Oh, yeah, they serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to check out The Mad Greek after passing every single day, multiple times a day. Such a Greek experience. I literally felt that I was dropped into the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Sat next to a couple who proceeded to explain to us why we are still Greek, even though we are Irish and Italian and then (after verifying multiple times that we were married) kept telling us how we need to have babies! Awesome experience. Most of the people in here were Greek.

Sat outside...it was nice and shaded and got to play a game of checkers. We ordered the pita and hummus and the lamb kabobs on special. The hummus was simple, yet, perfect. The lamb was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. It came with a large greek salad and some fries. Everything we had was just so delicious and authentic. The couple beside us convinced us to get this cake, which I couldn't pronounce. It was absolutely amazing. 

Awesome place that we will definitely return to when the Greek food craving hits again!"}
{"text":"Am from NY, but every time I am in the area, my girlfriend and I make it a point to stop at the Mad Greek and visit Chris and his friendly crew, especially for a good home cookin' breakfast.

Granted the place is a little rough around the edges, but I always enjoy the marinated chicken and/or ribeye with eggs.  They have solid home fries as well.

This may sound basic, but the piece de resistance of the Mad Greek is the fresh squeezed orange juice that they crank out, it's fantastic!  Best OJ this side of South Florida, stuff is like orange flavored crack in a glass!

And, if you like Greek football (aka soccer), it's on 24/7 - was there during the World Cup last year and had a blast watching it with the staff while enjoying my meal, good people."}
{"text":"I had the Greek salad which was fresh and loaded with feta . I selected the Moussaka ... lack flavor. Béchamel was awful. The restaurant was dirty and the service was slow."}
{"text":"I come here often and I always get the small Greek chicken salad. It is consistent with fresh veggies and flavorful chicken. The small is a great portion and I always take half of it home, after of course eating a ton of hummus and pita to start. The service is solid and I love sitting outside on the deck which is covered in grape vines!"}
{"text":"I was a little concerned when we pulled up to the restaurant as it looked dated. It was a full house when we arrived. Our server was nice and appeared to be working hard. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the food. My wife had the souvlaki and I had the gyro dinner. Portions were filling and tasted great. 

I would definitely return if we came back."}
{"text":"Hefty serving for the price. Got the lamb with pita with huge side salad. Fries were good too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are as Greek as it gets from the flavorful food to the group of men hanging out under the grapevine playing dominoes. If you want truly authentic Greek food then come here. It is not a fancy restaurant and you could possibly drive right by it on South Blvd if you aren't looking but if you do pass it do a U and come back. The fries are fantastic and the rest food is wonderful. Order the Gyro plate and you will be stuffed to the gills. They don't skimp on food! The tzatziki is to die for (and almost as good as my mother in law's) and you won't get frozen gyro slices from a box."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food, but is a run down dirty old diner.   Last time we were there, probably 6 months ago, there was literally an old french fry or something resembling it hiding near the wall under our booth.  The ceilings are funky and maybe next time I'll just get my meal to go.  If you don't care about ambiance, give it a shot though, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Best OG gyro in Charlotte. The perfect flavor is enough for 5 stars but the fact that this thing is huge makes it an even better choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. Their food is absolutely delicious and very authentic. The employees are also very kind. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place via yelp when looking for a new Greek restaurant to love after the untimely closing of Greek Isles.

I went today (finally) with a co-worker.

The food was amazing, the service was quick and great, the prices are good, and my breath still stinks of delicious gyro lamb!

I'll go again, and you should definitely give this gem a try... South Blvd traffic notwithstanding!

:D"}
{"text":"Margaret- wow! Best waitstaff ever. I had surgery and was in bed for a week when I met my family for lunch- my first outing. Not only was the food delicious and enough to bring home for dinner too but Margaret's kindness and warmth made me feel better.

Loved it so much I came back with friends from Columbia the next day. It's refreshing to feel like you are home when you visit for the first time!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I loved it! Great food and huge portions. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Greek food and I love well-run family restaurants and will choose them over a chain restaurant if given a choice.  Enter The Mad Greek....  We chose them for dinner last night based on location and Yelp reviews.  The restaurant has an old-school diner appeal.  Some of the seat cushions are in need of some TLC, but given the 96.5 sanitation rating, the owners clearly keep the place clean.  We were seated quickly and our drink orders were immediately taken.  We both ordered Gyro platters, which included a side salad, Gyro meat, and French fries.  The food arrived quickly and our orders were perfect.  The side salads were generous and there were literally chunks of yummy feta cheese to enjoy. I forgot to ask to have my dressing on the side, so I was happy to find that the house dressing didn't overpower the salad.  One of the things I judge a Greek restaurant by is the quality of the Tzatziki sauce.  The Mad Greeks is one of the best I have had!  It's thick and creamy.  The cucumber, garlic, and dill are perfectly balanced.  And they give you a nice, generous portion of it to enjoy!   The Gyro meat was well-seasoned and just delightful. The prices here are very reasonable and I will be going back in the very near future!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I visited this place a few minutes ago and it was a waste of time and money. The veggie omelette was the worst I've ever had. The peppers were uncooked and the omelette was overcooked. The waitress/hostess rushed us to order, only recommended the salad as being a great option if I want to eat healthy,(mind you I'm plus size) once I placed my order, I was scoffed at and ignored. The only way we were acknowledged was when we requested service and it was time to pay for our meal. Overall the service was unacceptable and has forced us to never dine here again. When you can see the blatant racism in their establishment its best to dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Greece on our honeymoon and are always searching for Greek food (specifically the gyros) that compares to what we had there. The Mad Greek completely surpassed our expectations. The Grecian shaved chicken gyro was the best gyro we have found (my husband says better than Greece!). We also tried the duo dip sampler and Greek salad which were fantastic! This will be our staple Greek restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Well. I don't think the people in there are Greek for one. Second do not expect a restaurant that is for sure. It's more like a hole in the wall. Lady told me the gyro meet was cut off the leg like in NY. It's most definitely not. Any vendor in NY that serves gyros would put this joint out of business. The only reason we stopped was because we tried to find something else and every time it said a place was open it was closed. Finally got sick of it and just pulled in"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out and I haven't even tried the food but the service was horrible. I walked in and another couple walked in a few minutes after me. An older woman with blonde hair took care of them before me. She had an attitude and when I asked for a Gyro she looked at me like I was talking another language. I was born in the Us and speak English very well. I honestly think she was racist because she was only being nice and friendly to white people that walked in. I'm of Latin decent and another colored woman walked in and she also gave her an attitude. This is very sad to see in such a modern world. Never coming back here again. And I didn't even try their food I threw it out."}
{"text":"Salad was great, extremely fresh cucumber and tomato!  Chicken spiced just right and really moist.   Tzatziki sauce was some of the best I've ever eaten.  Small dining area .  Felt sorry for the ONE waitress, she was having to run the take out orders in front plus waiting on dining room !   But she gave polite efficient service no frills.  Will defiantly be back to eat  at the Mad Greek on my next trip to Southpark mall"}
{"text":"The Mad Greek is a good place to get a Gyro, though not the best I've ever had. The pita was a little hard, but the meat was good and the cucumber sauce tasty! Definitely not much to look at and 50/50 if you stick to the booth when you sit down. Extensive menu and they're open to 4am on a Fri/Sat. They also serve breakfast all-day and the staff is friendly, especially the guy in the window cooking up a storm.."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant that has been around for awhile. I went for lunch with my friend (after leaving another restaurant down the road earlier that never sent a server to our table),  and the service was fine here. Someone greeted us and was pleasant, took our order and came back to check on us. So, I had no problem with service, but the food was just not good, except for the pita bread which was hot and delicious. 

The fries were cold when they were brought out, my dish was okay and the baklava was soggy. The tzatziki was good, but there wasn't much of it and they wanted to charge extra for another small condiment container of it. The lettuce in the greek salad was a little limp. The tea was bitter as if it had been sitting out too long. With drinks, a piece of baklava and two lunches, we ended up paying $32 for lunch (without the tip). We both got lunch specials.  I don't really consider that \"cheap\" and it looked as if they had raised their prices a bit since the higher prices were stuck down over the old prices on the menu. 

This was nothing special. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte and ate at The Mad Greek for the first time for dinner and everything was exceptional! I really love Greek food and always try to find a solid spot where I live and this will definitely be a place I plan to be a regular. The Grecian chicken gyro was one of the best I've found anywhere! The staff was extremely welcoming and attentive through the whole meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"An old school looking diner with a Greek flair. This place serves breakfast and Greek food. I enjoyed a nice dinner of pork, chicken souvlaki, and shaved gyro meat with a salad, hummus, and pita bread. The portion was way too much for me to finish and I'm not a small eater! Excellent value and probably shareable between 2-3 people depending on hunger. 
Service was quick and efficient. Will return."}
{"text":"While the food was good, our waitress went on a tirade about politics loudly, in front of the whole restaurant. That's not acceptable or good for business. It made our dining experience very uncomfortable. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! The gyro dinner was amazing and really filling. The only thing that was less than perfect was the service. They could use a few more employees so the one server didn't seem so frazzled. This was not an issue at all because we enjoyed the food so much but I would think twice about coming here more often. Take out for sure next time!"}
{"text":"So I had two different co-workers tell me that I HAD to try this place so I was looking forward to finally making it in over the weekend. 

The place is located on South Blvd, and it would be easy to just drive right by it! In fact, I have multiple times! But it's totally worth a visit. 

I was greeted when I walked in and since I was visiting solo I requested my order to go. I'd checked out the menu online but based on what they had told me I knew I had to try the one of the Gyro dinners. I decided to go with the Gryo Plate which comes with the gyro meat, pita bread, greek salad and french fries!

Yep, all of that comes with your meal.

I opted for more salad and no fries and was more than impressed with the size of my food. My goodness! The salad was so fresh and full of toppings and the feta was AMAZING. The gyro meat was so perfectly seasoned, juicy and so tender...to say I enjoyed it would be an understatement. It was fantastic. 

I think I've found a new favorite Greek spot that's actually on my side of town. Can you say #winning? If you're looking for good, authentic Greek food that's quick and super reasonably priced...this is your place! 

 I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing and just what I was looking for! Great prices, fast service, and friendly people who work there."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great portions! Lamb was delicious! The tour of Greece was perfect for two and gives you many options! Sooooo goood!!"}
{"text":"Try to overlook the sort of rundown state of the building - the food is consistently great here! I have tried a couple of dishes but always return to the Greek salad with grilled chicken - my fave salad in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"So glad we decided to check out The Mad Greek. Awesome authentic Greek food run by the nicest family. It felt like our server Payton was a buddy we were visiting. Very casual and inviting place. I love that they have a separate sheet with a description of the Greek named dishes for newbies. We started with spanakopita and kebab skewers. I also got the soup of the day which was chicken noodle. Yum yum and yummy! Our entrees were traditional gyros and moussaka. Everything was fantastic. The pita bread is down right addicting. You must try the homemade galaktoboureko(custard pie) and baklava for dessert. Best baklava I've ever had. It it soft and like a pie. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What used to be Hugo's diner and then changed hands a few times is now back to the original owner and he's serving up pretty awesome food at great prices.  Burgers, sandwiches, Greek standards and breakfast all day.  

The gyro is one of the best I've tried in town because they actually cook it on a spit and shave it off when it gets crispy the way you're supposed to (instead of pan frying up frozen strips).  My gyro and fries came out piping hot.  Will definitely be back to try their Greek chicken and other dishes.

An added bonus, they're open till 3am during the week and 4am on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pita lunch, it was so good. The sauce was on point. My husband ordered the Greek salad  and he was really happy. The large chunks of feta was everything!! They made his day. So good. We ordered the side of pita bread, ughhhh. Amazing. The food came with fries, they weren't great. Honestly the fries aren't needed they brought down the meal. I will absolutely order here again and again."}
{"text":"This place is kind of an ugly dump inside and pretty weird environment so I wouldn't eat inside. However, it is great for carryout, which I sometimes get at work. The gyros are pretty good and good for the price. It is definitely adequate enough to satisfy my gyro cravings whenever I am having one. I am excited to see the renovations finished. If you want a gyro check it out. You won't be disappointed. The only place better around is Greek Isles."}
{"text":"Hands down the best gyro I have ever had.  The staff is also really nice.  

Lots of bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my boyfriend in the late afternoon during a weekday and we both really enjoyed this diner experience. 

Our waitress was very efficient and simultaneously made sure that everything we asked for worked out! I asked for lemon in my water and swapped out fries for grape leaves. The pita was served warm both when it was a starter with tzatziki and as a side to my boyfriend's meal. His side Greek salad was gigantic and had a really nice variety and quantity of vegetables, cheese and dressing. His french fries were also served hot! I had the gyro and he had the gyro platter (just the gyro meat on a plate) and the portions for that were very generous as well. My gyro wrap had meat in it down to the last bite which doesn't always happen. 

The ambiance is very much that of a Greek diner. There were basic tables, booths and a counter to sit at. The whole place felt clean and fairly bright and there were large pictures/murals of Greek vistas on the wall. There was even chatter in the background in what may have been Greek. We paid at the counter and left feeling very satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"I checked out the Mad Greek today.  We were on that side of town and it popped in my head, thanks Yelp!  I dont' know if I would drive and make a special trip, but if I was in the neighborhood I would eat there again.  

In the light of day, it didn't seem so clean to me.  If you are the kind of person that looks at sanitation ratings, it might not be the place for you. I didn't see what their score was and I do not care, I will eat anywhere, but I know what people like when they think of a clean restaurant.

On the upside, our server was pleasant, we ordered chicken sandwiches on pita.  It was served hot and was very filling.  It would be so much better for you to eat at the Mad Greek instead of fast food anyday."}
{"text":"I dropped in on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered two chicken pitas and a greek iced coffee. I'm not sure what it is that they do to the coffee to make it so...think and delicious. I had to hold back from sipping it all up at once. The chicken pita with the tzatziki sauce was SOOOO good. I'll be back for more! And my son loved the pita is well. He doesn't like everything. He loved this!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad! I got the Greek Salad and Gyro, pretty traditional meal. Side of tabouli and hummus with pita bread. All very good. I did notice that the To Go orders had smaller portions than the Eat There portions. The ladies working the counter are wonderful, beautiful people and definitely Greek. I've caught a late lunch a few times and observed a table of Greek men chatting in their musical language which is a bonus to the ambience. One of the better Greek restaurants in the area. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"This is the best greek food I have ever had. The owner/chef goes out of his way to make you feel welcome. His kebob, gyro, greek salad  & custard dessert (cannot recall the greek name) is amazing."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pita. Delicious with great flavors. The fries are homemade but we're a bit too limp for my liking. Welcoming staff and very friendly."}
{"text":"Im Greek straight from Athens and im fed up with the Americanized fast food-like \"greek\" food ive had stateside by Greek americans who cant speak our language well on top of that. I cook myself all of the dishes this place serves and I have a very hard to please taste and I approve of them. From the fresh fish to the gyro meat and everything I tried, it's like i was at Lesvos island at a tavern by the beach. The owner Chris is warm-hearted (like real Greeks :D) and loads all the plates - no measuring no stinginess thats the greek spirit. At first I visited with my mom and her husband, we did not know anything about this place and we ordered a bit of everything, we had a blast. One thing i have to say is Chris needs to expel the old greek dudes often hanging out at the deck cuz theyre rowdy and i think they try to hurt his business(they make fun of him cooking in the kitchen smh). He puts his heart in this restaurant. He cooks everything himself along with another Greek guy (they both speak Greek perfectly) and he grows some of his own veggies in the back. The sweets are handmade and authentic (one time we brought a Greek walnut pie (karydopita) for him for free of course and he offered it to customers)."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot! We were driving home Raleigh through Charlotte and had a craving for Greek Food. Wow! We had Hummus, the Gyro Dinner which included and Greek Salad. Everything was awesome and tastes homemade! Whether you are a local or passing through, make the stop! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little place that is right around the corner from my house, so needless to say I have stopped in a few times for lunch. Overall The Mad Greek matches expectations for serving classic Greek food with very Greek themed decorations. The staff is super friendly and the food is really good too. Portions are large so bring a friend or come hungry. 

I highly recommend the hummus and pita and anything with gyro meat. Also don't sleep on the Greek coffee - served at 1 million degrees but delicious. They also have a nice covered patio that is great when the weather is warm. If you want to take a quick trip in spirit and taste to the Mediterranean, then the Mad Greek is certainly a good bet!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend and both of us were quite content with the quality of the food.  I had the seasoned chicken pita.  Fresh and soft pita, and so well prepared, side salad and an ice tea and am so happy.

My friend had chicken kabobs, hummus and salad with tea and both commented that this was a good find.

I have driven past this place a hundred times and my first time today eating there was such a treat.  Interior is nothing special, it's all about the food!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! Fresh hummus, sea bass, kebab plate, and gyro dinner. 

Specials for $6.95 to $12.95 ( with salad, pita and fries)

Chef Nick makes fresh hummus every morning and it it awesome. Like no aftertaste hummus bad flavor here. 

Seriously get here. Now. 

Oh yeah and we got an entire bucket of cucumbers for free fresh from the garden. Did you hear me?! For free. Oh they served us after the closed. Yep. I this place."}
{"text":"After a month-long traipse across Greece, I've become a Greek food snob. I read this place was touted as authentic, so I decided to give it a try.

For lunch, I got a classic gyro, which is a legitimate staple in Greece. I have to say, it was incredibly good. I could tell each ingredient was fresh - the pita hot and soft, the lettuce crispy, the gyro meat tender and full of flavor. And the tzatziki was the best I've had in Charlotte! The fries were also quite good too. A+.

The waitresses were friendly and attentive as well. The star deduction is only because of the restaurant itself. Our table was noticeably dirty, and the decor and lighting left much to be desired. The air also felt really stale and warm.

But these factors won't keep me from visiting again for another one of their delicious gyros. Maybe I'll just get takeout next time."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken pita in the Charlotte area. I  have driven by many times without even noticing It was there. Today was the first time I've stopped and I will absolutely be back for more. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place and wonderful food.  No frills and welcoming service.  Will be adding it to our place list!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been searching for a great Greek spot in Charlotte for a while now, and we finally found it!  

The pita bread was some of the best that I've had. It was thick, crispy, and fresh and I probobly over did it by eating the amount I did.

I consider myself a hummus conniseor, and am really picky.  Usually this is my make or break when it comes to Greek food, and was impressed by its flavor here.

I will definitely be coming back here, and you are mad if you don't try it!"}
{"text":"I went here for a dinner while my parents were in town.  I had driven past a million times, but never thought to eat here - well, glad my parents suggested it!

The Mad Greek has a small seating area for dine-in, a patio and a take-out counter.  We went inside and just like in the movies, there were a few regulars watching football and arguing.  We took a quick look at the crazy long specials list and sat ourselves.  

The waitress was ... sassy.  Definitely made the dining experience more fun.  I ordered the cheesesteak, because when you tell me that its Charlotte's best, I will try it.  My parents ordered a gyro and a kabob plate.  

We got some fresh pita bread while we were waiting for our meals - it was so warm and delicious, I really wished I ordered hummus.  

The food came, and the cheesesteak was definitely one of the better, more Philly-type cheesesteaks that I've had in Charlotte, but the cheese didn't penetrate through all of the meat, I needed a bit more.

I read a few reviews that commented on the state of the dining area - its nothing fancy, and their decor is eclectic, maybe a bit dated, but the food is good and its good value.

Pro tip: they serve breakfast all day, I need to go back & try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in Charlotte. We always order takeout because we live near by, but their staff is friendly for dining in.  The interior isn't posh by any means but it is representative of the Greek culture and we appreciate them staying true to their roots, especially when it comes to the menu. Their gyro's can fix any bad day, their fries are the perfect texture and their tzatsiki is so good - we pay $2 every time we order for extra sides of it for our fries. Go in with an open mind, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Secret bomb.com food! And very reasonably priced!! Even though I'm very selective on good  food and don't often really notice it, I have to say this place is a great find for reliably good food and service.  When you go, ask for Nicole because she's simply great."}
{"text":"Basic Greek establishment known more for gyros and other traditional Greek fare.  My breakfast was 2 eggs over medium, hash browns, and bacon.  Everything was cooked to order,  service was good, prices reasonable.  The bacon was paper thin, however, and the coffee lackluster--tasted like the cheap stuff.

I'll return another day to tackle the tzatziki, gyros, pitas and salads.  For now just OK."}
{"text":"I found the Mad Greek by chance one day a couple of years ago when I was waiting around on my car to be repaired across the street. Greek food is my absolute favorite, so I had to try this authentic-looking blue and white diner on South Blvd. I ordered the gyro pita and it was AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, delicious, tender gyro meat with fantastic tzaziki sauce and a deliciously warm pita. This place stayed on my mind when I came back to Charlotte last year. Their hummus is delicious - the type of delicious where the little pool of oil forms on top and makes for a perfect gob of goodness on pita bread. Their gyro meat has never let me down. It is always the perfection I expect! Their baklava is very tasty for dessert as well, and I also enjoy the Greek salad. I've never tried their breakfast, but apparently it's served all day. When I want my top choice comfort food/the tiny Greek diner experience that reminds me of home, this place is the perfect destination in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the gyros and the greek salads here. They are the best gyros in Charlotte, delicious crispy succulent meat. My wife really likes the Pastichio."}
{"text":"They are open until 3am! For the late night munchies, this is a great option. 

The fries are great (hot, crisy, yet soft in the middle) and the gyro was flavorful. The desserts looked good and sweet, I'll try one next time. They serve breakfast all day long...good to know.

The inside definitely gives off a small diner feel. It's clean, the staff is attentive and nice, and all around a good late night pick."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. Authentic Greek food with a home like feeling. Great gyros!  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We've been here several times & ordered the plates.

My better half who doesn't generally like tzatziki loves the Mad Greek's.  It is solid, huge portions so come hungry Greek.  

Dominoes table in the back & just old hole in the wall style find w/fantastic food. 

Love love love the warm pita, I could eat that all day long."}
{"text":"The Mad Greek finally finished their renovations, and the place is 1000% IMPROVED! Food is still delicious, and prices extremely reasonable for what you get. I'm giving it 5 STARS because the owner Chris took the time and effort to turn his formerly dumpy restaurant into a MUCH improved, more modern diner.

I STILL think this is THE best Greek food in Charlotte, just nudging out The Greek Isles (which is excellent as well and more fancy)."}
{"text":"It's not what is on the outside that counts!!!!
This place has good food for a good price. Plain and simple! 
My husband always orders the Gyro Dinner. It is a lot of food. We generally have some for leftovers the next day! 
I go between the Pastitsio (it's like lasagna with less red sauce and made with large Penne noodles with a Bechamel sauce on top, I love it) and the Gyro. Chris makes fresh  specials, so just ask what they have, sometimes he will bring it out and show you. On Sundays he generally does fresh vegetables the \"greek\" way (don't ask me) but my husband LOVES them!  
The service is generally good, some servers are better than others. Just know that we have only seen one person waiting tables so if it is busy you may have to wait, fyi! 
In general I love to go the The Mad Greek for a cheap tasty meal! If you order something to go make sure you check the meal to make sure that they include the Tzatziki (if it comes with your meal) because we have been gotten home and been REALLY upset, how do you eat Greek food with out it?
We have not been to any other Greek restaurants in Charlotte so I can't compare I just know I like this place, hope you do to!"}
{"text":"After years of searching and having to settle for mediocre Greek food,  I have finally found an amazing gyro in town. First, they actually have a spit here where they roast the meat and slice it off. Secondly, the pita is toasted on the grill and thirdly, holy moly, they pack the gyro meat into that pita. Top it all off with lettuce, tomato, onion and their (sour creme based, not my preference but still very good) tatziki sauce. FINALLY finally, a gyro worth mentioning. Fries are great as well. They are fresh cut and appear to be  tossed with some lemon and herbs. Also, delicious. 
As for the ascetics of the place...it's a Greek diner. Nothing fancy and it doesn't need to be. Its good food at an affordable price, served by a friendly staff. I have not tried any thing else on the menu yet, but based on how good  the gyro is i bet other options wont disappoint. Hopefully, i will get around to it once my love affair with the gyro tapers off."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall spot!
Definitely stop by for lunch. The food is fast, affordable and super fresh. Their Greek salad with grilled chicken was especially scrumptious! Staff is also very friendly. If you don't have time to dine in, they also do takeout."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in town. Authentic and charming. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. 5 stars. If your visiting Charlotte, definitely a go to! Get a Frappe too, they're wonderful!"}
{"text":"Basic decor, nothing fancy. Food is very tasty and reasonably priced. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I'd heard that, when visiting Charlotte, The Mad Greek was a place you had to visit. I did and...WOW! After years of subpar Greek-like restaurants, I finally had the real thing! My husband had the gyro (which I sampled -- to die for!) and I had the Kabob. The Greek salad that started my meal was authentic and deliciously fresh. The Kabob was, again, real Greek cooking (two lamb slabs with sauteed onion and tomato) the freshest and most tasty pitas I've ever eaten and the fries that accompanied it all were home-made, hot and delicious. The baklava is primo and the custard dessert we sampled made me want to cry out, \"OPA!\" The next time I'm in Charlotte, you can bet I'll be dining at The Mad Greek. Over and over again. Tremendously recommended!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the Mad Greek after about over a year of not going and I'm wondering why I waited so long to go back! This place is great! My go to is the gyro pita. The pita is filled with lots of fresh meat and I love their tzatziki sauce. You definitely will not get another gyro in CLT that's loaded this much- unless it was my lucky day! 

Each pita also comes with a choice of side, and I recommend the rice. It's light and fluffy- super buttery. Tip-Get an order of the hummus and mix some in with your rice! So good! 

Overall, the Mad Greek is very authentic and family owned, which I love. You will always see their family members hanging out around the restaurant - and they play Greek shows/movies in the dining area. 

And for the lack of traditional Greek restaurants in CLT, the Mad Greek is definitely a top contender."}
{"text":"Best Greek food everrrrrrrrrrrr

Chicken pita is da best Eva 

Fries = ok


Nice service"}
{"text":"Small place but authentic people in the place.  Ordered the hummus with pita and a gyro.  The hummus was served with warm pita. It seemed to be sitting for more than a day but was still creamy and well seasoned.  Pita bread was warmed on the griddle and tasted like it.  Olive amd feta were from the local grocery store at best.
Gyro was well proportioned and had fresh onions, tomatoes and lettuce.  Gyro meat was days old and reheated on a griddle.  It is served with hand cut fries but they were oily and just warm.  
I asked for a little extra cucumber sauce and they charged two dollars for 3 ounces.
Not the best experience but not bad.  I think the proprieter would benefit a trip home to remember how Greek food is supposed to be served.  If nothing elae, jump down to Tarpon Springs FL and see how they do it there.
They nickel and dime you for any extras.  This is not Greek style at all.  $25 lunch."}
{"text":"The portion size for the gyro sandwiches and a side of fries was plenty, considering I paid less than $10 for the entire meal. Waitress got everything I needed in a timely manner and the rest of the staff was very warm and welcoming to someone like me who had never been to the Carolinas before.

Will come back the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent portions. Service wonderful. Even bought an order of the Greek dressing which was excellent (a bit of mustard)."}
{"text":"Formally known as Hugo's restaurant I understand why they changed it to The Mad Greek Cafe - it's more catchy and clearly states the food they serve. The interiors are humble but not rich, though definitely clean! The restaurant seems to be family run and friendly. There isn't much of a Greek ambience other than a painting on one of the walls. The menu is surprisingly combines American and Greek cuisines! It's also a hefty menu so take time to go through all the dishes and ask for clarifications. Pita/gyro is always good option when you want to go safe. The dishes were served quick and they tasted alright. To sum it all up, it's not really a restaurant you would to take your date to and neither is it a restaurant to go through the Greek experience. If you want to just grab a quick bite of a Pita or gyro, this is the place. Other than that, don't expect a lot!"}
{"text":"Extremely authentic Greek. Very friendly environment. My husband and I had a great experience. Had the grilled fish and gyro dinner. Red wine and baklava. Everything tasted wonderful. We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek salad. Great hummus and pita. Service can be a bit slow but overall the service was good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure which is better - the quality and quantity of the food or the gracious generosity of the owner's son, Peyton!  String Bean in Belmont and Suffolk Punch used to be my favorite restaurants but the Mad Greek has definitely taken first place in my book after eating there for the first time tonight!  The Greek platter was amazing...and enough food for two dinners and a lunch. Thank you Peyton!!!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, this is the best Greek food I've ate in a long time.  Waitress was Margaret, and she gave me the best recommendation on the menu.   She was wonderful and helpful.  Let's get started with what I ordered, which was a gyro, and a side salad.  Salad was awesome and very fresh.  When the gyro came, meat was so tender and not overcooked.  The sauce that came was also on point.  Love this place and I plan on coming back again.  Keep it up mad greek!"}
{"text":"Finally made it! This place had been in my bookmarks for a long time. It's a total dive! The chicken pita was delish! I was a little disappointed with the Greek salad. The ingredients weren't as fresh as I had hoped. Don't expect anything fancy. The service is good. Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Finally found a true, authentic, homey restaurant in Charlotte! I moved here 3 months ago and had given up on finding any restaurants that weren't your basic, chain restaurants. The Mad Greek has character, amazing food, the nicest people, and a story to go along with it all! I came by myself and one of the co-owners of the restaurant, Peyton, sat down and explained the history of the restaurant to me. I could truly see the passion he had for this restaurant and the Greek food! I can't wait to become a regular and bring all of my friends back to try it!"}
{"text":"This was a great stop!  From the friendly service, the delicious greek beer and warm pita bread to the delicious kabobs...we would come back here again and again! Fun times!"}
{"text":"Grape leaves are juicy and tender. Tzatziki is like cream. Anybody who makes her own phyllo is tops in my book. Great spanikopita. Ice tea was very good. Disappointed they didn't have soup for lunch time. Stop by anytime you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was outstanding! True authentic Greek food at it's finest! The Spanikopita and Stuffed Grape leaves were perfect and the Baklava...out if this world!! We will definately be back and recommend this to all!!"}
{"text":"Mark and I thought we would try this restaurant after his boss recommended it.  Let me tell you, the food is AMAZING! Our waitress was so sweet.  The owner was telling us about the different meats that they offer.  We both ordered the Gyro dinner and it was so tasty!  The Greek salad with the homemade dressing was delicious, the french fries were nice and crispy and the gyro meat was so flavorful.  We ordered extra taziki sauce and it's a good thing because the homemade sauce was the best I've ever had!!  We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I seriously love everything about this place! If you've ever seen MyBig Fat Greek Wedding, you can imagine this place like a Dancing Zorba's.

If you come for breakfast, you can have the best gyro feta cheese omelette in the city. 

My friend and I frequent this place at least 3 times a month. The gyros are the best I've ever had, and I've heard if you frequent here enough, you can see Ron Rivera dining. He obviously knows good Greek food when he has it!

Visit. This. Place. It WON'T disappoint!"}
{"text":"I tried there gyro with fries for the first time. Very good. The cucumber sauce was great."}
{"text":"I was brought here with a group of my co-workers for lunch one Thursday. I had never had a Gyro before but I looked around and it looked like a lunch time favorite (and appetizing!). Even still, I looked over the menu and noticed so many options! I never knew there were so many Greek dishes! Although my options were plenty, I decided to go with the lunch time favorite, the Gyro with fries, no onions. The meat was very well seasoned and the pita and other ingredients were very fresh! I was more than happy with my selection and so were my co-workers. In fact, we have made a standing appointment on all of our calender's (invite only, haha) for what we call \"Mad Greek Thursday's\". It is always a delight and well priced ($)!

Two other things: 
1) Great, welcoming environment with really great service and very nice wait staff. Outdoor and indoor seating options! 
2) They make their ranch dressing in house. For ranch dressing aficionados, I hear this is some of the best ranch around. Its buttermilk based."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food with a solid Greek atmosphere.  You know you're in the right spot when you see actual Greeks coming in to order the gyro's!  The tzatziki sauce was thick and tasty with just the right amount of tang for the lamb.  Some douche of customer took off without paying, but the owner and the waitress maintained their calm and professionalism.  I admire that, cuz I would have been a true \"Mad Greek\" had it been me getting shafted!  Good people, good food.
Noosh!"}
{"text":"We had gyros, pork chops and a cheeseburger. Everyone enjoyed their food. Hand cut fries were a pleasant surprise. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  Enjoyed a huge greek salad loaded with fresh veggies and a generous amount of flavorful, grilled chicken.  Super friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"I could eat gyros almost daily! And we've been here several times and every time we leave full and happy! 

It's a diner so don't expect much aesthetically, but you'll be impressed when your food comes out. The service is friendly and the food is served fresh and hot!! Our favorite is their gyros of course served with delicious hand cut fries. The pita is so delicious and fresh that I doubt you'll leave anything ok your plate. Their prices are fair and if you have room try their Egg Custard dessert! 

This is my go-to Greek spot."}
{"text":"Look no further for awesome Greek cuisine in Charlotte!  The Moussaka was awesome and the Spanakopita was fresh(not from Sysco or US Foods lol).  Will definitely be back.  Great service too."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled chicken pita with a house side salad. The grilled chicken was so flavorful! The tzatziki sauce complimented the pita very well. There was enough food for me to eat on this meal twice."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh! The absolute best Greek food I've ever had. I'm a born and raised Charlottean, but for some reason had never been here before today. This is what I've been missing from my life! The tzakiki was the best I've ever had, great flavor and obviously freshly made. The gyro portion was huge. The meat was fresh and had a great flavor. The pita bread was soft and fluffy. Excellent service as well. I'm coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Have driven past this place and wondered, hmmmm, could this be REAL Greek? Tonight I was delighted to experience some of the delicious, authentic Greek food and EXCELLENT service. Greek salad, lamb chops, potatoes and sweets to finish my food lusts. I know this will be my go to for Greek food when in the Queen City. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered a large Greek salad with grilled chicken to go. When I got home and opened the salad it looked amazing! However, after dressing the salad what I thought was spice was a long hair on a cucumber, which doesn't belong to me...I'm a curly girl! I called to inform the restaurant of this and they just said ok! First and last time!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!!!!!

If you like AUTHENTIC Greek food, then you MUST try this place. I cannot believe that we have not tried this place until now.

Appetizer: Pita and Taziki sauce. The BEST Taziki my wife and I have ever had.

Salad: Greek salad was very good. Oil was very good and plenty to fill you up.

Gyro Pita: OMG, wow, nom-nom!!!! Sliced meat off of the spit, perfect meat, veggies, and the wonderful Taziki sauce. We added feta!!!!

We got baklava to go!!!!

Great place!!!! Met the owner and son, both awesome guys. Our service was great!!!!

Please try if you like Greek food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in town!  Great food great service!  We can't wait to come back and try other Greek specialties !  Opa!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and always been very very good. I get the greek salad with lamb which is outstanding,  I use the tatziki sauce as the dressing which is spot on.  The grape leaves are authentic and great. The only room for improvement I would like to see is the gyro meat be cut a little thicker. The feta is also awesome."}
{"text":"Have passed this place a million times on South Blvd.  Finally popped in with a friend for lunch.  So glad we did.  I loved the quiet atmosphere.  It was a great open space with a TV mounted to the ceiling, but not really any sound coming out.  Lots of panoramic pics of Greece adorn the walls.  Interesting sculptures are around as well, including one outside.  The chicken kabob that I ordered came with a side salad, which was very large, and French fries.  I ordered hummus instead of the fries.  It was all tasty, but I must admit I was disappointed by the hummus.  With The Jasmine Grill setting hummus standard, as well as YAFO, they need to present their hummus in a more appealing way.  It was served in a little tiny cup, sort of like what ketchup is served in.   And I wish it was as silky as the other Mediterranean restaurants. That was my only disappointment.   It is a little hard getting into and out of the restaurant because South Blvd is so busy. All in all,  I give this two thumbs up and hope to return soon.  Great find!"}
{"text":"I come here for the lunch special gyro, usually.  It's tasty and filled with plenty of gyro meat.  The Tzatziki is solid (as in good, not as in bricks) and the grilled pita is both fresh and a bit crunchy.  At $6.95 with a side of fries, it's one of the better deals in town.

I've also had the cheese steak, which was pretty good but not the best in the city.  I want to try the souvlaki, but the gyro is so good that I can't pass it up!

The waitress is the same every time, and she's as nice as can be.  This is a solid Greek-diner-like lunch joint."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! This food is AMAZING! I had the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner. The flavor was ridiculously delicious! My husband had the chicken Gyro...just no other words. Yummmmmmm! Even my kids (as picky as they are) Cheeseburger which my son devoured and my daughter ate the entire Italian sub (I don't know how she fit the whole thing in her stomach) she said the dressing made it \"so delicious\". Amazing customer service, attentive and warm. I loved this place and I'm glad I found them in yelp! We will be back and we will bring friends! Thanks Mad Greek Cafe!!! DELICIOUS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food was great. I would have gave it 4 stars, however the service was very lacking. I would have given that a 0 starts if possible. We placed our order and received our food and never saw our waitress again. We sat their with empty glasses, empty plates, and luckily we weren't in a hurry. It took her 30 minutes after we had finished to realize that we were still there and waiting for a check. 

I would go back for the food, but I would try to make sure we didn't get the same service again."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional this evening and the food was awesome. Appreciate all the other great reviews that led us here to begin with! A definite place to stop for Greek food."}
{"text":"Reminded me of the Greek diners back home. We both had Gyros with fries and shared the hummus appetizer. Our server was friendly and service was quick . Food was good."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place 4 stars because I seen a roach crawling on the wall by the cups that they use for folks who dine in and the restroom is absolutely creepy. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about \"The Mad Greek\". I have been eating here since it was \"Hugo's \" a few years back. I have tried Souvlaki dinners at many Greek establishments, but this is by far the very best. The same cook is there every time that I have eaten there over the course of 11 years. The food is consistent and that speaks volumes! I have let too many people in on this great diner, because I wanted to expose them to some food could be served in Greece lol. If you can get past the pest (which you can if you eat at any fast food restaurant) and potty before you go, you are sure to have a new favorite spot. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"If you like Greek food, this place is too legit!!! The decor is a bit dated and it's not the most pretty place, but the food is dynamite! Try the kebabs!"}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte from Dallas.  Had no idea where to eat.  Found this gem near my hotel.  The spinach pie was amazing.  The plate of gyros with hand cut fries and Tzatziki sauce was spectacular!   All with a traditional Greek salad.  

Finished other homemade Baklava and a cup of coffee.

Heaven..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Amazing food! It's like eating a home cooked meal with none of the work! Would highly recommend! I believe they might be hiring as well and everyone seemed nice so it should be a good place to work as well!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Arizona, this is some of the best Greek food I have had. The portions are huge everything was delicious."}
{"text":"We randomly found Mad Greek today and it was the best part of our day! Staff was super friendly and were very accommodating to our dog. The food was amazing! Best chicken gyro in Charlotte, their pita bread and tzatziki sauce are out of this world. I am so happy we found this place. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"We ate pastitsio at your restaurant. I understand your concern of the poor review but I can assure you this was the restaurant. I believe it was a special of the day and makes sense that it wasn't on your menu. Thanks for responding to my comment but I hope you don't brush off your other customers."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Greek restaurant in Charlotte.  The food taste just as good as it looks online! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone.  Everyone is very friendly, it's locally owned.  I can't wait to go back! Yummmmmmmmm----me!"}
{"text":"For starters- they make a damn good hummus. 
We tried a couple more appetizers, nice stuff!
We had pork chops, kababs and lamb chops for the main course.
The pork chops were way overcooked. Very disappointing, literally could not cut into the meat(more of a rubbery blob). 
However the lamb chops were phenomenal. Some of the best i have had. The kababs were also damn good, juicy, moist, bursting with flavor.
It was the shame the pork chops spoilt the entire meal.
Had the baklava for desert, a bit too sweet for my liking, but pretty decent.
Would have given it 4 stars if not for the overcooked pork chops."}
{"text":"Dear Mad Greek,

Where have you been during my time in Charlotte?  Why did I pass by you a number of times in my first three years without ever stopping by to bear witness to your gyros?  How did I live so long without experiencing your delicious, greasy gyros, scrumptious Greek salad, and surprisingly decent french fries?

I suppose part of the thing the issue is that your building, while somewhat eye-catching with the white and blue paint, looks pretty small and is located in a slightly run-down area of town.  However, I love the bright colors and simple decor you have going on inside.  Every time I've been, the staff people working have been friendly and helpful too.

Your gyros are definitely where it's at here.  For less than $10, you offer a tasty and good-sized gyro sandwich, with the most amazing tzatziki my mouth has ever tasted, and a generous portion of seasoned french fries.  I love that for a couple of dollars more you can upgrade to a gyro dinner, which has enough meat for two gyros, plus a Greek side salad and fries.  Your Greek salad has plenty of great things, with lots of feta cheese, Greek peppers, delicious Greek dressing, and Kalamata olives (which are not pitted, but still good).

I am sad I never stopped sooner.  But now that I've found you, I won't ever let you go.  I love your cheap prices, delicious food, and convenient location to my work.

Sincerely,
Ana O."}
{"text":"So excited I found this place, and can't wait to go back. Absolutely delicious food. Definitely a hole in the wall kinda place, but sometimes those are the best places, and the server was very friendly. I had the gyro sandwich which was one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Pita was nice and soft, fries were great. Greek salad was also delicious. Great little gem :)"}
{"text":"We had gyro dinner and it was awesome!For $10 you get a lot if meat, pita bread, salad, greek sauce,and homemade fries.We had baklava as well and it tasted great!The place doesnt look really nice but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I used to be the biggest fan of this place back in the early 90s when it was called Hugo's diner. But sadly, although interior has been revamped the menu has taken a slight dive and the service isn't all that great. The waiters spend more time yapping at the counter than being attentive to the needs of the patrons. I had an ultimate omelet. It was just OK. The hashbrowns were tasteless. Not impressed. I guess all good things must come to an end?"}
{"text":"This.place.is.banging!

Pita, tzatziki, Greek salad, gyro - all amazing! Best feta cheese."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is not very fancy in terms of interiors and Furnitures. The service is great and prompt. The pita bread here stands out, very tasty and is served hot. We had ordered baba ganoush and this combined with the pita bread was really good. After this the salads came over which were nice. The entree we ordered had a good portion of chicken. Chicken is very subtle in terms of spices and salt, for my taste, but cooked to perfection. The rice served along was plain white rice. Also ordered a bottle of Greek beer, it's reasonably prized and I liked it. All in all a good experience and I would recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great folks. Great food. This is a must stop for Greek food. I tried the gyro   We also had humus - very good. Ice tea was good also."}
{"text":"Decent Greek food! Gyro meat wasn't the best I've ever had but pretty close, fresh and hot and I really liked their fries. I also tried their baklava it was homemade and delicious! Place is super small, probably better for take out but worth a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences in a local family owned spot ever!!! I felt like family.  Everyone is awesome... 

THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC!  I will be back, over and over and over"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to The Mad Greek in a few years, but it wasn't nearly as good as I remembered.  I ordered a Greek Salad with Gryo meat.  The meat was very thin and dried out and the Greek dressing tasting like it had mustard in it.  Maybe that's what some prefer, but I didn't like it at all.  The bathroom was something short of clean and the floors were in need of sweeping.  The back corner of the restaurant looked like someone's office because there were papers, files, and a computer in plain site....not in a \"I'm need to have lunch and do some work\" type of way...it was clearly the restaurant's office.  Very strange.  With so many delicious Greek restaurants in the area, I doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've ever had! The gyro platter is amazing, with the best fresh French fries and salads. The gyro meat is unlike any other-- juicy and delicious. Not your usual dry meat.

This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends visited this restaurant on a random day out. Never have been before but instantly fell in love with the food, and excellent down to earth service. Hard to find in most restaurants these days as I am a server and am never impressed with service given to me. But from start to finish they get a A+++. Very friendly staff and good recommendations. We WILL be returning with more friends and family next time! You must stop by it's great. :)"}
{"text":"Great Greek salad! Friendly staff seated and served promptly. Very accommodating to children. Menu explained well. I ordered the spanakopita dinner needed a bit of salt but still very good. It came with a salad and bread which were good. They have an array of deserts to order when you come in. My meal was filling so I didn't indulge but will come back to try."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was atrocious. 
When we arrived on a Sunday evening a little after six there was only one other person in the restaurant. We asked for a table outside as we had our dog with us. Our server came out with waters and asked if we were ready to order. We told her we would start with the hummus and pita. She came back and asked if we were ready to order and we asked if she had put the hummus in. No she had not. When the hummus arrived we ordered our entrees. I was out of water by this point. 20 minutes later, still no water. She dropped our entrees and said she would be right back with water. Never came back during the entire meal. My boyfriend did not receive the salad or pita that was supposed to come with his meal so he just had two sticks of meat with fries. Our meals were actually very good, but he would have liked the salad that came with his meal.
After we were done eating we sat there a minute and still our server had not come back out since dropping our entrees. I went to the counter and she was standing there with the other server and asked how everything was. I said that my boyfriend had not received half of the items his meal came with and we were never checked on or given water refills. No apology. She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. She took $5 off the bill for it but still no apology about poor service or that we never received what we ordered. And there was still one person in the restaurant! The only other people that came in while we were there placed carry out orders, and now I see why. I enjoyed the food, and can understand bad service if you are busy, but this experience is enough to make me never come back."}
{"text":"Ever been to a place where you're treated like family? This is the place! I've been escaping to the Greek Isles by the cuisine of The Mad Greek. Chris, the owner, is consistent, courteous and an astound chef. 7 years of visits and the food has never waived from perfection. The prices has remained affordable for such succulent dishes.
If I want Mediterranean food, I only travel to The Mad Greek.

Thank you Chris for sharing your love for food with us!"}
{"text":"We've come here for both breakfast and dinner and we're never disappointed!  Pancakes, bacon, omelette and eggs taste like they were made with love came from mom's kitchen!

The Grecian style pitas are filling. Go for the Grecian style by the way, it's shaved and marinated chicken!

But if you don't get anything else and you love coffee, YOU HAVE TO GET THE FRAPPE, sweetened with milk."}
{"text":"YES!!!! FINALLY GOOD GREEK FOOD!! Before moving to Charlotte 10 years ago, I had these neighbors that owned this AMAZING Greek restaurant in Annapolis, MD. I was hooked and so moving to Charlotte, I felt certain there would be great Greek places. Granted, there are a few and Mad Greek ranks up there with the best of them.  The restaurant isn't pretentious but clean and the wait staff was very friendly. Everything I had from the Mosou-vizzika (that's what it sounded like when I attempted to pronounce the Spinach Pie app), to the Gyro was excellent. Plus ALL DAY BREAKFAST (Whaaaaa!!!!! )! I could definitely become a regular"}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME!!! Quick service. My favorite is the Greek salad with the fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Like others, I was on this side of town a quiet Sunday morning...you know, when almost nothing else is open in Charlotte unless you want to positively battle the church crowd?! I was also jonesin' for a gyro and The Mad Greek (previously Hugo's Diner) seemed to be a convenient choice. 

Inside, this place is definitely not much to look at. I doubt the booths or floors have been changed up since the late '80s and there was a sticky quality to the place. However, it's a diner. It's open until 4 am on the weekends, I half expected that. 

Service was very friendly from the (owner - I believe) slingin' Greek greens in the kitchen to our server. As with the decor, the menu is straightforward. It's also worth noting that they do serve breakfast all day - pancakes, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, etc. 

Since it was almost noon, I went with the classic gyro sandwich. A well made, soft but toasty pita filled with gyro meat, tzatizki, onions and tomato. I decided to forgo the fries and snag a greek salad for $1 more. The gyro was tasty, warm and just what I was looking for. The salad was fine but the Greek dressing wasn't my fave...even though I'm certain they make it in house. 

So, with good service, good food why not 4 stars? Well, others may disagree with me, but I found it a bit overpriced for what I received. The gyro, while tasty, wasn't giant like the others I've had. For example, Steak & Hoagie shop serves up a gyro for a bit over $4...here it's moderately sized and $7.95 (including fries). Hubs and I had two gyros, one with a side salad and one with a dinner salad and it cost us $27 with tip. That seems a bit steep for just a couple of gyros and salads. Regardless, if I was in the area and seeking a gyro, The Mad Greek would be a decent stop."}
{"text":"I went here back in May. The service was great. It was a wonderful mom and pop restaurant. I decided to have a sample of everything, and I mean everything, lol. Everything was super delicious. However, the best was the warm and homemade baklava. I've had many and this was the best by far. When I visit Charlotte again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't judge the place by the building... inside is awesome food! 

I had the gyro plate and it reminded me of the old Chicago Greek food places that were of my youth... the best I have had since I left Chicago.

When you drive up you will be tempted to turn and go after looking at the building but don't you dare leave! If you do you'll miss out on some of the best Greek food you have ever eaten!

From the salad (which can be a meal all on its own with feta, olives, veggies, and the best tangy dressing), to the gyro (which is really a 2 person meal), to the desert (sweet sweet heaven!)... just flat out awesome!! The baclava will have you craving more and more! According to the waitress fresh made right there. It certainly tastes that way!

If the food is authentic the staff is even more so... there are the group of old Greek men sitting outside  playing backgammon and yelling in Greek (seriously that is no joke). Then the staff inside are Greek to the core! 

I highly recommend trying this Blue Greek hole in the wall... be prepared to eat... you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Ballin Greek gyros, fresh made pittas, amazinggg tzatziki... and they don't skimp, on anything. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Very good Greek food! Would be 5 stars but no Pita with Gyro meat. The Baklava was the best I have had in the Southeast United States. The Tzatziki was perfect. The Spinach Pie was the only let down. Very dry and will not order that again. Overall though this will be our go to Greek Restaurant in Charlotte. The Gyro meat was incredible. The service was so nice and friendly I felt at home. The grape leaves were delicious. The portions were nice size also."}
{"text":"Mad Greek .. very good authentic Greek food. Very easy going environment. Sometimes the food is on or off, my only complaint but usually on."}
{"text":"I've been impatiently waiting to come here for some authentic Greek food and I finally got the opportunity to do it today, which just so happens to be Greek Easter!

I loved that as soon as you walk in you see a cooler full of Greek desserts, from baklava, to kataifi. The dining area is rather small and quaint. I will say it could use a little more of a \"Greek flair\". I honestly think the only thing that was missing to make the ambiance perfect was an old Greek man sitting in the corner drinking Turkish coffee with his Greek buddy, and traditional Greek music playing (the music part they can control, the old man, not so much lol) 

They seemed to be short staffed, so that did affect the wait time for the food, but that didn't really bother me too much. One thing they can definitely use is a more consistent and efficient bus boy. I couldn't help but notice that they had trouble keeping the tables clear of empty plates once people were done with their food. 

I ordered a frappe because I'm Greek, and I had no shame drinking it with my meal lol. It was made right with just the right amount of froth. Also, I love that they have a good selection of Greek beers and wines to choose from. 

Once the food came out, it was great! The spanakopita was crunchy and fresh. I've never had spanakopita that tasted almost like a sandwich, rather than a pie. It really does work lol! 

The actual entrees were just as good too. The Greek salads that came with them were hearty, and the pita bread served with it was fresh. Also, we order tzaziki and it was probably the freshest I've ever had. 

I had the rack of lamb. Traditionally, it's supposed to be served with roasted potatoes or orzo, but unfortunately they only had French fries available at the time we went (around 12:30 pm). This did disappoint me a little. In all fairness , our server said they were going to have roasted potatoes later that day, and that they were still cooking them. I do appreciate the effort they take to make everything fresh. Nonetheless,  the lamb was tender and the French fries were good too. My wife really enjoyed her Greek burger as well.

Our server, which I assume is the owner or manager of the restaurant, was really nice. He even gave us eggs to play the traditional egg cracking game on Easter Sunday (Or Pascha) 

I will definitely be back because traditional Greek restaurants are at a premium in Charlotte. Mad Greek has it figured out!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST tzatziki I have ever had. Gryro's are awesome as well!! Affordable, friendly place to get a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Tried to go October 10, 2012. Appears closed. Maybe renovating but not open."}
{"text":"This review is not based on the food. My husband and I always enjoy what we have at the Mad Greek, however I think we will restrict our dining there to take out only. Our recent visit was odd to say the least. 
It's almost like the owner set up his living room away from home at the back table. The game is on and he's yelling at someone in his cell phone. 
Then someone that I assume is related to him comes into the restaurant asking for money. This went over like you would guess.
We were uncomfortable. It's gotten weird. And sad. We want the Mad Greek to do well."}
{"text":"I have to say if you are looking for a killer tzatziki  sauce , Mad Greek Café is your go to place, and unless you like your food swimming in it I don't really feel there is a need to order extra, the serving size was quite large.  

It's not often I am craving Greek dishes, but today I just wanted something different, and different I received. My coworker and I ordered the GYRO dinner plate of shaved beef and lamb accompanied by a Greek sidpe salad, warm pita bread , and shoe string French fries. That's a lot of food people, definitely the Greek way right? :) I opted to not get the fries, and asked for more salad (I know , who opts out of fries?) It is January, and the holiday treats are still clinging to my stomach lining (TMI?) , the fresh Greek salad was a great side to go with the savory beef and lamb, there was just so much of it I can't imagine eating fries with it. The meat was nicely seasoned, but I do admit after your hunger is satisfied it does start to taste salty and a little overly oiled (NOTE: save it for later and put it on your left over salad, great snack)  

I called in my order and it was prepared quickly, the customer service was nice, I mostly likely will come back ."}

{"text":"What a find!  What this restaurant lacks in size it makes up in authenticity and hospitality. Great traditional Greek food, big portions, and well prepared. You know it's good when half of the restaurant is speaking Greek."}
{"text":"I love this place and the people and the authentic Greek food. They've made me believe change is possible. Great food, great service, and great people.  Mom and pop business serving it up old school and delicious!! Find this gem and eat!! OPA!!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food, friendly waiters and a very good value. Have made several visits here and we have been satisfied each time. There is an outdoor seating area but we've never wanted to sit near busy South Blvd. The inside of the restaurant is showing a little wear and tear but the atmosphere is laid back and relaxing. We usually get a Greek salad with our meal and it's always fresh and tasty. Recommend the gyro platters and souvlaki."}
{"text":"Greek Food Done Right!   This is not your Americanized Yee-Ro stand   

The fries are made correctly in olive oil. 

The Tzatziki has garlic in it. 

The souvlaki is served with shaved pork and French fries on the pita (just like in Greece)

This place is the real deal. 


Prices are perfect.  Great place for family dining."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Greek restaurant I've been to since relocating to NC! This is my second time having their food and both times were amazing! The first time I had a carry out and was amazed at the amount of food I got was impressive; but not as impressive as the quality of the food...my inner fat girl was very pleased! Today, we dined in and I ordered the kabob lunch special...my inner fat girl was yet again pleased. In addition to the quality of the food, the service was exceptional as well. Being within walking distance from my job, it makes for a nice, to key and delicious lunch break. Did I mention the fries? Fresh cut potatoes....AMAZEballs! The prices are competitive as well. You get more than your money's worth here. My inner fat girl is pretty picky...but when she's happy, I'm happy."}
{"text":"This place is great! I walked in and was greeted and sat. The server was takin another table's order but the chef saw me and greeted me. I was alone for lunch and he asked what I was in the mood for. I said some kind of gyro and Greek salad. He said he could either do the gyro dinner platter or the sandwich. I opted for the sandwich in pita. I thought it was really cool he addressed me and made a recommendation instead of waiting to get my order from a server. THEN THE FOOD CAME. Omg. The salad was out in 30 seconds- plenty of toppings, quality cheese, veggies, and olives, amazing dressing and seasoning! Next my sandwich- The gyro is roasted in house on a spit! Fresh never frozen and it is amazzzing. The tzatziki was obviously fresh and incredible. After a few bites the chef came back out of the kitchen to ask how my food was then (in a heavy Greek accent) told me about the meats they grill in house and about the desserts they make in house! Y'all- as I'm typing this- he just brought me out samples of the grilled chicken and grilled beef! His name is Chris and I just became his #1 fan.  He told me he has been in the states for a long time and said \"that's home\" while pointing to a framed picture of a beautiful Greek town. How cool. My server was very nice and attentive. I'll totally be back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  This review is based solely on their amazing gyros.  I'm sure they have excellent other choices on their menu, but I feel like I'll be ordering their gyros every time I go there.  I've had a hard time finding gyros that I really like in Charlotte, but theirs blows away any I've had any where.  The portions on the gyro dinner were huge too,  we both left with plenty of left overs.  Now if they would just install a drive through, and stay open till one in the morning."}
{"text":"We went here one evening for dinner with friends. We were seated in the tables in the middle of the restaurant, but despite our obvious location, service was extremely slow. Food was also slow to come out after we finally got to place our orders. The food itself was good, but nothing really blew us away. Having been to Greece just last summer, we went with high hopes of authentic fare, but it was all pretty hit or miss. The owner was friendly and the baklava was good, but it's not worth the hike over here for anything we had."}
{"text":"Best greek food I've had.  Everything was so fresh and tasty.  Ive had many gyros in my life but these are the best.  Small mom n pop kinda place but who cares. This is authentic!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time. I can honestly say it was the best gyro I have had in a long time. The portions were big more then I could eat well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best Gyro I've had. Best tzatziki sauce I have ever had.  It reminds me of the lamb sandwich I used to get in Germany after partying all night. The pita is delicious as are the grape leaves! The staff is super friendly. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was our third time eating at the Mad Greek and you just can't beat the food; it's excellent!  We love Greek food and for the price,  quality, and quantity, it can't be beat.  The service leaves something to be desired; it's slow and unattentive but the food more than makes up for it.  It's probably a better suggestion to get the food to go then to eat at the restaurant.  I highly recommend the pork kabobs, extremely flavorfu,l very tender, and comes with a salad and fries for under $10.  Even the kids chicken tenders are packed full of flavor.  This restaurant is quickly becoming our favorite place for Greek food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had the lamb chops and they were great. I would definitely stop here again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"One of my closest friends is a regular of Mad Greek, but most of our circle had not had the chance to partake yet. To celebrate her birthday, we got a big group together to try it! And by big group....I mean 18... and this is a locally owned family restaurant. 

I called ahead the day before to reserve the table and was nervous about the group size. They were more than accommodating! When we arrived Saturday they had the table all set and were so welcoming. 

Our experience at Mad Greek was just that, an experience. The staff and owner took exceptional care of us: great explanations, recommendations, attentiveness, and a whole lot of laughing. Everything we had was exceptional, from appetizers to dessert. 

One of the most unique and special restaurant experiences I've had in Charlotte (and probably most other places). Would definitely recommend to small groups and big groups alike! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just came back from my lunch at The Mad Greek, and let's just say I am loving the gyro.  I contemplated about saving half of it for later, but what do you know, I ate the whole darn thing.  Meaty, tasty, with just enough tzatziki sauce and lettace, tomato & onion, decent portion, along with fries that's lightly seasoned (hey... I give them credit for at least trying to make standard frozen fries more appealing... not saying that they succeeded).  The gyro is one of their daily lunch specials for $6.95, other options are: cheeseburger, chicken strips, grill chicken breast sandwich, kebab/chicken/souvlaki pita, all serves with french fries.

Let me clarify that I'm mostly writing about the food because this is definitely a \"dumpy\" looking place, with minimum service, and in my opinion the menu is a little lacking and kinda pricey for a joint like this.  But for a quick lunch, it's solid and I'll be back to try the kebab pita."}
{"text":"Quick and Good Greek Food.

The place was a very nice change from the standard Americana of charlotte.  I have the Gyro Plate. The meat was tasty and the Sauce was good.   I was completely full by the end of my meal.

The place is quaint and has nice colorful feel on the inside.  The lady would we have runs the place with a Greek Fist :) .  She happyily made sure we were okay  and everything was to our liking during the meal.

It is getting put into the rotation of place to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"Go to lunch spot, the village salad is great and fresh, family owned and operated. No pre made plastic bag food, the Mad Greek (the actual guy cooking) is back there making it."}
{"text":"The Mad Green no longer has the best waffle in Charlotte and that's a bummer. So I am updating my review because of what they do have, which is great Greek. Kleftiko, souvlaki, spanakopita, kebabs and of course, gyros.

My wife had a great meal of chicken kebabs, which she called tasty and moist. I had a gyro platter. Both came with a very good Greek salad that was heavy on feta cheese and had a good dressing with a small plate of grilled pita breads. My gyro was pretty good as well. The fries were tasty though I thought a little underdone.

Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"the only reason i am giving 4 stars is because the younger girl working up front today march 26 was absolutely rude. as soon as we walked in she was talking with the older lady (who is amazing by the way) telling her that some food she was going to eat was old and she wasn't eating it .. it kind of made me wanted to leave but we stayed because of the other reviews. the young girl ruined the atmosphere for my family. i would recommend this place to people even if she is there. cursing in front of customers, especially a family with young kids is unacceptable:"}
{"text":"always great.

Gyros are great, grape leaves are great, beer is great.

what else can you say? The staff is also great, my wife and I are regulars, and I usually order the same thing.
So they see me, ask if I really need a me u or will have my gyro all the way with fries.

Is good to go to a place with truely good people, authentic food amd have a great experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time here with one of my friend here. We were truly amazed at how authentic the food was. Do yourself a favor and get the grape leaves! Excellent option for just a meal! We could not stop raving about how fantastic they were! The gyros are fantastic as well, and the baklava is phenomenal, I say this because I don't even like sweets. I took a little bite of the one that I got to go, and nearly lost my mind. It should really be a crime to make something that good! I have def found a new local favorite spot in CLT. I will def be frequenting this place weekly!"}
{"text":"This place is a treasure! The grape leaves and hummus are to die for. The prices are really good and the food is authentic!"}
{"text":"Food is great! It's more like a greasy-spoon type of a place - they even have non-greek themed options. The hummus & pita are wonderful, but their french fries are amazing! Just beware that if you order the Xopiatikh Village Salad, there is no actual lettuce in this salad. 

Service is quick and friendly! Easy to get in and out - you can also togo too. 

Best tip about this place: The sandwich portions are ginormous!"}
{"text":"Solid diner food at 3 am. The gyros, pitas and breakfast items are all pretty good, with the exception of the bacon, which is pre-cooked and gross."}
{"text":"The Mad Greek is everything I want in a Greek restaurant: interesting personnel, questionable decorating choices, no frills and great food. 

The first time we ate here, we were the only patrons in the place -  I was definitely worried. The same thing happened the next time. And the time after that.... Apparently, I just pick off-times for the place, because based on the gyro, tzaziki and Greek salad, it would surprise me that the place is dead. 

My go-to meal here is a large Greek salad, topped with gyro meat and a side of that heavenly tzaziki sauce. It never fails to be an absolutely satisfying meal. 

The waitstaff is friendly and attentive - even after walking in after closing (oops!) our waitress INSISTED that we place an order and sit down to eat. 

In talking with another waitress, we learned that The Mad Greek sources its herbs and produce either from the veggie garden on the side of the property or from the local farmers market. They also source their meats from a small meat market in Charlotte. 

If you're looking for a corporate, sterile dining experience, this is definitely not it. I can't speak for much of the menue, but I will give The Mad Greek my vote for best gyro in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was warmly greeted with a smile by the guy behind the counter telling us to sit where we wished.  Waitress quickly came to hand us some menus. A quick glanced over the menu and I spotted a few of my favorite Greek food treats. I ordered the grape leaves platter which came with 6 nicely stuffed grape leaves along with a greek salad, a very creamy tzatziki, and warm pita (flat bread). The grape leaves were served hot. The creamy rice stuffing had a  perfect balanced of lemon, seasonings and olive oil.  Not too tangy as I've sometimes had at other places.  The tzatziki was thick and garlicky in the best way possible. The side Greek salad was impressive, tossed in a perfect dressing and topped with a generous amount of feta cheese that was smooth and mild in flavor. 
My hubby had the gyro plate and thoroughly enjoyed it (he grew up in a Greek neighborhood in Chicago. He knows good Gyro). 
We took some baklava to go and it was heavenly!  It's safe to say I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Okay. Confession time. We came here twice in like 4 days... it's just that tasty!

I recommend getting one of their pita sandwiches. Great price and awesome flavor. Grecian style comes with fries IN the sandwich as well as on the side. We tried this style our first visit (one gyro, one chicken) and went with the regular sandwich on our second. Both styles and meats were SO good. I don't know if I even want to expand to anything else on the menu, how can we NOT get the gyro or chicken pita?

Our server on Wednesday night was a bit friendlier and more interactive than the waitress we had today. But at this point, we're hooked anyway!

10/10 would come back and I've already spread the word to my friends to add this to their must-try list!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! The gyro was lovely and tender. Hummus was very nice and baklava was amazing. The staff was very welcoming - almost as if invited into their home. If I'm ever back in the area, I will definitely visit!"}
{"text":"I have to give The Mad Greek a two.  I, personally think the food here is pretty good but my wife disagrees.  The hamburgers are really good and the Greek dishes are authentic, if a little pricey.  But every time I talk my wife into giving it another chance, they consistently fail.  Last time we ate there she ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, and even though you would think for three dollars you would get at least a decent grilled cheese sandwich, they managed to put forth a sorry excuse of a sandwich that wouldn't even make the dollar menu at a fast food joint.  The sandwich had one slice of Kraft single that wasn't even melted. Pretty sad.

But there is an actual Mad Greek running the kitchen.  You can hear him yelling, and occasionally catch a glimpse of him.  I'll have to ask my relatives that are Greek just why the owner is mad."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The Mad Greek has very authentic Greek food and many Greek workers and customers too! You will get tons of food for a reasonable price, but save room because dessert is the best part! There is always fresh baklava and other Greek pastries that taste great! I would definitely recommend this place"}
