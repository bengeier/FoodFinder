{"text":"Live bands on Friday from 7 to 10. The wings are very good, nice and crispy but still juicy. The last time we were there was a Friday during lent, so I opted for the blackened grouper - wow, it was fantastic! Some of the best fish I have ever eaten at a restaurant. You can reserve a table for when they are busy, which is nice when there is live entertainment. The staff is friendly and willing to answer questions. Although the prices are a bit high, the atmosphere is great and the food is very good. This is the same place that used to be called Babes."}
