{"text":"Hard to figure out how to get a table, but their system seems to work. Lake perch & HUGE shrimp were excellent. Hash browns were to die for. Very old time supper club. Loved the relish tray."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my wife:
SERVICE: Service here is very good to spectacular. There's no greeter at the door; the bartender notices you when you walk in and gets you down and places your order so it's ready to go when you're seated. This is necessary since wait times can approach two hours, especially on Fridays. However, this is mostly due to the extreme popularity of the restaurant and limited seating. The only complaint I have here is the wait staff definitely gives preference to regulars over first-timers. 
FOOD: What we've gotten has been very good. Definitely recommend the bluegill fish fry. Also, the homemade fried chicken might be the best I've had in Wisconsin. 
DRINKS: Cocktails are dirt cheap and of excellent quality. Recommend the classic Wisconsin brandy old fashioned, also a very good beer selection.
ATMOSPHERE: Classic Wisconsin supper club with a small town feel. Nice bar area. Limited seating and usually very crowded, so can be a little overwhelming, especially during peak rush times."}
{"text":"There is little I could say that has not already been said in other reviews. Quite an enjoyable experience for this out-of-towner, and on tap for a return visit the next time my travels take me to Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place after a recent visit to Madison. It was 3 deep at the bar but we decided to wait because thats probably a good sign they have great food. We were right. We waited over an hour for a table. Both of us had fish frys. Food was excellent. It is a supper club. You order your food at the bar when the waitress comes to take your order. This typical of all supper clubs. The waitress lets you know when your table is ready. Drinks were very good and despite how busy it was the service was excellent at the bar and dining area. The building is nothing spectacular typical supper club with central bar and several dining areas. You dont go to these places for the aesthetics. Overall we were very happy to find the place and would definitely recommend it. We almost went back on Saturday night for the steak which looked awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Classic supper club atmosphere. Let me into employee/ regulars bathroom! Definitely a do-again"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great fishfry this is your place. My husband and I have been going to Toby's for 5 years. We have never had a bad meal. Everything is great. My husband loves the chicken and I haven't had better shrimp than the ones at Tobys and I grew up in Florida.
It's family owned and everyone in the family works there.
We are there at least twice a week.
There is quite a wait on Fridays but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Classic Wisconsin supper club with wood paneling. Order your drink, order with a waitress, drink some more, get seated an hour later and enjoy. Great fish fry! 
Not good for Kids who aren't patient but my 6 year old did great! We will be back"}
{"text":"Nice old super club. Awesome staff, strong drinks and good food. Unfortunately they said they are out of shrimp for awhile"}
{"text":"Unique experience at a local favorite.
First you order drinks from the bar  then they will bring your drinks and set the table, before you are seated.
Be sure to bring your appetite!
Good and plenty of it."}
{"text":"Best supper club around. Great steaks seafood fish. My wife says the frog legs are excellent. I'll talk her word for it."}
{"text":"I got my beer spilled on me at dinner and they charged me for a replacement. Friendly though."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday noon and had the lake perch. It was okay, but seemed pricey at $11 per person, especially when you can get AYCE for that price at other restaurants.  Cute little touch: an ice cream sundae in a cup at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I have been back to Toby's since my previous rant, and am here to apologize for parts of it.  All I can say in my defense is my leg was hurting, and I should have known better on a Friday during Lent.
The food is good, the service was as good as can be expected given the mob scene that is Friday @ Toby's.
Just be aware, there WILL be a wait.
They are victims of their own success."}
{"text":"Great food and very reasonable priced. I got the pan fried chicken which came with a salad, relish tray, rolls and breadsticks, 4 pieces of chicken, potato and cinnamon roll for under $15. The chicken was so good, actually some of the best I have ever had. I will go back when I am in Madison again."}
{"text":"Never been for the fish fry (I've never had the patience to wait through the crowds they get on Fridays), but the steaks are great for the price. Drinks are cheap and strong, service is always spot-on and the atmosphere is a hoot. It's a little piece of authentic retro Wisconsin. Fun to take out-of-town guests to."}
{"text":"Friday fish fry was awful. We had the lake perch. I asked if they had blackened or baked without breading because i have a gluten allergy. They said yes they could do both. I ordered blackened. They brought fried/breaded with season salt. My boyfriends fish was also disappointing. If you like to wait about an hour and a half for below average fish fry then this is the place to go. If not try Dexters."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Crappy food! We waited 45 min at our table before we even got any type of food."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so popular. After three attempts, we finally rode out the wait for the fish fry. After all, can ALL those people be wrong? Well, yes they can. Let every other town in American, Madison has it's share of cheap b---ds that will endure any indignity to get a bargain. That seems to be the draw of this dumpy little joint.

The drinks aren't expensive, but that means you get what you pay for. The fish was rubbery, the service perfunctory, and the decor beyond kitschy -- just old and tired. The restaurant equivalent of flying coach."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and have yet to get a table. It can't be that good always completely busy with slow service. Can't even get a drink while waiting completely understaffed and mis managed.."}
{"text":"Good food, even greater atmosphere on a Friday night.  Order the Brandy Old Fashion Sweet and the fish fry."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's day. Was super busy but the staff was very friendly. Very good steaks and old fashions.  Only down side was that it took about 45 mins to get our food. But like I said it was very very busy there."}
{"text":"Best Old Fashioned's around. We always get fried mushrooms and cheese curds for appetizers. The mushrooms are never slimy like they are at so many other places. And if you haven't tried their pan fried chicken, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait on Friday! Very good fish but the wait on a Friday at 5 was 2 hrs! Died down after we finally got our food so I would come at 630 or 7."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Been going here fir years.  Never had a bad meal, and I've ordered most of the menu.  Old school supper club style service, and food.  Get there early...it's always busy."}
{"text":"Toby's has the best fish fry in the Madison area without a doubt. We visited Toby's for the first time last Friday and were instantly impressed with the friendly service at the bar while we waited for our food. I had read about Key Lime Martinis being their specialty drink so I ordered one and it was delicious! Another one quickly followed the first it was so tasty. The fish was great. I ordered the cod and my Dad tried the baby pike and the perch. All three were excellent. I think the baby pike was my favorite. I never expected to have impressive french fries along with the fish but we couldn't believe how amazing the fries tasted. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The hash browns were perfectly browned. Loved the relish tray and the bread basket. We had a friendly server who urged us to try some of the breaded shrimp and that too was just another deliciousness to add to this meal. We left the place knowing we would be back."}
{"text":"Toby's is an awesome old school Supper Club.  They are busy on Fridays but worth the wait for the cod or perch - both awesome.  Their Toby's special is very special - a great cut of steak for a great price.  Their huge shrimp is breaded fresh and I'd put it up against ANY shrimp I've eaten.  We keep going there because it's hard to find better food anywhere.  The blue gill is my favorite!  And they even have relish trays!!!"}
{"text":"Great Friday night fish fry. 

You order at the bar (at least on Fridays). When a table is almost ready, they'll start cooking your food, and serve it when you're seated. 

Free dessert! But it's a single fun-size candy bar."}
{"text":"A Wisconsin Supper Club in the true sense of the word.  Great food, great gathering place for friends and neighbors.   Get there early.  Grab a seat at the circular bar.  If it's crowded, be prepared to wait, at the same time,
 meet your neighbor."}
{"text":"This is one of those kitschy Wisconsin places that I love beyond reason, though the food is average. See my review of Brother's Three for similar sentiments.

What's great about Toby's is the environment. It is a dark bar filled with old beer signs and locals, and for this, as well as the service and experience of eating here, I'd give the place five stars if my conscience would allow it.

There's a procedure to Toby's. You enter and sit at the bar. You order at the bar, and the server comes to get you when your food is ready, and then you are seated.

The bartenders make a great Old-fashioned, one of the best in the city. 

At your table, you'll find an array of decent goods typical of a supper club: a basket of de-frozen rolls; a plate of celery, carrots, and scallions; again, de-frozen cinnamon rolls for dessert; and breadsticks and butter.

The best dish on the menu, one that I can't order, is fried chicken. They make it to order. Because of this, it can hold up the meal, which the server will generally alert you about. My friend loves the fried colossal shrimp, which is awesome and also $$$. I generally get the cod, which is good. I doubt any of the fish is fresh, but perhaps on the weekends, it is. 

All meals come with a salad. Get the blue cheese dressing. You can also add blue cheese crumbles. 

If you love fantastic service and Wisconsin kitsch, this is a great joint. Don't expect five-star food, despite the five-star reviews. The prices range from moderate to expensive."}
{"text":"A true Wisconsin experience. An amazing fish fry with a friendly staff who make great drinks.

You will wait a long while for a table but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Always friendly people and great food.  Delicious fish fry and worth the wait.  

Tip: Key Lime Pie Martini."}
{"text":"i will return to madison just to eat here.  best of everything.  leave pretension at the door and come and have one of the best meals of your life.  when you think the ribeye's one of the best you've had come the next night and try the perch or the fried chicken .  also, it might sound crazy but treat yourself to the best ranch dressing you'll ever have in your life (as weird as that sounds)... and the fried cod... I know you're thinking cod? Fried? You got to come here!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to place for lake perch in the Madison area, but things have been slipping a bit lately in the food quality and portion department.  I consistently get the steak and lake perch and the last few times I've had it, the steak has been perfectly cooked to order.  The lake perch has been the downfall for me, though.  The fish tastes like freezer to me and always has tons of bones in it.  I would much rather go to the Avenue for lake perch.  Always get a baked potato, and it's hard to ruin that.   Salad is nothing to write home about - just a bowl of lettuce, but I do like their French dressing.  Rolls are always cold with rock hard butter.  I noticed last night that I had two fewer pieces of perch than I normally get.  Husband always gets the lake perch dinner and he loves it, but I think his tastebuds are slipping in old age.  We love that they are so good to our toddler here and they give out a treat to little ones at the end of the meal.  Service is usually prompt, but last night it was severely lacking even though it was slow with several open tables.  Took us 1.5 hours between ordering and finishing the meal, which is unacceptable.  Waitress made several errors with our orders, took 20 minutes to get white milk, drinks sat empty for 20 minutes as well.  Tip for those who want to try it - avoid the extremely busy Fridays and go later on a Saturday.  You can still order lake perch (although I told my husband that we will only go to the Avenue from now on after last night's debacle)."}
{"text":"2 ladies walk into a bar....the end. No really. This place needs instructions: there is no greeter, so you must go to the bar, ask for menu, jump a waitress, order food then wait for the waitress to grab you. 2 people was a 45 min wait around 6:45pm. The bar is decent size, but it's \"owned\" by regulars and their friends. You really have to be aggressive or extra friendly to grab a chair. 2/5

Ambiance: Supper Club: dingy club, more functional than pretty, more practical than snazzy. 2/5

Drinks: beer menu displayed on wall, couldn't find mixed drinks, but we figured they'd have an old fashion so we got a brandy OF sweet and a whiskey OF sour. They didn't muddle, but it was still tasty. 4/5

Food: Fish Fry only
Fried Shrimp! These are amazing. One of the regulars clued us into these - they are so fresh and perfect breading. I honestly can say these are the best in 10 yrs. (Coasts included) 5/5

Cod - Interesting. The breading on these are something like a nicely seasoned, dry cornmeal. When biting through it, it's so crunchy. It's like breaking through that crunchy caramel layer in a creme brule, only this is SAVORY! Itty bitty oil under it, but after 2 large pieces, never had a \"greasy\" bite. 4.5/5

Perch - slight flour dusting. No flavor. The fish is bland too so I assume the highlight is the tartar sauce. I don't like tartar, so that fixed that. 2/5

Coleslaw - very good. I like their mix of vinegar-to-mayo. The slaw is chopped (vs julienned) and wet (kinda \"soupy\" to dip your bread in). 5/5

Hashbrowns - kinda funny. Burnt with literally a piece of American cheese melted over top. 1/5

Relish - kinda simple, raw veggies + pickles. Pickles were the highlight. Nice little app. 4/5

Overall, I like the food, but not sure if I have the resolve to fight off the bar. The fish fry is what I call \"traditional\" - no beer or fun crusting here. Well, maybe that cod piece? I would order 4 orders of that shrimp anyday!"}
{"text":"They have a Key Lime Martini that is super delicious!!! Make sure you order one if you go. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"super food and super service. bluegill is great. ribeye is always perfect. best hash browns in town. always need to take home an order of fried chicken which is also superb. always bring family or friends so everyone can order something different and share. and if you like fried shrimp, try Toby's. because they have the best"}
{"text":"Great old fashioned supper club!  The shrimp is AMAZING!  You must try if you go.. So good.  The steak is also pretty tasty.  Love the relish app and cinnamon buns."}
{"text":"Toby's is wonderful.  Family run and super friendly.  Sit at the bar, have a cocktail and get your dinner order in.  When things are ready to roll, the staff will seat you and most often your soup/salad is waiting at the table when you arrive.  The lake perch and the fried chicken are excellent.  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I probably picked a very bad night to go, as it was both Friday and Valentine's Day. The wait was very long for both a table and food (so long! like, an hour and a half, but we had nothing better to do), and there isn't a lot of seating so you kind of stand around buying drinks until your waitress tells you your table's ready. Atmosphere is typical loud Friday night bar crowd. Here's why they get four stars- despite the busy-ness, the staff are extremely friendly. The fish fry is the best I've tried in the Madison area thus far. I had the battered cod. I think the tartar sauce is made there, and it is wonderful. The fish tastes fresh, batter isn't soggy like most places, and seasoned perfectly. I think I'll try going back earlier sometime so as not to run into such a huge crowd. I'm glad we stuck it out and waited."}
{"text":"\"I'm not sure I trust the system\" - feelings of my dining partner and I as we stood next to the bar, Lake Louie in hand, assured that our fish order was on some list that corresponded with a table list that somehow kept us in the right order and would land us a Friday night fish fry eventually.

As stated below, the \"system\" at Toby's seems pretty chaotic. There's no hostess or instructions, and the way to get the process started is just to belly up to the bar and request food. We waited about an hour at ~7pm on a Friday, though as promised (and seemingly in the correct order), eventually we were seated. 

From that point on, the chaos gave way to a great meal. Having gone to supper clubs with my grandparents in southwest Wisconsin growing up, my reaction may have been more Proustian than most, but this is the real deal. A vegetable platter with a plate of crackers, including sesame \"breadsticks\" in cellophane. Quality coleslaw and fries. Perfectly-fried fish, large pieces of cod and well-breaded perch. Even one of those rectangular Andes mints to top it off as we settled the reasonable bill.

No extra stars for the dining room (retro, but comfortable) or technology, but our meal at Toby's was fantastic and a great representation of the unique aspects of a Wisconsin fish fry."}
{"text":"Good perch and cod fish fry... wasn't a fan of the bluegill, it was a little chewey for my liking."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Toby's for awhile now because I heard the food was wonderful and my husband and I love Wisconsin supper clubs. We decided to go on a Saturday night because we were told Friday Fish Fry's were extremely busy! Will so was Saturday night. So it must be good right? Will it was just OK. We arrived around 7:30 and was able to find a spot at the bar. We ordered our drinks and asked to see a menu. 20 minutes later still no menu. I finally asked a different bartender and we got them right away. He was great! Even gave me a free drink for almost spilling a full drink on me... We placed our order and waiting only about 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the house salad with their house dressing. I wish I would have asked for the dressing on the side. Big mistake. It was swimming in dressing. YUCK! The veggie dish is a nice touch. Our food came out about 25 minutes after our salads. We had another couple with us so we didn't mind the wait time. I had ordered the grilled pesto garlic shrimp which was the special that night and it was very good. On their menu they say they are known for their hash browns. I have to ask myself why?? Nothing special at all. My husband had the New York Strip which he said was just OK. Nothing he would rush back again to order. He also had the hash browns and was not impressed. The other couple with us had the baked potatoes and fried shrimp. They both enjoyed their meal. Would we try it again?? Sure."}
{"text":"I just can't see the attraction to this place.  I will start with the positives.  The service was good and attentive and you can tell they have a loyal clientele but it ended there for me.  We all had steaks. I ordered the t-bone and my wife and son that the fillet.  They weren't good, they were bland and tasteless.  For the same price you can get a better steak elsewhere.  Not worth the money and we won't be back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love the supper club experience.  We live on the west side of Madison so it it took a little drive just to get here, but Toby's has been on the bucket list for a while (often rated the best supper club in the greater Madison area) and it was my birthday.  To begin, the bartender we had was amazing.  He made great drinks, and was quick at it.  Their old fashioned's were great.  We put in our order for 2 entrees and an appetizer.  The place is standing room only for the most part because it is so packed.  We got our appetizer but a table wasn't available yet, so we ate our moz sticks while standing at the bar.  They were actually amazing, but how can you screw that up?  It was about 90 minutes before we were finally seated.  We ate are salads and rolls and whatnot because we were starving.  It was probably close to 30 minutes after being seated that we got our entrees.  My New York strip was perfectly medium as requested.  It was very tender and juicy.  The hashbrowns with cheese were pretty bland and nothing to write home about.  She got the steak and shrimp, and thought it was was cooked well but under-seasoned also.  The waitresses were running around and quite busy, which resulted in getting very little in terms of service.  I had to go to the bar for more drinks because we got so little attention.  We were very disappointed at this point with the service and the amount of time spent there and asked for the check.  The atmosphere was very typical of a supper club, except for the fact that the bar was packed 3 deep and it was very loud with conversation.  This might have been more exciting to us if we were locals and knew other people.  I will gladly skip out on the drive and long wait for food to go to Klassic Tavern in Verona, or other similar establishments on the west side, rather than come back.  If you're a local or have recently eaten, Toby's is a great option for you.  I will say the patrons were friendly and helpful, as we didn't know how the ordering process works.  The bartender basically gives you a menu and you wait for a waitress walking around to see you and take your order on the spot.  I would probably be a regular here if I lived in McFarland, but I have better options closer, and I don't get how this has numerous nominations as best Madison area supper club."}
{"text":"Toby's is an icon of supper clubs. Its always packed and you have to fight for a drink- but it's because it's damn good. I've been here 10's of times and usually order the ribeye which they cook up nicely. I did have a bad experience once where my medium rare steak was way over done (I HATE to send anything back anywhere being former bartender/waiter, but this was totally justified). The second go round the cooks sent out a steak that was blue (ie raw/inedible), I was pretty upset and told the waitress I wanted nothing else due to the experience. She apologized for the blue steak- clearly the cooks were playing games but not her fault at all. She handled it well, this turned me off Toby's for a while... but I finally caved and started going back again and everything has been good ever since. Only giving 4 stars due to the one off, otherwise this place is worth your wait (there will be one, I promise)."}
{"text":"I've come to Toby's twice. Loved it the first time, unimpressed the second. Both times were very crowded but on our first visit we arrived at about 6 and had probably an hour wait, the second time we arrived around 7:30 and had to wait about 2 hours for our food. The first time the fish (we shared a few different kinds) was fantastic (like best in town) the second time it was no better than what you'd get anywhere else. The first time the servers/bartenders were friendly, if busy, the second time they really seemed like they wished we (or they) weren't there.

I felt like the strange model of hailing down a server and ordering when you put your name on the seating list was kind of quirky and fun the first time we went. On the second trip it just seemed like a big pain in the ---. 

Definitely won't go back later than 6 o'clock on a Friday. May not go back at all."}
{"text":"THE WRINKLE PARTY IS IN FULL EFFECT (and the ever had Wheel of Fortune on TV for them)

I am not saying I won't come back here because I will but....somethings has to change.  First off, I love the casual/old school/supper club seating style.   At first I thought I would hate it but I rather enjoyed ordering my food and sitting at the bar for a few drinks before being properly seated.   Don't ask me why but I liked it.    Thats about all I liked.

Before I start my rant I will say the staff was great and they did not charge my wife for her.....steak??   Yeah, long story short....the food sucked ass.   Short story turned long again...

We arrive and have some drinks at the bar...good drinks.   After ordering we were seated about 35 minutes later and thats great.  So...lets talk food.   I ordered the Steak (medium rare) and lobster and my wife got a tenderloin steak (medium).   Well when they arrive my steak was WELL DONE and so was my wifes.  She can usually tolerate it but honestly the tenderloin was a shitty cut of meat and un-eatable.  MY steak was a little bit better but way over cooked so I sent it back as I tend to do when that happens.  If I want jerky....I stop at 7-11.  So the steak comes back and it is RAW as raw can be.   Pretty much the seared the outside and the inside was a dark shade of red.  Not pink or rare red....i am talking old and probably no longer good for consumption red.   So.....yes I send it back again and this time it comes back to me well-done again.  FORGET IT!    I just sucked it up, put a ton of salt on it and ate my jerky.  MY wife....yeah she would not touch hers or send it back.   

WAIT....I got more!   So I did mention I got steak and lobster right?   Yes....I did and probably should not have but....what the hell.  My lobster was obviously frozen burned and WAY WAY WAY over cooked.  Insert \"dry\" joke here because all of mine at going to be a bit on the too vulgar side.

Anyway, I love the atmosphere and staff was very nice but the food was god awful form the cheese curds to the hunk or meat with no flavor and probably not even good enough for a dog.   But...i did say I will be back...yeah...it is a place to hang out and....ugh...why do so many of my friends like this place so much?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere reminds me of an up North bar, very homey to me as a northern Wisconsiner. More of an older crowd, but some younger people and families were there as well, I didn't feel out of place at all.
My husband and I got very good old fashioneds to start and placed our order- the service is very much no frills, but still polite and very quick. We came at 6 PM on a Friday for a fish fry- I would guess their busiest time- and we were seated within a half an hour and served maybe another 20 minutes later. Pretty quick for what I've come to expect from Madison restaurants. 
The fish fry is OUT OF THIS WORLD, I got cod, fries, and slaw and my husband got perch, hash browns, and slaw. Everything was so good and surprisingly cheap! The fries were especially delicious, the beer batter and perfect amount of crispiness and starchiness is incomparable. We will for sure be coming back for more fish fries- awesome find, a must if you're into supper clubs!"}
{"text":"Favorite place all time and close to home!! This place is what a classy hole in the wall supper club is all about. Best drinks in the area! My fiancé and I always order either a brandy old fashion sweet and/or a key lime martini. They are a MUST at this establishment! Friendly and great bartenders/servers! When we do order food, their steaks and fixings are amazing! Never a dull moment here. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, always for fish fry, and it's always delicious. It's your standard supper club with a relish tray at your table when you are seated. The breading on the fish is light and crisp. Same goes for the shrimp, which are huge and always a hit for whomever orders. The hash browns, though... These are no joke. You will be deeply saddened if not one person in your party decides to indulge. They are amazing.

If you haven't been here before, you need to order your meal at the bar before they seat you. Also, make sure you don't make plans for the rest of the night because unless you come to eat the early bird special, it's going to be a solid 2+ hour endeavor for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Servers are soooo unprofessional and loud. Expect to stand a while before someone comes and takes your order before even being seated. Great food, but don't think you are going to wine and dine your date romantically by any means, kind of hillbillyish establishment, but like I said, great food!"}
{"text":"We went here for fish on a Friday.  If you read my reviews you'll notice that theme quite a bit.  It was OK, nothing special.  It's one of those places that has old time quirks, and people love that.  

One of these quirks is that they don't really do a waiting list.  You walk in and kind of raise your hand, they tell you to have a seat and they will come get you.  Except they didn't.  We watched a few groups go ahead of us who came later.  Finally the group at the table next to us told the greeter to seat us ahead of them, realizing we should have been next.  That was annoying.

Still, the food was pretty good, including the fish fry. Also, several friends have raved about Toby's.  I trust their judgement, so if we are in the area we will give it another try.  The trouble is, for us it's not close."}
{"text":"Good place to stop off the Hwy, on ur way to the CHI, A DIAMOND IN THE RUFF, it's not big, but really nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"First time here, Friday night jam packed excitement! A bit of a wait but with the potent drinks that take you to another dimension who cares? Our party of four all had the cod, awesome! Bleu cheese dressing with vinaigrette was amazing. Very friendly, great service. All of the staff that we encountered couldn't have been nicer. Would highly recommend! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I almost didn't Yelp about Toby's, the place is so busy as it is.  Read the other reviews if you want a lot of details on the whole awesome experience that is Toby's on a Friday night, and it is awesome, from the food to the whole semi-surreal ambience, but I only have two things to say:

1.  Go there.  Seriously.
2.  Go online to their menu, figure out what you want before you go.  Trust me.  

You're welcome in advance.  

ps: one of the things Yelp asks you to rate is child friendliness, and that's a hard one with Toby's,  My 11 year old LOVED it.  But she's not a whiny, spoiled little ball of walking entitlement with zero patience.  That said, you'll wait 90 minutes for a table, prepare."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  A Supper Club.  If you're expecting haute cuisine you either can't read or have never been to the Midwest.   That said, the fish fry is nice and the cole slaw ain't too bad.  I give it 5 stars for being a great 3-star if that makes sense."}
{"text":"Tony's Supper Club was a great find. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and delicious. Very reasonable prices for the amount of food. Plus they bring you all these little plates of food: pickles, cinnamon rolls, etc. Don't let the exterior of the building put you off. It's a great find!"}
{"text":"I seem to be on my supper club tour.

Jam packed for fish fry on Friday. The system will likely seem foreign to everyone except regulars. Check in and order at bar. Get drinks. When food ready they find you and direct you to your table. Like others before us, we were skeptical that this would actually work but it seems to quite well. Very nice and friendly service.

The food was good. The fish fry - lake perch this time - was good. I certainly don't consider myself a fish fry expert though. The fried chicken was okay. I wish it was crispier though."}
{"text":"Let me say LOTS of people go here, so there is a wait, during which people sit and drink.  I think because they've heard people say it's supposed to be good, with a few drinks they think it is amazing.  I thought it was OK.  The fish were nothing spectacular.  It's a classic where people think quantity is quality.  Not great food in my opinion.  You can go elsewhere and get about the same quality, but because people drink and rave...so does everyone else."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a true supper club. Very old school. Place looks like a dump but looks can be deceiving. Like any true supper club you MUST and absolutely MUST sit at the bar and have a drink or two or three or in many cases when Toby's is busy five or six drinks before you seat. We went on Monday and it was super busy. I can't even imagine what Fridays or Saturdays are like. So, you order at the bar and a waitress will come get you when your table is ready. When your table is ready your salads are waiting for you with an assortment of relish, rolls, and cinnamon buns .classic supper club. Then your food comes out pretty fast. I got the blue gill and shrimp combo with hash browns. My friends got the perch and pan fried chicken which looked amazing. AND HUGE!!! Nothing was extremely remarkable in appearance but the taste was good ol fashion comfort food. And it was fried perfectly. Speaking of old fashion, you better order korbel old fashions here. Is there any other drink that says Supper Club like Korbel Old Fashion. Also another thing to note is our hash browns were served family style since we all ordered them as a side dish. I'm definitely coming back to try that chicken .oh, and the shrimp were gigantic. Literally HUGE shrimp. Not even sure how it is possible to serve such big shrimp in Wisconsin at that affordable of a price. Love this place. Love it love it love it"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! If your in Madison, make sure you stop by for a meal. Tucked away but very accessible from 12-18, this place that a great atmosphere of the traditional supper club."}
{"text":"Last night I was at a Local restaurant Toby's Supper Club?. Super excited to try the fish fry that i had been hearing about. As I'm sitting at the bar with 3 people one friend who happens to be Mexican the guy next to me leans over to me and says \"so how does a Ni**er and a Mexican hang out together?\" I immediately ask him to repeat him self and he does. 

Now plenty of thought run through my head, do I put hands on him??? I have too much to lose. So I get the bartender and explain the story. She does nothing but tell him to apologize. So he sticks his hand out and says sorry. I tell him I'm not shaking your hand and I'm about to remove you from the bar.

At this point the male bartender comes over slaps his hand on the bar and says hey you two no arguing. I tell him \"there is no argument this guy is a racist and needs to leave. The male bartender does nothing but says well \"he is a visitor from out of town he is staying at the hotel down the road and you see he is on his phone so he is clearly calling for a ride\". 

At this point I'm even more upset that they are not removing a \"visitor\" and letting 4 locals be treated like this. 

So the four of us get up and leave, I turn around and go back in with a business card and ask for the owner to call me. Come to find out the owner was the male bartender. 

Now I am more upset that the owner is slowing this to happen right in front of him.   As a business owner you know that reputation means everything to you."}
{"text":"1st time and as I say ONE AND DONE. This place was an ass backwards train wreck. They run around like chickens with there heads cut off taking orders, no body can sit until your salads are ready then they say there's your table and be seated only to witness the table had your salads sitting on it for 45 minutes. The steak was full of gristle and had no flavor. Waitress suffered with tip because again there was not one ounce of organization in the place. Me no never will I stop again."}
{"text":"We dropped by this place on a Fish Fry Friday which is a big night for Toby's. The place is so packed that they try to cut back on the time you take up at a table by having you order your food before being seated. You then stand around shoulder to shoulder with other people who are waiting and you all have to work together to let the employees pass through. Our party was seated 20 minutes after ordering. 

My bland plate of fish wasn't something I'll come back for. I'm just too use to food with seasoning on it."}
{"text":"my wife and I went to Tobys based on a number of friends recommendation (they are regulars) on Saturday june 17th. We were ready to eat their specialty,steak,rib eyes. Our waitress Ashley took our order . The steaks came. My wifes was tough and overcooked,ordered med rare. Mine was old ,the fiber of the steak was like mush. Our waitress' next trip anywhere near our table was after we finished eating and getting our own drinks from the bar. She asked'how was our meal'. . I told her . She tried to tell me she was busy..The bartenders were excellent."}
{"text":"Hard to knock this place,its a traditional Wiscounsin bar/resturant,great food and large portions,this is the place that the locals go,most patrons know each other.I had the cod special and the hash browns and it was fresh and portions were large,this place gives you a great value for the money. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"#3 on my all time fried chicken locations I have traveled to.  This one was a bit hard to find but it is a traditional restaurant, like so many, that may have started as a farmhouse.  I have only had the chicken dinner (been there 3 x's) but it is work the trip and the service and food excel. I will go back next time in the Madison area."}
{"text":"You've gotta love Toby's - it's a true Wisconsin supper club: great fish fry, relish tray, dark interior with lots of leather, and windows so dark you can't tell if it's day or night.

I'd give it solid 4/5 for a fish fry and sides, just note it gets pretty busy, so expect to wait over an hour, but the bar is happy to serve you a couple old fashions to get started."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try their fish fry after hearing many raves. Unfortunately, my party of 4 had to leave before we even got our meal due to a drunk patron who made derogatory comments. Bartenders/management failed to access the situation."}
{"text":"Disappointing is how I would start this review. We love the place and have been going here for years but the food here is just not as good as it once was. The bar was fun, we had an excellent waitress but once we sat down to eat it just wasn't up to fish fry good. My broiled cod was cooked right but was tasteless. It sat all alone on a big hot plate with nothing else to make it stand out. The hash browns we got family style, a big plate in the middle, were terrible. None of us would eat them. They had an \"off\" taste that was sort of moldy tasting.Our waitress immediately replaced them with baked potatoes which were perfect. My partner had fried cod which again was cooked perfectly but just sort of thrown on a plate. The baby pike which is Walleye was another choice was reported as a little overcooked and dry. We know that Fridays here are overcrowded and looked forward to coming on a Thursday for a good fish fry and it just didn't meet the mark. There is not many places left around Madison that still have a consistently good Wisconsin fish fry and Toby's needs to raise the bar and put a little more care in what they are doing."}
{"text":"Super supper club!!!   Generous and reasonably priced drinks, friendly staff and some of the best fish in the land?!!??    It is easy to see why this place is packed as early as 5:30 on a Friday night. I am fussy and this place has me captivated after our first visit. Time to try the steaks which people say are great."}
{"text":"Excellent food and waitstaff. Just get there early.  Very early or expect to wait.  One of the best cod fish frys."}
{"text":"Great place for old school Wisconsin supper club dining. Lots of food, small prices. No need for an appetizer when ordering entrees as they come with bread, cinnamon rolls, and relish tray. Great place!"}
{"text":"I loved the whole experience.  Old people like it here too.  Soup was bacon cheeseburger chowder."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on our way back to Milwaukee when he wanted to stop and have dinner at a supper club. Toby's fit the bill!

While I would describe the place more Wisconsin bar than supper club as far as decor, they did serve the obligatory relish tray so supper club it was. 

We ordered Old Fashioneds from a rather sour bartender who seemed annoyed that we didn't know how the place worked. She didn't really answer our question on that but the male bartender was very friendly and explained how the menu/ordering worked to all of his customers. The place was packed for Friday Night so our wait was decent but the drinks were great and cheap.

Our server was super sweet and attentive. I had the cod fish fry and my boyfriend had the ribeye. The steak was ordered medium and I think it was mostly medium rare but it was really good--and I was expecting it to be terrible. The cod was huge and typical fish fry fare and my only complaint would be the tartar sauce was very sweet, too vinegary. I love having tartar sauce with my fish and I couldn't fully enjoy this.

The rolls, salads and relish tray were all fine, nothing special. Prices were on the cheap side so I wasn't expecting anything grand here. I'd recommend this place as a bar joint with pretty good food, cheap date!"}
{"text":"Went to Toby's last night (Sat, Aug 1st) and were blown away with how good the food & service was! Arrived with a group (12 of us). They accomodated us quickly and were absolutely terrific! We had called ahead and even tho they don't take reservations told us to get there before 6 and they'd seat us. Place was pretty packed but they kept their word. From cod to steaks (rib eyes & filets were done to perfection, from med rare to med well), from baked to hash brown potatoes everything at our table of 12 was great! The drinks were excellent and the staff (all family) were delightful! Most expensive dish on the menu was $21.95. Prices were all very reasonable. Will make this a regular stop when in the Madison area."}
{"text":"FIrst time at a Supper Club. Tons of fun! Definitely a different experience. Cod is delicious. Two pieces is plenty with all the extras you get (rolls, potato, salad, relish tray...)"}
{"text":"For the all hype this places gets, it sure didn't live up to it. Sure, it was busy- what place isn't on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Rail drinks were prices right- two drinks for $6.00. I ordered the lake perch- what a DISAPPOINTMENT. If you've been to Door County/eastern WI and had perch there, don't bother with Tobys perch. It was not good. My cottage cheese was warm, and my date's \"salad\" was lettuce with salad dressing plopped on it. No veggies, croutons- nothing. The server was nice enough, for bring so overwhelmed and busy."}
{"text":"Our first experience with a supper club. A definite unique experience with a crowded bar as everyone waits for a waitress to come take your order and then wait for the same waitress to come get you to take you to your table. Three drinks later, we were seated, enjoyed our salad and relish tray and quickly got our fried chicken and hash browns. It was all tasty and plenty left over for another meal for each of us. 

Thanks to the crowded bar we got to meet a bunch of the friendly locals. One couple was kind enough to make a list of their favorite restaurants for us.

A definite must go to when in town, if only for the experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in at least 30 years. Didn't know the protocol when we walked in, asked the young lady at the bar. She handed us menus and told us that a waitress would take our order when we were ready. 5 minutes later a waitress came, took our order and said to stay seated at the bar, as she would tell us when our table was ready. About 15 minutes later she pointed out our table which was set with salad, bread and a relish tray. After another 15 minutes our meals were served and they were delicious. When we were all said and done, including take home boxes, our total bill including drinks and a tip was under $60, amazing!. Definitely will go back but you need to get there early as there is limited seating and you could end up waiting 2+ hours for a table as they fill up.

They do not take reservations, so it is 1st come 1st served!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Never been here before and was told that we are not seated or put at a table until our food arrives. We were quite confused when we seen 3 tables open for our party of 4 and we were told we couldn't sit because our food wasn't delivered yet. The bar was completely full so we were left standing for 40 minutes. We ended up having to change our plans for dinner due to unforeseen circumstances and the waitress was more than accommodating to box up our orders to go. 

Doesn't make sense to me to make people stand for 40 minutes to only sit and eat for 10-15 min."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place even though it's a couple miles from my house and I've almost certainly passed it and not noticed it.

An acquaintance told me they had the best fried chicken he had found in the area.  Fried chicken?  A Wisconsin supper club?  I was skeptical but this person was from the same rural part of Virginia where I had eaten the best fried chicken I myself had ever had so I gave it a try.

Best in the area?  Other than homemade, my wife and I agree it's probably a 3 way tie with Popeyes on a good day (they're so inconsistent for a chain) and McGee's.  The breading is very light with a subtle flavor.  I liked it a lot.  My wife likes a crispier breading.  Meat was very tender.  Chicken came with myriad traditional Wisconsin sides and ended up being a good deal for ~$15/person.

I'm told their fried shrimp is also amazing.

One start deducted for a wait that was over an hour for carryout (I was told 45 min) and some of the staff was rudeish."}
{"text":"Just a quick review. 

Went for lunch last week on a Monday.  The food was great, the service was amazing and the pricing very reasonable.

I went for drinks two weeks ago and enjoyed the crowd and the people.  

It is small, it is crowded, you will wait....but it's good and more efficient than most places.  I may raise this to a five star after a few more visits.

Suggest you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was fantastic.   I started with asparagus soup and had the prime rib french dip loaded with onions and mushrooms.   Best food I've had in a long time.
Microflex approved!"}
{"text":"We ate here last Friday night and it was maybe my 5th time here.  Wow the place was packed when I arrived at 4:30 and I had to wait 40 minutes before I could get a seat at the bar.  The place is VERY loud from talking and laughter and it's congested so if you can deal with that you will have fun.  The bartenders are nice and the food is delish!  You order from the bar and they get your food and table ready from there.  I always order the 16 oz. t-bone ($21.95), which is a great price,and my girlfriend ordered the Friday fish fry (3 piece $12.95).  Dinners come with salad (pretty average) and choice of potato.  Their french fries rock!"}
{"text":"Terrific traditional Wisconsin supper club, with personality-rich waitstaff and really good food.  Starting with some Spotted Cow farmhouse ale, everything we ordered was really tasty.  No surprises here -- the food is simple.  Meat is grilled or pan-fried, potatoes are baked or fried, veggies come in a relish tray, cole slaw or salad bowl.  Our waitress was vivacious and sassy and attentive.  The place was packed on a Saturday evening, and everyone seemed to know everyone else.  A fun place for locals, but welcoming to our-of-towners as well."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. Food is good, not great. 

If you are looking for a classic Wisconsin Supper Club experience, this is your place. Experience was awesome, food was above average. I would go with the cod over the perch."}
{"text":"It is only a few miles from the Capitol square but walking in is like going back in time.  Old school supper club that packs patrons in, serves strong and cheap drinks, and has one of the best Friday fish frys in the city.  There is no receptionist when you walk in so find a server to put in your order.  Order up some drinks and when your food is ready, your serverwill find you and bring you to an open table.  How these servers do this is almost magical as when we were there on a recent Friday night, the place was absolutely packed with people.  I have tried both the cod and lake perch and both were dynamite.  Perfect fried fish to go along with hashbrowns (go with the added onions and cheese) as well as a relish tray that is waiting for you when seated.  Our server, Wendy, did an outstanding job keeping us replenished with drinks throughout the meal.  We ended our gluttonous run with an ice cream drink nightcap-golden cadillac for me and grasshopper for my better half.  Served in rock glasses, they were a perfect and boozy way to end the night.
Yes, the wait can be extraordinarily long but the experience and the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a the Best Fish Fry in Madison, Toby's is the place to go! Get there early and grab a waitress to let her know what your plan is if you're looking to eat earlier then later. We love sitting at the bar and having a few drinks first. The system they have there is awesome! The waitress takes your order while you have a drink and then you get seated once your food is ready! I recommend the Cod Fish Fry, shrimp and scallops. Oh yes and they have the best KeyLime Martini!"}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry is so good. The place is set up very different. You go to the bar order your food and then a waitress seats you when a table is available. It was very strange. But after getting our food it was worth it. Great Fried Cod, baked potato, slaw, and salad."}
{"text":"Second time at Toby's and had a better experience than the first time. The bar opens at 4:30 and serving starts at 5:00. We arrived at 4:45 and pushed our way to an already packed bar on a Saturday night. Got our drinks right away and was told that if we sit at an empty table, the wait staff would take our order when they start taking orders....great'

We both had the shrimp served with drawn butter and it was out of this world! Everything else was A++. This place has earned 5 stars and will have our business consistently even though it is 1 hour away."}
{"text":"Great Friday night fish fry. Totally old school supper club feel (sans the smoky atmosphere). Order at the bar, they seat you as your food is ready. They still give you the traditional veggie plate and crackers (love it!). Cheap drinks. They still make grasshoppers (last time I was there anyway)."}
{"text":"PROS: Fish quality
CONS: Wait time, crowded

The cod fish fry came with really large, flakey pieces of lightly fried cod. The hashbrowns are also very nice and crispy. Both were undersalted, however. The coleslaw was nicely flavored, but the complimentary bread tasted like compressed cardboard. We waited 1.5 hours to be seated after flagging down a waitress, and another 30 minutes to get our food. The fish quality was high, but I don't think it was worth the wait, given all the fish fry options in Madison."}
{"text":"If you like the actual WI supper club feel, this a great spot that's not 4 hours north. Very reasonably priced, good steaks, delicious baked potato, and a relish tray. Can't go wrong other than maybe more sesame breadsticks and radishes, because they rock. 

My filet was great but cannot wait to try a strip or maybe the giant shrimp they have. 

Go to the bar to put in your name and have the key lime martini or a glass of wine, also reasonably priced, while you wait for a table. Be prepared that this may take a couple cocktails if it's a Saturday."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with family after Thanksgiving. OMG!  Their fried chicken is the best I've had in my 59 years!  Moist, salty...but not too...perfectly done!  From the Key Lime Martini to the cinnamon rolls at the end...fantastic!  For my Texas friends who will understand...this is better than Babe's!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse is Madison's best kept secret. Order the Tobys special medium rare and you would love all of the extras that comes with it! Bread, vegetables, hash browns and a salad for under $15 with an awesome steak!"}
{"text":"Toby's is our favorite Wisconsin Supper Club.  We make it a point to eat there whenever we're in Madison.  Last night we had another excellent meal and experience there.  The food was excellent and so was the service.  The biggest challenge is deciding what to eat because everything is so good.  Looking forward to our next trip!"}
{"text":"Classic supper club the way it should be! Pan fried chicken amazing. The atmosphere friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time.  No hostess spot, so we wondered around until a waitress barked at us to go to one of the bartenders.  The bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible.  Maybe the food here is that great but we left after feeling very unwelcome."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed until recently. It's one of those places that seems frozen in time, and gave me the weirdest, though not unpleasant, sense of deja vu. 

The service was very uneven; one great, attentive, jolly bartender, one mediocre one; one outstanding, friendly, funny waitress, one largely absent and stonefaced one (ours).

The interior is dark, classic Wisconsin tavern. Sooo much so. All the classic beers are available - Schlitz, Old Style, etc., both of which we ordered. It was less busy than usual due to the Memorial day weekend, probably, so we didn't have a long wait.

Fish fry options include catfish, always my choice. It was hot, a little greasy, and in thin fillets. The flavor was pretty indistinguishable from my companion's lake perch. Wasn't blown away, but nothing was bad. The salad was just iceberg lettuce, a bit on the dried out side, but still fine. Rolls (basic white, two of them) also a bit dried out, but we didn't eat til after 9 pm; probably everything was fresher earlier on. The hash browns arrived with a Kraft single melted on top, completing the feeling of basic home dining circa 1979."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night recently. Busy, even early. Terrific fried perch. The 6 oz steak special was excellent. They need to add braunschweiger to the relish tray but everything else, including the martini was perfect."}
{"text":"This is definitely a supper club staple for Wisconsin. (This review is for the Friday Fish Fry.)

If you haven't been before it can seem a little confusing and crowded. Calm down. Nudge your way in and order a drink from the bartender that never forgets. Rail drinks are about $3.50 a piece ($3.75 for an old fashioned) ridiculously reasonable. They also have a surprisingly good selection of beer and wine. (If you need menus ask while ordering your drink.) Find a waitress and place your order. Find a place to kick it for at least the next hour - that sometimes means hovering if you are looking for a place to sit. 

When your table is ready your waitress will seat you. Salads, relish, and bread will all be waiting. I love the classic aspect of a relish tray. The dressings have that old style taste to them so keep that in mind when ordering (a la not Kraft.) Almost as soon as you can finish your salad a very hot portion of fish will brought to you. My dining partner got the baby pike with a baked potato and I had the cod with French fries - we shared everything. The pike was super delicious, a mild fish taste with a very light breading. The cod was flakey and coated and fried up marvelously - a perfect brown. The baked potato was absolutely huge and came with a solid helping of sour cream. The French fries are flat cut and fried up nice and golden. Far better than your typical restaurant fries - they could have used a little more salt for my taste but that's why there is a shaker on the table. At the end of the meal you also get a sweet treat. 

The service is spectacular at every end of the operation. From the bartenders, waitresses, to bus boys, everyone is friendly and willing to get you what you need. I definitely recommend this place for when you have the time to just sit back with some cocktails and a fish fry - our meal took about 2 1/2 hours all together - so expect at least that on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Kicking it up a star because draaaanks are cheap, service it bomb and food is consistently tay-hay-sty."}
{"text":"A good place to gather with friends or family.  My wife's family love this place, where as I am indifferent.  First of all, I don't drink, and it's more than apparent that supper clubs depend on drinkers.  The idea of waiting around drinking for an hour before sitting down to dinner just doesn't impress me. 
The people are great and prices are reasonable and the food really isn't that bad.  Though, I they once over cooked a steak I ordered and I just can't order steak from here again.  This forced me to try the fried chicken, which is very good.  Moist and flavorful.  Hash browns seem to be the popular side dish and are pretty good, they certainly give you plenty.
So, nice people, social atmosphere and usually busy means it's very popular.  I would say it's worth trying, most aren't disappointed.  It's just not my thing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Tuesday and was pleasantly surprised to learn fish fry was a special that day. The absolutely best meal I have had while visiting Madison. Wish I could go back again before leaving this beautiful city."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and sometimes it's busy and sometimes not so much. Great food and great service. It's my favorite supper club type place. Sometimes you have to fight through the regulars at the bar to get a drink but every time we end up having a pleasant conversation and smiling. It feels like home."}
{"text":"Epic. Everything as advertised and more. Proof that a perfect experience does not have to cost a lot of money. 

Friday fish fry, packed house, had to park the car way down on the shoulder of the road. Walk in, the low ceiling adds to the intimacy of the place. Waitress, no waitress, it's not that big a deal to get your order in, they find you. Don't drink hard liquor, but decent beer selection, and the time passes effortlessly, especially if you chat someone up, made particularly easy by the close conditions. Food, what can I say? Cod perfectly done, relish and two (?) selection bread, awesome. 1940s prices (not quite, lol).

This is a relic that is slowly drifting into the sunset. One day it will fade just like our father's father's once treasured haunts. That is why you go now."}
{"text":"Wonderful, busy, Saturday night supper club experience. Pickles, carrots, radish served with rolls even before you order. Lots of varieties of fish. Perch was overcooked, but light breading and the seasoning was well done. We'll be back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and good service, place is busy and the staff hustles. Stop by after Canoeocopia every year when town. Love places like this."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap drinks and super friendly staff.  What's not to like.  The fish fry is awesome and the fried chicken is some of my favorite.  This is my go to place when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Great old fashioned wisconsin supper club.   Be prepared to wait a good hour to order and get a table but they make a great old fashion to help kill the time.  For dinner definitely recommend the shrimp as it might be the best I have ever had.  Don't forget to stick around for an after dinner drink too... great grasshoppers and if you are looking for something different the key lime martini is a must"}
{"text":"Perfect Wisconsin supper club experience. Perch and blue gill were amazing. Steaks were flavorful. Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Strong drinks; perfectly cooked steaks and reasonable pricing, what else is there? A bit of a wait, but worth it. A traditional supper club on the edge of town. Highly recommended kind of going back in time."}
{"text":"We've been driving yo the Dells area and back to the chi-town burbs for more than ten years always stopping to eat at the same few restaurants in either Madison or Janesville.  

I decided to search for something different using Yelp and that is what brought my family and I to Toby's Supper Club. 

Toby's is 100% authentic supper club.  It is dark and has really low ceilings.  The bar takes up at least 35% of the restaurant and is always full.  The menu is as expected with multiple fried fish and steak options.  The prices are affordable and the cocktails are huge!!

You immediately know that everyone in the place knows each other and probably has since childhood.  But everyone was friendly even tho we are lowly FIBs !!!

I had the bluegill and lake perch B+.  While the fish tasted great I thought it was slightly overdone.

My mother in law had the ribs A. They were perfectly cooked  and delicious! 

Oh yeah and the fried cheese curd app was coronary good!! 

If you are looking for an authentic quality meal stop on at Toby's!  You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better supper clubs I have been to.  But be ready to wait.   On Fridays, either get there early or be prepared to wait a while....But thats okay...drinks from the bar are spot on and has some amazing bartenders behind it. 

You do not get on the list to get a table until you have placed an order. Just flag down one of the waitresses, give them your order and they will find you when your table is ready. While you wait order a drink. A must try is the key lime pie martini and of course old fashion. It is sooo good!! All of their drinks are made excellent and their prices are hard to compete with!! Our bar tab after 6 mixed drinks was under $20.00   Can't beat that!  

The fish fry and steaks are excellent and I have heard the shrimp is also very good but I haven't tried it yet. This traditional Wisconsin supper club is a must stop if you are from out of town or even a local!! Friday's are always busy so be prepared."}
{"text":"An absolute amazing Friday Fish Fry location!! Be ready to wait though!! My husband and I arrived at 6:15 on Friday and waited over an hour for a table. The best part is their full bar which has some amazing bartenders behind it. You do not get on the list to get a table until you have placed an order. Just flag down one of the waitresses, give them your order and they will find you when your table is ready. While you wait order a drink. A must try is the key lime pie martini. It is sooo good!! All of their drinks are made excellent and their prices are hard to compete with!! Our bar tab after 6 mixed drinks and 1 martini was $21!! Can't beat that!  The fish fry is excellent and I have heard the shrimp is also very good but I haven't tried it yet. This traditional Wisconsin supper club is a must stop if you are from out of town or even a local!! Friday's are always busy so be prepared."}
{"text":"Legit. 
This was a make or break moment, it's the first supper club we checked out since we decided to make it a point to stop at Wisco Supper Clubs. 
This did not disappoint and we look forward to coming back when we can spend some time at the bar before our meal. 
It was an older crowd, but not stuffy at all, they were all having a great time. In fact all the older people were at the bar and the younger people at tables. 
I got the fried chicken, yum, juicy. My husband got the Blue Gill, he was happy. All the sides were good. I got a ravioli soup, perfect choice, I should have gotten a cup to go. Husband got salad w/ blue cheese dressing - it was iceberg lettuce and the dressing wasn't quite \"blue\" enough. He would try something different next time, there's certainly enough options.
Based on this experience, looking forward to the next supper club stop, wherever that will take us."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Bad layout, cold. I ordered a steak and it was over cooked. The drinks were solidly good but all in all it barely qualifies as a decent supper club. I'd rather drive a few more minutes south and go to the green lantern where I've had both good and bad experiences than repeat my experience here."}
{"text":"Service was awesome, but a little pricey for stale rolls.  I generally dislike TV's in a restaurant, and Toby's had a lot of them. The food was standard."}
{"text":"Toby's has one of the best fish fry's around which makes this place SUPER packed on Fridays.  Expect an hour wait as they do not take reservations. We have never had bad food here and we come here 2 - 3x/month. My husband loves the steaks. I usually order a variety of their seafood. We love the supper club effect with the veggies out first.  Salads are always fresh.  I recommend you try Toby's if you are not in a hurry.  They are just that good!  You will not be disappointed. Relax with one of their signature key lime martinis...better yet, make it two!!!"}

{"text":"Always recommend this place to friends when they ask about a good fish fry in Madison. Be prepared to wait a bit on Fridays, but it's so worth it!! Just sip your cocktail and wait for a meal that's a great value and delicious. Crispy fish, fluffy baked potato, and nice relish crock. This is what I think of when I think supper club in Wisconsin."}
