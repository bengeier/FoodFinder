{"text":"Great place for quick bite!  Manos and his brother Chris on Public Square are great city ambassador's.  Long-time staple, including the half decade I lived in the warehouse district.  Hot dogs were tasty and the buns always soft.  The mustards, both brown and yellow accent the warm tasty hunger busters!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"encased meat products. happiness with the mustard! tubular wonders.   23 years - same spot, same dude. Manos the Greek hotdog guy ( and his brother on Public Square) give some much needed life to downtown. Gregarious, funny, and always, ALWAYS glad to see you. This is 5 star hotdog performance art. The hotdogs themselves are New York style \"brownwater dogs\". A tad mousse-like (OK, mushy) from simmering in the hotdog \"brownwater\"holding pen, they lack the \"snap\" of a natural casing Chicago style tube.  The obligatory onions in a vinegary ketchup sauce is a New York/Cleveland thing, but that and some mustard always make these decent hotdogs.  Also, these guys don't wear those nasty plastic gloves. Using their tools and a simple paper, they never actually touch your food.  Less litter, less plastic.  And perfect food safety as far as I am concerned.  I can't tell you how many times I see the \"sanitary\" plastic gloved hand go from cash, to food, to face, to food...   Manos!  Great hotdogs!!!  Good shtick too!!  Tell 'em he was Yelped...  Carry on."}
