{"text":"I fell in love with this place during our annual anniversary trip to Sedona! Now they have relocated to the Valley and I could not be more excited! Best hot dogs hands down! When the husband and I became vegan we were still able to enjoy Simon's since he always offered absolutely delicious vegan hot dogs. Best food for anyone, take the whole family.. meat lovers and vegans alike will find something wonderful to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great for vegans!! My first time going out for a classic vegan hotdog and I will be back. The vegan alfajor is amazing as well, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The food and the staff are AWESOME!! I have tried all the vegan dogs and they are all really good. Start with the Columbia and go from there!!"}
{"text":"Awesome find! What a great an authentic Colombian place, the hotdogs were flavorful and cheap. I had a natural juice \"tomate de árbol\" and the original Colombian hotdog! Will definitely come back and i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Today I was really craving hot dogs because it's the 4th of July and I needed my vegan fix. Found this place near my job & I absolutely loved it. The owner is also very nice, he made sure my order was ready quickly because he knew I had to go back to work"}
{"text":"This one of my favorite places to go for lunch.
The vegan burger is the best! I've enjoyed trying many of the vegan foods. Sometimes I have a hard time deciding what to get since everything is so good. Also, everyone is super friendly and a pleasure to talk too. One yummy place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. My wife and I visited the original location 1.5 years ago in Sedona. When we visited Arizona again and stayed in Scottsdale, we were thrilled to see that they have now moved to Scottsdale.  The new location is great, spacious, and welcoming. More importantly, the food is still beyond amazing. I had the Columbian (x2) and my wife had the vegetarian Hola Amigo.  Both of us were again impressed with Simon's. This is saying a lot because my wife is not a hot dog fan whatsoever. The owner is very friendly and passionate about making good food.  Hope to visit this place again during our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Very cool take on a hotdog.  Tried the Columbian with a beef dog and YUM!   Can't wait to try a different one next time.  Unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in the United States. I flew all the way from the San Francisco Bay Area just to eat lunch here. Don't miss it if you are in the greater Phoenix area"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!  The buns are the absolute best I've ever had. The Columbian dog is my favorite!!  What's great about Simon's is that vegans and non vegans can both have an outstanding meal together, and neither will leave disappointed. And the fries.... seriously, the best!!!!  Do yourself a favor and go dine at Simon's."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Everything can be ordered vegan as an option.  And the food was really good.  Best hotdog i've had in years."}
{"text":"Vegan or non-vegan..this place makes a MEAN dog!!! Just ate my first meal here and I will probably be back every week! SO good!"}
{"text":"Amazing options for vegans and non-vegans alike! Great experience, customer service, and attention to detail...you won't be disappointed. Owner is the man !"}
{"text":"The veggie hotdogs were decent but not great. The veg toppings were better than the dog itself."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We were greeted instantly and the menu was explained thoroughly by a nice man. The vegan dog selection was unique and made our taste buds dance. Will be returning here very soon!"}
{"text":"So excited to see Simon move down to Scottsdale! Incredible flavor, great service, great people... looking forward to many more in the new location!"}
{"text":"The vegan hot dogs here are fantastic and I've tried pretty much all of them on the menu! The owner is very friendly and offered our group free samples. The location is a little inconvenient, but I would definitely eat here again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We've followed them from Sedona down to their new location in Scottsdale . We love the vegan options . The bratwurst is great to for those meat eaters in your group ."}
{"text":"Dont get the beef hotdog. It is expensive and small. Taste like all beef hotdog from Costco."}
{"text":"Tried the Colombian and it was amazing. The service was great - the owners are very nice."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't expect much going into this little joint, but it honestly is one incredible and memorable restaurant! You can feel the personality in the music, decoration, and friendly staff. The food is exquisite and delicious, especially the vegan options, both of which are fine substitutes to actual hot dogs. The toppings are fresh and interesting in their composition, ranging from vegan potato salad to crushed potato chips. 

The prices are perfect for the amount of food you get, and best of all the prices are tax-included! Their AC withstands the summer heat and the refreshing drink options help as well. 

Overall, my experience was fantastic and I will be returning on a regular basis. 10/10!"}
{"text":"I recommend the fresh fruit drinks they have. Called agua fresca in spanish. The one they had today was made from the Lulo fruit. Extremely refreshing. Ordered the Colombian with a beef hot dog as it is there most popular. The bun, is similar to a bolillo style, however it is sweet. I recommend it to anyone who is in the area."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Simons hot dogs! We found it in Sedona and are so happy it is in S. Scottsdale! ! What an awesome location and the specialty crafted Colombian hots dags are the best. Don't miss out on Simons!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner and was surprised the place was not completely full (especially because Scottsdale is full of less than great and always packed fast casual restaurants). I have been vegan for three years now and this is the BEST vegan hot dog I have ever had! I ordered the vegan Colombian dog which had roasted pineapple, vegan cheese sauce, and crushed potato chips. it was fantastic, I would recommend this place to meat eaters and vegans alike!"}
{"text":"This place is legitimate I got the sonoran dog my brother got Columbian and they were both great. Fries are also great as well as the cookies. Definitely would recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! So happy to find Simon again! We used to plan our Sedona trips around his business hours when he was located up North.  Found him on Facebook a few weeks back and just visited - YES! It's the same standards plus more. The veggie Columbian is definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Just waited 40 minutes for a hot dog no different than any other in town (in fact, Short Leash and Portillo's much better).  Will not be back."}
{"text":"We fell in love with this place during our trips to Oak Creek and we're excited they are now in the valley! Hubs and I just had our Colombian fix and will be back for me! Delicious and quaint local! Welcome to the valley!"}
{"text":"Ordered their vegan dog and vegan burger...loved both. Bread was soft, meat was hot (temperature-wise) and both items were prepared as requested. Service was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Simons is excellent! Their vegan chili is great and their lentil veggie colombian burger might be my favorite veggie burger ever! Awesome customer service as well!"}
{"text":"VEGANS REJOICE!!! Probably once of the nicest guys I've had the pleasure of meeting. Not only were both our vegan hot dogs amazing, so were the fries and the free desert sample! We drove in to town from California and were there just a few hours, and he blew us away! Must stop by!!! I'll always eat here when I can!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise find for us. My wife is a newly declared vegan and a HUGE Chicago hotdog fan. She wanted to see how a vegan hotdog compared to a \"Chicago dog\".  She ordered the Wunderhund and was more than pleasantly surprised and said that this was as good if not better than any Chicago dog she has ever had. I had the veggie burger and it was delicious. We highly recommend Simons's Hot Dogs."}
{"text":"I moved from South Florida and I have been to Colombia a few times, the colombian hotdog is authentic and delicious. the setting is cozy especially since you get shade on the patio on the afternoons."}
{"text":"I had the traditional bratwurst with sauerkraut and mustard.  It came with French fries. The Bratwurst tasted very good and was enhanced by the fresh soft bun.  The fries also tasted pretty good. The owners greeted us and were very nice. Everything inside was nice and clean including the bathroom.  I would definitely go back to try the other selections."}
{"text":"Simon Hot Dogs never disappoints! From their early beginnings in Sedona to their latest location in Scottsdale their creations are unique and delicious. Great service, friendly staff, yummy ingredients, and BEER (hot dog's best friend). I always go for the Colombian, Tokyo madness, or Loca Brat. Don't forget to try the maicitos!!"}
{"text":"I had the Colombian Hot Dog which came topped with pineapple, mozarella, and a nice sauce. It was delicious. The staff are very friendly, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Simon's Hot Dogs has the best Colombian fast food I've tried in Arizona. As a Colombian, I had been looking for Colombian fast food in the U.S. but couldn't find any restaurants serving it. The food was delicious! I got the Colombian Hot Dog with Salchipapas and a Colombian soda. As a huge fan of the fast food in my country, this food brought me so many memories about my life in Colombia. I got Colombiana, Popular, Manzana Postobon, Naranja Postobon, Uva Postobon, and Piña Postobon sodas. I also got Alfajores for dessert. The service was great and fast. The owners Felipe and Marcela were very friendly, helpful, and the only Colombians I had seen in a very long time, which made me very happy. You must try Simon's if you are Colombian and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for great fast food."}
{"text":"By far the best vegan hotdog I have ever had.   I'm sure their non vegan dogs are superb as well as the buns and toppings are awesome.    We had the vegan Mac and cheese along with some coleslaw and plantains which were all excellent but the next time we come, I will have to forgo those sides and get two hotdogs because they were THAT good.    Love this place!   Awesome service.  So friendly.   I wish they near our home in Chicago.  I would eat there once a week minimum!"}
{"text":"Love these hotdogs. Simon, the owner has a great selection of hotdogs. Our favorite is the Colombian style beef with pineapple and topped with potato chips. Don't forget to try their alfajores, delish!! Great friendly service is a plus!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service with a smile. Very quick and great prices. A must for vegans!"}
{"text":"Simon's is one of our all time favorite eateries. The hot dogs are simply delicious - especially the Vegan dogs!  We live in Jerome and whenever we go to the Phx area we buy Simon's as our special treat. If you're in the area and just hankerin' for a good hotdog, Simon's is THE place in AZ. No others compare, as far as I can tel...."}
{"text":"Interesting combinations on the menu result in a delicious experience unlike the common typical hot dog joint. While I happen to be lucky enough to live nearby, it would be well worth a much longer trip to enjoy the unique flavors available here."}
{"text":"One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. I love this place and was so disappointed when they left Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona... It's been a ritual when we go up there for a Simons Hot Dog and beer... Now Simons is 2 miles from home and I am so very happy about this. Cowboy Dog is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is the best and only place that I know that serves vegan hot dogs in Scottsdale. They have tons of vegan options which is amazing! They also have vegan cheese which is always a plus! The employees there were super helpful and nice. Definitely will be coming back soon. :)"}
{"text":"Tough place to find but worth the effort

Simple menu and done right

If you're a fan of all things hot dog, you'll really like this place. Please people behind the counter were super friendly"}
{"text":"Interesting take on hot dogs. I highly recommend the Colombian Dog, it's not how I would usually outfit my hot dog, but the combination of ingredients (chorizo, pineapple, mozzarella, chips, and sauce) makes for a delicious treat."}
{"text":"So yummy!!!! And unique in this area. Had the wonder hound very tasty! The people running the place are really nice too."}
{"text":"I couldn't have been more pleased with Simon's. My only regret is not being able to eat here again during my short stay in Scottsdale. This was on my must-try list of spots for vegan grub, and they delivered. They have two (2!) vegan sausages to substitute in on any of the hot dogs, and the Colombian dog was amazing. My friends had the meat options and were equally impressed. Top-notch! Also, super friendly and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I rode my bike to Simon's to try their vegan hot dog today.  I didn't realize that any of their hot dogs could be made vegan until I was ordering.  I ordered their Columbian dog with California (vegan) wiener.  The Colombian dog has pineapple and cheese and was great!  I'll be back for it and to try other versions.  Also they were very helpful to a first-timer there. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the cowboy and then had to go back for wonderhund after trying the great sauces the owner offered. Great addition to old town and on my short list of awesome places for a chili dog! I will be back for the loco brat and the Sonoran dog with refried beans which I will get spicy!!! Go and you won't be dissappointed in their amazing hot dogs!"}
{"text":"I always get the California Vegan Tokyo Madness. It's consistently great. I love this place. Staff is very friendly. Go here."}
{"text":"It was good for a hotdog.  $6 gets you a nice bun, lots of toppings.  I wish it would have been a little fresher.  The help is personable and really tries hard to make this a must-stop place.  Great job."}
{"text":"I have been to Simon's twice now and was very happy after both visits. The owner is very kind and accommodating (both trips we visited with a larger group)."}
{"text":"I was eating the vegetarian hot dog and had to make sure it wasn't beef! I couldn't believe it wasn't! It was delicious. Many great choices and fast and friendly service! Eat here!"}
{"text":"Staff is so friendly and their food is so delicious! We love that they offer vegan options too. I recommend getting some Alfajores, the most delicious cookies I've ever had. Please open a location in Chandler so we can visit you more ;)"}
{"text":"Oh. My. SWEET DAMN!!! 

We visited Simon's back when I was pregnant and I loved the food (and then totally forgot to Yelp about it...for shame!). And we just recently stopped back in and were super glad we did!

It's really a great treat to have a hot dog joint that also caters to vegan/vegetarians. I love me some kraut and mustard on one of their vegan dogs! I even got my boyfriend to join in on the vegan eats (he is totally not a veg head) and he thought they were quite tasty. 

I got the German Traditional (brown mustard and kraut) with fries and my man ordered the Hola Amigo (avocado, cream cheese or tahini and either jalapenos or banana peppers) and a German Loka (brown mustard, wasabi mayo, kraut, and jalapenos or banana peppers). Everything was delicious! 

The owner told us that he started adding veg-friendly items to his menu after many requests from staff from Oak Creek Brewery. (I guess they used to have a spot in or around there.) That would explain all of the Oak Creek beer and wine offerings, as well:) 

Great food + great price + genuinely nice owner = will DEFINITELY visit more often!"}
{"text":"Come in a few weeks ago. They can take any hotdog and make it vegan which is incredible.. unique flavor combinations. 
We came in at 5 pm on a Friday and it was dead. With only the two of us there it took a long time to receive our food so prepare to wait a while on a busy night. 
The food itself was yummy. The chili on the chili fries tasted like it was not restaurant made but rather tasted like it came from a can. 
The restaurant itself looks a little rundown, out of date. A pick-me up would give this atmosphere a 360. 
Overall, it was yummy. Might not return, but worth trying out."}
{"text":"Very well done.
   I wanted something different for lunch and I found it. Then I ordered something traditional. Simon's Hot Dogs has lived up to expectations. The restaurant was clean, nicely decorated without going over the top, and easy to find with parking right at the door behind the building. The owner was at the counter helping another couple when i walked in and greeted me right way. After paying with my credit card, he called me by name for the rest of my stay. That's personal service.
   Even though Simon's is known for their Columbian Dog (with mozzarella, pineapple, crushed potato chips and sauce) I ordered the traditional bratwurst. This brat exceeded many I have had in midwestern German towns, including some in Wisconsin. It was well seasoned, had a delightful snap when bitten, and was fully cooked with nice caramelization but not charred. It had a generous stripe of brown mustard that complimented the flavor of the sausage without covering it up. Plenty of hot (steamed?) sauerkraut was heaped on top and it was served in a steamed roll. 
   Who steams their brat rolls? I have never had a brat on a steamed roll. I've had many hotdogs on steamed rolls but I can't recall having a brat that way. Now what I need to ask is why does no one else steam their brat rolls?
   The french fries were simple, crispy, and served hot and fresh. 
   The price seems a little high for a hotdog (5.95) or a brat (6.95) but they have both vegetarian and vegan options. You do receive a 1/4 pound dog for the money with plenty of toppings. Add 2.99 for fries and a drink and you get a meal for under 10 bucks. You will walk out satisfied. If you are wanting to slam a bunch of chili dogs this isn't the place. If you want to enjoy a hotdog or brat that lives up to it's potential, stop in.

Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff)
-Hotdogs and brats done in an unique way.
-Clean and comfortable. (fantastic booth seats)
-Surprisingly good value.
-Owner takes pride in this business.
-Great flavor and nicely sized portions.

Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff)
-the medium fountain drink is the size of most smalls, but for dine in you can refill it. Canned soft drinks are way over priced."}
{"text":"Simon's was a lunchtime treat. The buns were some of the best I've ever had, and the Colombian style dog was outstanding. Who would think all those ingredients work so well together? I got it with the chorizo dog which was tasty - nothing like greasy Mexican chorizo. We also tried the chili dog with a beef hot dog and the hot dog/fry basket. The fries were another big hit. The only mutual complaint was that $6-7 for a hot dog plus fries and a drink is a $10 meal that may still leave you hungry. Nevertheless, it's something worth trying."}
{"text":"Holy vegan hot dogs.  Simons is great I'm glad they are in Scottsdale because if they were any closer I'ld  have a serious addiction issue.  The vegan dogs are great.  Texture and flavor are spot on. So many great styles to pick from. Love the crushed chips on them.  The best part are the little cookies. Pricey at 3 for 5.  But worth every cent.  I have to get 6 so that there is an even number to split between myself and my daughter.   Love this little local mom and pop shop. They are warm and friendly. And their love of what they do comes through in the food."}
{"text":"At first glance the dog creations served here are a little bizarre, I mean pineapples on a hot dog? But I was so pleasantly surprised by how great these dogs are I can't get enough! I've had both the vegan and omnivorous versions of the dogs and order the vegan dogs more often. Besides the greasiness of the real dogs I couldn't tell you the taste difference. The \"Colombian\" is a must try and it's easy to see why that's their best seller. Columbian soda is a nice bonus to the meal. Great hotdog place, probably my favorite in the valley."}
{"text":"Love, love the Wunderhund hot dog here! The staff is always friendly and the hot dogs are cooked to order. The Wunderhund has an awesome \"mustard-relish\" with Peruvian aji chili, do die for!"}
{"text":"I tried the cowboy hot dog with chili beans and mozzarella with fries and it hit the spot. So yummy juicy hotdog with home made chili beans was the bomb! Definitely will be coming back. Been here once before and tried the vegan dog. It was good for a vegan dog the toppings is what completed it."}
{"text":"Great for vegetarians and vegans. Menu is easy to navigate and ordering was not difficult. Friendly staff who actually listen to you when you order to ensure a pleasant experience. Plenty of outdoor seating on their patio, which is great at this time of the year. Service is definitely on the slower side, so don't show up if you're in a hurry. I waited over 25 minutes on a slow, Sunday afternoon. If this place could serve quicker, I would come more often and further explore their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs. Wife got the Colombian and loved it and I got the Cowboy and it was really good too. Fries were very good too. Owner was very nice too."}
{"text":"Truly delicious handcrafted hot dogs. I had the Colombian and Mexican versions and the sauce and toppings made it way better than the typical ballpark dog. The chili in the chili cheese fries has a nice smoky taste, too."}
{"text":"Hot dog lovers (and even those who feel they are not) may think they have died and gone to heaven when they first visit this place, as my wife and I did for the first time today. She's from a big city famous for hot dogs, Chicago, and she says Simon's Hot Dogs is an amazing place! That's the voice of authority!

Beyond that, I have been a hot dog lover for as long as I can remember, having had them in most US states and in several other countries, and I rank Simon's among the most unique and best. Period. 

Their specialties are all beef hot dogs, pork bratwurst, and vegetarian/vegan hot dogs with some truly unique and delicious toppings. For example, I ordered the Columbian hot dog which comes with pineapple, mozzarella, Simon's sauce, and crushed potato chips. WOW! It was incredibly good.

Simon's has been open for less than two months, but I predict it will be like a beehive very soon. In my book it is among the very best hot dog establishments anywhere. The manager is Felipe Roldan, a gem of a guy. Just go and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Let me just add another 5 star review, this place deserves it. Absolutely delicious and the owners are incredibly nice."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints...the quality and flavor is unmatched...my wife is a vegan and she loved every bite...friendly staff...all around A+!"}
{"text":"Good food, super friendly owner and staff. I stopped on a whim driving by....and happy I did. Nice spot."}
{"text":"Phoenix is lucky to have this place. The Columbian hotdog comes with pineapple and is heaven. The cookies are the best! We got everything Vegan and everyone loved it and felt great after. Thank you for the delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Tried the cowboy chili dog.  Chilled beer glass was a nice touch. Loved it.  I bet the chilli cheese fries are amazing, next time.  Great staff, thank you"}
{"text":"Chili was cold and bland. The menu was very overpriced for hot dogs, the cheese fries were tasteless and also overpriced. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs with interesting choices of toppings. I had the Sonoran Cousin with refried beans, onions, banana peppers, and bacon bites. My wife tried the Wunderhund with mustard relish and bacon bites, and my kids had a Columbian with pineapple, mozzarella cheese, Simon's sauce, and crushed potato chips while the other had the Cowboy with chili, Simon's sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Everyone thought their dog was delicious.

Service was fast and friendly and there is seating both inside and out.

If you like hot dogs, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Three dogs in and I have not found a bad one yet. Even the vegan dog is good. I'm? NOT even close to a vegan but I thought I would give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. The things that stood out to me was the bread is SO soft. The toppings are SO tasty and unusual in some ways. Pineapples? Who would have thought. They serve beer by the bottle and wine? Okay a little odd but I am not judging. The music is soft and upbeat. The service has always been very friendly. Totally worth a try!"}
{"text":"Ughhhhhh what's not to like about this cute little family-owned place?! The hotdog I had (can't remember the name now) was freaking delicious, and the top it off, the owner of this place was just as sweet as could be! He checked on us numerous times while we were eating to see how we were doing, and I can tell he just has a lot of pride in the business he's running. Good food, good service, good owner, what more can you ask for? OH, and the mini nachos were TO DIE FOR!!!! Order them now."}
{"text":"I recently found this restaurant and am in LOVE. I brought a date with me and we both ordered different vegan hot dogs. We also ordered the vegan potato salad and it was amazing! The hot dogs were absolutely delicious. The staff were super friendly and the restaurant has an awesome welcoming feel to it. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great little shop. I absolutely love Sonoran hot dogs so I was really excited to stop in. I got the Columbian which was delicious. I just wish they offered a traditional Sonoran hot dog. I need more bacon in my life."}
{"text":"Driving down Drinkwater, right off of Scottsdale Rd, I caught a glimpse of a new Hot dog place! 
Wow...being from Chicago, I was immediately attracted to Simon's Dogs!  I pulled in and was greeted by a most interesting & dee-licious way of preparing hot dogs, like none other! 
I ordered the WONDERHUND (WONDER DOG), MUSTARD RELISH MADE WITH DILL PICKLES, PERUVIAN CHILLES & MORE! It was amazing!  Very fresh & creative style, so I will be going back for the Columbian, Cowboy & def, that German Traditional! Great Craft Beers too! 

Debbie"}
{"text":"Great place! I am vegan an dmy wife discovered this place. The food is great and the people there are friendly.  I just wish we had one closer to home. Worth the 45 minute drive."}
{"text":"Finally had lunch at Simons. I'm pretty sure the owner served us and he couldn't have been having more fun doin it. 

Now to the food... 

I feel like I just cheated on Portillos and will do it again! I had one of the best Brats ever and the bun set it off..."}
{"text":"Love my colombian hot dogs!!!!
 anyone who just like hot dogs....will love hot dogs!!! And guess what, vegan are welcome and are amazing!!!!
To put the cherry on the top, 2 cherries on top: 
1st......they have beer ..local beer, LOVE that!!!
2nd.....they are in downtown scottsdale!!
Ok so even if  you are a local or not, this is a must try, a new restaurant. ...old...new...this is the place to have a cool awesome american meal...the colombian way - wink wink!"}
{"text":"I got the Columbian hot dog. You need to try it. Pineapples, mozzarella and chips on a hot dog? Yes! Try it! The owner is an awesome guy. Very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Every time we travel through Phoenix we stop by Simon's hotdogs. I love this place. We get the vegan Columbian hotdog and the corn dip called maicitos. I've known about this place since they were in Sedona az."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! I've been a vegetarian for some time now, and i love finding places like this that allow us vegans and vegetarians to indulge in. It was so tasty and I could tell that it was all fresh. I had the Columbian vegan dog (The dog is vegan, mozzarella comes on it though). It was ahhhhmazing! Hubby got the one with Cole slaw on it, and then we had to try the vegan chili cheese fries. Soooooooo good! It's a MUST! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Starving? Spicy? Perfectly filling? Grab a Sonoran cousins hotdog!! Beans, chorizo, jalapanoes, bacon and amazing bread. Sold. Great hot dog, great service. True Colombia style food says my Columbian friends."}
{"text":"I love the vegan choices and the hot dog was amazing. I just wish it were a tad cheaper."}
{"text":"Had the vegan dog, it was pretty dang good! The owner was super nice, and the place was clean."}
{"text":"This place was great. I tried the vegetarian Colombian dog and it was stellar. The owner is so sweet, he delivered my food personally and came to check in twice to see how I liked everything. I couldn't believe the near perfect rating until I came to try it myself. I'll definately be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place opened about a month ago and this was my first time stopping in. I'm so glad I did!! The owner, Luis, recommended I try the Colombian Dog and man, it was good.  I've had many Sonoran Dogs but never a Colombian one until now. Delicious! They have the softest buns I have ever had and they are made by a bakery specifically for them. I'll definitely be back to try the other variations that they offer. This place is located near the Galleria in Old Town Scottsdale and I hope it succeeds! Support local!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The food is great. My family and I had the Colombian, Salchipapa and the cookie dessert. The staff was extremely friendly and the owner came by our table to make sure everything was going well. 5 out of 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"So glad I went here during my visit in Phoenix.  My group walked by it a few times walking from our hotel to the office, and one of my coworkers made the suggestion to try it out.  

First you choose what kind of hot dog you want, beef, pork or vegan. There's a variety of styles you can get.  I got the Cowboy which was basically a chili cheese dog.  It was really good, and exactly what I was looking for.  Not overly-filling but gave you enough of a base before weekend shenanigans.  

The owner came by and talked to us as he was cleaning up a table and asked how we like the food.  He was very nice and talked about the business and their different hot dogs.  They were celebrating their two year anniversary at this location, but has been business for a lot longer."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs from Colombia, very unique and different flavors, the owners are super nice and friendly. If it wasn't a fast food place I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"So I found this place on Yelp while I was in Sedona, and we made it a tradition to stop by every time we were in town, but they closed and moved to Scottsdale. Although I miss it while I am up North I am so happy they are in the Valley! I love their Columbian Hot Dog and their Salchipapas. Their Tokyo dog tastes like sushi and its weird at first but its still very tasty. The Dogs seem a bit over priced but they are pretty big. The owner is true Columbian so he knows what he is doing."}
{"text":"Vegan hotdog and chili fries are AWESOME. Thank you for making this transition so much easier when I have a craving for a great German dog or Sonoran dog. 
I would drive down from Tucson for this.  
And the owners(?) or staff are so nice and very helpfully"}
{"text":"Love that they have vegan options! They are pet friendly which is a huge plus! The owner is super kind and helpful! Tried their columbian hot dog, which the owner said it's one of their top seller! I have to admit it was pretty good! I also tried their Colombian grape soda, nothing too special about it. It taste like regular soda lol!"}
{"text":"This place rocks the dogs. Clean, fast and friendly. The dogs are great; best dogs in AZ for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good, not great meal. Very personal and attentive service. We had a Brat, the Wunderlund and Nachos. Plus a Colombian soda. Only thing keeping it from another 5 star is the hard to find parking and ambiance.  
Recommend for a perfectly priced good lunch w great service."}
{"text":"Fun place! We tried the Columbian, cowboy, and wunderhund hot dogs. All of them were delicious, especially the columbian which had a great sweet/salty/savory flavor combo. We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I was a little unsure about the mix of flavors on the Colombian because I've never had anything like it before. It was great! A good surprise. Fries are good too. Good to support this local business! I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Seriously a great place to eat! The people were very nice and the place is clean and well just fun to grab a bite even with kids"}
{"text":"Oh.my.gosh! This place is so good! We had the California Vegan Sonoran Cousin, regular California Vegan hot dogs for the kids and the Vegan meatball sub with a side of vegan chili cheese fries and regular fries.
Everything was amazing! My kids scarfed down the regular hot dogs! They really do taste like regular hot dogs, they kept asking if they were really vegan! 
The buns they serve are seriously incredible! They are made with no diary and no eggs. They are so soft and buttery! 
My husband and I split the meatball sub and Sonora cousin hot dog and couldn't have been happier with our choices!"}
{"text":"The dogs are good and an interesting array of combinations of toppings. A bit on the pricey side, but delish. Not something I would go out of my way for, but if you are in the neighborhood, it's a good place to stop in. Never busy, but difficult to find."}
{"text":"Best hot dog place in all of Phoenix! Owners are from Colombia so they know how to make real, authentic Colombian-style hot dogs. They have great lunch specials and I love the variety they bring to the place.

They also have Colombian sodas and other appetizers that give me a quick reminder of how good food from home is. If you like hot dogs, like to support a family-owned local business, do yourself a favor and stop by here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Miami, and I've had a Colombian hot dog. And yes, they're Colombian dog is legit   delicious! I'm happy I can get it with bratwurst and I love the lays potato chips topping and the pina. Yum. It sucks that it's pricier than in Miami but it's apples and oranges, there's just more Colombian joints in South Florida than here. I think what disappoints me the most about Simon's is that they close early. You would think a latin resto situated next to a nightclub that serves a night out drinking food (hot dogs) would stay open late on Fridays and Saturdays. Sadly they do not, and when I have a craving of Simon's hot dog, I have no alternative but Los Betos. Eh at least a burrito still stuffs me. ;P"}
{"text":"This place has pretty much everything available to order as a standard hot dog and as a vegan option.  The vegan hot dog is delicious.  I got the Sonoran dog which is fabulous.  Chili cheese fries - amazing.  Vegan Mac and cheese to die for.  The service here is friendly and welcoming.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten many gourmet hotdogs but this one is by far the best.  I Had the Columbian and it was amazing.  The bun was so fresh and delicious.  The beef was delicious and with the toppings it mad is decadent.  I'm happy I live so close, I just can't believe it took me until now to discover Simon's Hotdogs.  Welcome to the neighborhood (sorry my welcome is a bit late), we are so happy you are here!!!"}
{"text":"Rarely eat dogs, but the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews swayed me to come here.  Worth every penny and 5-star Yelp review

Variety of hot dog options to satiate carnivores, vegans and everything in  between.  And the hot dogs were f***ing delicious.  Fries too

Family owned and operated and they couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. It's a Scottsdale staple on par with climbing Camelback. Don't think twice - give them your business"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I finally decided to try the hot dogs here. Granted I've only had the Colombian hot dog but it was so good that I came back for it again eventually. It's easy to see why that's one of their most popular as all the ingredients mesh together so well. I liked that the hot dog bun actually stays together the whole way through which is not necessarily true with other places and the sauce that they put on there is just awesome.

The people working here are very friendly and came to ask me a few times how everything was. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a good hot dog in the area to come by here. The hot dogs are really great and the prices are reasonable. I'm not even sure what took me so long to try it, probably because I didn't think hot dogs would be that good!"}
{"text":"Easily the best hotdogs in town. Simon's used to be in Sedona's Oak Creek Brewery and I was sad to see them leave, but they have only gotten better. Would and have recommended this place to everyone I can."}
{"text":"Get the Colombian with jalapeños.  Super nice guy and an amazing hot dog!!  He is very engaged with his customers and cares that they are happy"}
{"text":"I came here on Tuesday with a friend because we had been craving hotdogs and a close friend recommended Simons to us! I was bummed when I found out they had Pepsi products but no Mountain Dew! We both ordered hotdogs and fries, my hotdog had chili and nacho cheese on it and it was good but not the best hotdog ever. The fries were definitely very delicious and the best part about this place!"}
{"text":"Such a neat hot dog joint! The fact that they have vegan hot dogs make them better! And I love the fried plantains....mmmm!

Thanks Simon's!"}
{"text":"Great dog. My wife loves the vegan dig. We will return.  The best was the steamed buns it made the dog superior."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that I found this place. Coming from a Colombian, this is unusual that this is a Colombian vegan place. Everything was so goood. If you're vegan or not there are plenty of options. I will be coming here quite often."}
{"text":"Very good and creative toppings, wished the hot dog was grilled and a little sturdier. I liked the French fries, they were crisp and tasty.  My husband did not care for the fries. I liked the bun but again my husband thought they tasted like a Costco bun, i.e. nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but I like to eat plant based food at times and I love that they have an array of vegan options. The owner is very personable and friendly. I've come here several times to try different dogs (meat and vegan), and they are all tasty and delicious!"}
{"text":"Could possibly the best hotdog in AZ come from Chicago? Naw. New York? Nope. Mexico? Close El Guero Canelo. Cali? Haha you wish Pinks. The BEST hot dog in AZ comes from Colombia. The country. Simon's Hot Dogs has the most awesome dog in the valley. You read it here first. How good is it? Well, when he used to be in Sedona. We would ALWAYS make a stop. I mean a mandatory stop, like rain, snow, or shine.. Now that he is the valley? Shoot... you guys have no excuse. 

Service: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. They are a small family run joint and they are very hospitable. We've eaten at  Simons before and always have been treated warmly and like a regular (which we kinda were back when they were in Sedona).

Food: Ive eaten alot of hot dogs. This place might be the BEST place in AZ. It's different from  other hot dogs you have tried. Potato chips, pineapple on a hot dog? yup.  Thats that Columbia style. The pink Sauce is super yummy. He also has other yummy dogs (we like the Tokyo dog). Did I mention his dogs can be vegetarian and I believe are gluten free (you hipsters rejoice!). 

Atmosphere:
Small family spot. Local stuff on the walls. nothing too fancy. 

I dont know why or how this combination of ingredients work together like some operatic symphony. Perhaps Simon stole this recipe from the Ancient Greek Titans and passed down to humanity ala Prometheus stealing fire (okay, maybe not stole. But goodness gracious. will you go get one already??) All I know this is ONE UNIQUE AWESOME HOT DOG."}
{"text":"Simon's is simply fantastic.  Best hot dog I've ever had (and I'm from Chicago).  Plenty of room out there for great Columbian-style hot dogs!  If you are anywhere close, go there.  And if you are not, find a reason to be in that area.  You'll love the hot dog and be treated exceptionally."}
{"text":"Friendly and informative staff. I came for the vegan hot dogs and they were great. Had the Columbian and a couple bites of the Sonoran my boyfriend ordered. The vegan salichipapas are great! I was really impressed by their fries. I read reviews prior mentioning they were good and they definitely stand out! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs! Authentic and delicious food made me feel like I was back home in Colombia. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Vegan hot dog and maduros with vegan queso.  

Even if you're not vegan and just down for something deliciously different, go try it!

I don't remember which hotdog I ordered since it was many months ago, but I do remember how happy I was eating it. 

It's a spot I'll return to next time I'm out in the area for sure."}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying this: \"COLOMBIAN\".. not Columbian lol.

Anyways, the hotdogs are delicious. They have tons of variations, as well as other Colombian street foods such Salchipapas, etc. The original Colombian is the best. They also have Colombian sodas such as Postobon and Colombiana."}
{"text":"We love Simons! I'm vegan so THANK YOU for all of the options. The Columbia veg dog was awesome! Best chili cheeze fries and great soda/beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a vegan paradise! The owner is the one cooking, serving and taking orders. This is a very unique, small place that makes? you feel like home. When in town I tried the signature hot dog (vegan option), the vegan potato salad, the vegan \"meatball\" sandwich, the Paisita hot dog (vegan option), and the chili cheese fries (vegan) and they were all extremely good. The signature hot dog and the fries were? the winners though. I could have it every day? and never get tired of it. I am devasted that the city that I live does not have ?Simon's hot dogs! Great service, great food! 10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and affordable! I ordered the Columbian and so did my dad. It comes with pineapple and potato chips on top. It sounds greasy but it is actually very delicious and not over the top at all. I would suggest it to all. 

So delicious food 

Also, the owner is very kind making sure everything is to the customers liking and he is very appreciative of the customers that visit. Definitely try this place if you are in old Scottsdale. 

Atmosphere"}
{"text":"Normally I would have given 5 stars to this joint as I love the hot dogs. I was a customer that would drive from Phoenix to Sedona specifically to go to Simons. I was so excited to see they were moving to the valley. Unfortunately, the new location does not have the same personality that the old location did.  Just another strip mall restaurant. The good news is that the food did not change a bit!  The hot dog with mozzarella, pineapple and crushed chips is till fantastic."}
{"text":"My second visit to Simon's.  These gourmet hot dogs are the best dogs west of NYC and east of LaLa Land.  The Colombian is beyond belief!  The dog and condiments bring unbelievable taste to the table and the large fresh soft buns are the finest ever to deliver such a taste treat!  Thanks Felipe... Bringing Simon's Hot Dogs from Sedona to Scottsdale is the best thing that you could have done.  Continued success!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down.... finally get to eat my favorite Colombian hot dogs I feel like I'm back home"}
{"text":"So happy to have found a hot dog place with veggie/vegan options. The food is really good, the veggie dogs are great quality and my husband really enjoys the beef option. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful Cuban atmosphere with high quality dogs. The fries are super crispy and i highly recommend making it a combo."}
{"text":"Accidentally wandered into Simons, but I will assure you the next time I am in Scottsdale it will NOT an accident. This is a must visit place. Creative toppings and dogs!!!"}
{"text":"My husband has tried every hotdog on this menu and  he can't pick on he didn't like. Gun to his head, he could live without the mustard one (wunderdog... But it's still soooo good!

Th veggie chili vegan dog is one of the best on the menu! The Colombian is also amazing due to the grilled pineapples! If you want to try a different flavor profile, try the Tokyo one. It has fried seaweed (I think fried) onions and wasabi mayo. Very unusually but delicious. The Vegas hotdog is Tofurky and grilled so it tastes so good. 

If unsure what to order, ask the owner! Super nice and truly loves what he does!"}
{"text":"Awsome place. Food and ambiance is excellent! The owner is so nice so he makes your experience very pleasing. Had the hot dog, mine was plain but the others at the table had a cowboy, Columbian, and one with mushrooms and they were all delish!!! We are on to the dessert, alfajores and they are to die for. Recommend to anyone looking for great food and great service."}
{"text":"excellent chorizo sausage, better than the usual Mexican and Spanish varieties....and i'm Mexican"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!   The flavor and love (yes, LOVE...you can tell they take a huge amount of pride in what they are serving their customers!) they put into every meal served is SPECTACULAR!!!    The dogs and the toppings are so perfect .. and the buns, oh, the buns ... I mean how in the world do they get the buns so dang perfect anyway!?!?!  Simon's not only has some of the best food in the State but the best service too!    Truly the nicest people I have ever dealt with at a restaurant."}
{"text":"The buns for the hotdogs are amazing! Very soft, lite, and warm. One of the best vegetarian hotdogs dogs I have had in a really long time. Very friendly staff and laid back atmosphere. I definitely recommend and will be back again."}
{"text":"B loved his Vegan cowboy hotdog. The fries are to die for and the bratwursts are bomb. They have vegan alfajores and vegan rice pudding. Vegan ceviche, vegan salchipapas. Everytging was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was Extremely hungry,  but tired of eating the same food.   I was looking to try something different.    Looking through Yelp I ran across Simons and wanted to try a Colombian hot dog.  I tried the hot dog with pineapple on it and it was delicious.   I've since visited 3-4 times and tried different dogs that were all delicious.   Don't forget to try the Colombian cookie!"}
{"text":"Simon's deserves every five star review you see here. The hot dogs are amazing, great options for both meat eaters and vegans alike. The food is fresh and always delicious. This is a great family business and local business, they take pride in everything they do. My personal recommendation is the Cowboy, it's so good!"}
{"text":"We just happened upon this place and loved it!  We had The Columbian and it was awesome!  Prices are right for the quality and quantity. Clean atmosphere.  Simon is so friendly and nice. Really like this place!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE AND FOOD
I have tried this place several times now.  It is amazing because you can't taste the difference between the vegan and regular hot dog meat.  Quality products and fresh flavors.  Also the hotdog buns are made egg and milk free. Awesome

Owner is very helpful and appreciates every customer that walks in.  I would highly recommend anyone to try."}
{"text":"I have been to this place when they were located in Sedona a few years back and was very disappointed when they had closed down later. I was so happy to see that the have now opened in Scottsdale. Amazing tasting hot dogs...love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs and good service. Varied menu with interesting options. A bit difficult to find, but worth it."}
{"text":"I had the Sonoran Cousin dog.  Average dog, average fries.  I will keep looking for the ultimate dog-this place did not do it for me."}
{"text":"Really good hotdogs! I had the Colombian beef and my husband had the loca bratwurst. We both loved it! Kids loved their beef plain hotdogs. The buns are amazing!!! 
The owner is very nice as well.
We sat outside, it was a nice day and easy to control the kids haha
Go try it! :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! I had the Colombian and it was awesome. My friend had the Sonoran Cousin and liked it also. The owners waited on us and were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food, perfect buns, super friendly owners. Apparently it just opened a month ago. We all had various versions of the hot dogs - vegan versions and all were delicious! Vegan chili fries were good too! 5 stars."}
{"text":"A welcome fast casual and lower price point for the area.  The frantically fantastic owner and his staff aim to please with some very well executed fresh takes on the Hot Dog.  Do yourself a favor, imagine a Caribbean breeze, and sample the Colombian dog."}
{"text":"I love this place; this guy introduced me to a new hotdog that has pineapple, soooo bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Great dogs!  Keep an open mind and try them all  PS: The local beers are an added bonus"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat in Sedona has moved to Scottsdale!! If you love gourmet hot dogs, this place is sure to become a favorite!! 

Simon's gourmet dog flavors are phenomenal - he uses the finest veggie dogs, and the toppings are inspired.  I love the tangy combination in the Tokyo Madness, and my husband's favorite is the Columbian.  The nachos are lovely, and our meat-eating friends love the non-veg versions!

The service is super friendly - the owner is a dear!  It's no accident that the food is phenomenal- he puts his heart into it! You can order a bottle of Oak Creek beer to accompany your tasty hot dog."}
{"text":"OMG hold up. I reviewed this place once before while pregnant and couldn't find enough good things to say about this place. It was exactly what I wanted. They had food that tasted good and was allergy friendly thanks to their vegan options. 

I have been watching this place get all the love from the vegan community online and have been meaning to try it out again with all of the new vegan options they have since added and today was that day.
Ordered the vegan chili cheese fries. Something I have obviously not had since being diagnosed several years ago with an extreme reaction to cheese as well as red beans and eggs.

After waiting only 1/2 hour thanks to door dash I received my order which was still crunchy, still creamy and holy mother of vegan food: still freaking delicious.

I did not know that chili cheese fries, after swearing off cheese and red beans, was possible but it is. It so is. Here at Simon's. 
If you have not tasted the liquid gold and tasty vegan chili atop still crunchy delicious fries yet, what are you waiting for? 

I had to restrain myself from licking the container they came in. No joke."}
{"text":"Hot dog was just ok. The best thing about this hot dog was the bun. I ordered the Colombian hot dog and the hot dog itself tasted like if it came from Costco. The toppings on the hot dog were ok but overall I was unsatisfied. Lastly when I first walked into the restaurant it had a strange cleaning solution smell. For a hot dog, about 15 fries and a small drink the $10 price was a bit too much"}
{"text":"Being that I'm Colombian, I never eaten a colombian hot dog. Phoenix has limited amount of Colombian restaurants so when I heard of this place, I had to try it. 
We were immediately greeted by the owner. The atmosphere was nice & modern. The menu had a good selection of hot dogs and other items that I recognized. We ordered the sweet plantains, patacones, and I went with the popular Colombian style hot dog. Everything was delicious!!! The sweet plantains were cooked to perfection, the patacones were served with this avacado sauce that was out of this world. I've had the sauce in the past and it was just like how I remembered it. And the Colombian hot dog & fries did not disappoint.  Loved the salty and sweet combo.  The pineapple & crushed chips on the hot dog definitely was a new twist but I enjoyed every bite. The bun gets 5 stars!!!
I love supporting mom & pop restaurants & look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to grab a hot dog in old town and I found their ad on Yelp once I moved here. This place is a classic mom and pop shop with authentic flavor and the owner is always behind the counter. Try the cowboy hotdog!"}
{"text":"Delicious gourmet hotdog. Extremely friendly service. I got the Colombian dog all three times I've gone and it's great. The french fries are some of the best I've had. Additionally it's one of the only places that you'll find alfajores de maicena for sale as a treat."}
{"text":"Visiting from FLORIDA,Read the YELP reviews, they were all right.  Best hot dog, so many varieties. Be sure you try the Leche shortbread cookies.  Wish we had a place like this in FL. Very courteous, professional staff.  Thank you."}
{"text":"My friend loves hotdogs so we tried this place out. It's kind of hidden, at least the parking lot is. It was pretty good :-)

I'm skeptical about vegetarian and vegan hotdogs so I decided to try out the vegetarian one since I was craving something lighter than beef. 

It tasted pretty darn close. My Colombian was delicious and I was glad I got it. I also ordered the chili cheese fries which they also have a vegetarian option but I stuck with the beef. 

Both my friends liked their hotdogs too, making us happy we chose this place for lunch:-)

Simon the owner was also very nice and polite. Interior decor pretty neat with booth seating that look like it came from a car:-)"}
{"text":"Well when it comes to VEGAN hot dogs I have really struggled to find ANY kind with at least a little flavor. Well people I am happy to report my search is OVER. Simon's has the best VEGAN hot dogs in Arizona and perhaps in the country. The wife and I went in on the night before they had there Grand Opening and met the owner Felipe who was extremely courteous and knowledgeable about his great product. They have several choices of hot dogs and Brats.....cooked on the grill & covered with a bounty of toppings of your choice. Now for your beef and veggie lovers they have hot dogs and brats for you to.....but since I am VEGAN this place is a GOD send for me.

I had the LOKA BRAT which comes with Spicy Mustard.....Mayo....Jalapenos.....and Sauerkraut. SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.......WOHOOOOO!!!!! I can't wait to try the other dogs and brats on the menu and I know the customer service will be top notch. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"O the vegan days and these scrumptious vegan dogs that you are not able to distinguish the difference between a real hotdog and a vegan dog."}
{"text":"What a great find while traveling. Thank you Yelp. Had the \"cowboy\" dog with cheese fries and a sweet local beer  All owners should be like this guy. Personable n the love shows in the product  Next time in Scottsdale a for sure stop"}
{"text":"I see why this has nearly 300 5-Star reviews. 

The food is delicious. Portions are generous, the food comes out quickly and hot. Best tostones we've ever had and some of he most delicious potato salad as well.

The staff is helpful without being overbearing. Answered all out questions and made the best suggestions when we couldn't decide.

I LOVED the plethora of vegan options-not just hot dogs but sides, sauces, cheeses, and even dessert! Everything is customizable to meet your dietary needs, making this a fantastic option for groups. This is basically my idea of heaven! 

Well definitely return the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Exceptional quality and pride in what is being served. Absolutely loved it! This is the kind of family business you want & love to give your money to, to support & for the delicious, creative, and tasty food!"}
{"text":"I loved this place in Oak Creek and am so happy they're in the valley now. Hot dogs and maicitos were delicious. You won't go wrong with anything here. Simon was awesome!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a weird Hot Dog??? It goes against everything that's right. I'm sorry but this place is not long for here or anywhere. And it's not cheap. Oh and it's not good."}
{"text":"Awesome that we have new business in Scottsdale that has great vegan options! I met the owner Felipe who was gracious and kind, he explained the menu options that are available on the menu. This location is perfect because they have a parking lot so no worries about looking for a meter or space. They offer a unique twist to the hot dog and because of the plant based options available I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first especially when I read the menu and saw what comes on the hot dog but it was awesome! I wish they had a location in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I have ever had. I got the Colombian and the salchipapas. I'm Colombian and this made me feel like I was back there. Great service too!!!
If you are in the area... Go!!!!"}
{"text":"Simon's was a pleasant surprise! Didn't know what to expect as we first walked in, but thought we'd trust fellow Yelpers on this one.  

Why go there: 
Sure enough, owner Felipe (from I gathered from the articles on the wall) greeted us, took our order and served us. He was great with all customers who were in the dining room, the place was fairly busy. The buns at this place is amazing, he mentioned it was locally baked just for them. We had a combo of hotdogs and the salchipapas, traditional Colombian street food. The fries were nothing short of amazing and very unique.

Don't miss:
The salchipapas for the price are a good snack. A full Columbia style hot dog is also a good go to here, pair it up with a Columbia soda.

Overall:
This place is affordable for being in Old Town. It's a small run operation, but delivers in flavor. A good place to swing by and get food to go if you'd like to walk around Old Town."}
{"text":"Hot dogs were pretty good, but the place was a bit dirty.  Maybe they got overwhelmed at lunch rush and never got a chance to clean up?  Tried Sonoran beef and Columbian chorizo -  huge bun, tons of topping, decent flavor.  Worth trying."}
{"text":"I was in here for lunch the other day to try their hot dogs.  I went with a beef Colombian which was topped with pineapple, mozzarella, their special sauce and finely crushed potato chips to give it some crunch.  It was pretty tasty and I wouldn't hesitate to have it again although some of the other styles of hot dogs looked interesting as well.

For an extra $2.99 you get fries and a soda with their combo deal.  I went with a beer instead and they offer a couple Oak Creek and Coronado Brewing beers which was a pleasant surprise.

The decor is pretty sterile and plain and when I was there it smelled strongly of cleaning solution which wasn't very appetizing."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat now.  I recently adopted a vegan lifestyle and there aren't many vegan-friendly restaurants near where I live.  I've come here twice now I've loved it each time.  The owner is so nice and friendly.  I recommend the Hola Amigo hot dog with the California Vegan hot dog option.  Both the fries and the vegan potato salad are DELICIOUS.  This is a great place to go when I am craving a hot dog!"}
{"text":"I cannot digest beef or pork so being able to eat hotdogs is very rare for me. When I do get a chance the hotdogs are not that good. This place is one of the two places that have flavor-able vegan hotdogs. The other place I've found is in California. This place def deserves five stars!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! My boyfriend is Colombian and I am vegetarian so it's perfect! We've come twice in two days. The owner is so sweet and is happy to make sure everyone is doing okay. I'm so happy we found this place, and we'll definitely be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"Simons is the best hot dog place in the Phoenix metro area. The staff is exceptionally nice and the food is out of this world!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go to Simon's when he was in Sedona and then again when he moved to Scottsdale. Delicious and unique hot dogs! I got the Colombian, which has pineapple and crushed chips...so good. The fries are also very good. I was happy to see that Simon (or whatever his real name is, haha) is still at the counter serving you himself."}
{"text":"Amazing!! We tried both vegan and non vegan options. All of them were great. They are so thoughtful when it comes to allergies or food preference and every dog can be made vegan. Even just one is very filling. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The employees were so courteous and their customer service was outstanding. As a vegan I loved all of the options! I got the vegan California hot dog with only ketchup. It was so delicious, definitely the best vegan dog I've ever had. The fries were great too, crispy and fresh. I will definitely be returning and trying the different combinations!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs...and a great variety for vegetarians and vegans too.  What is so great about this place is the pride the owners take in their food. My husband and I are not from Scottsdale and I ordered a dozen alfajores to take back to SF.  The sweet woman packed them so nicely for me so that they wouldn't crumble in transit. Well, the BEAUTIFUL and decadent Dulce de Leche filled cookies made it all the way to SFO without as much as a crack or crumble! Please try thus place! Have an order of patacones to start; then I recommend the Hola Amigo or Sonoran Cousin Hot Dog. You must end your meal with a buttery alfajores! When I'm back in Scottsdale...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find and the parking situation is a little different but it is worth it. This is the first place I have seen that offers gluten free buns that actually taste good! They also have vegan options and vegetarian options and the hot dogs are very good. I hope they get more traffic because they are a hidden secret. The owner was very friendly. I had a hot dog with sauerkraut and mustard."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for months to try this place, and it definitely did not disappoint! The fact that they can veganize any option is so incredible to me. The hot dog buns were so soft and delicious, and the Hola Amigo vegan dog was amazing. You can't really go wrong with avocado AND hummus. :) the French fries were to die for. So addicting! the owner was so friendly and made sure our experience was great. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and interesting selection of hot dogs. The only reason I rated 4 stars $5.95 and $6.95 a bit too much for a hot dog."}
{"text":"Waaaaaaay overpriced and they are crap for service!  I went in on my lunch break, waited for two employees to service one customer ordering one $6 hot dog.  

I ordered Jimmy Johns while in line and it was waiting for me at my office by the time I walked back!  Get it together hot dog place!!!!

There were two of you working.  One of you could have helped customers while the other fixed the computer."}
{"text":"I enjoyed how they gave a puzzle to my 9 year old and had a special soft booster chair for my 10 month old. I would return again."}
{"text":"The Vegan dog was good, the vegan chili cheese fries were STUPID good!! But the service is why I will return again and again and..."}
{"text":"Best $10 lunch i have found in south Scottsdale. I have had both the Columbian, and the Wunderhund. I would suggest them both and I intend to try the rest. Braut's are cooked perfectly, buns are steam puffed but not soggy, and the toppings are new combinations for me but I love the way they work together."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hidden gem! From customer service to food quality  this place is rockin it. I don't even care for hot dogs that much but I love everything I've tried here this far! So so good!"}
{"text":"This was such a delicious gourmet dog! The bun was so fresh and moist. The hot dog was extremely juicy and tasty. 

I got the Columbian dog and I will definitely come back to try the other interesting combos!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews from yelp while headed back to the airport. So glad I did! Every ingredient on the dog was perfect. I had the wunderhund. The bun was soft and fresh, dog was delicious and cooked just right, mustard relish.. amazing, and of course bacon! Best dog I've ever had. Staff was attentive and helpful. Now if only they'd open one in central Texas..."}
{"text":"Ok Hotdogs!  But the Best Hotdogs ever.  I had the Colombian and it was awesome.  Wish we had one in New Braunfels, TX!  If you have never tried it, you need too."}
{"text":"I have had pinks in Los Angeles before and this place is KILLING it. It's located in a plaza next to the Hyatt place and is adjacent to that club Paris. When you walk in there are booths and a fridge filled with fruit drinks and pop. You can also get a beer there as well, this would be the PERFECT late night spot for after when the clubs and bars close in old town but I don't think they are open that late. The Colombian woman who is the cashier is extremely nice and from Medellin which is cool and authentic, and the service is amazing here; but the star of this place is the food and in particular the Colombian hot dog. It's a hot dog with some kind of sauce, pineapple and crushed chips on top, and even if it doesn't sound appetizing to you I would highly recommend it because the flavor mix is unlike anything I have ever had and I have been to Colombia!! I think the secret is the chips on top because it gives a perfect crunch to the bun and hot dog. I will make sure to stop by here next time I am in town to get another Colombian dog."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I stumbled upon this little gem while doing my vegan restaurant hunting spree awhile back. I bookmarked it but put it on the back burner because hot dogs are not my all time favorite meal and I wanted to try others places first. Boy why did I wait so long to try this place out! First off it wasn't hard to find at all, it is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, but it is kind of hidden off on a back street (which I think is sad because so many people are missing out on it!) I unknowingly arrived less than 25 minutes before they closed, but it was a treacherous journey there so I decided to still go ahead and try it out. 

To my surprise I was walking into a Colombian inspired hot dog place! I didn't really know what to expect because I've never tried Colombian food before (a hot dog at that) so my expectations were unsure at the moment. I walked in thinking that I would get the death stare by the employees because I arrived just before closing lol, but I saw a party of 4 already eating inside so I had a slight sigh of relief. As I approached the front to order I glanced at the menu and a gentleman greeted me with the nicest smile and hello and with the cutest accent, l believe he might've been the owner. At that moment it gave me a good feeling about the atmosphere of the place. He shattered my judgement of being an antsy employee who just wanted to rush all of the customers out before closing. 

Fast forward, I already knew about the vegan options, so I ordered the Colombian style hot dog with vegan chili fries and added avocado (additional $0.75). The price is very reasonable and especially for the vegan option, you definitely get what you pay for! The size of the place is small, but cozy and has some cool car seat booths! In the background was Latino music playing (I'm assuming Colombian) so that kind of set the tone. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be ready, the same cashier delivered my food with once again, a smile on his face. To be honest I was kind of skeptical because of the toppings on the hot dog. It had pineapple, mozzarella cheese (vegan), crushed potato chips, and Simon sauce (some type of special sauce). 

Once I tried it.......Oh.My.Goodness! The sweet and savory thing is something that I have always loved and this took it to the next level! The toppings are such an odd combination that I (or most people at that) would never think about but I loved every single thing about it! The vegan hot dog itself was so flavorful, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between it and a regular dog! It was slightly spicy to add more flavor, which I did not mind at all. The vegan chili fries were also to die for, I think adding the avocado gave it a bit better flavor too. I usually never finish a whole meal at a restaurant but I finished every single thing on my plate! Myself and the party or 4 were still there even past closing time but the employees never made us feel rushed. I love the concept of this place because you have the best of both worlds; non vegans AND vegans can enjoy this place equally! Will definitely be coming back for my next cheat meal lol."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD!

Highly recommend the Colombian Hot dog and the Alfajor Dulce de Leche Cookies for dessert!

Found Simons Hot Dog on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try. From the outside it looked like it could be a dive, and I wasn't sure if I was in the mood to see if all the Yelp reviews were accurate, but I am so glad I did!

My husband and I both had the Colombian beef hot dog and my daughter had the plain Jane beef hot dog (she's 3). The Colombian hot dog was delicious! Perfect flavor blend, but not too strong. Also, you can tell it was crafted with care as each layer was perfectly and meticulously applied, and not just slopped on. The beef hot dogs themselves were tasty and good size. 

After finishing our hotdogs, we on a whim decided to try the Alfajor cookies for dessert. They were amazing! I could see stopping by just to get a few to-go. You could tell they were freshly made today too. A perfect sandwich of 2 delicious butter/shortbread cookies with dulce de leche in the middle. 

Service was amazing, and the restrooms were super clean!

Can't wait to come back to try more of their hot dogs! And of course get the cookies ;)"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! I am a life long hotdog fan. These dogs did not disappoint. I had the Hola Amigo with avocado, tahini, Simon sauce and banana peppers. Fantastic. Creamy and flavorful. My son had the dog with sauerkraut. Can't wait to try them all! The fries were good too! Plus, Simon is so warm and friendly. Really glad he moved down from Sedona to my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"They have vegan and vegetarian options along with regular hot dogs. I got the Colombian with a  California vegan hot dog, but they also have the Tofurky Italian dog as another veg option. It was so much better than expected and I will definitely be going back in the future. They are great at explaining their options, especially their vegan and vegetarian options and they even have vegan cheese."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian but I tried the vegan dogs on my last visit and I think they're as good, if not better, than the meat versions!  There's no reason to get the meat ones again, definitely sticking with the plant-based versions from now on.  Thanks for the good food!"}
{"text":"We used to hit up Simon's every time we visited Sedona. We loved it so much we would kill time and bum around just waiting for them to open at 4pm. My family and I could not be more excited that Simon's made its way to Phoenix. The Colombian (vegan) is always my go to! The service is always warm, welcoming and super friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"I got the Sonoran Cousin hotdog. It was delicious. Only complaint is that the hotdog was a bit pricey and really didn't fill me up I had to order fries which were also very good. Customer service was great."}
{"text":"We live in East Mesa and we love this place so much, we don't even mind the drive!  Between my husband and I, we have tried almost all the different hot dogs. The toppings are different than you probably make at home, but they are amazing! Oh, and the fries are awesome as well! The owners are personable and friendly! A must try!"}
{"text":"The vegan version tastes EXACTLY THE SAME as a traditional dog would taste!!! Needless to say, I'm a new regular!!"}
{"text":"My new lunch go-to! The owners are so sweet, and they have the best fries in town! I've only tried the cowboy, as this was my first time here, but I'm sold. They came around and greeted everyone by name, and made sure everything was made alright. Love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious hot dogs.  I have tried the vegan ones and the meat ones and they are both yummy!! I usually get a dog with patacones (green plantain, smushed, deep fried, and delicious), and love the sauces that come with it.  I have also tried the alfajores (butter cookies with dulce de leche in the middle) both vegan and regular, which I usually get the 3 for $5 because it is a good deal and I always want more than one cookie (it is hard to share, so get your own :P).  I have tried the Paisita hot dog, which is a meal in itself, and the Colombian.  I have never ever been disappointed with their food.  The service is great!  They are friendly an attentive.  The only thing, which is not a bad thing, is that you might need to wait for your meal, especially during busy times, but you know that good things take time, so be patient and you'll be handsomely rewarded with a delicious meal!  You won't be disappointed.  ;)"}
{"text":"So happy Simon's has moved to Scottsdale! This was one of our favorite places to go in Sedona and now when we are craving a hot dog we can get one here in the valley. 

I've only had the Columbian because once you try it, you will highly doubt any other dog can compete. The beef hot dog, with the sauce, and the pineapple (yes) and potato chips (yes!) somehow make the best flavor combination. I guess it's that salty/sweet magic happening. And it doesn't hurt that the bun is the freshest, softest bun ever. Seriously I want to use it as a pillow it's so fluffy soft.

We've already been twice since they opened. My waistline may hate me for visiting regularly, but my tastebuds overrule on this decision."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome food! Out of the ordinary menu with outstanding flavor! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is small joint but great for vegetarians like me as they've excellent vegetarian patty and hot dogs! They don't leave the vegetarians out as most places do."}
{"text":"This is one of the best hot dog restaurants in town.  Simon and his family have a wide range of dogs, and other sandwiches too. We had the Columbian dog, chorizo, pineapple and crushed chips, great sauce and fresh bun. Also the meatball sandwich and a couple of beers.  Great people and food!!"}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs. Colombian style. The only downfall is the wait, but well worth it! Try this place!"}
{"text":"So glad I got the chance to try this place yesterday. We were in the area and wanted something quick and tasty so I remembered Simon's and we drove over here. It's a cozy restaurant and I immediately noticed how chill it was. 

There were only two people ordering ahead of us which gave us some time to peruse their menu. Though small, there is variety and vegan dogs, the sole reason I wanted to come here. The folks at the counter were super welcoming and friendly and even called us by name, which I felt was superb customer service. I ordered the traditional Colombian and added jalapeños for a kick. I had a choice of the California vegan dog or a tofurkey vegan dog and I chose the former. I made it into a combo for $3 more and got fries and a drink.

We forgot to tell them our order was to go, but they were great about changing how they packaged our orders so that we could take them with us. Once we got back to our destination and dived into our dogs, we all agreed that they were delicious and the fries were good as well. I loved their soft bun and the mix of sweet and savory with the hot dog, pineapples, Simon sauce, mozzarella cheese, jalapeños and crushed chips. Others tried the Hola Amigo and enjoyed that as well.

Love to support a small business, especially one run by such dedicated people. I will be back to try additional menu items like the Hola Amigo and the sides like chili cheese fries and salchipapas."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, because of the stellar Yelp reviews. Thank you Yelp, you didn't disappoint! 

I had the hot dog with pineapple, mozzarella, special sauce, and crushed potato chips. Sounds like it could be hit or miss meal, but it was a hit! Great hot dog! Great find. I will be back."}
{"text":"Such an amazing find! We were at The Drip Room looking for a place to eat lunch & the receptionist recommended Simons!!! So good. I got the Sonoran and my husband got the one with pineapple (forgot the name) both were wonderful and the fries were amazing as well! We will definitely be back next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food. As a vegetarian I enjoyed it, they really gave a lot of thinking for their vegetarian dishes and have vegan options too. 

It's a great place foe vegetarians who still crave meat, and are looking for that taste and texture. Im less in that school, so I wasn't amazed by it."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic place! Also has vegan options! Been here 3 times and it never disappoints. Also try out the original Columbian hot dog and add jalapeños (if you love a little kick). I don't believe in pineapples on pizza because I HATE IT but I Love pineapples on hotdogs......... add jalapeños to that and it's the best hot dog ever!"}
{"text":"Best hot dog I ever had...for real-zies! The bun was a real masterpiece in and of itself. Real soft and sturdy enough to hold all the toppings easily without leaking thru. Tasted very fresh and looked like a mini loaf of bread, not a typical bun.

Tried the Columbian less the cheese today. It was phenomenal (thank goodness for spell check) and had a perfect balance of sweet, salty and texture. I got the beef hot dog but they have a vegan and pork sausage to choose from as well. Best actual hot dog flavor I ever experienced. Not overly seasoned or a weird tough casing...it was just pure hot dog paradise!

Next time I'll get some fries, they look great! (I actually wasn't hungry but was driving past and this has been on my bookmarks forever)"}
{"text":"Me (vegetarian) and my sister (meat eater) came for the first time and split a veggie Columbian and veggie bratwurst loka- both so delicious! We both agreed the Columbian topped the bratwurst but they were both really good. After we finished (and were stuffed) they brought us a sample of the Columbian cookie- also a hit! So if you're thinking $6-7 for a hotdog isn't worth it- give it a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"These were the best hot dogs I've ever had! The French fries and cookies were also really great. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My bf and I were in the mood for a hotdog on Memorial Day and decided to give Simon's a try. The food was exactly as described, full of flavor, and delicious. Portions were appropriate and the combo is a steal. I had the vegetarian hot dog and it tasted 100% like the real deal. Also, I think this is a family owned business.  Every employee we interacted with was polite,super friendly, and accommodating. We will return! FYI vegan options are available too!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to check out Simon's. Wow! Everything was amazing. So thankful they have vegan alternatives for almost everything they sell. Went with non-vegan friends who also loved it just as much. Very friendly and helpful staff, a must try."}
{"text":"This is a tasty place.  The Colombian hot dog is so delicious.  It sound crazy but your mouth will exploded with happiness.  They also offer vegan options."}
{"text":"Highly reccomend Simons.  Not only are the dogs great, but Simon himself is so involved and has great interaction with his guests."}
{"text":"Colombian hot dog I missed you!
I visit Phoenix once a month for a few days and always looking for good meals. This month I stayed in Scottsdale and thank god for this place being just next door. First time I've seen a Colombian hot dog since I moved away from Florida. Everything was perfect!!!! Looking forward to my next trip. Thanks Felipe!"}
{"text":"Really good vegan food. We had the Cowboy and Columbian hot dog, it was delicious! I'm vegan and never imagined how good a vegan dog could be. The burgers were tasty too. The owner came to check on us, and was really friendly. You have to try it"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I had the Wunderhund with the California vegan hot dog and vegan toppings with a side of fries. It was all so good that if I wasn't so full I would have ordered another one. Everything from the bun, to the hot dog, to the toppings and the batter they use on the fries was delicious. Not only was the food incredible but the staff were so friendly and welcoming. They even came outside and asked if I was enjoying everything while I was still eating (which I wasn't expecting from a hot dog place). Prices are perfect. I will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Tried the brat and the Colombian hot dog. Well worth it. Friendly atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs ! Just like in colombia:) had the colombian and the hola amigo. Definitely, i will return to try the other ones."}
{"text":"Attended the Grand Opening today and was once again blown away by all the delicious vegan options. The family is so sweet and the food and drink are perfection. SO glad I don't have to drive to Sedona anymore to enjoy Simon's!"}
{"text":"Slow as Hades and couldn't get our orders right.  Once we got past that the food was good.  We ordered the Cowboy (beef hot dog with beef chili) and it was scrumptious.  Not so much on the Hola Amigo. The buns are perfection, and the fries are really good.   Not sure I'd comeback, but maybe."}
{"text":"We are on a business trip and my wife is a vegan. Seriously, this place has it all and they get it! It's not one of those places where they have vegan options but assume there is no meat then it's vegan. 

Colombian hot dog, wife got the cowboy, we got the ceviche and madurito for appetizer. Yummmmm great food!"}
{"text":"Vegan Hot dog and Vegan ceviche was delicious. 
Estillo Colombiano of course! Thanks to the Simon's Hot dogs fam!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only time I eat hot dogs is when I'm at a BBQ, and I'm starving, and I just want the meat that takes like, 2-3 minutes to grill while waiting for the good stuff that takes longer. It's not that I don't like hot dogs, I just don't prefer them.

Anyway, came here with a couple friends who wanted to try this place and I really liked it! The  thing that really impressed me was that the hot dogs (and buns) themselves were really good! With all the weird combinations of stuff they put on them I was expecting some sort of middle of the road boiled hot dog. They aren't. They're really good. 

As far as \"weird stuff\" goes I got the Hola Amiga, which has creamy avocado, hummus (there was an option for cream cheese instead) and jalapeno. It was delicious. All of it. The toppings. The hot dog. The bun. The other two people I ate w/had the Colombian and they liked what they had as well. 

We also split the macitas, which is basically a cheesy corn dip. Like the hot dogs, it sounds weird but it's yummy. Of course we had fries, and it almost felt strange to eat something so \"basic\" (and honestly they weren't anything special, but they tasted just fine).

Not sure if the guy working the counter was the owner, but he was very friendly and explained things on the menu. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at. There's no real decor & it's pretty sterile. Doesn't matter though. This place is all about the delicious, weird hot dogs."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I had the most delicious vegan meatball sandwish and my boyfriend had a vegan hotdog (Tokyo) which also was super delicious. Such wonderful staff too! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I like their Columbian Veggie hotdog. I really appreciate that a hot dog place has vegetarian options! Good service!"}
{"text":"BOMB vegan hot dogs!! Tons of options and they are decked out with good stuff. Haven't had a good hot dog since going vegan and this did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Are you looking for an absolutely awesome hot dog and the world's best French fries? Look no further.  This place can accomodate you.  If your vegan or a carnivore, Simon's got you covered. I'm a vegan and love the choices i get here! This pic is of a vegan meat ball sandwich and fries. SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I work near by so I pop in for lunch pretty regularly. I have to admit, when I first read the menu I thought a hot dog with Pineapple and potato chip crumbs sounded so strange but it is DELICIOUS! Everything I've tried is amazing actually. Every time I come in I'm welcomed by name which just feels nice. Customer Service is on point, good food, good location-- I highly recommend It!!"}
{"text":"As a vegan I struggle to find options for food. But the vegan dog is great and tasty.   I will be back often to enjoy the different types of styles they have! Cute and quaint place in heart of old town."}
{"text":"Extremely happy to see they finally have a location in Scottsdale.  I've been to their location in Sedona and loved the hot dogs.  Now that they are local I will visiting them more often!

The only complaint I have is the location, it is kind of hidden so they didn't have a lot of business during lunch.  I hope their dinner crowd is better so they can possibly expand to a bigger location or come to Tempe. 

I recommend the Columbian beef hot dog, it is very tasty!  The sauces, crushed potato chips, pineapple, and hotdog make for a flavor explosion on your taste buds!

I haven't tried any of the other hot dogs yet but my co workers all got something different and they were very happy with their choice.  I think next time I will try the Sonoran Cousin or Wunderhund"}
{"text":"All i have to say is wow!!! Mac and cheese AMAZING, chili cheese fries yes double size please, potatoe salad fresh and home made!! Cookies left taste buds feeling good!! O ya and the hot dogs haha everything was so yummy. I will definitely return. The customer service was above and beyond!! I wish i got his name. Young kid so polite and helpful. He made my first time so pleasant. Food was fast place is clean.  Cant wait for my next visit to try and different dog"}
{"text":"As everyone else has stated, this place is absolutely amazing!  I'm a vegan and I love the various options.  They even have yummy vegan cookies for dessert.  The prices are pretty standard and the food is absolutely delicious!  The owner is incredibly personable and truly seems to love what he does.  He chats with customers and checks on how you're doing.  Truly a five star place!"}
{"text":"When you hear about a place with hot dogs you think, \"Meh. Not that exciting.\" Especially when you're a vegan.  But you won't just find boring hot dogs with ketchup and mustard.  So many different toppings that taste delicious.  And 99% of their offerings are vegan...or can be made vegan.  To top it off everyone was so pleasant and welcoming.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"like i am not gonna lie, i am from chicago and thus i am, by blood and culture, a world-renown hot dog expert and enthusiast 

that being said, i used to live at san marin right across the street and this joint is flame. gotta get that colombian dog with the crushed chips with some peppers on top. its very close to the perfect dog. (obviously it is not a chicago dog tho) 

the flavor profile hits you from all angles. got that creaminess from the cheese, sweetness from the pineapple, salty crunch for the chips, meaty savoriness from the dog, and great buns to soak that whole taste mixture up.

also, you can tell these are good hot dogs from the bite the casing gives. dayum, i gotta go back today. writing this review is making me salivate. 

also, they have some really cool colombian sodas that i was feeling. try it!

my one qualm is that this place closes at 8. after many nights out in old town, a hot dog would have been the perfect late night snack. so sad :(

i think you should stay open till at least 2am, simon

besides that you are perfect"}
{"text":"Even if the food was bad, you would still love Simon's hotdogs because the owner cares and delivers outstanding service! Luckily, the food is amazing! I am not a vegetarian but I order the vegetarian hotdogs because it is that good. The restaurant is a small hole in the wall with reasonable pricing and unique and tasty food. Do yourself a favor and try them out... You will not be disappointed and you will help support our unique gem in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Looking for lunch options in Scottsdale? Head over to @simonshotdogs new location from Sedona finally in the middle of the valley. Known for its wonderful original Columbian style hot dogs also has other style like Mexican \"Sonoran\" which I still need to try!

{"text":"Omg. I had the paisita hot dog with a California  vegan dog. The pineapple sauce was unreal. Literally mouth watering. My bf and I also split the vegan burger. It was the most crispy vegan burger I've ever had. This place is SCRUMPTIOUS. I also had fries. My mouth is still watering thinking about it."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the the Colombian dog. As a vegetarian, I was really happy to see that they offer vegetarian and vegan versions of every hot dog. The owner is very kind too. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here after hearing multiple amazing reviews from my friends. I was very pleased with the friendly service and the huge variety of yummy food for vegans. I got the hot dog with crushed potato chips and cole slaw on top along with a side of chili cheese fries and they were both phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and even better customer service. The owner is top notch, and will make you feel welcomed in every visit."}
{"text":"Excellent dog! 

First time trying a Colombian hot dog and this one didn't disappoint! The bread was excellent. A pillowy cloud of carbs. The beef hot dog inside was just as good but the star was the mix of sauce, pineapples, chips, cheese and jalapenos. A great combo of sweet and spicy and the potato chips add great crunch. For 5.95 a pretty great deal too for the size and heft of the dog.

Everyone was super friendly inside from the staff to the customers.

Glad I stopped by and this hit the spot perfectly. Thanks Simon!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I was intrigued by the Vegan menu and had to give it a try. The food was really good and so was the service."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to try one of Simon's vegan hotdogs at the Scottsdale Vegfest.  I've been vegan for a year and this was my first vegan hotdog.  It was better than a meat hot dog!  Meat hotdogs are so greasy, but the vegan hotdog was so yummy.  No greasiness, no cruelty, and absolutely delicious.  I tried the Colombian and the Wunderhund hotdog, both with the vegan California dog.  Both were excellent, however I think I favor the Colombian!  Overall, great food and reasonable pricing.  I'll be stopping here when I'm in Phoenix for work.  Wish we had Simon's up in Northern Arizona!"}
{"text":"Yes, everything you've heard about the vegan dogs at this place is true! Was not disappointed. Friendly service and fair prices."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised and loved our food. We had the Colombian and Napolitano. Looking forward to going back and trying more of there menu."}
{"text":"We really liked the multiple vegan hot dog options!

Had the Hola Amigo, fricken delish!

Had the Wunderhund, really good!
I don't usually do pickles and mustard but had to try this one and it didn't disappoint.

Had the Sonoran Cousin, another one I'll be back for! Loved it!

I'll be back for sure to try some of the other vegan hot dog combos and looking forward to trying the home made veggie burger.

Super friendly owner who cares about his customers and the food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some hot dogs before the game starts and here we are!! Started in Sedona and now in Scottsdale!! Their menu is simple and fresh!! Started with vegan ceviche with tofu and delish!! Then had their Columbian hot dog and totally hit the spot!! Perfectly made beef hot dog and amazing topping!! Also tried the German loca which was really good as well!! Great place if you are vegan or love hot dogs!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this hot dog spot out after a long bike ride along the canal. I chose the vegan dog Columbian style and my boyfriend chose the Paisita. We bought two different ones intending to share and get a taste of the menu, as this was our first time there. I thought the Columbian dog was okay, but the Paisita really had depth of flavor, was satisfying, and super tasty. My boyfriend said he liked the Columbian best, my recommendation is to read the ingredients and go with which one sounds the most tasty to you! Next time I'm here I'll probably just get the Paisita, though I want to try the Wunderhund,
Sonoran cousin, and Mushroom dogs next time. We also split  vegan chili cheese fries which were yummy and a couple of their desert cookies, which were also good. They earn 4 stars from me because they are clean, offer very friendly service, and I like that the menu keeps you curiously wanting to try more."}
{"text":"The Colombian in me loves this place with all my heart! I was there for the Colombian Independence day specials and introduced my husband to them. I ordered the bandeja paisa (with beef) dog and enjoyed it tremendously. The patacones were awesome and it was a great way to get a taste of my birth country!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, SO good!! I went here on a whim wanting something on the cheaper end of things. The owner happened to be the one who helped me (or at least that's the impression I got) and he was incredibly friendly and helpful. I ordered the Hola Amigo, and every bite was true bliss!

My only suggestion would be either better buns or make a selection of buns. The ones they have are those fluffy wonder-bread style ones that you can squeeze into a marble-sized ball.

Nonetheless, the toppings were delightful, the dog was high quality and perfectly cooked, the fries were delicious, and the owner even chatted with me a bit during my meal and was very friendly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here is always so helpful and welcoming, food always comes out hot and prepared beautifully and everything on the menu is absolutely delicious! Favorite place to go for vegan food!!!"}
{"text":"Yea, I know five stars for a hot dog joint but Simon's does it so well. Awesome All Beef hot dogs or Veggie, Vegan dogs if that's your thing. Which is so for my wife who is a vegetarian. Casual decorated hot dog stand. With outdoor seating available. I got the Colombian zig and the Tokyo Madness. Like I said terrific sized all beef hot dogs. Excellent toppings that allows you to get out of your comfort zone of yellow mustard and relish. What sets these apart are the bakery made buns that hold the delicious dogs and wonderful toppings. My wife had the Hola Amigo veggie dog. Large sized and nicely spice veggie dog. She loved it! We met the owners and they were super nice. Explained how they had the restaurant in Sedona but have moved it now to Scottsdale. Boy, are we happy about that! He brought us out some samples of the veggie chili, veggie ceviche and wunderhund sauce. So nice of him. We wish it was tomorrow already so we could go back!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we go to Simon's it is never a disappointment! The hotdogs are phenomenal and as the menu has grown the food had only gotten better. The owner and staff are always friendly, and I always want to come back. I miss being close to the area but I drive HALF AND HOUR just to come. It's worth your time if you have a hankering for a hot dog."}
{"text":"We had the Columbia vegan hotdog and Columbia Vegan hamburger. Wow full of flavor from pineapple to little pieces of potato chips it was amazing! The Vegan burger tasted like a regular burger but better the patty looked like one too. My husband went the next day to have it again since I was on a business trip for a few days and we are originally from Tucson which is a 2 hour drive. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars for those two particular items. We also loved their fries. We tried their Mac n cheese wasn't a fan. The cheese had a slight hue of green. Making the appearance seem unappetizing. It was ok but I wouldn't get it again. I really liked the vegan Columbia cookies I would get those again!"}
{"text":"Am thankful for another vegan option.  Super good!!!! Had the Herman loka and was amazing. Best around for vegan hotdog option (and only, but is delish!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Colombian hotdogs!! Everything was fresh and tasteful. They also carry Colombian sodas and fresh juices. Awesome service as well."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs ever. I will surely be back plenty in the future! The gentlemen who was at the counter was very helpful and told us which were the favorites."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food here! I ate the Colombian Hot Dog and Salchipapas. Although the hot dog had a bunch of unconventional ingredients (like pineapple & potato chips) the textures and flavors mixed together surprisingly well! The owner was also very friendly and I had a great time talking about our mutual love for Salchipapas (I'm Ecuadorian so this is a popular snack in Ecuador too). If you're in town, I'd definitely recommend trying what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Stopped by Simons today based on the stellar yelp reviews. I also was thrilled to learn they had vegetarian options. My fiancé and I both had the Colombian Hot dog he had beef I had veggie. They were amazing! I got the combo with fries in a drink (you should too because the fries were fab)! I would definitely recommend - can't wait to go back and try another option!!"}
{"text":"The vegan hot dogs weren't bad and you can tell it's a mom and pop type shop. The owner takes pride in it. My girlfriend and I got the vegetation coyboy dogs and they were a hearty cheap delicious vegan meal"}
{"text":"Great food...the vegan dogs are good and I am not a Vegan!  The brats and regular dogs are fantastic!  The service is awesome as well..."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are so so tasty, the fried plantains with cheese was my favorite, you don't get that option very often,  I get to try the vegan ceviche as well, it is so good... I loved the environment, the staff is professional and friendly, great place, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Simon's is a gem for vegans and vegetarians, but also for regular go lucky hot dog lovers as well. When reviewing the menu, I wanted everything so I ended up ordering three hot dogs.

My first dog was the Tokyo Madness - complete with wasabi mayo and seeweed with a beef dog; it was definitely my favorite; the flavors meshed together and I love that they were on a hot dog- who knew?!

I then tried their signature dog, the Colombian, which has pineapples and crushed potato chips. I was a little skeptical but complete with the pork dog, it worked surprising well in combination.

Finally I ordered a California dog with mushrooms and cheese. After having the more decadent dogs, this one didn't shine as brightly as the others, but was still a great mix of flavors and approach to a vegan dog. I've never tried a vegan hot dog before, the consistency was closer to something like a garden burger? (I have no benchmark for this one!)

I actually did have a bite of my vegan friend's vegan burger and that was one of the best non-meat burgers I've had. It reminded me of a Big Mac! I'd go back and reorder it with a few of the hot dogs as well. 

The coolest thing about Simon's? The owner/chef is not even vegan but she creates vegan options for the vegan community. That deserves so much respect in itself but she also does it with such gusto that I tap my hat off to her. Now I see why Simon's is so awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food.  I had the vegetarian cowboy with fries.  I really liked the taste. Their ketchup sauce was fresh and delicious too. It's a nice place and I recommend it specially for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Good quality of food, but after waiting 45 minutes for a hot dog and experience poor customer service, I wouldnt recommend this place. It's a good spot for dinner or when you don't mind waiting"}
{"text":"The ever popular Simon's Hot Dogs, originally located in Sedona, has finally relocated and opened in Scottsdale, AZ. The location may have changed, but the hot dogs that we love remain delicious. 

They still offer vegan and vegetarian hot dog options. Don't worry carnivores, they have hot dogs for you too. I got the Colombian, vegan style, which is a vegan hot dog topped with pineapples, crushed potato chips, Simon's sauce, and vegan shredded cheese (the latter of which I omitted). The combination may sound strange but once you've tried it you'll be a fan! The buns are different (I think they had to change hot dog bun vendors after the relocation), but they're still good, just not as soft as the original buns. 

The menu has expanded too. Vegan ceviche and vegan salcipapas will be offered! (Note that some things may not be available during the soft opening.) They offer a combo; you can add crispy french fries and a drink for just $3 more. 

Prices remain reasonable and the owners are complete sweethearts. You'll feel like family here.  

The new location is nestled in Old Town Scottsdale, next door to the Hyatt Place hotel. As of Thursday, 03Dec, they are in a soft opening status from 11am-8pm, everyday except Sunday (although they will close at 5pm on Friday, 04Dec, for a special event), as they train their staff. The grand opening will be Saturday, 12Dec, starting at 11am."}
{"text":"The chorizo sausage is very good. The sauce is a little too sweet for me though. The chilli cheese fries are the bomb"}
{"text":"Such an awesome little spot! The hot dog combinations are super unique, and the actual hot dogs themselves are tasty and high quality. We got a Colombian and a Tokyo... both completely different but both delicious! I can definitely see us coming back for many lunches in the future."}
{"text":"Super friendly owner, he suggested the Cowboy dog and he was right, it's delicious. It was super clean and reasonably priced for Old Town Scottsdale. I will be back."}
{"text":"My bestie has been craving some delicious hot dogs, so one day I decided to come here to pick her up some deliciousness to make her day a little brighter. WOW WOW WOW...who knew hot dogs could taste so good. My husband ordered the Columbian and he ate it so fast that I did not know if he even chewed it. I had the Sonoran and I was so impressed. Erica had the Wunderhund and almost licked the plate. 
I am from South America and was very impressed they had Salchi Papas and Alfajores. I am definitely coming back here to taste a little bit of my home town dishes. 
Gracias Simons!"}
{"text":"The Colombian hot dog and burger are simply mouthwatering. The only burgers I enjoy eating are from In-N-Out, but after trying the Colombian one here I now have another burger spot to put into my rotation! The place is very clean and Felipe is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This was one of my two favorite gourmet veggie dogs when it was located in Sedona. They have now moved to my home city so I'm excited to be able to get it all the time. Simon's offers tasty dogs with very flavorful and interesting toppings. It's worth a try if you're in the area. It's an extra bonus that the owner is such a nice guy."}
{"text":"The columbian hot dog is the only way to go! Yes, I have tried other hot dogs but this is the one I always come back to. They also have wonderful Columbian style appetizers and desserts. Make sure to stop by and try everything!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place!! So so good! I had the Italian tofurkey burger and it was amazing. The wait was long but definitely worth it. Will be coming back for sure to this place!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this since they opened and finally got there yesterday. I don't eat meat, so of course I went veggie. The Colombian with pineapples, cheese, jalapeños and yes, crushed potato chips was outrageous. Now I have to work my way through the rest of the menu. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly owner. We arrived with our luggage in an uber and were greeted nicely by the owner. As a someone who is on a plant-based diet I was very impressed with their options. An out of towner but would come back if I was ever in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs. They were out of the Colombian version when I was there and so that's why I'm only affording 4 stars. Other then that the food was delectable.  

The fries are also amazing."}
{"text":"I first tried them at the AZ vegetarian fest (I think it was January). I got the CA vegan, Colombian. It was awesome! I finally got to go to their actual location today and it was amazing! Service was great! Food was amazing and a good price. I'm hoping to go back and try the different style of hot dog toppings soon. I know there's a Tokyo and Sonoran one plus more. If you're vegan, I would definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Yum!! We came here after reading other good reviews, and it did not disappoint. I had a veggie Hola Amigo (avocado, cream cheese, special sauce and jalapeños) and a beef Cowboy (their version of a chili cheese dog) and they were supreme. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Best hotdog I have had in a long time! The first time I went there I got the columbian and it was a perfect combination of tastes. The fries are amazing too. My boyfriend has tried several of the dogs on the menu but always comes back to the columbian. It is surely the best in his opinion. The 2nd time I went to Simon's I was not super hungry and just ordered a plain hotdog with ketchup and mustard. The bun alone is just amazing. I am getting hungry thinking about it. The quality of the hotdog meat is very obviously good quality. I love this addition to old town scottsdale!"}
{"text":"In looking for something different to try my wife suggested we stop at Simon's Hot Dogs for dinner. We were greeted by the friendly staff and we asked for some suggestions on what to try. Everything sounded so good we went a little overboard on the order...lol

Here's what we had:
-Colombian (beef dog)
-Hola Amigo (beef dog)
-Cowboy (beef dog)
-Salchipapas
-Maicitos
-Patacones w/chorizo

Everything we had was delicious! The toppings on the dogs worked well together with the dog and soft roll. The salchipapas and patacones were very tasty with the sausage and sauce. The maicitos were OMG!

We ended up leaving over-stuffed and satisfied. 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start out with I hate hotdogs and I am vegetarian. This place has off the wall crazy delicious dogs. My boyfriend had The Columbian and it had beef and pineapples and potato chip crumbs and he was in love with it!!! I had the Wonder Dog with a California Dog and it was really hard to understand that the hotdog wasn't really meat. It tasted soooo good, the buns were so soft and perfect and both of our toppings, mine being dill pickles, onions, mustard, poblano peppers all in a homemade relish, were perfect. I didn't know how close this place was to my work so they definitely have a constant face to see, but i'm definitely writing this review for any Vegans/Vegetarians in the area, it's hard to find good food made with love especially if your friends want to eat meat as well, but I promise you this place is the place. pluuuuuuuuusssss it's cheap, you better be reading this review in the restaurant or else you're really missing out."}
{"text":"What a little gem - wonderful food and really wonderful human beings running the place and working here. Many GREAT vegan options!"}
{"text":"You know that place where the owner is always onsite, smiling, gracious, and welcoming? They are far and few between.  This is one of those places where you love making the exchange of money for quality food.

People who frequent and work and live near Old Town Scottsdale already know this gem of a place. That's how I landed here for lunch. It is now, after a single visit, on my places to frequent.

 If you appreciate a good hotdog, plan a visit. Try the Colombian dog and include the marvelous fries if you choose. Say hello to the owner, Simon, while you are there, and experience true hospitality."}
{"text":"Average, at best. No idea why all the great reviews. Owner was very friendly but place is a bit shabby and the dogs were nothing outstanding. Menu offers some intriguing options but when served up flavors don't match what you imagined them to be."}
{"text":"I love Simon's Hot Dogs!  It is a nice atmosphere and the owner and staff are super friendly!  Has a nice small business feel that makes me want to support them!  Vegan options are EXCELLENT!  There are several vegan options and they are really great!  May be difficult for the gluten free people though.  I know a few gluten free vegans who prefer other dining options."}
{"text":"Vegan dog is amazing and delicious. Simons never disappoints. My go to is the Colombian.
I recommend trying the California vegan dog if you are a vegetarian/vegan. The taste is very true to the original."}
