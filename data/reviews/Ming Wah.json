{"text":"Ming Wah the well known place to go have buffet style Chinese food in St-Jerome. This place is huge and has Plenty of seating, in three different sections.    The decor is new and has Asian flair and pictures.  There are many waitstaff people ready to replenish the foods, and remove the discarded food and plates off your table, and bring you water or drinks. My waiter was attentive .  There are so many foods in the buffet to choose from.  Many different varieties of foods to choose from like Canadian, Chinese, Szechuan , sea food bar, sushi, salads, and dessert bar.  Great for groups Everyone should find something.    Tsingtao Beer and Sake, to Beer on tap and bottled, variety of Wine, Pretty colourful Polynesian cocktails, full bar with Whiskeys and Cognac to enhance your experience.    My Favs were the Won Ton soup, Sushi,  Beef and broccoli  , the Shrimp brochettes were skewered and you can reheat on a grill was great and makes a fun station.  The Ice Cream too with flavours like Neapolitan , Blue Bubblegum, vanilla, chocolate, orange, mint chocolate chip, Green Tea fresh because the turnover is huge here and sauces, cookies to top it off with.  There are a few good dishes here, and others not worth eating, so I suggest putting small amounts on your plate and trying before filling your plate up.  There's are days when the buffet is cheaper and early bird and late owl can save you cash so call ahead.  Bring Cash or Credit card, they do not take Interac cards."}
{"text":"We were well received by the Hostess and quickly seated. It is a large dining hall with the complete buffet in the center. The Popcorn Shrimp, the Wonton Soup, and the grilled shrimp were my favourites. There is Roast Beef, Sushi and a long counter with a good choice of salades and an array of desserts. Everything I tasted was great and we were well tended to by our assigned waiter. I highly reccomend this restaurent......"}
{"text":"I went here before but It was a few years ago, they renovated ( don't know when ) and it looks nice. Went for dinner and it has pretty much the same as \"usual\", I know that they do breakfast to but never went. I was kinda impressed, so all you can eat restaurants they make in big quantities and they taste so so, but here? The \"Wong Tong\" soup is so much better, they have like 5-6 types of sushi's ( not a lot ) but they are soooo good.   They have a few / lot of things that are fried, tip: don't eat to much because it makes you \"sick\" after a while ( personnel experience ) I tried to eat not a lot but a little bit of everything.   What they offer: -fried food  -more \"Asian\" type of food, noodles and soups -soups  -quite a few dessert types  -salads / fruit bar  -rice and medium \"breakfast potatoes\"  And a whole lot more.  Didn't take the best pictures, but at least you will have an idea how it looks like.   I gave it 3 stars because it's a good restaurant, it just not a restaurant that I was \"visually\" impressed by. The food was amazing so 3/5 stars.  My experience was great, just didn't based my review on my servers \"humour\" because she looked \"annoyed / tired of working their\" kinda face: but she did her job well. Gave us lots of water, took our dishes when we were done, yeah nice.  Really recommend this place! I will certainly go more often and try the breakfast menu to next tim!"}
{"text":"I kind of like this place nothing really bad to say about its not amazing but for a buffet it's good. Worth it if you feel like pigging out . I don't like there sushi but  they have good muscles and shrimp . The chicken wings have good flavour also."}
