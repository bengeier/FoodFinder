{"text":"Vicky's diner is a hidden gem you definitely get everything that you see in the pictures that are posted to the yelp site. The breakfast food was definitely what we expected and needed although the orange shoes was not fresh squeezed it help with my hangover that I was having at the time. I will definitely frequent this location when I come back to Vegas the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Well we came here years ago and it was a typical diner so we decided to try it again since they had a mini make over. It was horrible. The iced tea was disgusting, I can't even explain the taste. I can't believe the way that they have this place set up. Bacon once cooked it tossed between 2 white towels, toast sat on plates for 10 minutes or not even under a warmer. Complete disorganization, serves running circles around each other. Way to expensive for the quality of the food. We both had pancakes, no taste and rubber like. They serve it with a buttery spread not even real butter. The hash browns lacked seasoning. Will never go back. Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"They charged my card extra. Assuming the waiter wrote in another 20 on the tip. Now they won't answer phones to refund the extra taken out."}
{"text":"This is a great little classic old time American Diner. A great place for bacon and eggs. The food is good and you cannot go wrong. It is always best to order the bacon traditional or as i say \"greasy\", they are health conscious and dry the bacon off as some restaurants do. To get a full flavor order it \"greasy\" it is best to dry it off yourself if it needs to be dried off at all. After all why ruin a perfectly good piece of bacon by trying to make it healthy. Just enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Small dinner tucked into a strip.   Food was plentiful and we shared a corned beef hash breakfast.   Price is reasonable and restaurant was easy to locate.   Food good for price."}
{"text":"No idea how anyone gave this place a good rating. Yes it's clean. Food was terrible. Pancakes were bland. Ham and cheese omelette was terrible. As bad as the food is the service is the worst part of the experience. Had we not prompted the waitress multiple times about coffee or missing food items I doubt she would of gotten them. Advice..go elsewhere."}
{"text":"John makes Vickie's Diner. He greets you with a huge smile as he cooks your meal. The girls were very attentive in taking your order and making sure we had everything we needed. Pancakes were huge! Tiffany burger was delicious. Price was even better after paying for meals in the casinos!"}
{"text":"My friend and I love eating at breakfast places such as Denny's or iHop, but they're not the best. I love cute diners w/ a 24/7 breakfast menu. My friend and I were at Circus Circus and I looked on Yelp for the nearest diner. I found that Vickie's Diner had great reviews. At first we couldn't find it and it was in a sketchy area. Then we turned the corner and there it was!  We went inside and the decor was like a diner you see in the movies. I loved it!  I ordered a cheeseburger deluxe and the breakfast special. All I have to say is... it was delicious.   The service was fast and friendly.  They're open 24/7 and it truly is a hidden gem of Vegas.   Try it out! :-)"}
{"text":"Nice diner decore. Food is cheap and tastes pretty good, like what you would expect for a diner. They only had two waiters working and the service was not perhaps the fastest one."}
{"text":"Ambiance à contre temps du tumulte de la sin city, touristes et locaux partagent un même moment d'un (petit) déjeuner typiquement américain, sympathique et vivant dans un décor digne des road movies, dans des prix en décalage avec les pompes à oseille de hôtels-casinos."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Vicky's diner. The first time they impressed me with a great service and cool internal decoration and open kitchen. One can easily see how the staff is grilling the meat or making pancakes. Now, I am enjoying a generous portion of steak dinner and a pumpkin pie for desserts. Quality and juicy food. But It took them more than 15 minutes to prepare and to serve it! My only mark to Vicky's could be faster service. However, waiting for my portion was fully worthy and my impatience to try the pumpkin pie was fully repaid.  Prices are average, for this part of the town. If you include drink refill, the final bill could be for sure considered as cheap. The nightshift staff is showing a really polite manner to customers and a buddy style approach."}
{"text":"Funky dinner with lots of atmosphere in a marginal part of the Strip.  Great burgers and diner food.  Good service and friendly staff.  What else could you want?"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Diner through and through -  not too frilly and great service."}
{"text":"Exactly what we were looking for.....  Meatloaf special....  Coca-Cola on tap....  6/10 eggs and burger."}
{"text":"Don't order Delivery!! I have ordered delivery from this place many times, this last time I called to order I was told that you cannot receive delivery unless your order is $30 or more. However I am certain that I have received a delivery of $15.. Half of the time the people answering the phones have no idea how to take an order."}
{"text":"I wish there where six stars. Because when a situation is handled and made right gracefully, they deserve an extra star. Vickie has owned and operated her Diner since 1969, Yet she is young. I was born in 1969 and I'm 47 and I just don't see how she is that much older than me. Everything at the diner is homemade. Even after the situation, she was very polite with me and conversational. I enjoyed my visit. I'm here for another 3 days and I'm sure I'll be there again."}
{"text":"You'd  think you were in the heart of Texas!  Big portions  and Vickie 's genuine   warm hospitality that feel like home  and equals to wonderful  home cooking. The wait staff  are friendly  and inviting and fast as lighting !  the pork chops are large and juicy and above all no preservatives! ..a favorite!..mouth watering  chicken  fried steak. And home made country  gravy! From scratch!   Home  fries...again   no preservatives. .taters are boiled to perfection  and  then peeled grilled to order....order them  with grilled onions!...the angus beef burgers are to die for...juicy  and filling....again  no fillers! and the steaks are juicy and tender too!  and John 's home made soups from scratch...feel the loving!  His homemade daily specials always  running out cause  so delicious!   Of course  breakfast  hearty! and filling. another  favorite Bacon!  Cooked to order and crispy the diner  has that retro feel. Like going back in time to my childhood."}
{"text":"A fantastic alternative to the over priced options on the strip. Great food served quickly with a smile. The exterior will leave you guessing if you've made a wise choice. The inside is clean and the food is great. We will be back every time we visit out here."}
{"text":"10/10 would go again. Perfect hidden gem, me and my boyfriend missed were it was at because we are blind. But we finally found it, no wait time. It was like stepping back in time, the service was kind and treated you like customers they have seen so many times. They were kind and polite, they joked with you. Perfect place to have a date with my boyfriend and I'd go here again"}
{"text":"A hidden gem that more people should discover! Amazing food in big portions, affordable prices, fantastic and friendly service, and a delivery service that's one of the fastest in town! I can't praise Vickie's Diner enough. Their grilled pork chops and New York steak are so good and filling you won't believe their prices."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst. what a bunch of idiots she has answering the phone and taking orders for delivery. I think Vicky is a little too self absorbed and doesn't realize that her service sucks. Example: whoever heard of breakfast at Vickies!!??  Get over yourself, your place sucks and SOME of the people you got working for you are total  morons. Don't waste your time with delivery from this place."}
{"text":"Since changing from Tiffany's to Vicki's, the french fries have also changed and they are not good. They've added some sort of crunchy flavoring to them, the sort of fries you get at a drive-thru. I used to go here a lot, so the last visit, I had a side salad instead of the fries and it was just a handful of iceberg lettuce, one tiny cucumber slice and maybe a tiny tomato, I don't recall, but I do recall that it sucked. My boyfriend hates the new fries, too, and it's not the dude who wrote a review slamming the new fries."}
{"text":"Traditional old fashioned diner. Great food, spotlessly clean, good service, inexpensive, open 24x7 with lots of parking. Do not miss Vickies if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I loved the food, the service, and the place!! A great home cooked meal, without charging you a fortune."}
{"text":"Best food for the value in Las Vegas ; Hands Down !!!!!!  Have to go, Even if you take a cab to get here since it's a few blocks from the big hotels on the main section of the strip."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years, back when it was Tiffany's Dinner. Vicky has definitely done a great job keeping the friendly dinner atmosphere but also keeping the place looking clean. Great deal on the food and they will do everything they can to accommodate substitutions. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Great diner experience. Location is a bit sketchy, but good parking. Food is perfect American diner experience. Solid, reliable, and tasty, but nothing fancy. No artisianal breads here handmade by Belgian monks, just straight up eggs and kick-ass potatoes."}
{"text":"Cheap diner with GREAT service and plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"We met the owner, Vickie.   Very lovely lady.   Food is good.   Don't let the neighborhood scare you off.  It's a true diner and the food is good."}
{"text":"Great old fashioned Diner.  Good quality food.  Cooked food on open grill top right by counter.  Most big chains give you a partially cooked piece of bacon, but not Vicky.  Crispy!!  Will definitely return.  Homestyle potatoes look amazing."}
{"text":"This place is not good and has questionable food safety. Pancakes under cooked and had a taste like some thing was on the grill before they were cooked. Eggs ok bacon,not great. To top it off I saw the cook form raw beef patties with his bare hands then go back to cooking touching plates and the spatula and toast etc. Really how hard is it to throw a pair of gloves on when dealing with the raw meat. I have seen the cook at a Waffle House do it. He could easily get some one sick. Oh and the coffee is like watered down colored water."}
{"text":"We arrived to find a gem! We had been here previously when it was first changing over to Vickie`s Diner and love the new paint and revamped interior! The food is delicious and is your standard diner menu with lots of variety.  The entire restaurant was very clean, and the staff were very friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to be so disappointed. My guy found this place and wanted to try it out for breakfast. So we did.  Walking distance from our hotel, we found this spot in an area we weren't expecting. If it weren't for the painting on the outside walls of this diner, I would have thought it was any other abandoned place covered in graffiti.   I didn't have such a big appetite that morning, and felt like I could only do something small. After looking through the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order a mixed fruit bowl. When I told the waitress that's what I wanted, she told me that it \"comes with everything\" and asked me if that's okay. I said yes. I didn't think to ask her what \"everything\" was until she had walked away with our orders. So we wait a well amount of time and breakfast is on the table. I was shocked.   When I see \"mixed fruit\" on a menu, I imagine something like strawberries, bananas, melon, grapes, ect. I couldn't believe what was brought to my table. I almost thought it was a joke.  My bowl of mixed fruit that I had ordered was diced peaches straight out of the can with a sliced banana on top. Yep. I would have never paid over $4 if I knew that's what I'd be getting. If that was the case, I could have bought my own can of fruit and banana and still spend less than that! All I'm saying is, mixed fruit off a menu should be FRESH and MIXED fruit!   I ended up eating potatoes off my boyfriend's plate instead.  Improvement very needed in my case, otherwise the potatoes were okay. I love potatoes."}
{"text":"When you just don't know what you want, but you can have anything you want makes it hard to decide. And you can't beat the prices for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Great food at cheap prices. Just an old-school diner the way it should."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall 24hr Diner. Whenever we feel the need to eat breakfast, Vickie's is one of our top choices. Seating is limited, so don't expect a large crowd, however sometimes this place does get a bit packed. Would prefer this diner over your usual IHOP and Denny's. It's a great spot to fulfill those anytime breakfast munchies!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas from San Diego and wanted to find a small Diner off the strip. Vickie's is so cute, and the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back in next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We thought the breakfast was ok. We were surprised to see the restaurant on the evening news the next day for health violations."}
{"text":"Old school joint run by good people. Best for the breakfast staples. If you need some ham and eggs at 3am, this is your man.  A slice of old Vegas, with zero presences but plenty of soul and authenticity, which is pretty rare these days."}
{"text":"We love this place at all hours of the day but late night is my favorite! The chef is  also your server if you sit at the counter, and he puts on a good show. He loves what he does and it shows. Thanks D! We will be back again with friends and fam!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast. Ever.  Whenever we are in Vegas, this is our go to. No frills, best down home breakfast this side of my Grandma's house."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places for breakfast in Las Vegas. Its always been a great place however Vickie has remodeled the joint and now is a Las Vegas gem. Ya gotta love the 24-7 hours. I highly recommend Vickies."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from an Old school diner, greasy food with tons of butter! Great for hangovers  open 24/7"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Vickie's for dinner. It is hole in the wall, which we expected, but we were hoping for decent food and decent service. My wife was turned off by thick dust on windowsill ledge. Meal started out ok with an order of onion rings, but went downhill from there. It took forever for our entrées to come out, and then we were still missing a side of toast and my entire meal. It was a very long wait to only end up with an incorrect order (mashed potatoes instead of fries, over-cooked steak  and mediocre (if that) food. They comped my drink to make me feel better but the experience just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Love this place . Everything is fresh and made to order . Real down home cooking . The service is excellent, and you feel at home. We have been there at 4am with a party of 4 and the chef took our order, cooked it and served us all at once . A must place to eat!!"}
{"text":"The worker guy said this is the oldest cafe in Vegas! It's been around since the early 1900's and was around when there were only two hotels! Pretty neat. Cute charm. Small cafe with elderly men cooking for ya. The outside looks sketchy but the inside is a cute diner. They made good conversations and the breakfast was good. Nice get away from the strip."}
{"text":"Horrible service they are a bunch of liars! Hair was found on my salad nasty nasty nasty... Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Terrible experience, average to bad food. Baffled by the rave reviews.  -Not greeted at all, employees were apathetic -Waited 30 minutes to order food, despite only 3 other tables occupied. -both of our burgers came on dry, old buns -the tomatoes were old -I asked for mayonnaise and there was a huge frozen banana chunk in it -We had almost no interaction with our server and the whole experience and the less than amazing food really made it a truly miserable meal.  When my partner tried to complain, he was interrupted and the issues were side-stepped.  Would not recommend. We would have left because of the long wait to place our orders but we had been travelling all day and had been almost 12 hours without food. We were starving and desperate. Even considering that, this was bad all around. I made a yelp account just to leave this review.  Do not waste your time or money here, or risk your health!"}
{"text":"Came in for St Patty's day! Wanted breakfast but ended up with Corned Beef n Cabbage oh my! Wow that was a lot of food and delish. The corned beef was so tender and the wedge of Cabbage was perfect. None of it was too salty and I rolled out of there. The boy had three Pork chops n eggs. You can have one or three Pork chops lol!  We will be back while here this week.    Day 2 came in again for breakfast. I thought sat morning would be packed but it was a perfect constant flow of people. We did sit up at the bar cause booths were full. But doing this we got breakfast AND a show! The line cook was awesome. He has been here 40 yrs they said! Heard the story that Vickis Uncle had owned it owner Before last and now she has it back!! Don't see her today, must be her day off. He orchestrated the hash browns in the back with constant perfection. The meats front right ,several slices of bacon and sausage patty's alternating. He patted the grease off with his special meat towel as they waited to be plated. Thick pieces of French toast and huge pancakes front left were also flipped with precision. Everything g looked sooo good. I wanted to try it all.    I ordered trout n eggs. It was the best I've ever had. It was a full trout split open, deboned and crispy with skin and tail on!! Perfect seasoning, side of two lemons and tarter if you like, accompanied by potatoes( whew... too many), & 3 eggs! Oh with toast too! It was so good I even ate the fish chip (tail)!!!    Bf had the Vicki Burger and wowee that's a huge burger. He truley enjoyed the heck out of it. Cooked med rare just like he wanted it too. He even couldn't eat the hash browns lol. So hope to come tomorrow afternoon one more time if we can!     Okay..... day 3 it's Sunday and not so busy at 11:20. I wanted a burger before we left town so I got the Vicki ( Tiffanys) burger that bf had. Wow I wasn't sure I could eat 1/2 lb burger... but I did. I tackled it by cutting it in half and ate two halves! Lol. As usual so many potatoes but they didn't get wasted.    Bf had Greek salad with Gyro meat on it. It was equally good. Unfortunately he was still hungry and I ate all my burger. So he ordered a side of burger patty for $5 and ate the rest of my potatoes ! Hahahahaha waste not want not.      So I have to say this place is a gem and open 24/7 and always seating. If you don't try this place you are losing out on good cooking!! Till next time in town thanx Vickis!!"}
{"text":"This is classic, old school, original Las Vegas. We wanted to eat somewhere other than the overpriced, standard resorts. This place has been around for a long time. The building itself is old but not in a bad way. It's just classic. They have pink leather seats. It just speaks of original Las Vegas. It's very reasonably priced and the food is delicious!  Wherever we travel to, we like to experience the area and lifestyle and not stick to resorts or places we know tourists will go. I'm glad we ate here. I would eat here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"good food  good service  cheap prices, better  eating  here  them Dennis   look like I hole in  the wall  but don't  let that fool you  it taste  better  then  some  expensive  reastauran on the strip"}
{"text":"Really great hole in the wall place literally! Tucked into the corner of an abandoned liquor store building, we missed it when it was right in front of our eyes! Parking was easy, service was relaxed, patrons mostly seemed like local regulars who kept to themselves. Our waitress had professional service and was kind enough to ask how we wanted our checks split before we ordered which was helpful. I ordered a BLT on toasted sourdough with mashed potatoes & gravy. My SO ordered a steak dinner with peas & mashed potatoes with gravy. His brother ordered a Paul Bunyun no pickles or onions with fries and his girlfriend ordered home style potatoes with her three egg breakfast with wheat toast. Our son had chicken tenders with fries (he normally has an organic breakie of fresh fruit & veggie juice in the morning w/egg, vitamins & 1/4 whole wheat bread but we're on vacation so this is what he gets).   Gravy was okay, peas were canned, the steak was actually a large ground beef patty to my SO's disappointment but everything else was delicious and I loved my BLT.  Definitely a great locals spot to get some cheap eats as long as you have a decent idea of what to order ;)"}
{"text":"Overpriced for bland food. Maybe 2 stars at best. Definitely not the current 4 star rating. Cheese omelet for $8.50 was an egg omelet with 2 slices of American cheese melted on the top. Home fries were dry and bland.   Definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"Took my family for breakfast good very good large servings. The pork chop (3) special was really good, reasonable prices will go back."}
{"text":"Corn beef hash is very yummy! The Philly cheesesteak was very good as well, huge portion. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the service. It depends on the waitress, I've been in here a few times and only once did I enjoy the service from the very nice and cute lady with glasses, the rest of the times I've had weird and a little rude service from the other waitresses. Took my family to eat here because we needed somewhere close to here and the food is good but the service again, could've been better it seems like they're only nice to some customers?"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to stop for an all American diner experience! I highly recommend coming by for a very affordable, feel-good meal.   Stepping across the threshold is like stepping into the 1950's. The decor and seating is very much like an old fashioned drive in diner. It's also much larger on the inside than it appears from the outside, so don't be afraid to bring friends.   The waitresses are so freaking nice and hospitable. It felt like sitting down to breakfast with my extended family cooking and checking in on me.   The food was super good. I got the bacon and 3 egg breakfast with wheat toast and home fries. The eggs were over a little too easy for my liking, but still very good when you soak up the runniness with some buttered toast. The bacon was perfectly crispy, salty, and savory. I also got an extra piece, so my Vegas luck cashed in at the perfect time. The home fries were really good. It was nice that they were made fresh and not fried from a bag like I've seen at a lot of places.   Definitely stop by Vickie's for a great diner experience. I'm sure they will take care of you like one of their own!"}
{"text":"Dieses Diner hat es uns während unseres Las Vegas Aufenthalts angetan: Nicht weit vom Strip , gute Parkmöglichkeiten, großes und leckeres Frühstücksangebot! Sowohl das Breakfast-Special als auch die verschiedenen Omelettes haben uns überzeugt. Nicht zuletzt die persönliche Note durch die Gastgeberin \"Vickie\", die das Restaurant in Familientradition seit fast 50 Jahren führt, hat dazu beigetragen, dass wir gleich 3 Mal dort waren."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars alone for the Absolute best patty melt on rye!! It's really good!  I've ordered several different things off the menu, but I always come back for that patty melt. Other things I've enjoyed would be their French toast, omelette's, chicken fried steak and eggs, grilled ham and cheese... there hasn't been anything I've tried that I wouldn't order again.  24/7 365 fast friendly delivery that always arrives piping hot! (Seriously CAUTION very hot!!)  Give them a try if you are looking for some good ol American diner food.  It's nothing fancy, but sometimes that's exactly what I'm looking for.  Support your local small businesses people, don't let the exterior fool ya, there is a hidden gem waiting for you inside."}
{"text":"If you go anywhere, go here! Its great food.  Vicki is awesome!  You want good home cooking,  go here."}
{"text":"I love the food at this plsce especially because they do food delivery 24/7 and they are open all year long. By the way they have great coffee"}
{"text":"I was super hyped up about eating here when i found it on yelp because I'm all for supporting small, local businesses while traveling. Obviously this is in the not oh so glamorous part of Las Vegas so my expectations weren't that high. When we walked in the diner it was small and cute- pink everywhere. We sat down, looked at the specials and prepared to order. I looked to my right to realize that the cook was NOT wearing gloves. YUCK!!! Ultimate turn off. I'm grateful that the waitress walked out to see why we were leaving. She asked did we want to speak to the owner, Vickie but we declined."}
{"text":"Ordered my steak rare,  and the waiter said \"okay, medium rare\" ordered my eggs over easy and he put them in as over medium. I am an adult, I know how I like to eat my food. I don't need you to correct me. Ordered a coffee, he brought the coffee... With my check? Um no... I didn't want coffee at the end of my meal I wanted it before. I try never to complain, but I am so frustrated by the terrible service. I even waited for forever to have my waiter come take my bill.  Please, please care more about your job. If I'm spending my money here I expect to get what I asked for, not your opinion on what I should have, or when I should have it. Leaving here in flames, and never coming back to these burnt out coals."}
{"text":"Endlich ein authentisches amerikanisches Diner! Richtig oldschool.  Wie schwierig es ist in Amerika ein vernünftiges Frühstück zu einem vernünftigen Preis zu finden, dürften USA Reisende kennen. Deshalb war ich super glücklich das Vickie's Diner gefunden zu haben.  Hier kann man einfach nur Toast, Rührei, Speck oder eine Portion Pancakes bestellen. Alles, was das Herz begehrt. Yeah!! Bestellt man einmal Kaffee, wird dieser solange nachgegossen bis man genug hat. Essen und Getränke bieten keine kulinarische Gaumenexplosion, aber alles schmeckt bodenständig und herzhaft gut. Übrigens gibt es auch Mittags- und Abendgerichte. Einfach reingehen, sich auf einen freien Platz setzen und die Bedienung den Rest machen lassen."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food was great and the service was excellent.  The Philly was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"DON'T invite your guest to sit where they would like and then ask them to move when they pick a spot. I'll never come here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Fast service and the best owners! Favorite breakfast spot. Love Vickie's!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but sadly I didn't. I don't care about all the graffiti and the homeless asking for money as I went down the block. But the eggs were under cooked and they didn't give me real butter with my pancakes. Sadly they redid the place sense the movie \"Lucky you\" with Eric Bena Drewberry more and Robert DeVol in this place. I sat in the same Place as in the movie and sadly that was the best part of my experience."}
{"text":"Good comfort food. Clean and remodeled. Had breakfast food came out fast and service was spot on"}
{"text":"Small diner with cook to order food!! We had the French toast meal.So flavorful and with the cheap prices , it's a place you can't miss! Bacon has a jalapeño maple taste to it!!"}
{"text":"This place was efficient and clean.  Had breakfast with the family.  The portions were huge, and the bathrooms spotless.  All together, got to try pancakes, veggie omelette, hash browns.  Not disappointed.  Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Great service great food best value on the Strip for food a hell of a lot better than Casino food"}
{"text":"This is our first time in Vagas and our first place to eat. The name sake/waitress was amazing, very friendly accommodating. We sat and ate our food and watched the show aka kitchen and Vickie running back and forth. We loved the homefries and will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is the old Tiffany's Diner that had been around for many years. Not much has changed except ownership and it's still a great hidden gem. Open 24/7, they have all of your diner mainstays like burgers, breakfast, sandwiches, etc. but what I love about this place is that most everything is homemade. Sure it's a little divey but having eaten here (in its previous incarnation) many, many times it's always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  Never knew it was there in all these years!   Thought It was just a big store.    Friendly service, great prices too."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. I would never have come in here if I hadn't read all of the other great reviews. Ignore the outside and go on in and give it a try."}
{"text":"Lidia the waitress is kind, friendly and efficient. Great mom n pop old time diner witg GREAT food and AMAZING prices. Huge portions. Very much worth it. I highly recomend coming here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I got delivery so much that they'd go to the store for me on the way to my pad. No mas. Why? bcuz someone's decided to offer some salty nasty crappy Jack n the Box fucked up fries as the only choice. I loathe these fries. And why not give people a choice? Your fries are not good. They obviously come from a cheap bag. Tiffany cafe never would force people to eat this shit. I'm all for change etc, this just fucking pisses me off. They are not only awful, how dare you do a salty nasty frie with no option to have a regular fucking frie? Sucks hugely."}
{"text":"Classic diner ambience with delicious food in large portions. My friends and I came here for our first breakfast in Vegas and we were tempted to make a repeat visit the next day! I had the bacon and eggs with toast and hash browns. Everything was freshly prepared and cooked to perfection. My combo came with 4 huge slices of crispy bacon. Coffee hot and kept refilled. Our waitress was just great. I'll definitely return when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had a BLT with great fries and milkshake. Fresh and delicious. Clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Seriously the best diner food in vegas. I recommend everything here. The staff is amazing and the soups are always awesome. The breakfast special is to die for. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Probably one great deal and good food.  Hard to find and found it through another yelper's suggestion.  The staff is friendly and food is good diner food.  More traditional diner food with working class clientele and locals."}
{"text":"The best hole in the wall old Vegas diner.  Not many people know about this place. It's hard to tell from outside that there is a diner here.  I've been coming here for years. Great food at very decent prices. My favorite is the ribeye dinner or ribeye breakfast. The BLT is good too.  It's open 24/7. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! True dinner style with good prices and great food. Our service was so friendly! We came really wary in the morning, 7am and there was no wait so it was perfect."}
{"text":"I do not know where to begin. First off I am amazed how this place does not have a million five star reviews. The service is absolutely amazing. At any time of the day. The staff clearly enjoys being here. The food is amaaazinngggg. I have yet to find a place on the west coast that rivals both the great food and service you get here. It is so unfortunate that I live 8 hours away or else I would be here everyday.....like I've been doing since I've been here in Vegas. Third day third visit. The specials are amazing. You get a ton of food and everything is homemade, which is hard to find nowadays. Vickie is an amazing and sweet lady. STOP BY AS SOON AS YOU CAN."}
{"text":"This is a down home diner with delicious and inexpensive breakfast. The special hit the spot at the price  ($6.99). The only downside is that you have to walk a ways from Vegas strip to get there. Great exercise though!"}
{"text":"Ooooommmmgggggg!!! I was visiting Las Vegas from Texas and wanted to try something local. This was down the street from our hotel and it was AMAZING fulfilling food with a price that couldn't be beat!"}
{"text":"Very good diner . The food is good, the price is just as good . Love that it's open 24/7 . Don't live in Vegas but we always make sure to stop by when we take a trip to Vegas ."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Great food great service. Always happy to be here. Especially love there chicken fried steak and eff"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall you've ever been to.  #1 coffee in Las Vegas!  Hands down is the most classic diner experience you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"In town for a rugby tourney and wanted to try a local place for breakfast - wow, back for a second day in a row!  My hubby and son love the chicken fried streak breakfast and I had an omelette yesterday and oatmeal today!! #supportlocal #repeatoffenders"}
{"text":"Cheap eats not far from the strip.  Great Philly cheesesteaks, omelets, and home fries.  Friendly service.  Will return."}
{"text":"Awesome after bar food. Breakfast is my favorite meal at anytime of the day and this place delivers greasy yumminess. Love the counter and the people watching."}
{"text":"This place is a one of a kind! Very sweet staff! And the interior is to die for in my book! Very cute and 50s! I'll be going there ALOT MORE OFTEN!"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing!!! It tasted like a back yard bbq. I'm a ranch fanatic and that was amazing as well. The service was perfect,  friendly and very attentive. I have lived blocks away from this hidden gem for years.. Now that I know what I've been missing, they will be seeing a lot of me from now on.. Open 24 hours and they deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally when yelp sends me to a 4+ star restaurant in a new city, I am introduced to a unique and hidden gem of a place that I would not have found on my own. I can not believe how disappointing this place was.  Based on the pictures, i knew it was going to be a hole-in-the-wall. I overlooked the surprisingly run down appearance in the anticipation of great food at a good price. The food was mediocre at best. Very simple diner fare, with little to no flavor.  I had the chicken fried steak & eggs. The meat was the poorest quality I have had, and again just flavorless.  This place is not a diamond in the rough, but a lump of coal."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a hole-in-the-wall place to eat when visiting a different place while on vacation. We get so tired of hitting McDonald's or paying for meals on The Strip. When we drove by, I was a little put off by the boarded up neighbors and the vagrants sleeping across the street. But the diner was clean and inviting.  We were welcomed by the owner immediately, and she told us about the specials.  The food came out quickly and was hot. Bacon was perfect, eggs were not runny, and overall, it was all tasty!  I think we have found a regular stop when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the high ratings. One star for friendly staff. One star for the potatoes. The coffee wasn't coffee. It was warm brown water. The ham and cheese omelette was undercooked, there were little raw white globs throughout and the \"cheese\" was American. I don't count American cheese as cheese. Just not my thing."}
{"text":"Used to be Tiffany's. This place had pretty good food but not too many vegetarian options and definitely no vegan options. My friend got the greek salad and was very happy with it. The veggie omelete was really good. Even the grilled cheese was awesome. Only complaint was that it was very crowded and a short staff so it was quite a wait to get our check. Very nice service however."}
{"text":"Vickies diner @ las vegas blvd and Oakey in las vegas has excellent food and the cooks and employees take excellent  care of their customers 100 per cent there opening 24/7 365 days a year BODACIOUS"}
{"text":"Clean. Homey. Not necessarily inciting but a good local joint.  Sort of inside a liquor store  will almost miss it if aren't looking for white cross market   Went at 4 pm with DH, ordered Tiffany burger and Fries - asked to have bacon and cheese on top of the fries AND grilled cheese on sourdough & fries - also with cheese and bacon on top.  The burger was cooked medium well perfectly ! 3.5/4 out of 5 for the burger . The fries that came on the side did not have cheese or bacon on them -- oversight of waitstaff - though she was incredibly pleasant.   The grilled cheese was buttery and melty as expected -- 4 out of 5 for that. Fries came topped with cheese and bacon. BUT when the server Asked the cook (named D) to put these toppings on the fries on the grill, what should have been simple turned into a complicated scenario! Ultimately, the server popped 2 slices of thick cheddar cheese and crispy, almost tasteless bacon on top of fries and put them in the microwave for a few seconds. Then we received this plate with half melted cheese and super crunchy bacon on top. Not what we were looking for on the side of this tasty grilled cheese.  Bottomless coffee and water paired with these meals were good.  Total about $24"}
{"text":"I wanted breakfast and happened to see this place on yelp so it wasn't a long walk from the hotel.  In fact I almost missed it since it was kind of blending in with the rundown part of town Denny's is nearby and recognizable but I wanted something different It's like a mom and pop diner so just basic ambiance and decor.  I felt like going large on breakfast so I had the ground round with eggs and toast.  It was like two meals.  Very yummy and oh so filling that void of not having a hot cooked meal lately since being a flight attendant your choices are mostly airport or airline food. This will be my go to for breakfast when I am in Las Vegas.   The service was warm and friendly and I enjoyed and appreciated watching breakfast being prepared and cooked in such an efficient and enjoyable manner from my seat at the counter."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last week for vacation. We wanted some breakfast but not from IHOP or the Denny's around the hotel, so I checked yelp to see what was around. We ended up going to Vickie's & it was worth it. Good food, service & price."}
{"text":"A little displeased with the waitress as I walked thru the door being it was my first time, she seemed a little irritable. The food for me was okay, it was also very greasy. Maybe it depends on the day, but wasn't really impressed."}
{"text":"We choose Vickies Diner for a breakfast meal, upon walking in, the temperature in the tiny dated diner was about 90 degrees.   I ordered breakfast special, the food was \"OK\".  There was a guest at the counter that openly and loudly burped while he ate his meal. I would not recommend this business as it was cluttered, dated, dirty and the waitress was rude and abrasive.  Have you ever gone somewhere and your server pays zero attention to you but the buzzer is so attentive that you leave them the tip instead!"}
{"text":"Across the street from Arepas is this little diner called Tiffany's.. JK new owner bought the place and now it's called Vickie's Diner. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a diner. A menu that rarely changes expect it's specials. They're open everyday of the year and are never closed. Who does like that?   On to the food. I ordered the Hot Pastrami & Swiss which was delicious. Remember people this isn't gourmet food, it's a diner. It's great for lazy people like myself who want a hot meal and people who of course are too drunk to cook as well.   If you're in the area give them a try, they also serve breakfast all day long as well."}
{"text":"I can't think of one bad thing to say about this place.Good food,good prices,and great service.If you are ever craving a good burger at 3am this is the spot to be"}
{"text":"Omg!!! So good!!! I am Vegan so had home fries and toast. Pretty good! My husband had Denver Omlette he's in love! Awsome service!!! Great food!!! We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good ,service was ok... however , my plate French toast , eggs , bacon only $6.95 great price!! My daughter had French toast, sausage, potatoes and they charged $15.45  ....."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find as it is nestled by a market. The ambiance is cute and the staff is really friendly. The food was pretty good. There is limited seating however so if you have a big party it will be difficult to seat everyone together."}
{"text":"this place is insane! we went in after noticing the bright pink booths when we had walked past the day earlier. we ordered the Greek omelette which was a massive portion, with hash and toast; and the Tiffany burger. the food was amazing, the service even better. we enjoyed it that much that we got a photo with our server, who then introduced us to Vickie, the owner. this place is legit American diner food and I can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"When I fly into Vegas for a gambling vacation, I get off the plane get my bags, rent a car and Drive DIRECTLY to Tiffany's, now Vickie's..  There is a Diner Artist behind that counter named Louie, been cooking the grave yard shift at this same restaurant for more than 30 yrs... Louie is making the BEST Breakfasts, Burgers, Country FRIED STEAKS, Liver and Onions, BLTs etc, etc, etc.....you have ever had, anywhere. Daily Specials, Daily Soups......  This Diner is the last remain institution from old Vegas..... You will love it, the food, the ambiance, the characters, the Cooks, the staff.... It's perfect"}
{"text":"Vickies diner just got remodeled the new color is pink inside the food is still the best in las vegas nevada and the employees are. still really cool people"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great fresh made to order diner comfort food and the staff are the sweetest! I eat there all the time for my lunch time comfort."}
{"text":"The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but as someone who is tired of restaurants named for a celebrity that sell you a $25 breakfast, I'm happy to be on this end of the Boulevard. Vickie's is an old school diner where everything is cooked in front of you on the flat top and the prices are reminiscent of the days before Vegas became all about bottle service.   Service is friendly, and if you're in there early enough your server also cooks your food. It's not fussy. Your omelette will have American cheese and your toast might be a little burnt. But that's part of the charm of eating at a real diner and not a Strip hotel restaurant decorated to look like one."}
{"text":"Perfect little hole in the wall diner with great service for that classic diner experience. Good food. Generous portions."}
{"text":"Really good food at very reasonable price. It takes a bit of courage if dining between 2200-0700 because it's not in the best neighborhood, midway between downtown and the hussle+bussle of the Strip. Parking is available right by the entrance and that is a good thing. Be courageous, take s leap of faith, you'll get your money's worth after a long day of walking."}
{"text":"If your looking for fresh delicious American food this is the place to go. It's a hidden gem. Service was great and the food was delicious. Will definitely come back again when we are in Vegas! Manhattan burger was on point!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was 21...always came after a night of drinking downtown (haha) when it was still Tiffanys. Always great diner food, everyone was always so nice and friendly. Now that I'm in my 30s, I come in the daytime more often and it's still just as good. Always a great nostalgic spot. Things have changed, but not for the worst. Love the biscuits and gravy and corned beef hash! Older Vegas spot, but that's what makes it great."}
{"text":"we used to have our lunch delivered from ther old owners and it was mediocre at best.    now that vickie took the place over ... the food is 1o times better and the diner has never looked better.  super daily specials and great friendly service.  reminds me of a good old fashioned jersey diner!    go there and be happy!"}
{"text":"What a blast from my past!  the Tiffany burger is now called the Vickie burger but its still a beefy, mushroomy, bacony mouthful of deliciousness.  The beef somehow was beefier than any burger I've had lately.  The service was great and our waitress offered us several options instead of the fries, which got such lousy reviews on here.  One had the potato salad and the other had a side of cottage cheese.  While we waited for our burgers to cook, the waitress brought us each a complimentary bowl of clam chowder, which was unexpected.  If you're looking for a diner/dive with character and delicious food, look no further than Vickie's!  Reservations not required.  lol!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! We just found the place called Vicky's diner this is a must stop and get something to eat everyone was wonderful the place was packed and yet everyone including the chef were polite and friendly with a little bit of good old sarcasm thrown in.  The food is absolutely fabulous I had the corn beef and hash and my wife had a special order of potatoes with grilled onions peppers and mushrooms. The chef makes the special order turns around and hands it to us and says \"Now that's a good breakfast.\"  We don't always come to Las Vegas but when we do this is definitely the The place where we will be eating"}
{"text":"Vickie took our order today! So cool :)  This is a no-nonsense diner, which is my favorite kind of diner! Nowadays, you get all these fancy brunch places that have fancy brunch dishes and they are nice, but sometimes you just want your basic pancakes, eggs, and bacon all on a plate! That's what Vickie's offers! Fresh hot food at a fair price, I would go back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good local spot when your surrounded by casino. But we did it. Thanks Vicki"}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service. Everyone employee was super friendly and helpful. I really like the cute retro diner feel. It's worth the stop."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much last year while at the Dog Show, this year not nearly as much, since scheduled for demolition in early fall, I guess you can't expect much from the place or employees, won't be able to come back next year!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place, but it's clean, and the portions are generous. Ordered corned beef hash and eggs, and country fried steak and eggs. Neither my husband or I could finish our meals. The service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here because the IHOP next door was too stinky. Top notch meal! Have been here multiple times and always served a great breakfast. You get more than your money's worth. Def go for a visit while in Vegas. They give good sized portions. Waitress kept our drinks filled. I have to visit this place everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"West side of the Strip just North of the Sratosphere ... it's easy to miss but DONT! Clean with friendly staff and great breakfast, sandwiches. Pink vinyl booths or counter seating. It's the original diner in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food was excellent and beyond reasonably priced. The coffee was excellent. This place has total old school feel. Staff is friendly, quick and attentive. I would defiantly recommend this place if you are anywhere near downtown."}
{"text":"I love their corned beef hash! It was soooo delicious & filling. It came with your choice of toast and eggs. I definitely made the right choice by stopping by this diner. My husband got the french toast & it was perfect. Our waitress was so kind and made sure we had gotten everything we asked for. The food came out pretty quickly too. A very nice, family friendly diner, you can tell they had a lot of frequent local customers there. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a fabulous find. You literally have to pass a Denny's to get here but it was the best choice I could have made. Amazing food, good prices, wholesome service, just overly genuinely a very very amazing hidden treasure that is absolutely underrated."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and made fresh to order. After a long night Vickie's is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place is really great. Vickie introduced herself and was very nice. just like ll the waitresses too. I got the chicken fried steak and it was incredible. My girlfriend got french toast, eggs, sausage and potatoes. Vickie threw in the potatoes for free. Great diner food."}
{"text":"Vickie's is in a neighborhood that's a little sketchy but very worth it. Food was awesome, service was good. All around cool experience."}
{"text":"Good value and breakfast was good. Can't give more stars because they serve a \"hydrogenated \" spread in a packet instead of butter. Makes me wonder what they cook with?"}
{"text":"Great diner, superb service by Cindy at Vicky's diner on Las Vegas Blvd.    Had Philly Cheese Steak and Chicken Fried Steak!"}
{"text":"Great spot right off the strip.  Much better and way less expensive than most places on the strip.  If you're staying near the north end you have to come here."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you! This place is a go to for locals! Tons of taxi drivers, hotel workers, and airline employees come here to fill their stomachs. The prices are hard to beat, the food quality is excellent, and the portions are big! I have seen big time celebrities frequent this diner, with bodyguards also enjoying the grub.  I always loved their chicken wings and fries, with a cup of ranch. Their hot chicken strips dipped in hot sauce also are yum! I also love their corned beef hash, and their breakfast is spot on. I have had some great memories at this cafe through the years, and I have NEVER left there hungry. Take my word for it!!! I love this place!  I moved to Seattle in 1999. Born and raised in Vegas. I miss this place so much! I kid you not, I flew to Vegas for just one day to do business, and came here to eat. I then went back to the airport, and flew home. That is telling you something! I also flew to Vegas with my wife. Before even going to the hotel, I took her here to eat. She was hesitant, because she didn't like the outside. I told her not to judge a book by its cover. Anyways, she was pleasantly surprised, and raved about the good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place! I guess it used to be called Tiffany's Cafe, although I didn't get to dine here before its bubblegum pink makeover. They have a classic diner menu and a friendly staff who are quick to serve you with a smile 24 hours a day. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Great steak and eggs, but go during the week.  The cook oon those days ia amazing. I'm giving it 4 starts because the weekend cook is not the same. I ordered the same breakfast and it was no where near what I had 2 days before! If you're looking for amazing food at very reasonablr prices, and not a hip snooty place,  them this is it (on a weekday). Just past the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"Place was absolutely disgusting, dont let these hipsters and whatever other bozos on here tell you otherwise. I get it, its in a shitty shopping complex so thats supposed to make it cool or something?.... I think not. Food was awful, waitress was awful, we waited for like 25 minutes which i would let slide if the food was good, it wasnt. Its pretty hard to mess up basic breakfast items but man they out did themselves, toast (if you want to call it that) was flabby no butter, the biscuits and gravy were just wall paper paste with no flavor, potatoes no flaver, etc. We went here absolutely starving and hungover i literally had 2 bites and we left. I cant even put my disgust into words it was that bad.. Usually i give places the benefit of the doubt even if it is bad but everything about this place was just horrible right down to the terrible food, terrible waitress, service, etc.. Its hard to believe this place could be any worse than it looks from the outside but they sure do it!  P.S. Dont eat here, im local and lived here for 10 years this might be my worst dining experience ever. Which is pretty hard to do/say for basic breakfast items but it really was that bad, which is a shame because i was conned into coming here solely based on the reviews from yelp."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while we were on our honey moon looking for biscuits and gravy . Ms. Cindy was our cute lil waitress . Vicki was in while we were there and talked with us . Food was great , Cindy was fabulous . Will go back again . Remember to support the lil mom and pop places , they are really all that's left on strip that give u the true feel of old Las Vegas ambiance ...... Tell Cindy hello from us :)"}
{"text":"Everytime I have ordered late night delivery service was prompt courteous and great. Tonight talk about a lack of anything. I understand you are busy. Please tell me you are not taking any phone orders at the moment I can understand that. Do not put me on hold and disappear talking to guests and not return to the phone. I call a second time. You tell me to call back in 30-40 minutes. I do so and I am put on hold again. No return to the phone Thanks, this is the last time I will order from you during my graveyard shift."}
{"text":"When you look at the façade from the outside there's not much to expect, the inside still has the old-Vegas look and feel with a casual 24/7 atmosphere.   The food is amazing, you don't really expect just how delicious the home made food is, the country fried steak is phenomenal. The staff is warm and welcoming and without judgement.   It's a place where it doesn't matter if you're here for a quick bite as a lost tourist, or if you're having a burger after working on the Strip. It is definitely a hidden gem and love coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Nothing too special inside but boy oh boy is the food good. Don't let the looks of the place deter you."}
{"text":"24 hour breakfast...yummy burgers...an authentic diner decor and friendly service...what more could you ask for? no alcohol is served here...it's located a few blocks away from the Stratosphere Tower, but it is worth the ride! Fair prices!"}
{"text":"This classic diner from the 1960s including with the pink formaldehyde booths and charm.  nothings changed prices are about the same as they were when they first opened.   a great deal if you love liver this is the place to have liver and eggs over easy"}
{"text":"Nice little cozy diner. This place is a nice change from the hotels and casinos in the area. I have the corned beef hash breakfast and would go there again."}
{"text":"Basic no frills 'mom & pop' diner on Las Vegas Blvd between the Strip and downtown LV open 24/7.  I ate here 3 mornings in a row.  Omelets and hash browns every day.  Bit greasy, but filling.  Sausage gravy was decent. Plenty of parking out front."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. One of the original places to visit in Vegas! Try the French toast with eggs, and you will love it! The nostalgic atmosphere and downtown vibe makes the experience even more memorable. Check it out and say hey to Vickie when you drop in!"}
{"text":"Great food! This is where the locals go to eat! Try it when you are in town, you won't be disappointed. Great old school coffee shop vibe. Reasonable prices, good service. Not much to look at, but place serves great food!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the outside appearance. We were a little nervous when we pulled up but were greeted so sweetly and had the best service followed by amazing food! The breakfast muffin was amazing and the prices were awesome! We'll be back!!   Then I got the bill...  So right after giving them 5 stars I got the bill. :( They charged $2 to have runny eggs in the breakfast muffin, $2 to have fries instead of potatoes which would have been nice to know ahead of time and I don't even know what that other $1 is charging me for. I was so excited to give them 5 stars. I guess Vegas is Vegas... There's always a catch!   Ps I attached the picture of the bill..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The coffee was delicious. The help was quick and polite. Only a minor problem is that the tap water smelled a little. But this is not essential. Perfect place."}
{"text":"This is a special place to me in Vegas.   Awesome hole in the wall with 4 star, really solid food and 5 star service.  Everyone I've taken here has loved it.  Try the tuna melt! Vicky is an awesome lady with such a positive smile and attitude.  Love her place!  Get out of your mega-resort and try this place :)"}
{"text":"This is a really small tucked away diner with awesome food for a low price. My friends and I stayed at the convention center and this was a very short drive. Satisfied our hangover needs perfectly :) Friendly people too. If you're looking for a real diner like the one back home, this is it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome über-kitschy old-school 24-hour diner across from a strip club and a dive bar. Interior is a Pepto-Bismol-pink wonderland of vinyl and chrome....with very tasteful oil paintings on the walls!  Menu is typical greasy-spoon diner fare, all cooked up behind the counter by a short order cook. Your clothing (and hair) will smell of fry grease after visiting -- beware!!  I had chili cheese fries, and my friends had the chef salad and the tuna melt. All were fine -- nothing fancy, but what do you want?  This will be my new go-to spot for visitors wanting that \"vintage Vegas late-nite sleaze\" vibe."}
{"text":"OMG! Clean. Fast. Delicious! Made with pride and TLC! Just like I remember growing up! So retro. So adorable. Made by people who care about what they do!   Why haven't I been coming here ALWAYS!   I had chicken fried steak, eggs and biscuits and gravy. I had sourdough toast that was so fresh and light it practically melted in my mouth! Perfect Breakfast!"}
{"text":"I usually order eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast - but tried the chicken schnitzel this time.  Real nice white meat cutlet, breaded just right.  Potatoes and gravy were savory - nice.  Had a small generic salad, rye bread with it.    Very savory, I could have eaten two more.   I still prefer them for breakfast food, but trying more off the menu.   Still a place I head to for a good quality meal."}
{"text":"Excellent greasy spoon style diner for those whole like good cheap food. Great breakfast,  good coffee, excellent prices, superb staff!! Just what I was looking for. Off the beaten path but worth the trip. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best food I have had here in Vegas. I will be eating here for every meal every time I come to Vegas and will come back just to eat here at Vickie's!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, good breakfast and coffee... I just wish they served fresh brewed iced tea:)"}
{"text":"Thank god for the real diner! This is a locals spot if there ever was one. We came at night, and ordered some monster burgers. Amazing!! Juicy, lots of lettuce and tomato, just great diner fare. We also got some onion rings that just rocked. We saw some breakfast orders that looked great, although we didn't order. Check them out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cheap... too cheap? If you're hungover and broke.. perfect, but if you're looking for quality and enjoyment... this is not the place!      First of all, the \"butter\" is whipped hydrogenated oil. I came here with my friend and her parents.. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was fine, biscuits tasted like sponge. The pancakes her parents ordered were flavorless. ***ALSO, the only cheese they have is sliced American!!!      The service was slow, our food came out cold and at separate times. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. We showed up with a group of 9 and the wait was very short. Everyone's good was great and a good value. It was fresh and fast. We will defiently be back."}
{"text":"What a colossal waste of time.  While staying on strip (at the SLS), I always like to find a local breakfast joint away from the hotels. Yelp usually puts me on hidden gems that few know about.   When I saw that there was a 50's diner for breakfast nearby, I was jazzed. We show up but couldn't readily find it--although it was right in front of us. The old strip-mall that it sits in was all but vacant of any businesses. The whole corner looked dead and depressed.  We see the diner and we went in hoping for the best. It was far from being great.   Pros: 1) Simple food at an OK price 2) Great parking  CONS: 1) Biscuits (gravy and biscuits) are warmed in front of you in a MICROWAVE 2) The staff lacked any vitality 3) The coffee sucked--badly (think hotel room instant packs) 4) Food was darn near fast food quality, but it couldn't get that high 5) A cook dropped a fork and it went under one of the greasy fryers. He retrieved it, with his bare hands and went back to frying.  6) Sausage patties were as cheap and greasy as you could get them (awful)   Will never go there again.   The only reason I gave it two stars was because it's easy to park."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times so far. And I gotta say the food is good and isn't over priced. Staff are nice and the wait isn't long. There's not to many places like this in Vegas. A must see if your traveling and want some good food."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast great prices. We had a French toast combo and two 3egg breakfasts. I'm a bacon connoisseur and a bit of a snob so I wasn't fond of the bacon  but for a quick breakie this place is great! It's in the hood behind stratosphere so night time might be scary."}
{"text":"I really would not go here if the other restaurants nearby are open. My friend and I came in around 2am and had ok service and questionable food. I feel like the food here is like the food you get at a friend's house and when you look at it you suddenly are inexplicably no longer hungry, though it might have something to do with the fact that the cook looks like a tweaker and the food looks substandard to frozen food. There was only one or two guys behind the counter prepping the food and taking orders and whatnot but there were also only like 3 people in there. Needless to say, my friend ordered a steak rare, got it medium rare; she ordered her eggs over easy, got them over medium; she ordered a coffee, got it with our request for the check after waiting for 30+ minutes. I ordered biscuits and gravy and am by no means a picky eater, but something seemed off about them and I only ate a few bites. The 5 star reviews confuse me, but maybe different hours/different staff/sweeter food is better? The decor was very retro and cute, but the food was far from cute. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here about once a week. This is our holy place. The service is wonderful and the food is perfectly diner-esque. I always get onion rings and a banana split with only strawberry ice cream. Highly suggested.  Fin."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a breakfast plate and still had leftovers!  The staff was speedy, attentive and friendly.  Our food was delicious!  Three pork chops, 3 eggs, potatoes and 2 slices of sourdough toast sliced diagonally and buttered, all for less than $10. What a deal!!  Be sure and grab dessert.  The sweet potato pie cheesecake was phenomenal"}
{"text":"This place use to be called Tiffany's (check there for reviews). First time here the epitome of five dinner. I'm in freaking love!"}
{"text":"Excellent little diner with friendly staff Amazing salsa!! Had breakfast here and would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went here today with my grandma for the first time & will definitely be back! I love it!!! The pink booths and bar seats are so cute. Our waitress was so nice and even though she was extremely busy she made sure we had everything we needed. I had the BLT which was a little dry but nothing some mayo couldn't fix!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. In my experience the staff is friendly, the last time I went my friend got a shake to-go, we couldn't stay for the extra that comes with it, we were out side with our bikes just chilling and the person who took our order came outside and and asked if we wanted the rest of the shake, so he poured the rest in a to-go cup. To me that was really awesome.  I'd recommend the the Paul Bunyan burger or the chili burger(definitely a \"fork and knife\" burger, it comes smothered in chili!), both are very scrumptious. I also really enjoy their French fries, they are only seasoned with salt, but they're a step above shoestring fries."}
{"text":"So being from NJ eating at a diner is a staple for me..... Let me say this place is the real deal...... We walked in at 845 with no seating issues what so ever our waitress was on point with our drinks and we waited only a few minutes for our food...... Now on to the food..... Amazing..... I didn't need to make any adjustments to the flavor.... No need for salt or pepper or anything which is impressive when you consider I had sausage gravy and biscuts.... My other half had three eggs over medium with bacon hash browns and toast...... She loved it eggs cooked perfectly,  bacon was fantastic..... Even had a little kick on the back....... There is nothing we can complain about with regards to this place...... If you from out of town and don't wanna pay $40 for two people to eat breakfast at one of the casinos...... We did that...... Come to this place........ Its truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Despite being a little challenging to find (the signage is not the best), this was a great hole in the wall locals joint that was reasonable with its breakfast options. I got the breakfast special and this was just enough food for me not to feel overall stuffed. This included two pancakes, two strips of bacon and choice of eggs. My boyfriend got the sausage, biscuits and gravy, which I tasted and was also pretty good. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Cute little diner and service was good.  Read the reviews and expected more. Very inexpensive but breakfast was kind of tasteless.  Based on reviews I'm willing to try again - maybe just an off day. Will try lunch instead."}
{"text":"Super reasonable prices - especially for the Strip - great diner atmosphere - very friendly people!!!! A great find!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, if it weren't for  trusty Yelpers, I would never get to the good stuff. My mom and I were on a quest for breakfast food after our girls night out. We stopped at another popular breakfast staple on the strip, but the wait time was over an 1.5 hour. Buh bye. Not in the morning. So I do like any Yelper and hop on and see this place with great reviews. Put the car in drive and ride!   I had my maps on and would have missed the place! It blends right in with the building. As we pull up we both looked at each other and I read a review that headlined, \"Don't let the outside fool you. There is a hidden gem.\" So we shrugged our shoulders and in we went.   We walked into an old fashioned diner with pink booths, surrounded old time memorabilia and smiling faces as they greeted us. Not to mention no hour long wait. Although I could see there being one. We got to sit where we wanted and I ordered my usual grilled cheese with the home potatoes and my mom got pancakes, house potatoes, and 2 eggs. We both got a lot of potatoes. And I lovvvveee potatoes so I was happy. The cheese was melted perfectly too. My mom really enjoyed her meal. We were both satisfied and satiated without breaking the bank. Our total bill was about $20.   Can't beat excellent service. You can tell some of the people are regulars there. I can see why as the food was delicious and the people working there are extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Found out about this lil gem on Yelp. I can honestly say that I wanna take a nap here in the parking lot.......I am that full right now. The chili-burger was on point,chili-cheese fries were delicious and the onion rings were outstanding. Today is definitely NOT OUR LAST TIME EATING HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food came fast and tasted great as well! This is a tasty homestyle diner and i would recommend coming here. The food is better than half the food at the restaurants in the casinos on the strip!"}
{"text":"I have never walked in to restaurant in my life and been treated like this. 6 of us walked into the diner to be greeted with these words \" great, look what just walked in! I knew I shouldn't have opened my mouth\" from the white trash waitress on staff. This was at 745p on a Friday night with a half empty restaurant. I could half way understand if it was close to closing time, but this is a 24 hr diner. Avoid."}
{"text":"Just what anyone would expect from a classic diner. The food is good the price is better. A great value for breakfast or lunch. Very nostalgic."}
{"text":"Huge burgers at great prices. It's just a simple diner. Don't expect anything but down to earth service and cheap & easy eats. The Vicki burger is hands down my absolute favorite burger. It's insanely crave-worthy. The location and cleanliness does leave much to be desired, but if you're not a fan of greasy old school diners, just order your food for pick-up or delivery."}
{"text":"Skip Denny's and go to Vickie's! Large portions, small prices, and the food is really good. I had the biscuits and gravy and it was amazing. Also had the French toast and that was great. Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I would have given it less if they weren't so friendly.  It may have been my fault for ordering a salad at a diner, but I've had good luck in the past.  Also, there is a menu section for salads with more than a few, so I figured it would be OK.  The Chef's Salad had browning iceberg lettuce, american cheese (only type of cheese), the cucumbers were definitely old, and the ham was extremely salty, way more salty than most ham.  The breakfast options looked pretty good, so I don't wanna bash the place over a bad salad, but it was definitely not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of downtown area diners in any city,and I have seen more than a few. Vickies has everything I expected and then some. There is the line of booths and bar seats near an open kitchen and a brilliant cook,or as I like to call him,the city chef. Vickie is as warm as her staff,and makes you feel like you have been coming for years on your first day. The food is portioned for the working class hunger,and has a high class taste of everything you compared to how mom used to make it. This is my spot everytime im downtown. Please stop in for a home cooked diner downtown experience."}
{"text":"I freaking loooooove this Place... Come let your tummy enjoy this food...  Chocolate M. Thunder ~"}
{"text":"Recently, my wife and I stopped here to see how it was with the new owner. I had a Patty Melt that was fantastic.  We met Vicki, the owner. Very nice lady. The waitress was very good. I was the first native Las Vegan that she had met.  The service was great and the food was fantastic. Oh yes, don't forget to try the onion rings. It was fun to see the waitress chatting with the regulars and watching the cook with the old style grill. Give it a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Have been wanting try this place for some time now, finally got the chance and it was well worth it. From the outside not to speak of a corner window with a door that leads into a long narrow diner. has an opening to the store next door as you enter to your right.  nothing fancy but has a nice welcome feeling. we went in about 10 pm on a Thursday. There where a few people at the counter. we sat ourselves and with in minutes where served water and greeted us and took our drink order. There was only 2 guys working both tag teaming on the grill.. both sporting the typical white diner aprons, which I found went with the theme 100%. the main cook came over to take our order and then returned to the grill. I like that it is all open and you can watch as the make the food. He had it down. By this time the place was filling up a bit but neither one of the 2 missed a beat. I have to say this place has the best food, its diner food and made like diner food.. served hot right off the grill.. i was impressed that they served the food as it was done didn't hold it on a pass till all of the order was complete. They have some wonderful looking deserts but was to full to try anything this visit. Prices are very reasonable for the food you get. I wish I had gone in alot sooner.. This may end up my goto place."}
{"text":"Fresh homemade food. Clean and super friendly. Vickie is amazing and very hospitable."}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say.... other than, GO somewhere else.  If, you do decide to stop in. ORDER THE FRENCH FRIES, and the burger delux, without the bun. A better option than the Salisbury steak meal my boys friend ordered. Lentil soup wayyyyy too salty, mashed potatoes, flavorless white goo..."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The prices are great and large plates.  Had to wait for a seat but staff kept coming over to keep us updated. Water and coffee was never allowed to get empty.  A must stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and everything you would like a 24 hour Vegas diner to be. From the decor to the open kitchen, and watching the guy on the grill work thru the tickets in anticipation of my order only added to the appeal.  I ordered the Manhattan burger which is a 1/2 lb patty with American cheese and bacon that comes on sourdough with fries all for $8.95.   The bread was toasted to perfection on the grill and the burger was cooked just the way I ordered medium well.  Extremely filling meal the French fries were great as well. Only thing missing was a beer to wash it all down.  I ended up with a fountain drink perhaps next time I'll try a milkshake.    Staff was polite and super busy but made sure to refill my drink and check during the meal.  I have already recommended this place to my friends and will be back for a breakfast, lunch or the occasional after midnight meal.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Get little place just out of the strip area so not to crazy good parking, great food, friendly staff and great prices. This will be my goto spot for when I want to eat at a diner. They are open 24/7."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this Vickie's before making the long drive back to Phoenix. I must say the food was great and so was the waitress, very tentative. I will defiantly be back when I visit Vegas. Thanks Vickie for the great service!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years! Since it was actually named tiffany's. The prices went up and the name change isn't what I agree one but is still a gem to me. The patty melt and chicken fingers are my go to. Most def one of the best all American diners I've been to. Best place to hit up for late nights in vegss"}
{"text":"The owner was unfriendly and not helpful. If you work in the service industry you should probably be able to speak to people in somewhat decent manor. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  The service was excellent and don't let the hole in the wall fool you. The food was delicious and the portions are big enough for two people"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp for a late night meal away from the strip.  Clean, quaint and good food. Our server was Julie and she was efficient, friendly and in top of the orders and refills. She was helpful and patient.   Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Vickie's Diner is really good.  Our server was funny really nice!!! I will tell my friends to go eat there!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for breakfast and great atmosphere. They have always treated us when we come in like family. I also love the fact that they deliver to my work!!! Who doesn't love a 24/7 spot that delivers hot food!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food is great with huge portions at a reasonable prize! we met the owner Vickie and she was so charming and pleasant, the staff are all great,  helpful  and kind! I highly recommend this place and will come back for more!"}
{"text":"There's no reason to ever go to IHop or Denny's with Vickie's Diner.   The staff is always super friendly and accommodating, day or night. This is the local spot to go,  The food is a bit better than the standard greasy spoon fare- nothing that will win awards, but it's always consistently as good as you expect it to be, or better. (I've eaten here dozens of times). And if it's not, they will happily correct it immediately.   Smaller, cozier place. I wouldn't go with more than 6 people, and that's pushing it, as it's narrow.  Servers tend to be more mature, 50+ locals, which I like. It's reflected in their attentiveness and professionalism.   Great place to have some late night coffee talk too.   My only complaint -might- be that it's VERY BRIGHT. So if you're looking for grub after a late night of drinking, you might want to wear shades coming in here.  Support local businesses. This is not corporate owned or even a fanchise. It's a mom & pop, and a great one. Possibly the last good, 24hr greasy spoon left in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just finished ground round steak dinner and pumpkin pie. It was a good home cooked meal..just a 5 minute walk from Stratosphere. Friendly service and lots of drink refills.  Breakfast menu looks good."}
{"text":"Good food good prices topped off with very nice staff! Score!!! The pork chops and eggs are definitely worth it! Highly recommend this place! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Checked into the Stratosphere in the afternoon and we were really hungry. The hotel food was real expensive. Looked on the phone for a place to eat near by and found Vickie's Diner. W e got there around 8pm, it was my wife and I and our 15 year old son. We sat at a booth and a began going through the menu. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak, wife got the Fish and Chips, my son had a Cheese burger. We also ordered a baket of Onion Rings. All of the food was delicious! Big portions.The Fries were doubled fried for extra crunchiness! The Cheese Steak had a ton of meat!. The Fish and Chips were great, they were Cod Pieces fried up. If we were to be on that side of town again we would definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"This breakfast spot is a hidden gem located on the strip.  We are here for a week and have been here twice! Good food at a great price with unbelievable hospitality. Thanks Julie for being so friendly, attentive and such a great waitress! You keep that coffee coming!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be for a casual original diner feel in vegas. The menu is large but we stopped in for breakfast and sat counter side. Everyone is friendly and you really feel like you're eating breakfast with your family. Portions are large but the cost isn't. Thanks guys for a tummy filling breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food is horrible! I'm serious, I can't even attempt to try to explain how horrible it is. I will never return here!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!! Our office decided to order it for lunch one day as it was recommended to us by a co-worker.  We were not disappointed.  So much food for a reasonable price.  The burgers were made to our liking (med, well, etc). Not to mention, they're massive in size.  I will def be going back and bringing my family.  Great Job.  You guys have a new fan."}
{"text":"I took my family here for breakfast. The chicken fried steak was delicious. Vickie herself greeted us and even took pictures with us.   Absolutely loved this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super friendly staff, very clean, and amazing veggie omelette. Oh, and if you're broke, you could literally eat here for every meal and it would be less than if you went to the grocery store. It's in a weird location, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I came here one early morning with my dad. The service was very strange. We walked in and we're told we can sit wherever we want. A man came up to use and gave us more menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I had to repeat myself a few times so he could understand me but he got my order down eventually. The cook came up to us and ask what we wanted to eat. He was wearing cotton gloves with the fingertips cut off. Food safety isn't a big deal here. When our food arrived we were surprised. HUGE portions which is good. They only checked up on us once so we didn't really get great customer service. At the end of the night it was only $29 for 3 people. Not too bad. Idk if I would recommend this place just as a regular spot but if your in the area and are really hungry would recommend."}
{"text":"1) this place is a bit hard to find since its in the corner, but I promise the food is AMAZING!  2) when we first arrived the staff and owner were so pleasant and greeted us when we first walked in.  3) super cheap and extremely attentive. They were constantly on top of our coffee refill and ensured everything was to our liking. We ordered the breakfast special of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 pieces of bacon. Not realizing it doesn't come w home fries, we asked if we could change the order to have home fries and Vickie was sweet enough to take care of us.   They're open 24/7, 365. I AM DEFINITELY COMING BACK!! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and the staff are friendly and good workers.  I eat here approximately once a week as it is in the lunch rotation.  I've tried various sandwiches, salad, pork chops, and breakfast dishes, all of which have tasted great.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While on the strip with an out of town visitor, we were looking for a diner for breakfast. Vickie's came up on Yelp with excellent reviews and we decided to check it out. On the outside, this place looks sketchy as hell and maybe if you're a snob, the inside isn't the fanciest, but Vickie's is awesome. We were instantly seated at the counter in hot pink diner swivel chairs and given menus and had our drink orders taken.   I got one of their breakfast combos with eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes. It was A LOT of food. I couldn't finish it all, or even come close to be honest. I got my eggs scrambled with cheese and my only complaint was that they melted the cheese on top rather than scrambling it in with the eggs. But whatever, everywhere does it differently and that's no big deal. Like any great diner, the food was greasy, the menu was somewhat limited, and the kitchen is open for you to watch them do everything.   Don't come here expecting fancy. If you want a diner that's got less personality to it, go to the Denny's next door. But if you want a good meal with a ton of food at a very reasonable price, check out Vickie's!"}
{"text":"Decent diner w/good hearty breakfast and dinners.  Just as good as the old Tiffany's in the White Cross Drug Store.  Some strange clients but spacious booths and counter seating.  Nice omelettes and lunch specials.  Little bit of a greasy spoon.  Good coffee."}
{"text":"This is my husband (Randy Heaton)'s favorite breakfast spot!  I've gone with him a few times (I'm not much of a breakfast person), and I agree, it's a great place.  It's comfort food at it's best.  Friendly people, great food, large portions, nice prices, and old time Vegas atmosphere....doesn't get much better than that.  We've lived in Las Vegas for 28 years and have been coming here for all these years."}
{"text":"Great place off the strip for breakfast. Good food, fast service and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I've been in Las Vegas since 1979 and have always loved the food here.  Vicky who now owns the Diner is awesome.  The food is great and the Diner is a hidden gem and recommend it to anyone....give it a try."}
{"text":"I love Vickie's and their burgers! The Tiffany and the Manhattan burgers are my favorites. I alway get them med rare- which makes them a little messy, but better in my opinion. I am sad that they close at 6 pm now Monday through Thursday. That severely cuts down my ability to go."}
{"text":"Always the perfect spot when you want a good sized portioned meal and not trying to pay a fortune. Always satisfied with the breakfast country fried steak!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  My personal favorite is the Patty Melt, followed by the Country Fried Steak Dinner and Breakfast.  If you're looking for a good, down to earth café, this is definitely the place, and for being so close to The Strip, the prices aren't bad either.  This place blows away Denny's, IHOP, Carrows...whatever!  The staff is amazing as well and this should definitely be a place you eat at once a week, or at least once if you're visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Dump..... came in sat at the counter and waited Bunch employees  standing around doing nothing Nobody approach me for service.. finally got up and left...."}
{"text":"Juciest burger of my life. Super thick and big patty fulfilled my hunger. I got my burger with just lettuce and tomato and thats all you need my friend."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.   My wife had the pancake special and I had the corned beef hash and eggs.  Reasonable and nice diner atmosphere.   We will be back next time we come to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall diner with good food for cheap prices. I recommend the Sausage and Eggs which comes with a side of home fries and toast/English muffin. If you order lunch, the fries are a tasty side!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good....but the real pleasure is the atmosphere and the personal touch from Vickie and her staff... don't waste your time at Dennys next door"}
{"text":"Super dinner Américain comme je les adores, ingrédient frais, ainsi que le café bref un must!"}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere was great! Vicki was actually our waitress. I loved everything about the place. It was a nice little place for the area. Nothing fancy, flashy, just good food. I had eggs, home fries and a biscuit. It rocked. If ur staying at the far end if the strip or a local go and support a small local business!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with the family during a weekend in Vegas. Small, old fashioned diner type. Not very many vegan options, but they were as accommodating as they could be. The food I had was yum! My family said there food was good, and their portions were huge! Staff very nice and hard working!"}
{"text":"This is an old fashioned diner with great people and down right good food.  Portions are perfect, prices are excellent. I recommend two items.  The pork chop breakfast and the ground round breakfast."}
{"text":"Truly a great place for whatever you're craving.  The menu is simple, well organized and easy to understand. Service is awesome. Owners are really sweet."}
{"text":"My go to neighborhood diner. Breakfast 24/7 and plenty of other options. The food quality is good, kitchen is clean and the service is fast.To me, this is the perfect 24/7 diner. Prices are reasonable."}
