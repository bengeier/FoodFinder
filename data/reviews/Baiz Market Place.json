{"text":"Shopping experience was great at Baiz Market. Specially HALAL meat shopping.. All the meat items were fresh and the staff was also very friendly. Mr. Hussain from Meat department listened to all our queries and also helped select right kind of meat from many varieties available there.Really appreciate his help. Will love to go there again. Also don't forget to try Chicken Swarama or Kebbab after your shopping, Its too yummy."}
{"text":"8 different kinds of olives prices range from $2.69-4.99/lb, great deal because they are $8.99/lb in the regular grocery store.
Pair them up with fresh feta and pita and you're set."}
{"text":"Mediterranean restaurant inside a Mediterranean grocery store.  I had the best Beef shawarma ever here."}
{"text":"I can never go back! I'm so disappointed because they no longer accept call-in orders and wouldn't give an explanation as to why. I've offered to pay over the phone and they still wouldn't take my order. They will lose business because of this and that's unfortunate, because they have the best mediterranean food around. I'm craving hummus but can't spend over 30 minutes of my lunch hour waiting for food in the restaurant. :( 

Why baiz?!? Why???"}
{"text":"First Visit Expierienc

4 star on variety of items on the shelves

1 star on the beef shwarma in the restaurant-chewy, fatty, dry, tasteless little scorched pieces of meat on top of rice--Enough said!!

Go shopping but skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great butcher shop. Friendly staff and they have a large selection of international goods."}
{"text":"Hummus, pita, dates, and Vimto!  Such a great place to add some variety in your grocery shopping.  Baiz really caters to the local neighborhood and provides great deals for fruit, veggies, spices, and pita!  Can you beat $.50 cent pita bread baked fresh daily?!

There is also a tasty restaurant to pick up shawarma, falafel, and all honey pistachio treats.

If you've ever been to the middle east....this will whisk you back to fond memories."}
{"text":"The butcher counter here is amazing. You can get lamb, beef, and chicken--and they have liver, tongue, kidneys, tripe, and anything else you might need that you can't typically find at Safeway. The best part is that the meat is local and the beef is grass fed. The quality of the meat is excellent and the prices are reasonable--frequently lower than Safeway, which they easily pass in quality. If you want excellent, grass fed beef, you're way better off coming to Baiz than going to Whole Foods.

There's a little restaurant/cafe inside and they sell excellent thyme and spinach and meat pies, as well as shawarma (beef and chicken), hummus, fatoush salad, and lots of other excellent dishes. 

They also have really good deals on spices and lots of other Middle Eastern staples like feta, labna, dates, dried figs, orange and rose blossom water, pomegranate syrup, fresh mint leaves, goat cheese, and more. The bakery has fresh pita as well as injera (Ethiopian flat bread). I love this place, but the butcher counter really takes it to the next level."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out a few weeks ago considering I heard so much talk about how this is the mother of all middle eastern markets in phoenix. 
To be quite honest, I had much higher expectations- considering Ive visited middle eastern markets in other large cities across the U.S.
They are stocked up on just about all the middle eastern staples like dried nuts, beans, couscous, pickled lemons and various spices. 
At the mini restaurant in the market I tried the shawarma- the thing is if you cant get a proper shawarma down right then lets not go any further. 
It was okay, nothing spectacular or I'd drive out of my way to eat.
I guess if your in the area and need some middle eastern staples pass by."}
{"text":"Good food. Tried the lamb kabob plate and the roasted chicken. Both were good. The meat was tender on the chicken and the kabob had good flavor. Environment is good it's a mix of restaurant and grocery store."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times. Great food and inexpensive. Everything is good, but chicken shwarma and falafel are my favorite."}
{"text":"What a GREAT place to pick up some snacks or lunch on the way into or out of the airport. We flew in and out of Phoenix on either end of a car trip. We found this place on Yelp on the way into town, and stopped there again on the way back out because we loved it so much. It's 5-10 minutes from the airport by car. We especially loved the meat pies, the grape leaves, and the spinach pastries. Don't forget to get a tray of baklava from the sweets counter in the back - they were the perfect snack for a road-tripping family.

NOTE: the service is pretty slow. Try calling in your order 10-15 minutes before you get there. You might still have to wait in a line at the sandwich counter, but at least it'll save you a few minutes."}
{"text":"Although I would like to take the credit for finding this awesome little market and restaurant on my own, I can't... Tucked away on a side street just outside of the heart of Downtown Phoenix, Baiz is one of those kinds of places that I just would have never stumbled across in my usual wanderings had I not been clued into its existence by my good friends over at CenPho.com.

With so much awesomeness crammed into such a small place, it's a little hard to decide where to start... Since it is the primary part of Baiz, I guess I'll start with the market... From the first second that I walked into the doors, I was washed over with a feeling that I've missed from my days of living in San Francisco where I would routinely go shopping in a variety of small and authentic ethnic markets. The shelves were fully-stocked with a huge variety of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean products: a multitude of tasty fruit preserves and jams, spices galore, tahini by the jar or bucket (and every size in-between) and even hot ajvar (a condiment that's held a special place in my heart ever since I discovered it in college).

But for me the real shining star of the market was the deli and baked goods section. With a glass case filled with an assortment of different kinds olives and cheeses (some of which I've never heard of before) that includes a variety of fresh feta cheeses, it was like love at first sight. But looking just left of the olives and cheeses made me even happier: stacks of fresh, daily-made pita, rows of baklava (honey-drizzled pastries), slabs of halawa (sesame candy), a bin of turkish delight (jellied fruit squares) and pans of mamoul (fruit-filled cookie bars) all seemed to be calling my name... Must... Resist... Temptation... Onto the restaurant.

So I know it's not exactly the most culinarily-complex dish to choose, but the epitome of good Middle Eastern fare for me is a falafel sandwich. And while it's not quite up to the level of my all-time favorite from Falafel Drive-In in San Jose, CA (pretty close, though), Baiz definitely makes the best falafel sandwich that I've tried so far in the Phoenix area (and I have tried a few). The falafels were flavorful with a great texture (crunchy on the outside yet tender on the inside) and served with lettuce, turnips, tomatoes and tahini inside a fresh pita (I like to add in some hot sauce as well)... A quick side note: you'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal for lunch in the Downtown Phoenix area ($3 for a wonderfully tasty and filling meal).

Although I haven't yet had the opportunity to try too many of the other dishes that the restaurant has to offer (dolmades, hummus, savory pies, etc.) due to the fact that I'm usually too full after the sandwich, I have tried the baba ghannouj, spinach pie and cheese pie. The baba ghannouj has a wonderful smokey flavor and great taste without being overly-infused with garlic. The \"small\" plate was definitely big enough for 2-3 people to share. The spinach and cheese pies were also great. Made fresh there at the restaurant, all their savory pies are handmade.

So if you're ever in need of some tasty Middle Eastern/Mediterranean  ingredients or feel like chomping down on an awesome falafel sandwich, check out Baiz in Phoenix. I think you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I can't go near central Phoenix without a visit to Baiz Market. They have everything from fresh baked pita bread to string cheese to Middle-Eastern pastries to a full grown grocery and meat section. Their selection includes foods from the Middle-east, Europe, Africa, and Asia. There has yet to be a spice that I have not found there. 

My favorite part is the small cafe with fresh food and loads of garlic. You can watch your food being made and pulled from the hot oven. I've had just about everything  but my top recommendations are: chicken shawarma, falafel, and manaeesh (both the za'atar (thyme) and cheese (jubna) varieties are excellent), I have not tried the meat version."}
{"text":"Delicious food that tastes like legit middle eastern food at their little cafe and a market full of hidden treasures. We bought several items for a Greek night we hosted at our home and guests raved about everything we bought there including the Baklava which was a huge hit. 12 people are almost an entire large tray it was so good!"}
{"text":"I ventured to Baiz Market with a few of my my friends and boy was it worth the trip!  Al-Hana, the restaurant inside, is the ultimate hole in the wall!  The hummus is so good I could seriously bathe in it.  I had the Chicken Taook which was amazing especially the garlic dip that accompanies it!  I also tried a meat pie for only $.69!  How could I resist?

Because we went on a Tuesday night things were pretty quiet.   We wondered the grocery store after dinner and picked out sweets by the pound when we were done with dinner, this only added to the charm!

I would definitely recommend checking this place out!  Make sure you have time to peruse the store and order the hummus whether you think you like hummus or not!"}
{"text":"Great place to find eastern Mediterranean and Middle East groceries. Love the cheeses, fruits and vegetables, meats and bakery. My favorite thing to do is order food from Al-Hana when I arrive (middle eastern cafe on site) and my take out is ready when I am ready to check out. I love the multicultural environment, people from the Caribbean, Muslims, Christians, Hindus..."}
{"text":"Great Place, the food is delicious ! And it's great that you can eat in the shop!  Price are really affordable. If you like Mediterranean food go to this place !"}
{"text":"Want high quality lamb for a good price? Go to Baiz Market. 
Want middle eastern or Eastern European spices and sauces? Go to Baiz Market.
Want awesome little meat pies? 
Inexpensive wrap for lunch? 
Awesome flatbreads?
This place is a great neighborhood grocery focusing on middle eastern flavors. Don't be afraid to ask questions, the workers there are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this market for Middle Eastern/Indian food supplies. Pickled turnips, cheap phyllo, spices galore! I'm in heaven. The pastries and pita for sale are equally delicious. I've yet to try the butcher, but will be back soon to hopefully get some high quality halal meat. The best part thus far--eating at the restaurant inside the grocery.

If there was a 4.5, they'd win it...simple cafe inside Baiz Market. I ordered entirely too much food to-go and was not disappointed by the price or taste!! Large hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli (entire package of house-made pita included) + falafel wrap and shawarma wrap = about $30 and is enough food to eat as leftovers for days. 

Best of the best was the baba ghanoush. You can really taste the roasted/charred quality of the eggplant and it is balanced perfectly with the tahini. I love the slight chunkiness of the puree that really highlights and respects the ingredients. (Grade: A+++)

The falafel sandwich/wrap was also AMAZING! Great balance of pickles, tomatoes, tahini, etc. Cheaper than the other wraps (though all are super cheap given the quality ingredients, this is about $4) and the staff favorite. (Grade: A)

I asked the gal taking my order what her next fav wrap and followed her suggestion of the chicken shawarma. This was certainly good, but I'll definitely stick with the falafel. (Grade: B+) 

Tabouli was also spectacular! I would have preferred a bit more lemon, but was pleasantly surprised that they didn't overload it with bulgar (huge pet peeve of mine). (Grade: A) 

Lastly, the hummus is flavored more strongly with tahini than other hummus I've tried from M.E. restaurants, but texture is fantastic and I'm a fan! I'd say it's a standard hummus that won't blow your socks off, but is still certainly delicious. If you are new to hummus, this is the perfect intro. (Grade: A-)

All and all, everything was well worth the trip, money and calories. The large sides fill up an entire full-size to-go box.  I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"They have the best middle eastern food! Great prices and everything is fresh! My favorite thing on the menu is the chicken shawarma! I advise everyone to come to Baiz!"}
{"text":"The store market seems like a great market that I'll need to check out at another time. But for my first visit to Baiz Market, I just went to the food counter to order some food.

I could comment on the mediocre service, but I really didn't care. I had a chicken shwarma sandwich and a small side of tabouli - which became a large when I realized that I needed to spend more than 10 bucks to use my debit card...I hate it when that happens. The sandwich was plain - a lot of meat, little of anything else. I know that the chicken should be the main player of the sandwich, but I like having enough of the other things as well. The tabouli was also good, but tasted like it was missing something...what, I don't know, but  I've had better.

All in all, I prefer other middle eastern restaurants in the valley, and so I'm not sure if I would choose here again for dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible! 
Let's start with the market: I bought a couple of pounds of what's supposedly 90% lean ground beef. 90%? Not even close! I would be generous to call it 70%. I could get cheap beef like that anywhere. I went to Baiz based on the positive reviews here, but the meat is greatly disappointing.
I also bought what's supposed to be basil. When I got home, I realized it was lemon leaves. Yes I'm serious! Baiz is that cheap and dishonest! I got fatty beef for the price of lean and lemon leaves for a little less than the price of basil.
Now to the restaurant, the food is terrible. I bought a cheese pie, a spinach pie, and a meat pie. The cheese is okay, the spinach is bland, and the meat is awful. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. I don't know where the great reviews are coming from, but perhaps I have higher standards for middle eastern food since I just moved from Michigan (Shatila, anyone?).
I'm giving two stars only because the pita bread is pretty good. Otherwise I would give only one star."}
{"text":"Great selection. Always fresh. The Al Hana food in store is just ok for me it doesnt beat family recipes. I do get the pre make the lamb kafta at the butcher which is awesome. Baklava is to die for. Best of all the have fresh grape leaves near the spring/summer months."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of ethnic grocery stores, and now I have a new favorite!

I stopped in today for the first time, just on a whim.  After wandering around the store and picking up a few interesting items, I decided to get lunch from their cafe.  I had a spicy meat pie and a lamb kebab wrap, and they were both phenomenal - I fear the meat pie may become a new addiction for me.

I had a few random questions about some products I was unfamiliar with, and everyone was polite and courteous, definitely a refreshing change from some of the other places I've shopped.  

The only challenge with the entire excursion was parking - they've got a very compact lot (and they're popular), so it was a challenge finding a spot that my truck could fit in.  On the upside, there's lots of streetside parking available.

Baiz Market, I'm glad to add you to my list of regularly-scheduled ethnic food destinations!"}
{"text":"I wanna give 5 stars to this place.
Because I order my lamb kabab and go shopping in the market , when I am done with shopping my food is ready to eat. 
I used to like food better but still good tho."}
{"text":"Excellent food with excellent price.

I really recommend their chicken, didn't try the beef yet.

Order the chicken shawarma (plate or sandwich) or order the roasted chicken, amaaaazing.

Order small sizes coz their plates are huge"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean Food! Wow this place is amazing! The beef shawarma is by far the best I have ever had and the beef pies are great too. Home made pickles make the rice plates even better. This is definitely not a fancy sit down restaurant but is actually an authentic Mediterranean market with a restaurant attached. Even though there are places to sit here, this is more of a take out place. You must try this place."}
{"text":"Super yum food :) We like to go here to purchase ingredients for our home dinners, but they have a restaurant that has amazing shawarma.!!"}
{"text":"I've found a new grocery shopping destination...and I think I may be in love. 

Sure, I don't know what half of the items on the shelves are used for, and I don't really care for dates, but there is just so much goodness in between the mystery items that it doesn't matter. I'm hooked. 

The produce is cheap and much better than the comparably cheap Ranch market nearby, and you just can't beat a package of freshly made pita for fifty cents. The spice array is dizzying, and I really want to find out what one does with Pomegranate syrup.  

One distinct advantage Baiz has over other markets is the meat counter. Where else in town can you get fresh lamb and goat? 

Baiz market is so great that it now has a place in regular rotation on our grocery outings. As a bonus, the Al-Hana restaurant inside is a great place to grab a cheap but excellent meal during the trip."}
{"text":"I was told about this grocery store/restaurant from a Coworker it's excellent across the board.  The meat section, baklava, pita bread, & restaurant are simply the best.  The meat is mainly Hilal which is similar to kosher.  

Clean, clean, omg clean,  I'm sorry did I say how clean it is.  The service & politeness of the staff makes me feel ok about the grocery store prices.  Lately going to the traditional grocery stores makes me feel angry about my shopping experience first the customers rude & then the staff incompetent.  Age [40's] I know plays a huge factor for me now remembering excuse me & parents who made sure their children were well behaved.  At this store I was pleased with even the customers total breath of fresh air. 

Now the restaurant nothing fancy being a Tempe native this is Phoenix' Haji Baba; for those who know about that wonderful middle eastern restaurant/grocery store but the go next level with fresh meat & a larger store option.  I recommend a visit shop & do lunch or dinner.

My food recommendations the chicken shawarma, grape leaves, & baklava; yummy."}
{"text":"While the restaurant inside this store is nothing particularly exciting to rave about (see my review), the store itself is the real gem.  

Compared to Haji Baba --- in my mind, the only real compeititor in the Valley --- which has a small, but very good selection of Middle Eastern and other \"affiliated\" foods, Baiz Market is much larger and has much more to choose from.  They have a variety of cheeses and lebni (labna) in the dairy area that is unmatched.  They also have a good selection of frozen lamb, whitefish and other goods, which are uncommon and very difficult to find in the Valley.  Finally, we bought a medium tray of mixed baklava to compare to Haji Baba's offering and they're quite superior.  I have no doubt, that, although not in a good neighborhood and very \"industrial\" looking, this grocery store is THE place to go for all kinds of Middle Eastern products.

It also doesn't hurt, that it's located in central Phoenix.  For those of us who live in the West Valley, that's a significantly shorter drive than trekking all the way to Tempe."}
{"text":"Great honey, baklava ingredients, nuts, jellies, cooking oils at unbelievable prices (the fancy stuff that is usually gimmicky overpriced at Wal-Mart Safeway&Fry's), health tahini butter, a variety of teas, and a nice selection of fresh vegetables---  butcher shop -,-and restaurant in one spot. 

The restaurant is savory- chicken shawarma sandwich /plate - very good!
This is an understated review, but this place has so much to offer."}
{"text":"I want to start saying that I'm new to Phoenix and I searched online and I decide to visit this place and my remarks about this place as the following: 
Restaurant: I have tried both beef and chicken shawarma; i didn't like the taste of their chicken shawarma so I wanted to try their beef shawarma; this is what I have to tell about their beef shawarma; 
They use the cheapest quality! Why??? Okay, here is why, I don't know if other people experience that, there is a lot of intramuscular fat in the meat which indicate that the animal stopped growing and they are putting way more fat in their body than what they need to. The more fat is collected in the muscle is going to be harder to trim, therefore the price of that meat is going to be cheaper because of the excess fat in the muscle tissues. This was the reason why I stopped buying that sandwich."}
{"text":"Once upon a time... when Cher was still Cheryl... I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.

When I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods. 

When we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?! 

The dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line. 

After our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave. 

We will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!"}
{"text":"In a town with arguably dozens of grocery options, Baiz is a unpolished gem. It's on an unassuming sidestreet and the exterior is a typical desert drab, but inside you will find high quality and very reasonably priced international groceries. Greek, Middle Eastern, Ethiopian, Indian and more. Most of the brands aren't immediately recognizable by Americans but that shouldn't be a deal-breaker. We're talking 99 cent hummus, 99 cent fresh baked pita,  condiments of every type and price, and great options for coffee and tea drinkers. This store is very awesome, and I would actually prefer to give this small business my bucks over national chain grocers. 

They also sell hookahs. Just saying."}
{"text":"The falafels are very good at Baiz. I got the platter of 12 falafels and four of us shared them at a picnic. The pita is huge and it comes with pickled radish, lettuce, tomato and tahini. I get hummus and Baba Ganoush as well. It was perfect for our picnic and so filling! The market is pretty awesome as well."}
{"text":"This place has some good middle eastern stuff and If it was not for their horrible customer service, I would have probably give them a 4 star. 
I've had a few bad experiences including the last one which was this: 

I purchased some brown rice from them (4x10-lb bags) a while ago and when I opened the 2nd bag, there were countless dead bugs inside! The 1st bag (and the other two) did not have this issue. So I took the bad rice back to the store to return. I did not have my receipt from 2 months ago. When I shared my experience with the customer service rep, they told me they can't accept the return because I don't have my receipt. I asked if I could talk to the manager and when she showed up, she said the same thing. She said we are not sure if this has happened prior or after the purchase. She also said they can't accept any returns without receipt because people may buy items from other stores and try to return to Biaz!

Anyhow, some thoughts:

1) I too am not sure if the bugs where there when I purchased or appeared afterwards. But I'd expect any reputable store in the US to honor my words for it (and time for bringing the item back to the store) and issue refund.
2) There are other ways to prevent fraudulent returns and it should not be very difficult to distinguish between an honest customer and someone who is making up a story. 
3) above all, the most successful stores are the ones with the mindset of: \"customer is always right\". You can't do big things thinking small. At the end of the day, that bag of rice (which I had to threw in trash) was only $14 or so. I think I've spent $1,000 over the last 10 years at Biaz (phx store and Mesa). I will probably still shop here but only when I have no other options (and with hesitance). Hope the management can improve the customer service."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place amazingly delicious Middle Eastern grub!!! The spinach and cheese pies and the Zatar spiced flat breads are so yummy!!! Haven't had the pita but I'm sure it won't fall behind everything else!!!"}
{"text":"Smack in the middle of a semi-depressed neighborhood, Baiz Market is a large Middle Eastern market stocked full of imported goods & other foodstuff, including freshly cut meat and Arabic pastries in the back.

The main draw for me to Baiz, though, is Al-Hana. Nestled in the front corner, Al-Hana is the mini-restaurant centered around a wood-fired oven and spits of beef and chicken shawarma waiting to be sliced off. I've gone there several times for their shawarma and it's gotta be the best in the Valley that I've had so far. Their chicken and beef shank kebab plate is also excellent - the meat is tender & juicy, not at all dry and gristly like many other places - and comes with a generous serving of hummus, salad, and a huge pita. You should also try their zaatar flatbread (ie. thyme pie) which on weekends is made fresh from the oven.

They've got a lot of veggie items as well, including the expected dolmas, tabbouleh, and falafels. The dining area is extremely casual and right next to the market checkout stands so don't expect anything fancy, but the food is really worth the drive over if you're hankering for Middle Eastern grub. And if that's not all, the prices are dirt cheap, too. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"They have everything! A deli, a bakery a halal meat counter and all kinds of amazing stuff from the Middle East -- check it out!"}
{"text":"Never again! 

I went here specifically for their meat department, however I was very very disappointed. when I ask for lean 90% ground beef, I expect LEAN bright red colored ground beef that has hardly any fat on it. 

The first time I bought the \"lean\" ground beef, I brought it home, took out to cook and thought, why is this so white? looks weird..well i cooked it anyway to find that half my pan was full of melted fat when i had hardly put any oil to begin with. Thinking maybe it was just a mistake, maybe they accidentally gave me the wrong meat, i didn't think to go back since i live about 30mi away. So, when I went back today, I made sure to check they were putting the 90% \"lean\" meat into the bag and giving me the correct one. Well, nevertheless, I come home to compare it to the one I previously bought and it's the exact same thing!! i've never seen ground beef look like that, let alone the \"lean\" one!

I also bought boneless chicken thighs, i brought it home, opened the bag and it stunk!! the chicken had completely gone bad! my first experience with spoiled chicken!  

i plan to never go back again!

--let me update my review and go from giving baiz 2 stars to just 1!
from the same trip as described above, i had also bought \"shish tawook\" which is the pre-marinated chicken..let me tell you, i ate that for dinner and was up all night for 3 days and spend 4 hours in the ER to find out that i had \"gastroenteritis\" (the stomach flu) from eating their contaminated chicken! I ended up throwing out $70 worth of chicken/beef.

FYI, STAY AWAY FROM THE MEAT DEPARTMENT!!!"}
{"text":"Now I know how non-Asians feel inside Lee Lee's...and the best part?  They sold me pure fat for 0.99cents a lb (best to call ahead, though I caught them in the middle of a butchering and they happen to have a slab handy to chop for me immediately), which is wonderful for adding into your own homemade sausages.  I used to purchase the fat pre-pckgd at Lee Lee's but could no longer find it in the past year, so I am glad to have discovered this place!"}
{"text":"Great store with all things middle eastern- the pita bread is the best in the valley and the in store restaurant is great!"}
{"text":"Baiz Market is a wonderful Middle Eastern grocery that has everything you can think of. We buy all our meats here and the butcher prepares it for you right then and there based on your requests (very lean, no fat, etc.). Their pita bread is baked fresh everyday with no preservatives. It is also super cheap, about 89 cents a bag but good quality. We always buy 10+ bags at a time and just freeze them because we live about 30 minutes away. They also have a wide variety of fresh cheeses, olives, sweets, and a restaurant in the front that serves Arabic foods. Ask for Abeer if you need any help when you're there! She is very helpful and treats you like a truly valued customer."}
{"text":"For the price, all of the following is true: Awesome butcher, awesome produce, awesome restaurant. Good selection of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean foods that you might have trouble finding elsewhere (ex. soujouk).  Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it's very hard to find however, it's hidden in the neighborhood but wow, they have a great selection of food and had everything I wanted and more! And the customer service is great and helpful, my new go to grocery spot thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Fresh peta bread and delicious marinated meats and fresh spinach pies. What else do you need!"}
{"text":"A very well hidden gem!  It was a chore to find this place (coming from the SR51), but once we did, we were happy to have found it!.  

This place is hidden in the Ghetto, but the food is excellent!  My wife said that it was the best falafel she had had in a VERY long time.  The hummus was fresh and tasty.  The steak \"sandwich\" (which was a wrap)

The pita bread was awesome...  They have a meat and pastry counter in the back of the store...the baklava was soooo yummy!

...oh and the portions are LARGE!!


4.5 stars!   -0.5 because of the location :P"}
{"text":"We recently moved from Texas and found this store in search of halal meat. It is a busy place on weekends and the cafe inside the store is amazing and cheap . we bought ethnic groceries and meat and this place is already added to my weekly grocery shops list."}
{"text":"I have been shopping here for years. They have the best prices in town, and the best quality produce. I typically fill my cart with produce for less than $40. The staff is super sweet, everyone remembers my husband and I each time we come in. Lots of very unique things from toiletries to spices. Check out the restaurant also. Best falafel ever."}
{"text":"What a great little market! I was excited to finally find a new ethnic shop to use, and man did I hit the jackpot!  The restaurant, Al Hana, is really great as well. They have a great butcher in the back of the store, all the pastries you could ever want and even a huge hookah case, if that's your bag. If your looking for a great ethic shopping experience, this is it!"}
{"text":"This market has the BEST lamb anywhere I have found in the Phoenix area and the prices are extremely good. I love the meat department here and would recommend it to anyone looking for the best quality meat at the best prices."}
{"text":"Baiz is a large ethnic supermarket that provides an amazing array of food items including produce, butcher shop, canned goods and a small deli department.  Lots of middle eastern items, of course, but many, many items needed in anyone's pantry.  Bought French Feta cheese (love, love Feta) after choosing from several types (but only after first getting a taste of course!)  Bought 3 different kinds of olives at bargain prices ----chose from 10 types which were available.  Just had to get the basmati rice in a 10 pound bag since regular supermarkets charge so much per pound.  It was indeed a bargain.  Figs, dates, honey ---all reasonable priced.  And now here's the BONUS.........
I had lunch with my granddaughter at the little counter in the front of the store.  Two delicious sandwiches for less than $10.--chicken schwarma and falafel.  Wow, were they great and fresh, fresh, fresh.  
This ethnic market is not to be missed."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - full service grocery of Persian/Mediteranean products, delicious food ready-to-eat at the cafe.  Why pay more to go anywhere else?  Baiz has what you need!  Pita, Hummus, Baklava, Falafel, tahini, mmmmm....."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food in the city. In the back of a humble market, this little shop has the best shawarma I have found since my last trip to Israel."}
{"text":"I do not think I would have ever tried this on my own. I really didn't know what to order or would have ever guessed that there is a restaurant in the grocery store! I had the beef shawarma platter at the suggestion of a coworker. AMAZING! It was about $12 for the food and drink and I ended up having lunch and then a small but decent lunch the next day for myself and boyfriend! The portions are huge! The food was very much like the Lebanese food I had in London. Service was a little slow for the lunch rush and there are only a handful of tables but we took it back to the office but were rushed because of some large orders in front of us. 

Explored the store for just a few seconds while waiting for food. Really unique stuff most of which I don't even know what to do with! But I am sure if you are looking for specialty items, this is the place!"}
{"text":"For those of you who complain about there not being a good middle eastern market in downtown Phoenix, then surely, you are not looking hard enough. Easily comparable to Tempe's Haji-baba, the Baiz Market is nestled in between the outskirts of the Roosevelt neighborhood downtown. It is a Lebanese grocery store with a small cafe, deli, and bakery. Need an afternoon falafel fix? Baiz is the most authentic you can get in downtown-- and for super cheap, too! Tasty gyros, chicken shwarma sandwiches, and pastries too. Their spinach pie is also worth a try. The market itself if perfect for those who want choice guts of goat or lamb- probably one of the only places you can get it in town. And of course, a Lebanese favorite, cases of glass botttled Orange Crush."}
{"text":"If this place wasn't 10miles from my house I would frequent it all the time!! I went on the road trip here seeking Pomegranate Molasses...yes it is a thing.  They had 4 kinds to choose from!  Mind you I had been to Fry's Marketplace, Whole Foods and Trader Joes trying to find the stuff!  As a side note the Trader Joes 'guy' told me to come here after doing a bit of googling!  FYI Pomegranate Molasses is $27 on Walmart's website!!! At Baiz they have four kinds ranging from $2.49-3.99!  So they are extremely reasonable.  The vegetables section is very fresh with a great variety of vegetation.  If you are making anything from scratch Baiz has amazing ingredients and obscure items to make exotic dishes!  The customer service was very friendly; there were only two cashiers open and decent lines.  But really no big deal, I was tantalized by the yummy looking foreign chocolate bars surrounding the register, but somehow managed to resist!  

Just being in Baiz Market inspires me to want to cook more!!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern food to eat in or take out. Also an almost full size grocery store with reasonable prices. It's a little hidden in a neighborhood, and parking can be tight at lunch."}
{"text":"I adore this locally owned market tucked away on 20th street in central phoenix.  Clean and well organized, from the parking lot all the way through.  Mighty diverse  for its size, with its own bakery, butcher and a little cafe (where you can find the fresh hummus, pies, pita bread, kabob and gyros platters large enough to share..  International flavors with an emphasis on middle eastern.  Flatbreads, cheeses, baklava.  Their produce section is a little weaker but perfectly serviceable if you get a little picky.  I wish they had something besides shamrock brand milk (they do have a ton of yogurt drinks which maybe you are supposed to use the same way as milk - anybody know?). Here is the best part.  We went for lunch and the entire bakery aisle was full + there were about 50 whole chickens in the butcher case.  I returned the same night after 6 pm to do grocery shopping and found about 10 packages of flatbread remaining, with a sign directing customers to the freezer section.  Over on the butcher side the 50 chickens were completely GONE and the butcher was busy cutting more.  No doubt I got a fresh one and it is encouraging to see them doing such a brisk business.  Planning to make this my summer go to grocery store to keep my dollars local!  Sure they are missing some of the traditional grocery store staples but it will be fun to invent new dishes with what is here.  A perfect place to shop on your staycation and make ethnic food 'as if' you were there!

Ps the parking lot has these faux log tree posts that made me smile and wonder what the heck this building used to be....some kind of western saloon or?  Reminded me of something you might see at the old knotts berry farm back in the days before roller coasters, when they were known for fried chicken, jam, burro rides and panning for gold.  If I see a burro tied to one of these hitchin' posts someday I wouldn't  bat an eye."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best middle eastern food in Arizona (yes, even Pita Jungle..).


Go to the counter and order cheese bread and schwarmas.  Little area to eat and great place to people watch.  Very diverse crowd from literally all over the globe.  The rice is the best!"}
{"text":"Baiz Market is part Middle Eastern market, Lebanese cafe and pita bread factory. We found out about this little Middle-Eastern gem through a friend and headed over there for lunch. 

The cafe serves everything from shawarma to tabouli along with authentic Middle Eastern refreshments. We had the chicken shawarma, tabbouleh and hummus. All were fantastic and reminded me of dinners with our Afghani friends. The The market carries a wide-selection of Middle Eastern and European foods along with fresh meats, vegetables and a bakery.

Baiz is a little off the beaten path, so to speak, but worth the drive to find it and enjoy some wonderful Middle Eastern delights."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was great and the quality/quantity are incredible considering the cost. My friend and I split a chicken shwarma plate. The meat was well flavored and the naan was fresh,"}
{"text":"Coming here is a must for ingredients that are hard to find when cooking middle eastern dishes. The meat counter has a variety of  meat and will cut anything to order, as well as fresh vegetables and breads  that are baked daily. They carry a large variety  of teas, cookies, dried fruit, olives, spices, rice, olive oils and more. I could go on and on about all the yumminess down each isle. But really go check it out and you won't regret it. 
We also come here for the little restaurant up front by the registers. The falafel sandwich is hands down the best you will find in the valley. It comes with tahini sauce, pickled beet, lettuce and tomato wrapped in a warmed thin bread. Seriously this is no joke how delicious it is. I have had falafel at many restaurants and none compare. Their Kefta ,Iraqi kabob and shawarma are also very well done and delish. We also really enjoy the tabouli salad. All in all it's a great experience coming here. The staff is welcoming and the store is well stocked and clean.  Go, visit, and tell your friends. 
Also a side note the New Baiz in Mesa is much larger and nice as well, but the restaurant is not the same. I would only recommend coming to this location for hot food.-Cheers!"}
{"text":"Some of the best lamb kabob one can get in the phoenix metropolitan area ... reasonable priced and freshly made .."}
{"text":"Great place to shop at when you're needing ingredients to make some homemade Middle Eastern food. They have several choices and brands of everything you could desire. Just pick out some tasty recipes at home and bring in your shopping list.

Normally get the ingredients to make fresh Tzatziki, Hummus, and some Beef and Lamb Gyros or Kabobs. Last time picked up some Jordanian Green Zaatar. Saw them make it on a DDD show. Just mix it with some olive oil and add a little chopped onion and tomato. Really good on freshly toasted pitas or even English muffins.

My favorite here is the amazing butcher section with all the different cuts of the lamb. Hearts, livers, kidneys, tongue, rocky mountain parts, and even the head. The Chicken case also looked nice and got my attention.

Nice Pita Bread selection and then some. Had to pick up a few extras to put in my freezer. You can even use these to make personal size pizzas by adding a little sauce and some cheese. Cool project for the kids when they are needing a treat.

Looking forward to trying their restaurant on my next visit. It always smells good and is packed with hungry people. Had several Yelp friends recommend it. Hi Guys!

Kinda tucked away in a small neighborhood off the freeway. Place gets really busy and parking can be tricky. This place is like a top secret OASIS in the Desert. TOUCHDOWN!

4 STARS"}
{"text":"it's a good market, where you can find what you are looking for (MOST OF THE TIME), some product just come and go and that is not good.
problem that he is the only market that provide fresh pita bread :("}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!! Its not only a market, its also a restaurant, their Beef Shawerma is UNBELIEVABLE! and their service is great, If you shopping for mid-eastern arabic food you can find almost anything there, from Tahini to Molokhiya *traditional Egyptian food*

The neighborhood its in is not very good but thats ok!

again TRY THE BEEF SHAWERMA!"}
{"text":"Great Market. People are friendly and helpful. I love their home made flat breads, garlic spread and baba ghanosh. A real must go place."}
{"text":"I'm moving in. The end. This is the most authentic shop (of any variety) that I've seen since I moved to Arizona. It reminds me of the mercados I used to hit up in VA in that it has everything, hookahs to religious art, and of course food. 

The bakery was a mystery to me. I pointed at a few things, have since tried two of them, and I have no idea what they are. But I like them. There is a huge section devoted to turkish delights, as I sadly found out after making my purchases. Great cheeses! Massive quantities of dried fruits, nuts, olives and canned meats. 

If you see me brushing my teeth in aisle 4, please don't mess up my cot in aisle 2. Thanks."}
{"text":"Great place. You definitely aren't going to find this place casually driving around town.   If your looking for ambiance this isn't your spot. If you want unique, great food, then this is your place.  You will leave full and feel like you learned a bit about different cultures."}
{"text":"The location is a bit far from me but I still tend to come here often. They have good food and great service. I hope they can open more locations that are closer. Thank You Baiz"}
{"text":"Hands down best Middle Eastern Food ive ever had. Everything was authentic and fresh. So delish! Highly recommend this spot!

*Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"If you love an exotic grocery store with hard-to-find items from the Middle East and India, this is your place. We walked around wondering why no one had told us about this place for years!! It's tucked away in a downtown neighborhood that's def off the beaten track, but an amazing find. There is a counter to order hot foods--hummus with meat and delicious eggplant Baba ghanoush. The check out lines on a Saturday morning were quite long but everyone was polite and a few even let me go ahead of them. Basically, there is some waiting and I fear parking, at times, can be problematic. But, as Arnold says, We Will Be Back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this market. It is located in a not-so-good neighborhood, but the openness and foot traffic makes up for it, lol. Do not let the area deceive you to what you can get inside. It is not located in a prime area, but this place is great! Their food is yummy and fast service! Many selections in their grocery area. The meats are excellent! The bakery offers a variety of goodies! I enjoy that the butchers are well-knowledged in cuts of meats. They were featured on the Cooking Channel, congrats! A second location is on it's way in Mesa."}
{"text":"3 dishes: Grape Leaves, Chicken and Beef Shwarma

I blame myself for the grape leaves. They are meant to be eaten cold, and I did not know that all they contained was rice. I was not a big fan.

The rice was good, but the chicken and beef were just okay. It wasn't dry, but the flavors that I am used too were just not there."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place! Very clean very organized, spices, fresh food, butcher shop, all kinds of Middle Eastern goodies and a lovely Halal restaurant (Al-Hana) right inside. We had beef shush kabob and Iraqi kabob, served on basmati turmeric rice with fresh onions, pickles, tomatoes, hummus and pita bread. We also got some savory ground beef, feta cheese and spinach pastries, all fresh and very good. Two of us ate for $25 including drinks, I had a mango yogurt drink and loved it. While our food was cooking I had to shop. I picked up some red lentils, Himalayan pink salt, jwahar flour, corn meal, cookies, olive oil and pita bread- unreasonably reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I can walk the aisles for a long time just looking at all the goods.  They have groceries as well as kitchen supplies.  Everything is priced very reasonably, and the prices on some of their bulk products can't be beat.  The restaurant has cheap and yummy falafel pitas (pickled beets, yay!!) and super yummy spinach pies.  Oder them.  You shall not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. The best pita bread in the City and a full market. 

I have eaten there many times. It is part grocery store part restaurant. They have a fresh pita bread bakery. The bread is authentic Lebanese and the best I've had outside Lebanon. They have a butcher market with fresh halal meat including lamb and goats. You can get a whole lamb from there. 

I like the falafel and shawarma wraps. They are both good."}
{"text":"I recently bought chicken from the restaurant for takeout and to my surprise when i opened it at home it was dry like a rock, filled with olive oil as if they are passing it as fresh chicken, we threw it away,  even my dog wouldn't eat it.  They were selling it as a whole chicken, cut up and I kind of suspected something when I noticed the cook was picking the chicken from some covered place and didn't see a whole chicken cut up in front of me!

Left over chicken from the day before should never be sold to customers and pass it as fresh chicken, they should be glad I didn't drive back and throw the chicken in their face. I would never buy there again and I hope the health department looks into their practice. If you don't have fresh chicken to sell customers, just say that! Don't sell me something old, you won't feed to your own family, you just lost a long time customer!"}
{"text":"From your pyramids of produce, to the shelves of canned/bottled/packaged items of indeterminable but unbelievably delicious origins, to your viles of saffron that I can't yet afford, to your deli that accepts my orders for poorly pronounced food, to the butcher that understands that I don't believe in waste so he knows not to question when a white boy orders lamb testicles--thank you for that.  

( you know I can get get everything from head to tail here? Amazing!)

Thank you, Baiz for the experience. 

Every time I come in here, I am made better by the experience.

It is because of this market, My wife had a special dog collar made for me: if lost, Return to 3052-- Baiz Market Place 

My wife will know to pick me up here."}
{"text":"This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...

Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book! 

This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this after my friend told me what great reviews it had on yelp.  I was not overly impressed.  The employees were kind and helpful.  I ordered a falafel sandwhich, stuffed grape leaves and babaganouj.  I did not care for the falafel as it had a cinnamon type flavoring in it.  I have eaten lots of falafel and this is the only one I have ever had that I didn't really care for.  The stuffed grape leaves were edible but tasted exactly like the ones I get out of a jar from Trader Joes.  The babaganouj was DELICIOUS though.   If you go I highly recommend you order this eggplant dip.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The restaurant here is to die for! Love the lamb, so juicy. I would eat their rice everyday and lastly but not least their hummus is smooth and delicious."}
{"text":"Baiz is our go to store for all our Middle Eastern ingredients. Being Lebanese and having lived in the ME 33 years of my life, I don't know how I could have survived here without it! Baiz not only carries our spices, they also have fresh chicken and meat (halal) and they also have dairy products, freshly baked Arabic bread, Lebanese sweets, and grocery items typically found in a ME store. Not only that, they also cater to other international communities such as the subcontinent and some gulf and Persian items, all of which are very important for our international cuisines. Baiz is also my favorite because their prices are relatively good. Considering that they have to order their stuff and have them shipped to Arizona, their prices are pretty reasonable. Their fresh produce prices are particularly good too! 
I go to Baiz at least once a month to do all my Arabic/ME grocery shopping. I strongly recommend it for anyone who would like to buy authentic ingredients to cook our delicious dishes away from home. Can't wait for their Mesa branch to open as it would be closer to where I live! Thumbs up Baiz!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't the only place to buy in Phoenix Middle East groceries I would never go there 
The whole store is dust and not clean 
They cut the meat next to you that make you want to become a vegetarian 
They DON'T SPEAK A WORD IN ENGLISH . 
the price are too high 
Bottom line this place need a new stuff , new owner , and a cleaning team"}
{"text":"I love shopping here, less the crowds and narrow aisles.  I enjoy meditterranian cuisine and this place has all the right ingredients at the right prices. They akso have a nice selection if meats, fruits, and veggies that are high quality and reasonably priced. I can't do all my shopping here, but I can knock out a great deal of it."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I went to three different markets before I found what I was looking for at Baiz.  Very nice produce, good selection of spices and canned foods."}
{"text":"This place ROX.  Cheap store-made Pita bread, and the cashiers are VERY CUTE.

Excellent for this type of food."}
{"text":"The prices are super cheap, buy your spices here. Also, the restaurant is amazing. The beef shawerma sandwich with a yogurt drink is incredible. If you get fries, get the garlic butter dip."}
{"text":"First off I cannot comment on the Restaurant, as I only went here to buy grocery's. 

That said I am excited about the products this place carries. First off, the Meat counter had Goat, which makes me very happy. It is rare to find Goat in most places. I really liked their selection of meats. Almost as amazing as Ranch Market.

The Baklava was OMG AMAZING!!!!!! I had to hide it so I would not continue eating! My only complaint was it was kind of pricey, but it is probably best for my diet that it was pricey, ya know what I mean?

They had some interesting produce you don't see most places, although as a whole there produce is limited.

Their selection of spices was vast, they probably have anything you might be looking for. 

Looking forward to go back and try the restaurant...oh and don't forget to pick up some more Baklava."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and my coworker suggested we stop here for lunch.  I spent a lot of time in the Middle-East, so my expectation is high, and I have to say the food is fantastic!  I had a chicken schwarna and it was hot and good and quick and as good as any I had overseas.  I will go back any time!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to find large, gooey, fresh dates! It is hard to get out of the door without a spinach pie or baklava."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years for meat and other middle eastern delights."}
{"text":"Hands down the best baba ganouj in the valley. I've had Haji-Baba's and Ali Baba's, and this by far blows them out of the water. The store is great and I shop for a majority of my groceries here. This place is a local gem and it always cheers me up to go here!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the grocery store it is inside of. You feel like you've been transported overseas for a moment. They even carry that elusive Ethiopian spice berbere (spl?). Master Chef eat your heart out!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! I had the Beef Sharwza platter, humus awesome, beef very tasty...dining partner had shish ko babs and i totally wanted to steal one- they looked delicous. the hummus on the plate is really good, delicious actually.  they have all types of cookies in the back, many pistachio ones..i adore pistachios but not being familiar, wasnt sure which ones to get, im not a fan of baklava..too sweet for me...so all the cookies were so diff and unique looking, we were starving and just wanted to grab dinner but I will definitely go back and try cookies and get that shishkobab next time although the shredded beef plate i got was yummy yum. Nice counter staff also, super friendly and laid back tasty diner style hangout."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma Ive had in az since Sababa Grill in Vegas (3220 S Durango Dr. Las Vegas)... Kosher Glorrrrrry (Sababa)... aagggghhhh *drool... but yes, the pita breading is nicely grilled with a healthy hint of shawarma chicken. Garlic sauce topped the cake perfectly with the toasty grilled goodness of the whole pita ensemble."}
{"text":"This is a great ethnic grocery store with tons to offer. There is a lot of variety. Highlights for me were affordable spices, delicious baked goods, good tea selection, and Middle Eastern housewares. You can also pick up a hookah with a hose, coals, and various tobaccos. There are also some nice Turkish coffee and tea sets. Not to mention the variety of food items you can get. I was very tempted to get a tray of chocolates."}
{"text":"Baiz is a great place for your Middle Eastern grocery shopping needs.  They are stocked with items such as imported mango juice, fresh pitas, a variety of feta cheese, yogurts and kefir cheese, frozen parathas, etc.  In other words, if you need some Middle Eastern grocery items, you will probably find them here.

The prices are mostly reasonable and the place isn't the cleanest.  But, I still recommend Baiz as a top Middle Eastern grocery market in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranean cafe and grocery store.  Every time, I've ordered the baked lamb.  I like gyro meat and similar ground meat, but when given a choice, much prefer chunks of real lamb.  

Their baked lamb plate is delicious.  It is cooked over the grill.  You get two skewers of lamb over rice, a sampler of fresh vegetables, hummus, and pickles.  This plate is perfect!  Be sure to finish your meal off with some dessert.  The pistachio baklava and maamoul are YUM."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to yelp. I was excited to try my new hole-in-the-wall finding especially given all the great reviews. I was hoping to be amazed and wowed, but.... alas.... I really wasn't. 
This review is based solely on the meal itself. Serving size was very generous, but flavor was missing from the chicken. The garlic sauce stuff is amazing though, I will give them that. I'm not quite sure what was missing, but something was. Don't get me wrong, I'd go again if in the area, I just didn't think it was super super awesome. 
Just as an FYI, the restaurant is within the store itself, which is found in a fairly ghetto part of town. Didn't bother me a bit, but you never know who's out there reading these things."}
{"text":"Al Hana, their restaurant inside of the grocery store is a total 5 stars!  This review is for the Baiz Market, the grocery store.  For us, this is a great \"go to\" place for some key items we need from time to time that our local grocer doesn't carry and/or they offer a better quality.  

Some of the items we shop for while at the Baiz Market; 
~the BEST place in town to get your pita bread!  Both white and wheat and in different sizes.  
~they have a fantastic selection of middle eastern spices especially curries.  
~they have some great butchers that will chop, slice and dice every part of a lamb, cow or goat.  
~they butcher fresh ground to 30/70, 20/80 and 10/90 
~a great selection of nuts, sesame seed and olive oils, curries
~some great pastries 

Sometimes they have seasonal produce you may not find at your local grocer but you have to search for it.  Their produce is not one of their qualities.  

It's a great place to pick up some groceries and have a bite to eat!  Maybe I'll see you there."}
{"text":"This is a great to get hard to find ethnic ingredients.  It's in a kind of sketchy neighborhood and the parking lot fills up quickly.  Once inside though, there's a ton of unique and exotic products at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This grocery store/ restaurant has a really good shawrma. The other items on the menu are also good, like the Med. pizza and the small stuffed pastries. 

The store also has a vast array of Arabic bread and naan. 

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I jus t went to the store it was iust ok. It didn't really cater to the food we wanted which was African food it was mostly Middle Eastern and I saw Greek accompaniments. They had no fresh hot peppers like habenero or plantains so we headed to Rancho Market which had lots of fresh ingredients. 

We did purchase goat meat. Make sure you \"pull\" a number otherwise you will be standing around like I was looking crazy."}
{"text":"Some of the most wonderful Middle Eastern food I have ever had.  We had the hummus and I had the Beef Shawarma and both were excellent. Loved this place and would go back again."}
{"text":"I drove here after work one day in search of berbere and hopefully some injera.  They did not disappoint.  I walked up and down the spice row reading EVERY label, looking for the berbere.  I finally asked an employee (and showed her the written word), who then looked in the dried berries and told me they were out.  I was thinking about the wasted trip, but finally decided to check out the bread aisle before I left to see if there was injera.  Score!  I bought the best whole wheat injera I've ever had.  And what was located in big containers right about the injera?  Berbere!  Success!  I now have probably a years worth...but need to work on preparing my own injera because this is not the most convenient location for me.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but nothing to worrisome for a female shopping alone after work."}
{"text":"My ethnic experience isn't rooted in the middle eastern culture, but my fiancee's is, and she goes nuts in here buying some awesome, interesting, and delicious gear like tahini, chick peas, za'atar, feta, etc for making things like hummus, za'atar bread, and the like.  I picked up a half-rack of lamb chops and a side of couscous for prepping ($12) together.  Their butcher is awesome and far different from retail grocery chains in Phoenix.  They have a mountain of hooves, FYI.  

Typically, the prices are inexpensive-to-reasonable, but sometimes the rarer items are a bit elevated in price.  That is totally understandable considering the unavailability of this type of product nearly anywhere else in the valley.  They make you put at least $10 on your debit, so be aware, though they have so much good stuff that this fee is easy to surpass."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been shopping here this entire century and haven't written a review - well timed at least - this is my 100th.

First and foremost - they make their own yogurt and labneh. Secondly, the spinach and herb mixture in their spinach pies is the best this side of lower Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Now that I think of it, several brands in here I haven't seen since Brooklyn.

Their fresh produce section is big, varied, and fresh. They butcher their own meat.  They have an excellent selection of honeys, herbs, spices, olives and flat breads. 

Best of all, on many Saturdays, I find I'm the only native English speaker in the place."}
{"text":"Fresh fruits and veggies I absolutely love this place  and the chef I have to say love their freshly made food is mouth watering their is not any plate that I've tasted that I don't like  shopping their takes me to the middle eastern not going to miss going to the festival in April 29!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant inside the market is amazing. The food is fresh, authentic, cheap and just awesome. We got 2 types of kababs, cheese pita, small meat pie, falafel, beef shawarma, and babaganouj. Everything we had was excellent and I am SURE that we'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"One of the best middle-eastern markets around town second to Haji-baba."}
{"text":"Huge grocery store that my Mom would be super excited about.  I will bring her here when she visits again.  I don't do much cooking so I don't do much grocery shopping but I will be visiting Baiz Market often- I mean,
I've found myself here three times in the past two weeks, so it must be love.  I come for Al-Hana, which is the modest little restaurant inside Baiz.  

I order the Chicken Taook which is quite satisfying.  The tabbouleh and hummus are also big winners in my book.

Some things to keep in mind:  The seating area is small, and there tends to be small children running around.  Read:  Do not take someone on a first date here.  Also, the menu is just kind of taped down to the front counter and a bit hard to navigate.  The waitstaff is patient, though, so no worries.  

Simply put, when I moved to Phoenix, it seemed that Pita Jungle was considered the standard middle eastern- and I was depressed.  I'm so glad Mr. K introduced me to Al Hana/Baiz, as I am in love and can authentically have my middle eastern fix."}
{"text":"Love this place. I discovered it a couple of years ago and go there fairly regularly now. Great prices on produce. Lots of specialty items that are difficult to find elsewhere.
The restaurant is excellent. We fell in love with their chicken shawarma sandwiches and get them all the time. The pastries are fantastic too."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a chicken schwarma / hummus place closer to phoenix, seems that all the good ones like haji babas are in Tempe.  So we went here, the emphasis is mostly on the market.  The eating area is typically small, and the tables were a bit dirty.  You order your food at the window and pick it up.

Overall the food was pretty good but I didn't like the thin pita bread compared to typical pita.  The schwarma and rice were good.  The hummus was ok.  I wish they had a plate that offered, schwarma, rice and hummus.  I had to order a full size side of hummus to try it out.

There are no fountain drinks and only salt and pepper on the tables.  I was dying for some Sri Racha aka rooster sauce but they don't have any available.  

My friends each ordered the boiled lamb and they loved it.  I would give this restaurant 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the Pomegranate that I got on my purchase on September 16th 2017! Picture talk more than me!"}
{"text":"Was at the bakery/deli, ordered a lamb burger. The guy making the burger dropped it in the floor proceeded to pick it up and served it as it nothing happened..."}
{"text":"An awesome little middle eastern store, not a little bodega, but an actual store.  This place is in an odd location and I would have never found it had I not been close by and searched for gyros on yelp.  They have an awesome bakery and butcher in the back.  They also have a bunch of unique items you cannot find other places like ink for henna tattoos and different flavored Kit Kat bars which are amazing.  The also have a small little restaurant at the front with sandwiches for under $5.  I got probably the best shawarma sandwich I ever had in my life here and will be back often.  Don't let the odd location scare you off as I have never had an issue here, but I could see that being some people's complaint."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma sandwiches in the Phoenix area, hands down.  I have not had such delicious, authentic Middle Eastern food since I lived near Dearborn, MI, which has perhaps the the largest population of Middle Eastern folks in the U.S.  Friendly service, exceptionally clean and don't forget to stop by the Bakery for some of the best Baklava ever.  Oh yeah, only this much money, too.  $"}
{"text":"Market = Five stars - they have EVERYTHING - including full size doner/kebab roasting machines, which is awesome.   
Restaurant = Two stars.  I wasn't terribly impressed.  The seating area is gross, they were out of a few options we wanted to try, and the sandwiches we ordered were kind of bland.  Really cheap, though!"}
{"text":"I love this market. prices are competitive, the butcher shop is great, clean, fresh meat. If you like raw Kebbe, this is where to buy the meat.... Its a complete middle eastern market. In addition they have a small restaurant that is truly phenomenal... just line up, be patient, and you are rewarded with absolutely fresh and delicious middle eastern dishes or sandwiches. 5 Stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"Well,  I buy meat from Baiz in a bulk but last Friday I had a bad experience.  In the butcher section there is a guy called Ehsan and he has a bad attitude. I wanted to buy two legs from the same goat and he was reluctant to bring a full goat from inside the cold storage.  He was forcing me to buy from the shelf and those didn't look fresh at all.  I buy $300-$500 worth of products from Baiz each month and if I don't have the freedom to choose my product then I would rather choose another place.  I want the Baiz owner to move Ehsan from butcher section to another place.  All other butchers are friendly except him."}
{"text":"A friend and I split a beef shawarma, a chicken shawarma, and a couple of different types of baklavas. And a meat pie.  So we had a total of 7 items and it cost $16. Nice! My favorite was the chicken shawarma, marinated chicken and some veggies with a garlic spread wrapped in a pita which is baked on-premises. The baklava-type desserts consisted of flaky pastry with a custard-type of filling. Forgive me for not knowing the exact names of the ingredients as I know very little about the ins and outs of Middle Eastern food other than putting it IN my mouth! Some of the crusts could be a little oily around the edges. Only enough of a deterrent to remind me not to eat these every day! 

Service is fast and friendly; I will definetly return!"}
{"text":"Today's lunchtime quest was to check out Baiz Market. The place is like a mirage. It sits on a barren residential stretch of 20th St. near the intersection of the I-10 and the 51. Don't worry about the car; there's abundant parking and little potential for destruction and mayhem.

This is actually a business-within-a-business. The restaurant inside Baiz Market is called Al-Hana, and it's a clean, well-oiled machine. Al-Hana takes up about an eighth of the market's floor space. A young woman was taking orders at the counter and two white-uniformed cooks were models of efficiency. You can see everything being prepared as the aromas of garlic, sumac, and roasting meat fill the air.

I had a small order of hummus and a chicken shawarma sandwich. The hummus was enough for four small people or two large people, and it came with a mountain of freshly house-baked pita triangles. It was delicious, but next time I think I'll ask for a slice of lemon on the side. The chicken shawarma sandwich was a miracle of industrial design. It was a perfectly shaped torpedo: juicy chicken, pickles, onion, and garlic sauce wrapped in a perfectly heated piece of flatbread. Make no mistake -- this thing is easy to eat but it's also impervious to collapse. It's the perfect thing to eat in the car (not that I eat in the car), and at $3.99 it's a bargain. For non-carnivores, the menu has grape leaves, taboulleh, falafel, baba, the famous thyme pie, etc. Did I mention the garlic sauce?

After lunch, I strolled the aisles of the market. Picture the market side of places like Haji Baba or Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, but about 10 times the floor space. Spices, bagged pitas and chapatis, green and roasted coffee beans, a full produce section... it's like being in a supermarket from a more interesting place .

Definitely check out the glass cases in the back, where the meat guys reign. There are halal meats available and the staff is friendly. Personally, I locked in on the case to the left of the meat counter. Olives. An armada of olives, floating in fragrant oil. Next to the olives, red pepper paste (the ultimate condiment) beckoned. I wanted it all.

Head to Baiz Market / Al-Hana for some fertile crescent-y goodness. One tip: as other Yelpers have mentioned, there's a $10.00 minimum for debit and credit cards."}
{"text":"I wish I was a good enough cook to be able to put all the exotic ingredients this place stocks to good use.   But even for an amatuer like myself, this place is well-worth a visit.  For under $10, I got: 1. dried apricots, 2. dried papaya, 3. baby carrots, 4. small deli container of delish green olives, 5. fresh ginger, 6. a bag of dried garbanzo beans.   Then I went to the restaurant and for another $3, I got a nice sized to-go portion of awesome hummus, which came with two big, fresh pitas.  Yumzo.  

Not the most foreign selection on my part, but with prices like that, I will be a little more adventourous next visit."}
{"text":"Great market. I work downtown so this is a convenient stop before heading home. I can find what I'm looking for here, including bulgur wheat, pita bread, labne, molokhia, bamya, and more. I've bought some delicious chocolate wafers here as well. Don't really check out the produce or meat department, but the pita bread is fantastic, fresh, and frugally priced. Comes in white and wheat and two sizes: small for .79 and large for .99. Always busy with people when I go but I've always found a parking spot. I usually don't take a cart or basket and regret it when I'm trying to carry all of my items to the counter. Don't be like me, grab one when you walk in."}
{"text":"My husband is the cook and I love when he visits this market. He arrives home with a bag filled with amazing items and money still in the bank! If you are planning on a new meal, you must add this place to you list of errands. Go there during lunch and grab a bite before you shop, mouth watering food!"}
{"text":"Third time eating here. We get the shish kebab lunch specials and shwarma wraps. That red dessert is also a treat, cannot remember the name but you know what I speak of. Hummus and salads are exceptional and the cheese bread is worth a try as well."}
{"text":"Busy little market. Challenging parking. Homemade wheat and regular pitas, delicious bakery. Fresh produce and wide variety of pickled items. Will visit often."}
{"text":"They don't take phone orders.... Aside from this, the food is excellent. The neighborhood is seedy ( at best) but the food is worth the trip. The grocer had hard to find ingredients and the butcher has halal meats."}
{"text":"This Middle Eastern food market is a bit more expensive than a supermarket, but worth it. It's a very comfortable blend of people from both a Middle Eastern and Western background. Muslims will find it's  HALAL and non Muslims will go for the quality. So the cultural diversity will add to it's interesting ambiance. Customer service is good, people will help you find something on request. 

This place has a great meat market section,  and the best coffee and yogurt in town. Produce is good too, with some hard to find items. Middle Eastern bread is excellent. There is a dining lunch counter area near the front. 

We've traveled in the Middle East and have been attracted to this place as a result, and have been going regularly for years."}
{"text":"Came here with my MIL to get some kosher meat + groceries.

It is in a very sketchy area but once inside the store, you don't feel it.

This review is especially for the butchers. The butcher who helped us (he was hispanic and can't remember name!) was very kind, patient and informative. It was our first time here and he really helped us out."}
{"text":"Grocery is 5 star, lots of options and good selections. The restaurant is inside the market and the food is excellent. HUGE portions for the price. Fed my family of 4 with leftovers for 22 bucks and even my kids ate everything. The food is excellent and made to order, nothing sitting under lamps."}
{"text":"Really good food at their restaurant.  Kind of iffy service though.  The people have always been nice, don't get me wrong, but the time it takes to get your food can be crazy unpredictable, so beware if you're going on your lunch break.
Haven't really shopped in the market, but they seem well stocked from what I saw waiting for my food.
The lamb pita is alright, but the chicken shawarma pita is absolutely excellent, and they serve it up with a proper pickle game.  Hummus is good and a big, big portion.  The dolmeh are very good and come garnished with some salad, I don't remember if it was fattoush or tabouli or something else.
They also sell doogh/ayran in bottles just off to the right of the register, so don't forget to look out for that if you're a fan."}
{"text":"Grab some grub before you shop, the restaurant inside Baiz is great, I reccomend the schwarma wraps and falafel. I love this market, the people are nice and sometimes you can find neat stuff for super cheap. \"Yes sweetie I do need this banana slicer, you expect me to slice my own bananas? and it comes with an apple slicer, not JUST a banana slicer\"."}
{"text":"This market has great international products and foods at very good prices! I love their Persian cucumbers and ground lamb. They also have a variety of fresh feta cheese, tasty baked goods and fresh baked flatbread. My favorite feta is the Bulgarian but they are all delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that gives ethnic food lovers dream about.
The market itself specializes in all kinds of ethnic, mainly Middle Eastern and Arabic, fare, Fresh and varied....the bread is freshly baked, soft and fragrant. People buy it by the cart load. The meat market sells everything from testicles to tongues...dont go near the butcher if you are squeamish!
The Al Hana restaurant makes most things fresh to order it but they also keep a ready supply of things like meat pies in the cooler to serve you faster. Eat in or take out.
The Babaganoush, Tabouli and Humus are about the best you can get. Take home plenty of Pita bread to scoop it up with.
Hookah pipes and supplies line the walls near the exit."}
{"text":"Baiz Market is a \"Mediterranean\" type restaurant, or \"Arabic\" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.

This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).

I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.

If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.

I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.

I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting."}
{"text":"Decent selection. Vegetables a steal in some cases. Restaurant is really quite good for a lunchtime bite."}
{"text":"Both the chicken and beef shawarma's are phenominal - as good as it gets.  The rest of the store is a great way to be temporarily transported to another part of the world without having to get on an airplane.  If you like Middle Eastern foods, this should be the epicenter of your Phoenix-world."}
{"text":"Baiz Market is a wonderful ethnic experience. I went in for lunch to satisfy my curiosity and was very impressed. The market portion of the store is huge, the produce area was well stocked as were their meats (you can buy an entire goat). I wandered through the isles for quite a while taking in all the exotic spices, they had not only Middle Eastern, but also African and Asian items. There was tons of tikka sauces, red pepper pastes, hummus and baba spreads. The bakery was awesome containing date and fig breads, 50 cent pita packs and little meat pies. They also carried hookahs, tons of shisha and every accessory you can think of to go with them. 

After my shopping was finished I stopped at Al Hana, the little restaurant inside and had the beef schwarma (as recommended in several reviews). I am hoping it was just an off day, because the schwarma was very dry and grizzly and the pita it was served with was hard. I also ordered the baba ganoush and it was pretty tasty. I washed this down with a rose water (actually tastes just like it sounds but super sweet). All in all this was a great experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best place to purchase lamb kidneys. And at $4.99 a lb 
The deal can't be beat. They have them fresh and nicely displayed at their meat counter. My husband had been searching for years. I found the place using my Flipp app. The men behind the counter were very friendly and helpful. They interupted their conversation with other customers to offer their assistance. The place was clean and well kept. It is on the small size but packed with all kind of middle eastern goodies that looked fresh. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"This market is VERY good. The food is great, and the people here actually care about you & your opinions regarding their business. This place is small but a great grocery store. You will not be upset if you come here. The selection is limited but the ingredients are quality. This place is a staple for when I need international ingredients"}
{"text":"Very good food, I like to eat here always and I hope they will open the new north Phoenix location because it's closer to me"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best place in town!
The high quality of the food and the employers are the two things you can immediately see and taste! =)

The veggie combo is absolutely beyond delicius!
Never had falafel and hummus so good!

The place is super clean and everybody speak english!

The best for vegan as well, you can have so much choice in the menu, it's amazing!!

Keep it up guys! you are the best!"}
{"text":"Baiz Market surprised me in two ways.  First, it was larger than I expected, with a sizable produce area, meat market, and even a small restaurant.  Second, it was pretty much true to its mission, providing a wide variety of ethnic foods from the Middle East.  Although it bills itself as having a wider representation, such as Europe, don't expect Danish cookies or Italian pasta.  European apparently means Turkey and Greek in this context.  But because Baiz Market does not fall into the trap of also carrying a host of \"American\" goods, it is able to provide many choices in its ethnic aisles, often including several brands or varieties of an item.

If you like to try different foods, stop by and give it a look."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I'm going to have to give it three stars only. 

The market itself is superb, with pretty much every possible ingredient, an outstanding butchery selling every part of the lamb (and whole lambs), industrial sized blocks of feta cheese, etc.

The restaurant is a small kitchen area with maybe ten tables.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating, but frankly, the food we had was good but not great.  The hummus in particular was not garlicky at all. The roasted chicken was a bit dry and the fattoush was, well, to me at least, it was a nice kind of sweet salad, not a proper fattoush.  It was basically lettuce with a bit of tomato and olive.  No cucumbers and no dried pita bread, which is kind of odd since they have a fabulous bakery and the bread was the highlight of the meal.

We bought extra bread to go and I'd go just for that.  But as far as the food, I'd go in the neighborhood but it's not quite the mecca of mezzes that I was hoping for.  

And if you want to buy a whole lamb, this is the place."}
{"text":"The baba ganuj (\"vinete\" if you're Romanian) is good. Had a shawarma and enjoyed it. Plus, you can roam around the market and get yourself some European or Asian chocolate or candy."}
{"text":"One of my co workers took me here about couple months ago to get food when I was working OT.its a market but has a small restaurant inside the market.. we always get their chicken shawarma plate here along with baklava (many varieties) in the back of the market.. I also like that they have mango lassi along with regular lassi and rose water lassi in the drink aisle.."}
{"text":"I love shopping at specialty markets like Baiz Market.  My quest was for merguez sausages which they sadly did not have, but I found a number of other unusual items for my cupboard whilst browsing here.  They have harissa (Tunisian red pepper condiment), very affordable fresh lamb meat, and super low priced fresh pita bread (79 cents a package... ridiculously cheap)!

I also picked up some other items I was thrilled to find.  I bought Tamarind Syrup, which I intend to use in some Tiki cocktail creation (the Monkeypod, if memory serves). I also grabbed some canned hummus and canned baba ghannoush.  If these taste comparable to fresh, I may keep it stocked in my pantry at all times (to impress unexpected guests)!  I noted that they have ground lamb and beef kababs in the freezer section that I have to try.  I have fond childhood memories of an Egyptian friend bringing these to family barbecues, and have not been able to duplicate them since.

I couldn't complete my shopping experience here without sampling something at the in-store snack bar (Al Hana).  I ordered a Chicken Schwarma sandwich (wrap) to go and was an instant fan.  I enjoyed it at home with my own bottle of sriracha at the ready.  This is a bit different from other Chicken Schwarmas I've had for one notable reason... the inclusion of pickles.  I think it was pickled okra actually, but for sure, the entire wrap was delectable.

I'm coming back to Baiz Market for all of the goodies I spotted and for others I have yet to discover!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite middle eastern markets in the phoenix, every time I'm Scottsdale and Tempe area i can count on them for low prices and high quality.  Its just a great spot with fresh meats and a full-service restaurant and a grocery store to fill your fridge with fresh fruits, deserts and whatever else your pretty little heart desires.  One stop and you can have all you need for the week.  A++ value and quality"}
{"text":"Kalamata, Feta, Baklava oh my!  

Pita, Hummus, Baba oh my!

Just a few of the items that made their way into our cart as we enjoyed our first shopping trip to Baiz Market.  This place is a great resource for hard to find middle eastern ingredients.  We got a nice block of Feta much cheaper than the grocery, for example.

There were many items I saw that we didn't get this trip - we'll save them for our next excursion.  Like European Style Ovaltine.  What?  European style?  I was a big Ovaltine fan as a kid - just imagine how much more worldly I will be if a drink European Style Ovaltine purchased at a Middle Eastern Market!  Sprechen sie Global Citizen drink mix?

We ate at the little restaurant in the front.  Fabulous!  Four of us shared a plate of baba ganoush, a chicken shawarma wrap, a falafel wrap and of course an order of fries.  The kids insisted they needed the fries because they probably wouldn't like the middle eastern food.  So everything was delicious including the  fries and some serious haggling took place over who got how many bites of the chicken shawarma.  We washed everything down with a pomegranate juice drink, 2 waters and an orange crush.  Perfection!

So glad we stopped here!"}
{"text":"This store is awesome. They have a great selection of Middle Eastern groceries and products, teas, rice, spices, meat, bread, olives, boxed and canned items, juices, sodas, it is an amazing array.
The produce is great, fresh and really inexpensive. There is an on site butcher, something you rarely, if ever, see anymore. There are great deals on fresh, yes fresh, chicken, lamb, goat, beef, fish and more.
The restaurant/bakery has an array of amazing and tasty items like hummus, flat bread pies, shawarma, falafel, amazing pitas, small pies, all fresh, made on the spot for ridiculously low prices. The small pies, similar to a turnover with either meat or vegetables, are less than a dollar each and good enough to eat a dozen!
If you are a fan of Arabic and Middle Eastern food and/or products, this is the place to go. Or, even for the cultural experience, Baiz Market is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I Loved this place! I can't say enough great things. The owners are the nicest people ever. The food..... To die for!! Prices are great and everything is fresh. I would eat here everyday.

{"text":"Can't wait to go back for more discoveries.

When I was in Jordan last year, I picked up 2 lbs (or whatever their measure) of assorted baklava for $6 and ate it (with a little help) in five days, while losing ten pounds. Got all that? The baklava diet. Gotta love it.

So I went to Baiz hoping for some more amazing baklava. Bought the 1 pound assortment for $16; two weeks later, still some left.  It's delicious, pricier, definitely not dietetic, and not quite the same as Jordanian baklava. Still yummy.

Also had the hummus, baba ghanoush and pita. Loved the hummus and pita (very fresh)."}
{"text":"Wow!  I only wish there were more convenient locations for a tasty shawarma like this in town.  This place is a diamond in the rough but worth the trip off the beaten path.  Praise God for their tasty shawarma!"}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian, here's a good place to get cheap bulk nuts/grains. Also their (small) produce section usually has a pretty good range of fruit & vegetables for its size. ..though it's either fresh/wilted not really an in between for quality. 

Also, a good place for bulk meat items you wouldn't find in a grocery store (i.e lamb HEAD, intestines, etc..) not my cup of tea but it's there. Their deli/meat section is 2x the size of their produce. 
The smell is a bit overwhelming.

Overall this is a great international store; one of a kind for sure!"}
{"text":"I have this unheard rule for ethnic food.
If the restuarant is next to or in a supermarket it MUST BE GOOD.
So far it has not steered me wrong. 

I got the Lamb Kefta Plate. It was WAAAYY to much food for the quick and easy lunch I was imagining. But it was good none the less.
When I ordered they let me know it would take about 15 mins and it did... Since the seating is in the supermarket the ambiance isnt great, but I LOVE IT. Don't be a snob... this place is great.

Definitely a fan and definitely returning."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and heard about Baiz market so had to go check it out as my gf is a chef and loves exotic spices & ingredients. Not disappointed at all and definitely going back. I found quite a few things I missed from our fave middle eastern shop back home desserts and some soda and juices. Also great prices on everything! We bought some lentils, desserts, spices and a few other things I can't recall. The lot is small and was very busy but we still got a spot and the store did not seem crazy. It was easy to find anything we needed and the employees were helpful as well. Would've eaten at the restaurant inside but we were full so we'll be checking that section out next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Arabic foods and great environment . I get my groceries there and then sit down for a a light meal. They make fresh Arabic bread and morning pastries. Yummy ! Love love love . So many spices and cooking ware they know what they are doing . Keep it up guys ! Muahs!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot. Ever since the management changed a few years ago, this place has gone down hill. The deli is such a rip-off. You get less meat for higher price. The employers don't know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Middle East and I have been searching for a tasty shawarma ever since I left.  Finally, I found one at Baiz. I've had both the chicken and falafel shawarmas and they are sooooo good! They are pretty close to the ones I had overseas, but they could be perfect if they put pickles and french fries inside - - Yum! I've also had the zatar (delicious) and the cheese bread (ok, but not like I remember). The baklava, however, is a whole different story - it's absolutely delicious! I could eat their baklava all day long!

It's really fun to walk around the grocery store while you wait for your food. For me, it's like a trip down memory lane. It's nice to know that when I'm feeling a bit homesick, I can always go to Baiz and reminisce :)

So, if you want a great lunch...head here and order a shawarma, zatar and vimto with a couple of pieces of baklava for dessert. You won't be disappointed. 

P.S. They have great prices on hookahs here, too :)"}
{"text":"The flavored just weren't there!!! I'm used to Haji Baba which is pretty much the best Middle Eastern in AZ so maybe I've gotten spoiled.
Everything here tasted very vinegary."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for some Shawarma. Really good and affordable. The three of us each got one plus some other goods from the deli case all for less than $20.

They have a seating area or you can take your food to go. Full market of international groceries which seem very reasonably priced. Lots of hard to find items can be found here."}
{"text":"Baiz Market makes me happy to be alive. Seriously.

Great Middle Eastern grocery items, a full selection of great mediterranean drinks, and an awesome restaurant  to boot (See Al-Hana under Restaurants).

I believe this is the only place in town where you can find a full wall of Hookahs for sale in an abandoned videogame case. Seriously.

If there is some rare European or Mediterranean candy, snack, or confection that you haven't been able to find elsewhere, odds are you will find it here.  Oh, and you can buy a whole goat if you're into that kinda thing. yeah, just check out the goat-sized cooler by the produce section."}
{"text":"My daughter found this Phoenix gem. The little restaurant inside has the best falafel, chicken shawarma and hummus in Phoenix. It beat Mazza in Salt Lake, too, according to my daughter, and she said that would never happen. Now I find any and every excuse to stop by for a falafel sandwich. New hope for the global future of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if you've stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients."}
{"text":"Yet another Central PHX gem that I have heard sooo much about and had yet to stop in at until this past Sunday afternoon.  So many of my Middle Eastern favorites.  But I came to find that you have to come early for lamb and goat as the selection becomes limited.   I loved the variety of cheeses and plain yoguart. The fresh breads and sweets lured my carb loving self to pick up some wonderful fresh goodies.  
The menu at Al Hana looked very tasty but I didn't have the time to stop in for a bite.   
My sweet tooth has assured me I will be back sooner than I expect, I am sure."}
{"text":"A gem middle of PHX. Nothing fancy, but place is authentic, reasonably priced and as tasty as you would expect from a REAL arabic food. Amazing falafel and tabouleh! 

Grocery store is well stocked with wide variety of oriental foods (from yogurt to halwa, and spices generally of superior quality than you will ever find in standard US Supermarket. 

Wide selection of teas. Pastries are to die for. Literally."}
{"text":"I swear I've been meaning to come here for so long and never did..... This was a huge mistake! The selection and the prices here can't be beat. I got some amazing stuff....za'atar, fig jam, fresh pita...... So good! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great, authentic middle eastern grocery and super cheap to boot. Don't miss the bakery or the little restaurant. The food is great and you can eat right there. I would recommend the flatbreads. Don't expect anything fancy- very casual atmosphere- but the nice staff and great food will keep you wanting more."}
{"text":"Baiz Market Place has the most affordable fresh meats and produce. Friendly people, cultured foods. If you're having trouble finding the right lassi, a particular brand of olives or feta cheese, this is your spot."}
{"text":"The neighborhood may be rough, but the market is really a hidden gem.  This is the Middle Eastern market you need to go to in Phoenix.  They actually have injera on sale regularly!!!

The shish taook at the cafe was wonderful.  My wife and I enjoyed the sandwiches.  If you can get over the neighborhood, it is a wonderful place.  The surrounding neighborhood appears rough."}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern market that I've ever been in. It's set up partly as a supermarket/grocery, halal meat/butcher, bread/pastry & prepared food eat in or take-out. Very good selection of middle eastern groceries, fresh pita bread & pastries and decent take out/cafe, especially the spinach pies! Also it's so convenient to the 51 freeway. Every time I'm in the area I stop in. By the way I've never had a problem with the service there, everyone seems to be rather cheerful & helpful."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this place it has all the things I cannot find at the normal stores. They have a variety of international food and products. The place is clean and there is no odor's. Fruit and vegies are fresh. They have a butcher that will cut meat into pieces that you prefer."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  We stopped in for lunch after a morning flight into PHX.

I had the \"hummus supreme\" and asked for a mix of beef and chicken shawarma (along with some added pickles).  My wife had the veggie combo.  

The portion-to-price ratio was truly astonishing.  Both items were under $10 and the total amount of food would have been enough for 6 people.  In the future, I will definitely have to restrain myself from eating the whole portion.

If I went again, I would probably get the same two orders.  It would be nice to get some extra veggies.  Maybe I would just buy a tomato or something from the produce section of the grocery store.  (We bought some very cheap persimmons and pita bread while we waiting for our food).

If I had one criticism, it would be that the restaurant seemed kind of slow.  We ordered food at 11-something, and it may have taken 15-20 minutes to arrive.  Later, when the restaurant got busier during prime lunch hours, it seemed like people were waiting even longer.  Maybe call ahead to order?"}
{"text":"Best halal market in Phoenix! I buy all our meat here and the staff is fantastic. Never had an issue with quality. Their selection is outstanding, and the cafe is mouth-watering! It's our one-stop shop!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a Chicken Shawarma sandwich. Great price and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst place to buy meat. I bought $200 worth of meat and ended up throwing all of it away, because it wasn't edible. Something is wrong with their meat and if you don't want to get sick stay away from their meat department. Their lamb has a funky smell even after cooking, and just doesn't taste right. I honestly have no idea how they sold us lamb like that instead it of throwing it away. I have a pic of their ground beef after cooking,it didn't smell right and didn't look edible. And honestly even before I cooked it, it didn't look like any ground beef I've seen in my life. The color wasn't right and it was slimy. The quality of their meat is horrible. I would not trust buying anything from that store."}
{"text":"If I can find the product from somewhere else. I never would come here. Every time I am having same problem. Store manager even  bother talk with costemers. Horrible"}
{"text":"If you need goat or lamb meat, you can get it here. This wasn't the reason for our trip to Baiz Market this weekend--we went for Al-Hana dining, which was delicious. However, the walk through the grocery portion of this place was great. We picked up some produce and feta cheese [I think they make their own: Confirmed, they make their own!] and overall had a great experience.

I can't wait to go back and take more time to discover some wonderful products and new foods."}
