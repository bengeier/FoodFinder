{"text":"We ate at the concourse A location while waiting for our flight. Very disappointed in our drinks and food. The potato skins were terrible, looked like crap out of a freezer box.  Our drinks had little to alcohol in them.  Way overpriced for terrible food/drinks. Will not be eating at a Friday's ever again.  Your money is best spent elsewhere"}
{"text":"This location in the airport is everything you want in an airport restaurant.  Reasonably priced food, VERY fast service and friendly wait staff.  They will get you in and out before you flight boards."}
{"text":"This place has the best ever barbecue chicken breast with Jack Daniel sauce.  I get it all the time since i work at the airport and its very convenient. Recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Had an early layover on Sunday and had enough time for a sit down breakfast. The steak and eggs sounded delicious before my 1 1/2 hour flight right after. Considering the restaurant was empty they were quick to get our orders out to us. My steak was cooked more on the medium side instead medium rare like I asked. It's hard to mess up breakfast but it was a pretty good meal. My entree came with \"fresh fruit\" which ended up being a thin half slice of pineapple which was slightly disappointing. Waitress was lacking on keeping our drinks filled and I was about ready to stand and get my own refill at one point since the fountain drink machine was right next to us. Decent spot to come in for breakfast if you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"I visited this location while waiting for a flight out of the airport. The bartender was friendly and the service was very quick for both the food and the drinks. The food was delicious and was perfect to get through a flight on."}
{"text":"Hostess gets a 5 star...  Arrived at the airport my battery on my phone was low and I was hungry so I asked the hostess \"do you have a table with an electric outlet?\" she said absolutely and took me a table.  It was hidden and not easy to find but she knew it was right there.  I ate (food is always a 3 at Friday's) and charged my phone.  I have been to 100+ airports and she was the SECOND one to ever know where an outlet was.  Recharge your batteries internally and externally here."}
{"text":"I am normally not a huge fan of TGIF, but it seemed like a decent choice when I had a few hours to kill in the Pittsburgh airport last month.  It's pretty cramped if you have carry-on luggage, outlets are in short supply, and it took a while for the server to notice me; although, to be fair, those are all typical drawbacks at airport locations.  Once she noticed me, I had great service-- she was super friendly, and didn't mind that I wanted to table-camp and read for well over an hour.  I had a Jack Daniels Burger and it was actually really good-- the sauce was just a little sweet but not overpowering, and the burger was juicy with great flavor.  I had a Yuengling to go with, and it was actually reasonably priced considering that the large beer is actually a pretty generous pour.  I also got a metal knife to cut my burger in half-- I'm not sure if this is special to TGIF, special to Pittsburgh, a change to TSA's regulations, or if I've just alerted the NSA to something, but it was nice to not butcher my sandwich with a plastic knife.  Funnily enough, my flight got canceled as I finished my beer, so I killed time in Concourse A for nothing.  But if I happen to end up there again, I'll probably be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I spent my entire morning at TGIs and James was the bomb!! He was super friendly, made good drinks... especially his mojitos!! He was hot too. Ow ow !"}
{"text":"We were part of the Delta mess this past week and landed in Pittsburgh instead of NY like we were supposed to.  We and thousands of others were in an airport that was not expecting us and certainly not used to this sort of a crowd flying in, one plane after another, minutes apart.  We were in the one without the kitchen and all the food came up from the bigger one on the other side of the airport.  Our waiter, Anthony was kind, calm, and treated us like we were the only patrons there.  Although the place was standing room only, spilling out into the airport.  Our food was as ordered and we were very please.  For a while , Anthony handled the entire place with no help, until some was sent in. He never broke a sweat.  I highly recommend the small Fridays in the Pittsburgh Airport."}
{"text":"Our dinner was ok  what you would expect in an airport. So my complaint is the music was extremely loud in every dining area not only loud but loud rap style. I think a nice variety can be found that would please everyone."}
{"text":"I get that it is in an airport, but nothing special.  The reception received by the bartender should have been the warning.  We just wanted a quick drink and a quick snack before getting on our flight.  First off, they close at 7:00 PM on a Saturday.  Not sure if that is the norm or if it was because the airport was so slow, but still 7:00 PM???  My son had the cheeseburger and it was fine.  I ordered the pretzels and cheese sauce.  The amount of sauce for 4 pretzels was a total joke.  It was MAYBE 3 ounces of cheese.  Also, the cheese sauce was runny.  The pretzels were not good at all.  I am not sure what was done to them, but they were actually greasy and had a weird crunch texture to them. I am pretty sure that they fried them but cannot be sure.  The bartender did warm up once she realized our son was low maintenance.  There was no secret that they were closing down because that happened all around us.  Will go to Bar Symon the next time we want a quick drink and snack."}
{"text":"A much better menu than most Friday's. Excellent service. Very good food. Blue Moon beer on tap."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, I cannot complain. The wait staff was extremely friendly and service was quick. Only problem is there are not healthy choices on the menu. Crazy that a salad has 1100 calories! Ever think that some people ordering salads only consume 1200 calories a day, not a meal!"}
{"text":"\"Just to let you know we close in 15 minutes and can't serve you\"...WOW!  Didn't know that closing at 8pm meant you say NO to a customer at 7:45pm."}
{"text":"Good food. A little more effort would go along way.  I had the boneless chicken wings with the Garlic Parmesan sauce. Almost no sauce on the chicken and I had to ask for more. Obviously the Chicken was pre-breaded and heavy done at that. Mine had to much breading for my taste. My friends Shrimp was just to his liking thought the fries had way to much salt on them. A smart eatery puts just a little on and lets the patrons add more. Many travelers are older and can't handle heavily salted foods. Fair beer selection and my friends Bloody Mary was just OK. Good food if your out of time and choices."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy my experience at Fridays.  The place is much larger than I expected, once seated it took a really long for my server to make her rounds.  I ordered a steak cooked medium with a side salad and sweet potato fries.  The steak was well done and hard to cut.  I never got the fries, but I did enjoy the view of planes coming in."}
{"text":"Just standard Friday's, nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good breakfast food - got the breakfast burrito and while it looks like a lot it's very light. nice and early on the mimosa and Bloody Mary service, and really awesome hostess and waitress - great experience!"}
{"text":"Fridays is always seems like it is a great restaurant, and this one in the airport always provides my family with a good meal.  They are open early to accommodate the early morning flights, and they even were serving lunch at the early hour of 8am.    My dad was even able to order a beer.  Food was great.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I usually like TGI Fridays but this experience at PIT was not good.  The restaurant was not busy (it was 2:30 PM).  I had the bacon cheddar cheese burger which came with fries.  The bun was refrigerator cold and very hard (not ciabatta-hard but stale, cold hard).  I literally had to eat the burger without the bun.  Plus, I am eating an order of McDonald's fries as I write this because I received so few fries with my Friday's burger.    There was one positive, however ... the beer was very cold."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here after being bumped by the airlines so we had several vouchers. Let me start with the food and service. We trust TGIF and the menu and food was great. Service was very good although we did have an awkward situation.  The waiter (Matt) saw our food vouchers and explained they didn't work for drinks, which we understood. He had picked up the vouchers and said you have 6 worth $75 - I corrected him and said they are each $15 so its $90 - he apologized. When the bill came he grabbed all the vouchers and the check. He said I can only use 3 because of the drink policy. I go to sign the slip and notice I only got 2 vouchers back. I bring it to his attention and he counts through his receipts and says \"I took 4\" and gave us one back. My daughter (25) and I have both been waiters and felt like there was something fishy going on. I cant prove anything, just explaining my experience.  Otherwise its s great place to eat, nice view of the runway and they open early for breakfast."}
{"text":"What a great way to relax with my sister while we waiting for our planes home to Austin/Norfolk.         We perched ourselves on the barstool and parked our carry-ones next to us.  There were hooks under the bar top to hang our bags, how thoughtful is that?   Carrie, the bartender, never stopped moving.  She made beverages, took orders, bused the bar and washed dishes and had conversation with us all at the same time. My sister has celiac disease, no gluten.  Carrie set her up with a delicious and colorful meal. There are a lot of restaurants in the hub of this airport.  The next time I find myself here, I will have one less decision to make."}
