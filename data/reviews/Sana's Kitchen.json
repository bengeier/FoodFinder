{"text":"After another day of a walking marathon around Toronto, my husband and I paid a visit to Kensington Market. He was in the mood for Shawarma and I was in the mood for anything vegetarian, when we stumbled upon Sana's Kitchen.  There's a little patio area with tables, which made the experience much better, as the inside was a little too non-atmospheric for my liking.   My falafel was decent, but a tiny bit dry. I was really surprised to see how much food it entailed. I envisioned a sandwich, but ended up with a plate of rice, salad, vegetables, 3 falafels and some cooked vegetables. The hummus, however was great. I had to leave most of my plate behind because I couldn't stop focusing on the hummus. Yummus!"}
{"text":"I had probably spoke too soon when I announced \"Zucchini falafel! How exciting! I think I'll try that.\" cuz the very sweet and heavily accented server behind the counter had a few things to say herself: First of all, they were out of zucchini falafel. Oh. Secondly, the debit machine wasn't working. Crap!  Luckily, I dug up enough pocket change for a boring old chickpea falafel ($4.50) which I was promised would be just as good - and to be fair, it did it's job, but have you ever settled for chickpeas when you'd had your mind set on zucchini? It's just not the same thing at all. My amigo's chicken gyro ($5.50) was reported to be alllright save for the non-solicited onions that were snuck in.   As we swung our legs while eating from one of many stooled high-tops, the colourful selection of exotic juices and iced teas teased me from the behind the glass of their refrigerated home while I thirstily wondered why I had promised to pay for dinner without checking that I had enough cash. I will probably not be back, but they sure looked refreshing."}
{"text":"I'm getting to be a regular, as the shawarma can't be beat at their lunchtime special prices. Tried several of the competitors in the neighborhood, and Sana's is easily the best - and bonus, one of the cheapest."}
