{"text":"Great place. 

Leslieville location is really the only of its kind in the area worth going to. Slices at all locations are huge, and always topped generously with fresh ingredients. Staff are always friendly, and even let me have a few taste testers of gelato while i wait for my pizza!!

Overall would totally recommend. Much healthier and better tasting than your usual PIzza Pizza cardboard junk."}
{"text":"We walked in at lunch time today, and there was no menu anywhere so we asked the guy behind the counter who told us the menu was available online! Seriously?! You guys cant even print out a piece of paper?"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here.  Everything always tastes really fresh. Takes a while for them to make it sometimes, bit it is worth the wait. The Gelato was okay, I have had better. The prices seem a little high. Almost $9 for a large gelato? Think I would rather go to Ed's for gelato, but will be back for the pizza for sure. Staff could also be a little friendlier, but it is always really hot in there, which may explain why they always seem so grumpy."}
{"text":"Awful, inch-thick crusty, bland, tasteless, expensive pizza. Don't even bother."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!! We get a Gelato Pizza from this Queen and St. Patrick location EVERY Sunday and it is the highlight of our week. We looooove the nice big sun dried black olives and the whole grape tomatoes. It is SO GOOD! We ask for thin crust and it is delish! This is our go-to pizza place in Toronto."}
{"text":"We got gelato pizza for dinner. We got the Magio pizza which was supposed to feature mozzarella, Gorgonzola, boccacini and  parmigiana.  It was your basic cheese pizza and did not feature anything but mozzarella. As for the gelato it is not authentic or  made with natural flavours. The pistachio was a bright green colour and tasted very artificial. Not horrible but you could definitely find better near by.."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, the worst pizza experience of my life. 

I will preface this by saying that I have had excellent experiences with this place in the past. I have been touting this pizza around town, saying it has the best gluten free pizza around. Things have changed.

I do not know if they have changed management, or what has happened, however, tonight it was atrocious. I will not be back.

I live around the corner from the shop, it came late. It was not hot, however it was over cooked (go figure), the gluten free crust was rigid, thin, and bland and it was out of control expensive. $50 for two mediums. The margherita pizza did not look fresh. Overall, there was not a single positive aspect of tonight's pizza. 

We were starving, so we choked it down. Otherwise I would have walked it into the store and asked how it had changed from the time it left the shop, because I would be embarrassed to send this out of my doors."}
{"text":"We've tried two of their pizzas - one on the whole wheat crust the other on GP's regular - both were very tasty. Service isn't the friendliest in town but I'm going to blame the lack of AC for that (it's been ridiculously hot of late)"}
{"text":"Based on some of the other lackluster reviews I must have come on a good night because the pizza was delicious. 

Crust was very nice, toppings were ample and fresh and I didn't feel burned out after eating it like you do with a lot of pizza places. I usually get whatever came out of the oven most recently and that night it was a 'deluxe' of sorts. Washed it down with an orange San Pel. 

Left satisfied. Friendly, smiling staff. No complaints. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Strolled into Gelato Pizza on Queen by St Patrick today (just west of Osgoode TTC). It is brand new, and replaced the Decibel clothing store that used to be there.

It was empty when I stepped inside, except for one friendly man working behind the counter.. and some construction still happening in the back of the building. I guess this is a soft-opening and they haven't yet had an official grand opening.

There was a selection of maybe 8 - 10 pizzas available for slices in the displays at the front. Nothing was labelled and no menu was posted; but the server behind the counter took my order and mentioned that for this first week there was a special price (I won't mention any temporary pricing here; but it was very reasonable).

The pizza I selected was the \"Isola\" which is a vegan slice, he mentioned that there was no cheese and would be able to add some cheese if I wanted; but it would take a few more minutes to heat up. I opted in for this add-on.

Hope to be back there again now that they are officially opened to check it out for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Went in to their new leslieville location today. Had heard a lot of neighbours saying there was free pizza, though the main reason I went was because I had been waiting so long for them to open. I ordered a pizza and was asked for $9. I didn't think much of it until I overheard the couple behind me saying that they thought the pizza was free. I took a seat to wait for my pizza and watched two other couples come in and order/receive free pizza. 

I decided to check their website in case there was some deal I was not aware of. The website very clearly said FREE PIZZA June 21-29, 5-9pm (I was there today at 7:30pm). I confronted the person behind the bar and he proceeded to lie through his teeth, saying that \"walk-in\" means that you have to walk-in and order the pizza, then come the next day to pick it up, and then further that it was only available for online orders (?!).  

I left without my pizza. Absolute disappointment and disgrace."}
{"text":"MEDIOCRE PIZZA. CRAP SERVICE AND EXTRA FEES.
I call to make an order and am advised of a 40 minute delivery time.. okay, I can wait.  Then I get a call back 10 minutes later telling me it will be an hour -- how long does it take to make a medium pizza? -- and there will be an additional $5 delivery charge.
Cancelled order and moved on; not good enough for either the wait or the extra charge for an already over-priced pizza.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A little more for a slice and coke than Pizzaiolo but a welcome new variety of slices to choose from.  The atmosphere is respectable and the owner plainly really cares about making this thing work.

He not only brought my slice to my table, he brought me the napkin container so I could choose exactly how many I wanted! So yeah, I think I'll be coming back - if nothing else, I want to try the gelato."}
{"text":"Despite the terrible name, I popped in for lunch yesterday. With a drink, slices are just over $6 and worth it, as there are actually two of them. I loved my giant piece of The Manhattan, a spinach/gorgonzola/feta variety that was one of 4 or 5 veggie options available. All the other pizzas looked great too - heavy on the toppings. Crust was chewy, crispy, perfecto. I'll try ordering a whole pie for delivery soon and report back.

I didn't have any gelato but it looked a little too...colourful.

STRICT VEG*NS BEWARE: My colleague asked them to cut her (very meaty) slice and they swiftly used the slicer marked \"VEGAN\". Not much of a point to having separate tools then, eh G.P.?"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. 

I have been here twice since they opened and as someone else here said \"meh.\" I tried the pizza and it was fine, maybe a bit on the salty side.  It is not Neapolitan style, the crust is a medium thickness.  Another reason I was disappointed was the price, it was around 14$ for a one person pizza and that was a takeout price. The counter guy was very nice though.

The second thing that was disappointing was the gelato. If gelato is in your restaurant's name, you should \"do it right.\" Again it was ok, nothing to write home about and very expensive for what you get. I honestly think the ice cream at Ed's down the street is better.

I appreciate any new business that makes an effort to come to my neighborhood, but Gelato Pizza was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat before heading to the clubs in this neighborhood. First off this is a pizza joint reminiscent of the types you found \"back in the day\" or like ones in New York; very casual eatery. Upon entry of this place the pizzas are lined up in the glass show cases; you order by the peculiar names for slices. I like the fact the slices are one Price! So it doesn't matter if you want a pepperoni or loaded slice; it's $4.99 & the slices are cut in two so it's one huge slice! Now I had one with chicken,tomatoes& pesto. It was really good, the crust was crisp on the bottom yet the dough had good pull/chew to it. The flavour was good too. They make their own dough daily. The guys working that night were very friendly. I would definitely go back when I'm downtown in the area. I saw people walking out with large boxes of \"za\" (that's pizza slang) for those who don't know. Atleast that's what my friends & I call it when we tipsy after late night bar crawl. Oh they do have some tables & chairs about 5 tables in the whole place, but most people I noticed got their slices to go."}
{"text":"The place is not bad; nothing special but nothing bad about it. Went there for gelato (about $4 for small), got the almond mocha which is REALLY good! It was 30 degrees out and was melting fast but in every little scoop, there are almond chunks and the texture of the gelato is almost sticky. No A/C, but couple of benches and a TV."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend for a quick scoop of gelato...pfft!  What a mistake, it took 20 minutes to get a scoop of gelato and pay for our orders...the guy had no clue what they had and had to go back to the freezer at least 3 times to check what they had.  Their freezer had crapped out that day and so they were keeping the gelato in the back. There were only 2 other people in the store and they had already been served and THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE working the counter...it was ridiculous. 

Anyway, my friend ordered mango and I ordered, what I thought was raspberry...it tasted like cranberry at first, then changed to strawberry mid-way through the bowl.  It looked and tasted more like ice cream...not at all what I expected.

Their pizzas looked really good, but something tells me I don't have the time to order and pay for a pizza at this place...service takes forever!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very meh. I just got a regular cheese slice although they did have a lot of options. All of the pizzas with spinach looked old and unappetizing. The cheese was ok, I went for late night eats so usually I'll like anything I eat but I could only finish half of the slice. I would say that maybe go here when you're drunk but otherwise I don't know, it's not better than pizza pizza that's for sure. The garlic sauce was the best part, it was homemade and pretty good although it was close to $2."}
{"text":"This place reminds of the the hundreds of the \"Pizza Gelato\" places that I've seen on trips to Italy.  The people who run the place seem to be authentic Italian.

The pizza is delicious.  It's definitely among the better pizza places in town.  I've tried the MBP, the Brad Pitt, and a few others.  I like them all.  My girlfriend thinks some of the varieties are too salty.

They had a half price special when they first opened.  That was nice.  However, the website said free pizza here that first week, but the guy inside said no free pizza when I went... So that's that.  We eventually got a free pizza on a specific day, but they said it would be a 4 hour wait.  However, if we wanted to buy a pizza, we could have one right away.  Funny stuff.

The owner was really working to make this location take off when he was there.  On the other hand, some of the staff have very poor English skills, which can be frustrating.  The only communication that works with them is to point at a slice, and even then it's difficult.  If you want a full pizza, you'll need to find the staff member who speaks English.

Also, despite the good taste, $5 for a slice seems on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This place changed its name or there is a new company at this location. I found the pizza to be above average so I was satisfied trying this place. The  pizza had a very similar taste as Pizza Nova which I love. But not quite as good. So seeing you are paying probably $5-$6 more per pizza I'll just hit up Pizza Nova over this place."}
{"text":"Hi, me again. This time for the pizza, like I said I would. If you walk in and place a full pizza order they'll take 15-20 minutes to make it.

Indeed, they do a better job with pizza than with gelato, but not by a giant leap. 

The pizzas they have taste and variety-of-ingredients-wise are better than the Amato's or Pizzaiolo crap, and for that reason would make Gelato Pizza a better option than those chains if you want something a bit more 'gourmet'. Pretty good to enjoy and smells damn fresh, but not quite impressing me enough to make me drool or a regular. The dough on my order was tough to cut and chew on. Quite salty too.

They have a very limited vegan option though. Pricey, though comparable to what Pizzaiolo charges, but at least Gelato Pizza's prices are consistently the same among all their standard menu offerings. And the lone wolf holding down the fort behind the counter on a quiet weekend makes efforts to be friendly.

Verdict on pizza: Meh. Not enough to give Toronto a sense of having an innovative pizza scene."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

We've been here twice in about a week, since this is one of the newest places that have opened in the neighbourhood.
I've tried the MBP (mushrooms, bacon and pepperoni), which I found to be somewhat salty, but this is probably largely due to the type of ingredients, and the crust was thicker than I like.

On my subsequent visit, I tried the Basta Casi, a thin crusted pizza with tomato sauce, bocconcini cheese, basil and olive oil.  This pizza was great, not salty, the crust was nicely done, not too thick.

This pizza place is pretty good, a step above pizziolo (or whatever that chain is called that has a logo that has a green background, with a white symbol and red font), but its not as gourmet like a queen margherita pizza or a pizza libretto pizza.  

It's super tasty, and probably a borderline 4 star place.  I recommend this place b/c there's something for everyone, and people are really accommodating.

When I was there, a man asked for a medium to well done crust, and even though they weren't sure what that was, they still tried to do it."}
{"text":"Pizza was consistently undercooked. Not a huge fan of eating raw dough! Decor left a bad taste in my mouth, an over-sized giclee from 1984 really needs to be painted on-maybe a unicorn? Toppings were fresh and varied. Crust although resembling a wet diaper had too much salt on it. Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"We received their flyer in the mail and ordered a medium pizza, easy on the cheese, well done, with olives and pineapple on a classic crust.

It came exactly as I ordered and it was delicious, the best delivery pizza we've had in the neighbourhood. Good telephone customer service manner as well as a friendly and well-mannered delivery person. We were told 30 to 45 minutes and it arrived at one hour. 

The classic crust was beautifully thin, which is my preference. I like a crispy finish to my slice, instead of gum-chewing my way through the crust.

Build your own toppings are 2.25 for medium and 2.75 for large. I couldn't find a specialty pizza that I liked. This was our first time ordering and we would order again."}
{"text":"I visited the new Leslieville location twice this weekend and both times I was disappointed.

First visit was on Saturday and was strictly for gelato, even though I knew about their free pizza promotion advertised on their website. I saw people waiting around outside so I didn't bother with the awesome promotion. Unfortunately, there was no gelato in the store so we left. 

The next day, on the way home, I decided to pop in for their free pizza promotion as the store wasn't busy. I went in (there was one other person there buying pizza) and asked if they were giving out free pizza and the man behind the counter told me I had to book it and the current wait is 2 hours. The customer there told me to just buy it and I wouldn't regret it. I didn't bother and said no thank you and left leaving both of the men surprised. My actions might have been a bit rude, but nothing compared to the way the man behind the counter was talking to me - like I was stupid or something for even asking for free pizza. No thanks! If that's the customer service to expect from this location, I wouldn't recommend it. It's too bad as I was actually looking forward to its opening."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty average for a pizza place like this (where you select a pre-made slice and it's reheated). The toppings combinations on the pizzas are creative and unique. Great location for a slice after a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"After friends didn't want to wait at Grand Electric for a table, they popped into Gelato Pizza instead to grab a bite.  Apparently, arriving before 5:30 at GE still warranted a 45min wait!

Anyway, no real impression for Gelato Pizza.  Like any other place, slices are displayed in a showcase as soon as you walk in.  Slices are just under $5, with tax, does not matter what kind you get.

I got some veg one with red peppers and spinach.  The girl before the counter re-baked it in the oven.  It was awh-ight, nothing special or particularly tasty.  Crust was quite bready, on the thick side.

Friends got an entire pesto pizza with chicken to share.  Contrary to the slices, the crust on that was much thinner.  They said it was a bit greasy 'cause of the pesto.  Either pizza could've been straight outta Pizza Pizza gourmet slices."}
{"text":"I sincerely do not understand how this place does not have higher ratings. Awesome crust, fresh ingredients, fast delivery."}
{"text":"Meh is the word.  The pizza was lackluster..the crust too chewy and doughy.  The dude serving us should looking into getting a personality too.  As we were entering, some woman was telling him off for being so rude.  I didn't find him offensive, but he did seemed like a robot to me.  

Also, did I mention that the place was five thousand degrees?  Maybe that's why dude was so lame."}
{"text":"One of the few 1-star reviews that I've had the displeasure of giving. 

I was passing by on Queen St. & noticed this brand new place. It caught my attention, and though I was not particularly hungry, I decided to give it a whirl. 

The pizza I had was nothing special, something that I could get at any Pizza Pizza location. M'eh.

The ~8 choices of gelato that they had in their tiny freezer looked disgusting. Honestly, I've been a gelato freak for years now, and it has taught me the tell-tale signs of BAD FAKE gelato. This place has it. Plenty of it. Their banana gelato was a bright yellow (tell-tale sign #1 of a gelato shop using artificial ingredients and food colouring). What you'd like to see in this situation is a nice soft grey colour, like a real banana. They also had a very bright neon green mint-chocolate. The other flavours seemed very glazed over and old-looking. No wonder. I don't think anyone in their right mind would be buying this gelato.

The guy behind the counter (not sure if he was the owner) was very rude and seemed like his job was the worst thing ever. Very BAD customer service.

All in all, I don't know how these guys are managing, but at the rate that they are going, they won't be staying long.

P.S. \"Voted #1 by Toronto.com\" - Yeah, I don't think so."}
