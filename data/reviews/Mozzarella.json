{"text":"Hidden gem! This place is so delish :) and the little Italian lady that runs it is the sweetest. I had the gnocchi and salad. Both were superb but I think Mozzarella needs to sell their salad dressing...by the case ;)"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was tempted to give Mozzarella a 1 star rating to keep the rest of you away. I don't even know where to start. First off, the food is as authentic Italian as I've ever had (which says a lot considering I basically grew up in an Italian restaurant). The price is so inexpensive that I thought it was a mistake. And finally, the serving size was more than I could handle for 1 meal (which says a lot considering I'm a chubby dude). The only slight issue is that they're only take-out or delivery, but they also cater."}
{"text":"CLOSED? CLOSED! Noooooooooooooooooooo  I thought it could not be true. We had decided to order takeaway and I was already dreaming about the tiramisu, but then saw it was reported closed on yelp. I thought, it must be a mistake, so I called anyways and my heart started to ache as the phone just rang and rang.  I didn't want to give up hope, so I checked their twitter account, just to make sure I wasn't calling too early and sadly my suspicions were confirmed.   It was too much for her to keep up the kitchen on her own, so now they are shut and I will eternally be 4 away stamps away from a free meal on my loyalty card.  Seriously, so sad about this, their food was really, really, really good.   Taste of Asia to open in its spot..."}
