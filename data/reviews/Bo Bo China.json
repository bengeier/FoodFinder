{"text":"I called the store they said they won't do anything becouse uber takes the money not them. The person on the phone was very rude and told me every body likes the food so I am the only one complaining. They gave me raw food and she didn't belive me. The chicken was raw and the fried rice was raw had to throw it out. I told her I don't even care for a refund just wanted to let them know that they are sending raw food and she hung up on me."}
{"text":"Scrumptious food!! I went for dinner and ordered the lemon chicken a la carte which comes with a fairly large portion of the main course enough to share with two or more people. It also came with egg drop soup and a side of rice (fried or steam at your request). The soup was the best I ever had!   Oh, their crab angel appetizers (other restaurants usually call them \"cream puffs\") were worth a try as well! 

Have to say the prices are decent for the huge portions they serve. Super welcoming and friendly staff. The interior was a bit small, but clean and gave a \"homey\" feeling.

Will definitely visit again! :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place in town to get Chinese Food. The service is always good, the food is well made, and the environment while small, is intimate and not pretentious."}
{"text":"The chicken with the brown garlic sauce is sooo good.
The staff was nice and the place was clean and food was made to order."}
{"text":"My family and I were longtime patrons of the old Bobo China, and were at first hesitant to try the new place, especially after reading some of the Yelp reviews. So, let me set the record straight. 

This restaurant has undergone a substantial improvement over the past owners. The vegetables are fresher and of better quality than before, and the portions are much larger. Prices may be higher, but the portions are 50%-100% larger.

Service has improved as well. When a mistake was made on our carryout order, they were quick to remedy the issue by replacing the meal free-of-charge.

If you haven't been here since the renovation, check it out! It's worth your time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a small mini-mall.  It's a small restaurant with only a few tables.  Seems they do more take out than dine in.  My friend and I ordered the pepper stake and curry chicken.  The food was very good; tasty and mild.  It was also very inexpensive.  I wouldn't rave about the food as some have but it was good enough that I recommend it and would return."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from here through a 3rd party site so I can't comment on their location but I've liked 6 or 7 different items that I've ordered.

Their delivery isn't the fastest but I've ordered during busy times (usually about an hour to get food). 

Yesterday, my food took over an hour and a half to arrive. The restaurant never brought it up but the 3rd party website emailed me a $5 credit without me complaining or asking for it. 

Mimimum order requirement for delivery is $8 which is lower than most and delivery costs $2. 

Beef Curry is great here but that's just based on my taste so who knows if you'll like it or not."}
{"text":"We used Yelp 24Eat for the first time tonight. We ordered from Bo Bo China, also the first time, and I can only say that both 24Eat and Bo Bo China were impressive. 
First. Eat24. Used my Yelp app and found a restaurant in my area that offered the service. Using the app we placed our order and were impressed with the ability to customize our order. We placed the order on our credit card. Very easy and painless. Eat24 called to update us on a possible change we could make in our order, very thoughtful. Then sent us an itemized statement with our order, prices, charges ($5 delivery charge) and approximate time of delivery (they were early 20min!).  The delivery person was prompt and polite. You may leave a gratuity for your delivery driver when you pay for your order if you like. 
Now to Bo Bo China. I ordered the Shrimp in Lobsters Sauce.   Rice and condiments came on the side along with almond cookies. The shrimp were very tasty. Cooked to perfection. Peas and carrots accompanied the shrimp and a healthy portion it was. My only complaint was the Lobsters sauce broke down too quickly. 
All said, we loved the experience of Bo Bo China and Yelp 24Eat. Kudos."}
{"text":"Was staying in a hotel from out of town and found this place on Yelp.Was craving Chinese food and this was the closest to my hotel and had OK reviews.Im giving it a great review.Very good Chinese food and delivered in half of an hour from ordering.The Mongolian beef was amazing and great fried rice."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials. Small clean dine in area, friendly server was helpful with my wife's restricted diet.  

We were pleased and will return for more. Very notable was the soup, delicious."}
{"text":"I will never come here again! They misserved the dishes and they did not admit their mistake and even argued with us......so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bad manner and bad service!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The lunch combos are reasonably priced and decent size portions. The first time I went I ordered the Bo Bo chicken and was disappointed. The chicken was kind of tough and I did not care for the seasoning.  I probably would not have gone back if my friend didn't like the place so much. The second time I went I ordered the Happy Family lunch combo and it was very good. Lots of fresh tasting vegetables, good sauce, beef, chicken, and shrimp with egg fried rice and a spring roll. Other than the Bo Bo chicken I've liked everything I've tried there.  A solid choice."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 7 years and I have to say I have never enjoyed any other Chinese place out there like this one I have tried many places but nothing compares to Bobo China, it's delicious! I have tried everything on the menu and everything is a must try I give every dish 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied....Bobo China is no more :( they sold the business and the new owners kept the name but changed the Bobo chicken and its not the same. 
The price increased and the serving size is about 1/2 the meat now and tons of rice...Im not saying the food isnt good, its okay, its just not the same, but the sauce now being used on the bobo chicken is a thick salty sweet - the old was a garlic onion broth--
The rice is now more like spanish rice instead of fried rice.

You can sure tell its not run by the same owner....

After 20 years of buying from this establishment, we are so disappointed- We wont be going back.  - Thank goodness May Garden is still around, - I didnt think I could be so disappointed in an establishment."}
{"text":"Good food excellent service.  Egg drop soup was well done and didn't taste like it was made from a package like some places.  General Tso's chicken like said by others had no spice but was tasty and well prepared.  Fried rice was cooked well.  I wasn't impressed by the crab rangoon as I'm usually very critical on that dish as I cook my own Chinese food and normally avoid anything I make myself on a regular basis .  Dine in area was very small but clean and staff was friendly.  Much better than going to a big box like panda express.  Worth a look if your in the area and want to try something new."}
{"text":"New owners... Super friendly! Amazing service! Egg foo young was amazing.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE, there are plenty of nice Chinese places within walking distance, don't risk your dinner. The attitude is horrible, we waited for 1h and it turned out they just forgot to cook. When we ask for refund, the women at front shot and acted like it was our fault. Worst Chinese place ever."}
{"text":"I like Bobo. They have really authentic Chinese food. Best on campus. Off campus is Tang Denisty. If you are not from south/southeast part of China, you will definitely agree with me."}
{"text":"I have finally found a quality Chinese food place close to my house!

I got the General Tso chicken and it wasn't spicy at all, but it had a great taste and the rice and egg roll was very good as well.. The sweet and sour sauce was good and everything mixed together hit the spot! 

I will be coming back to this place to try other items on their lunch special for sure since they have their lunch special on the weekends as well! 

The food is great, however, the condition of their actual place isn't nearly as nice as other places.. It looks pretty run down and outdated. A good remodel would help their brand quite a bit. It isn't in the greatest location (a strip mall on life support), but when I went in, there were still some patrons, so I think that this places food keeps it a live. The staff was very friendly and I felt welcome.

I would recommend this place to others and I am glad that I was able to find this place!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food we've had in the valley, everything was delicious, moist, and well seasoned. We ordered teriyaki chicken,  spicy chicken with vegetables, and cheese puffs. The teriyaki was to die for and they gave enough for more than 1 person, and the cheese puffs were very plump and tasty. The only thing I would say is that I really wish there had been cabbage in the chicken and vegetables, but it was flavorful and the veggies were tender. They gave us a plentiful range of sauces and extra fortune cookies.

Two thumbs up, we'll be ordering again in the future."}
{"text":"A group of us just sat down to eat at the grand opening of the BOBO China under new ownership and were very satisfied with the food! Rice bowls have changed to have bigger portions, focused on quality and the service was very friendly and fast!  It may be a small place, but for a quick and delicious meal, BOBO China delivers. I had the lunch special, shrimp with cashew, and there was so much food I had to take to go!! Big, juicy shrimp and no shortage of cashews and veggies makes this my new favorite when I go back next! Give this place a try, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware..... My wife and I have been eating from this establishment for many many years. I've ordered the same menu item all along. (I found a favorite and stayed with it) I ordered the Bo Bo Chicken.... it was not the Bo Bo Chicken  I have eaten in the past. (I guess nothing lasts forever) I'm now aware there has been a change in ownership. When buying an established restaurant don't you get the recipes?  All I can say is good luck with the regular clientele. I for one cannot except the change. Higher price, less chicken and more rice (looked like a mexican spanish rice) and the sauce was like a thick salty maple syrup. I'm not saying the food was bad but it was not to my liking.  I'm sorry to see the end of a legacy. I won't be back........  What were they thinking ???"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I haven't been there for about a year or so and WOW did it go bad..... unfortunately..... went there a few times over the last week or so to be sure but yeah the portion size has gotten a LOT smaller and the egg rolls, wontons, and crab angels are nothing like what they were.... especially the egg rolls, which are either now frozen or just old but the inside is mush.... like those icky buffet egg rolls we all know..... too bad as this used to be one of my fav's for a good lunch special.... no more though...."}
{"text":"We just wanted to give Bobo a shot after hearing some mixed reviews about it. I highly regret it now because it is just the worst chinese restaurant you can find on green street. The food is bland, and the owner got so aggressive when I tried pointing out that the meat tasted a bit old. She literally slammed the table and told me every restaurant cooked their meat like that. 

Would not recommend at all as there are two better chinese restaurants just within twenty yards."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that, for the first 24 years of my life, I had zero experience with Chinese food.  My parents are meat-and-potatoes people, and Chinese carryout was simply not a part of my upbringing.  Enter my Chinese-American husband, who grew up on the stuff (naturally) and can cook it like nobody's business.  This (lengthy) disclaimer is basically to tell you that I am not an educated critic of Chinese food, so it's based on whether or not I liked it.  I have no way to judge how \"authentic\" someplace is.

All that said, Bo Bo is pretty good.  It's a campus town take-out type place, although they do have a dining room and a few tables, so you can eat there if you choose.  They have a very extensive menu, printed in English, Chinese, and Korean.  The menu has every Chinese food item you can think of, and many that you probably can't (and here I am thinking specifically of a dish, whose name I cannot remember at the moment, involving fried pork intestines.  I'm told it's good, although my Leviticus 11 Diet prohibits me from partaking).  

My favorite item here, though, is the bubble tea.  I don't know how they do it, but they make the best bubble tea I've had.  I've tried replicating it at home, and simply can't do it, so, much to my chagrin, when I get a BTC (bubble tea craving), I hop in the car, drive to campus, finagle a parking spot, feed the meter, go get my bubble tea, and repeat the process.  It's a lot of trouble to go to for bubble tea, but it's THAT good.

I did take off a star because they don't always have the bubble tea.  One (very busy) day last month I was running errands; it was cold, it was rainy, I was tired, and all of a sudden, I was siezed by a powerful BTC.  I was sort of near campus anyway, so I drove over there, finagled a parking space, fed the meter, went in, ordered, and was told that they didn't have any bubbles cooked.  Unfortunately, I simply didn't have the time that day to wait half an hour for the bubbles to get cooked, so I ordered the tea sans bubbles, which was still pretty good.  However, I was annoyed that they charged me the full price.  I thought I should have gotten a discount for a bubble-less bubble tea, but I didn't have the time or inclination to press the issue.  Hopefully, that was just a one-time occurrence, and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I seen good reviews for this place because I've been looking for a new Chinese restaurant since the one we went to for 15 years closed its doors last year. I ordered my kids and I lunch today for delivary and I wasn't impressed. The food is mediocre at best. While it did arrive piping hot it wasn't very good. My kids usually clear their plate but both had lots of their orange chicken left over and it was pretty dry. The lo mein was pretty bland although there was a lot of sauce on it. The egg rolls are actually pretty good but the crab puffs really don't taste too good and taste very fishy which is unusual for most of them. The price is outrageous for portion sizes, for 3 people it was over $50 and we didn't get very much food at all even though there were tons of leftovers. I was disappointed with the price because the food wasn't tasty."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm from out of town and never ordered from Bo Bo before. I ordered something I've never had before, the Bo Bo chicken. Not impressed. If I were going to name a dish after myself, or my establishment it had better be good, not so much in this case...should have played it safe and ordered the fried rice. Hard to mess up...."}
{"text":"Ordered thru Uber Eats, got here in a quick manner, it sat on my kitchen counter for about 45 minutes, it was still hot when I ate it. Perfect storage containers. The good was good tasting, spicy, fresh. I recommend them for price, taste, portion."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!
Ordered from here since they delivered. I ordered orange chicken with white rice and Kung pao chicken and shrimp. The only thing I will say is they should add more shrimp and chicken as it was mainly vegetables in the mixture. The food is authentic and delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I got this delivered. It was OK. I'm sure there are better Chinese places in CU."}
{"text":"Meh. Not that great. I got the sesame chicken lunch combo and totally regret it. The egg roll tasted like it was previously frozen & lacked flavor. The chicken was way too salty and the rice was edible but nothing special."}
{"text":"excellent prices, food, and service. I have both ordered delivery and pick up both were satisfyingly swift and successful.  I will definitely continue to order personally as well as refer to all of my friends"}
{"text":"My mom never walked out on a restaurant - until the day we stepped into Bo Bo China.

Bo Bo China didn't know what to do with themselves when my family and I said we DIDN'T want to eat their buffet , which was sad looking, and we wanted to order from their regular menu. We were handed some poorly copied paper menus and sat down in the pretty empty restaurant. 

Apparently there's an unspoken rule here that you either go for the buffet or order takeout, because the lack of service was offensive and we were hungry. The buffet also had flies buzzing about it. 

Never again will I come here, which isn't a loss since there's another Chinese restaurant next door and one across the street. What is up with this stretch of Green St. in Champaign, IL and their Chinese restaurants?"}
{"text":"We've been going to Bo Bo China for years. It use to be delicious. Like everyday earing delicious. We went there last night the first time after it being closed for a month... and we were disappointed. The egg drop soup was egg drop gravy. It was so thick and greasy. They've removed the vegetables from it to so its a thick gravy with pieces of egg. Thats it.
The Sweet and sour chicken... the breading was so thick and there was very little chicken. They also removed the veggies from here. No more carrots or onions or green peppers. Just overbreaded chicken. And no more fountain drinks.   Sorry to say this might be our last time at Bo Bo China... Under the new management it should be called Bye Bye China."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I first decided to give it a try after recently moving to this side of town and really wanting some take-out Chinese. I did a quick yelp search, and this place looked the most promising out of the nearby options. I've been back 4 times since, and have never been disappointed. Their Kung Pao chicken is delicious. I've also had the Orange chicken (it's great- just the right amount of fried, and not overly breaded like at some places). My husband has had the beef with black bean sauce, and the curry chicken. I liked both, but their black bean sauce is definitely the better of the two. If you go in person (and don't get delivery), the combo meal comes with an egg drop soup that is simply amazing. I'm a huge fan of this place, and will definitely be back. We keep meaning to go for lunch (since their lunch prices are such a deal!) but keep missing it. Even going at 3:30 in the afternoon on a weekday, after the lunch menu ends, there were other patrons and several phone calls placing orders for delivery. It's obviously a local favorite. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"The service is great and food is on point. Portions are courteous. I Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never again. It took two and a half hours for my food to be delivered. I got the dumplings, when they finally arrived I ate one, spit it out, and threw out the rest. They tasted vile."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this restaurant when I was going to Big Lots. The location can make it look scary lol but I promise once you go in it isn't so bad. I ordered to Teriyaki Chicken and it was really good. The sauce wasn't too sweet like some other places. The lady that work's there is really nice as well. The prices were also very reasonable. I liked that their lunch menu is bigger than most places. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"New owners don't have a clue on how to run a restaurant.

As one of my group said they're running it like a take out pizza joint.

Instead of taking our order at the table the hostess made us get up from the table and go to the register to order because they have a digital entry system.

They raised the prices and now you have to pay extra if you want soup and egg roll.

They took out the soda fountain and only have canned drinks... like we said before reminds you of a takeout joint not a sit-down place.

We've been going to this restaurant for 15 years we went there at noon and the place was empty on a Saturday when they're usually packed.

I'm afraid to say unless the new owners get their act together they will not be there very long.

Decided to walk out and go to another restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"I can give 1 million stars for ????, but other dishes are just so-so."}
{"text":"Very good, quick, kind service! The $9 combo is pretty typical for all of the food you get. The Mongolian beef was a tad salty but still above average. I'd definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Very authentic northern Chinese food. It has homemade buns (Beef, pork, seafood, vegetarian) every Thursday night starting at 5 PM. You may want to order Ahead because it runs out very quick. But this place serve food very slow and the staff it's just okay."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, I've had quite a few different dishes consisting of the combo that comes with rice, egg roll, and fried wonton. 

The price is very affordable, and the people are always nice when I call and place my order or pickup.  I've never really eaten in house there because the space is kind of small, and sometimes busy. 

Even getting my food to go it is always fresh and delicious.
They do offer delivery but only after 4pm. 
I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try out a new restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my friend whom I hoped to catch up with. After pointing at every restaurant and choosing one we had both never gone to, we found ourselves at Bo Bo China.

I don't know if this is an unwritten rule or custom, but I figured somebody on staff would recognize two people who had no idea what was going on. With little guidance, I pushed us along and we found a seat in back on those sticky, red vinyl benches. We went towards the buffet and got one of each thing. The food was all pretty bland and there was no definitive winner of the choices, or one that was even slightly above average.

And then it happened. I glanced down at my foot and saw a cockroach about the size of my pinky crawling around my feet. Suddenly, I had lost my appetite. I didn't have the heart to tell my partner what I had just witnessed since it was my idea to go to this hut in the first place. We just conversed over tea, the one beacon of clouded hope in a desolate, unsanitary wasteland.

As we walked out, I flagged down a member of the staff, and she almost seemed surprised when we asked to pay our bill. Is this like a donation-based service? Even, if that was the case, I still wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent!  

I was very surprised that the fried rice was like a meal itself.  There were actual slices of meat on top.  Wow.

Plenty of food- had a ton of leftovers."}
{"text":"Won over by the reviews, I decided to try this place for dinner and am incredibly disappointed.  I like to keep bad reviews short and concise, so...

-Had the orange chicken and \"crab angels\"
-Strips of odd color chicken that had the texture of beef jerky and even covered in the sauce did not taste like anything.  Honestly, it was a little strange, really like, nothing.
-Crab angels were under cooked and very bland.
-Rice, old and, just old.

Yep, never again."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place, absolutely fantastic!! Tried it once have not gone anywhere else since! The egg rolls are out of this world amazing! Good food good prices and fast delivery."}
{"text":"?????? ????????? YELP??????????????????????????????? ????????????????? ??????? ???????..."}
{"text":"WORST ATTITUDE EVER. Don't even go there. I don't even know how they are still open. The owner is so bad, she talks to us/other guests like demanding us. We waited so long and even the ppl came after us got their dishes. When we asked how long we still need to wait, the owner was like \"can't u just wait for a while?!\" It was literally so bad."}
{"text":"I ordered from them thru uber eats and it was delicious. They also have their own delivery driver. Small nice place. I believe it's family owned. I ordered and didn't think it would be a lot of food and boy it was. 

I got the house special fried rice with no shrimp, beef with broccoli, house special lo mein with no shrimp, & orange chicken. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I can overlook a slow delivery order that mixed up crab rangoon with egg rolls, but the final straw was getting bubble-less bubble tea. We ordered it and it came out as basically a sugar slurry. I asked the people working there where the bubbles were and they said they didn't have any. 

Would have been nice to know before I ordered..."}
{"text":"One star for the service

Another star for the food quality. It was great.

Another star for the food being worth the price. I got a dinner combo that came with the entree, egg drop soup, wontons, an egg roll, and rice, and I got it all for $6.95! Now if that isn't a deal I don't know what is.

Another star for the wow factor for the amount of food we got for the price.

The one star I didn't give was for the atmosphere because it is a little dingy and not in the greatest area but still a great hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"If I could give this less than a star a would. It was disgusting. Everything was stale and cold, the egg rolls were hard as a rock and the vegetables were slimy. The only thing decent was the service. We asked for our money back and they drove back to give it to us which was very nice."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great!!! And their prices are affordable!! I will be going back ASAP!! We got two free sodas with our order as well.. they also have huge portions!! I will recommend bobo China to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"When you order two chicken dishes and one us like a sponge and the other is moist, it's easy to tell that they might not be using the freshest stuff for all orders. Soup was great and one of the chicken dishes was outstanding. Egg rolls were on point as well. Hit or miss seems to be the the main reviews and I would have to agree. But staff was friendly and that's worth giving a few chances for."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and there will not be a third time.  Portion was less than half of what was given last time. The dishes were like leftover from other customers. It literally looked like someone just finished eating it. I also suspected sanitary issue with this place. I had bad diarrhea after having Bobo's food. Long story short, AVOID this place at all cost. I'll never return."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I placed an order for delivery tonight. Let me tell you, Bo Bo NAILED IT!!! The food came super hot and we didn't have to wait too long for it to arrive. The dish I had, moo goo gai pan, was the freshest I've EVER had!! The price was right and we were EXTREMELY pleased. All around.....5 star experience!!"}
{"text":"The only place on campus to go for Northeastern Chinese food, I'd say this place does a good job of offering a variety of dishes.  Bring a Chinese speaking friend, ask for recommendations, and definitely try the meat buns on Thursday."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for making our Friday night dinner delicious.  Finally a restaurant that put meat to veggie ratio balanced.  We ordered the Steak with Veggies Schezuan style.  They would have gotten five stars but they did not make it extra spicy.  Nonetheless it was delicious.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Well this is definitely a legit spot for any northern Chinese, but apparently not so for ppl from anywhere else in the world based on the review. Personally I've been there regularly, and also a big fan of their food. You have to know what to order and what kind of food you're expecting. I love their chicken with mushrooms and the braised pork ribs with beans.. I will take a star off just for their mediocre buffet. Dishes are usually empty when I am there"}
{"text":"I'd recommend order based on the menu they posted on their counter, not the regular menu they handed to you. The menu on the counter contains very delicious dishes that are not included in the regular menu. I recommend their spicy stir fried pod - best in town. They also offer Bao every Thursday, which is another good choice. 

Their service is just OK, and the place can get noisy, so don't expect too much on those."}
{"text":"I was unaware that ownership had changed in the past year. 

I took my granddaughter for lunch to eat soups. Kind of a tradition that I share with her. It was not the same, at all.

Egg drop soup: pretty good but doesn't have all the cabbage like it used to, which I loved. 

Wonton soup: just pork wontons in broth, (pretty good and plenty of meat) but it used to be wor wonton soup with a couple of shrimp, snow peas, broccoli, cabbage and bbq pork. It was heaven to me! I love vegetables. 

Hot and sour soup was  lukewarm, thickened with cornstarch and not very spicy or sour. 

The teriyaki chicken skewers were tasty, but I am willing to bet they were deep fried. Maybe they are everywhere, I don't know. 

They gave us bottles of water (Costco) which was nice as it was free. The tap water around here tastes terrible. But no glasses to pour it into. 

Ambience: Terrible!! Our 4 soups were served in plastic to-go containers, even though we were eating there.

We could clearly hear the ongoing fight, going on within my line of sight. The older woman berating the two young male workers in a language I don't understand. Cantonese?

Cost: very inexpensive, had the food been better. My 14 year old granddaughter and I shared 4 soups and an order of teriyaki chicken skewers. We did not not order drinks.
The bill was just under $14. They must have comped us something because that's too cheap. I didn't look carefully.

Picture 1 from March 2016, (notice real dishes and broccoli peeking out of the soup?) picture 2 from today (to go containers, really?) She's a good sport but we were definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service when we came in. Found this place on yelp and was very surprised. It is a little hole in the wall. Hope this review makes more people stop by.

Egg Drop soup awesome
Pork Egg Foo Young delicious
Bobo Chicken good

Quiet clean place!"}
{"text":"I wish I could choose zero star. The worst attitude I've ever seen. Won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Quick to get the food out! Food was great quality too. Best prices in the valley too!"}
{"text":"So... I've never been to the restaurant, but I have ordered by delivery. The 1st 2 stars are for the service. Food arrives promptly and as ordered. The 3rd star is for the quality of the food. My husband won't touch it, and I've only ordered from here a couple of times in hope and expectation that the food would be better the next time... Dream=Stomped! LoL. The search for good Asian cuisine remains a debacle."}
{"text":"When we got there we almost left because the outside is kinda unappealing. But we are glad we went in because it was nice and clean and the woman who helped us was super nice .

We ordered Sesame Chicken, House lo mein and orange chicken. The Sesame chicken we ordered spicy, and it was delicious ! We took the food back to our hotel and had so many leftovers that we offered them to housekeeping who gladly accepted them.

I would recommend this hole in the wall to anyone that wants an inexpensive Chinese meal in Peoria!"}
{"text":"I ordered from BoBo China through grubhub.com. Being that it's a Friday night and the email they sent estimated delivery to be over an hour, I was pleasantly surprised when they showed up in about 25 minutes. I chose to try this place because I found a $5 off coupon code online, which got me $17 worth of food for $11, and I'm still not sure it was worth it. Everything I ordered tasted very bland and was a little on the greasy side for me. Next time I'll get my butt in the car and go to my usual chinese place."}
{"text":"I tried the food before with previous owners not good at all....so when I heard that there were new people I decided to give another try & I love it!!!!!! prices  are fair the portions are good super delicious Mongolian beef is my favorite so far :)"}
{"text":"Great food always fresh and hot. Very fast service. Not a fan of the egg drop soup or Mongolian beef, but everything else is fantastic! Best place in the area by far!"}
{"text":"Little hot on the inside, but the service is good and it is family run. Food is good as I had the sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery about 6 months ago.  Food came after close to 2 hours.  It was cold when it came, and the driver was barely apologetic.  They were very unhelpful over the phone.  Food was mediocre, definitely not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  I was apprehensive because there have been claims of cockroaches in the food, but I had none.  I would definitely go with Cravings if you're in the area over Bobo China."}
{"text":"This is a great example of hit or miss, I suppose. Opted to order from here due to several good reviews. Here's how it went for us:

Sweet and sour chicken was okay.
Salt and pepper shrimp had no crisp, the batter was doughy and without flavor.
Crab wontons were doughy, chewy, and not really appetizing.
Pork fried rice was bland.
Chicken chop suey was fresh, so that was basically the bright spot.

Sixty dollars later, counting in tip and delivery charge...

Never again.
Everything but one small dish was disappointing enough that we didn't finish the meal and now I'm looking at ordering pizza to feed us."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Food is always fresh and delicious. Egg drop is amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered here through  ubereats and pictures look appetizing but food was really really salty . I put my shrimp and veggies in a strainer to rinse off all the salty brown sauce and it was good and they put lots of shrimp in my order . Wontons soup was really salty and crab puffs  were not good at all ;(. I don't think I will order here again. If you decide to order maybe ask for salty sauce on the side ."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I would have given this place 4 stars. It was really good.  I was getting my tires rotated at Discount Tire up the block and tracked this place down on yelp and with the good reviews I was down for a nice lunch.  The meal was delicious and less than $5.  Fast forward to today.  I went in and the guy taking my order said that if I wanted to substitute hot and sour soup for egg drop, I would just have to pay full price.  In that case bring out the free soup which will just sit there.  For a friend, I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and asked if noodles could be substituted for rice.  He told me that wasn't possible even if I paid an upcharge?!!?  Come on buddy, you own the place, go back there and cook some noodles instead of rice and trying making a customer happy.  Anyway, after all of that, the food wasn't nearly as good this time as it was last time.  Last time the Mongolian Beef was crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  This time it seemed pretty bland.  I will give this place another chance, but I won't crave this place as much as since the first time."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, great food, and great prices! Would eat here again! This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"It was too hot to leave the house today so we ordered through Uber Eats. The food arrived super hot within 30 minutes. The portions were HUGE, and the food was decent. We ordered the orange chicken, house special chow mei fun and some fried rice. The fried rice was pasty, but other than that the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"probably the worst experience i have ever had on this street. the old lady who worked at the cashier yelled at customers and drive them out of the restaurant. Apparently, I didnt see any bad that customer had done to upset that old lady. it was their attitude, the restaurant like this shouldn't  open anyway!"}
{"text":"We came in based on an assumption my husband had this Bobo's had not so great food but good boba tea because of their name. We've recently moved to Urbana from California and have been craving good bubble tea. We came in near closing time (9:30, not 9:00 as yelp indicated). They were friendly enough but it took them about 15 minutes to bring our drinks (we finally ended up with a regular and green milk tea after she told us they were out of half the flavors we requested). My hopes were quickly falling as each minute passed. Finally she brought the drinks out of the back, a partially open kitchen next to a sad looking buffet. My husband paid $8 total for our drinks which had a pitiful amount of tapioca balls in them. After my first drink I knew the tapioca balls were so so old, who knows how long they've been there?! Both teas were weak and sickly sweet. We couldn't finish and realized that was an $8 lesson well learned. Please don't get tea there. You are much better off trying Chatime down the street!"}
{"text":"Really quick delivery and wonderful food. Loved the packaging, made storing the leftovers really easy. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice. Both times we're 5 stars. Food was delicious. Delivery was expeditious."}
{"text":"Just don't go this place, unless you like to be served by bad attitude owners and sitting on sticky chairs. Once I ordered their food it took half an hour for them to tell me that they can't make it. Fuck this place"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here on a number of occasions and every single time it's been delivered fast, hot and delicious!  I decided it was worth changing my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.

BTW, the boneless spareribs are like pork candy...absolutely scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"always good food! Great service. Fast delivery and never gets my order wrong. Always early!
My favorite is pork egg foo young!"}
{"text":"Went there several times for buffet. They only have maybe 10 selections of fried dishes and some desserts that look old. 
Haven't tried anythin else there."}
{"text":"Gross! The steamed rice was mushy and watery. The chicken lo mein noodles were undercooked and not tasty at all. I I ordered a side of teriyaki sauce for the rice and it was tasteless. General Tso chicken was very chewy and not edible. The egg roll was suspicious. My kids enjoyed the spring roll but that was it. Waste of money!!!!"}
{"text":"As much as I love my Chinese heritage, I will not dishonor it by writing a good review about Bo Bo China.

Let me put it this way, I have eaten here about 3 times in the past four years, and after my last time... well it is going to stay the last time.

I ordered a spicy chicken with fried rice combo which arrived in a hour to my workplace. Since it was busy i was only able to eat 1/3rd of it. The next day at home I heated up another third of it. And finally on Sunday, I ate the final third.

AS I WAS FINISHING THE LAST COUPLE OF BITES:

I FOUND A COCKROACH IN IT... AUGHHHH

The cockroach had been cooked with the dish and I guess settled with the sauce to the bottom of the takeout box. I had a moment where I thought I should be vomiting uncontrollably. But thanks to my superb nerves of steel i calmly spit out the food I had been chewing and proceeded to scrub my mouth out. Dry heaves ensued.

I am never eating here again. I am one to hate asian stereotypes about subpar kitchen cleanliness but this one takes the cake. Honestly? A cockroach? *Sigh*"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and the food got there on time. I ordered their Triple Jade, Sweet & Sour Pork, Tofu Veggies Soup, Steamed Dumplings, Egg Drop Soup and the Vegetarian Spring Rolls. 

The Triple jade was delicious, but a bit soggy. 

The Egg Drop Soup was also good.

The Steamed dumplings were soggy and stuck together. It tasted OK but the sogginess made them almost impossible to dip into the sauce because they kept falling apart whenever I tried to pick one up.

The Sweet & Sour Pork was lacking. It was very mediocre and after a few pieces, I felt a bit yucky and couldn't eat anymore. It was like they fried the pork in old/dirty oil. The sauce was like instant sweet & sour sauce and not the authentic sauce made with pineapple and bell peppers. 

The white rice that came with the orders was really dry. 

I didn't have any of the Tofu Veggies soup, but my friend that did said that it was good, as were the spring rolls. 

What caught me by surprise was the $5 delivery charge. Apparently they charge you for every mile they had to go. I didn't notice it when I looked over my order before confirming, but it was on my printed receipt once they got there. 

Overall, the food was very typical and nothing stood out, but the quality wasn't the best. I wouldn't order from here again unless I didn't have a choice."}
{"text":"Haven't been here forever, man it was great! Fresh to order. I had sweet & sour chicken & fried rice! 
Omg love it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: It is a dingy little place. No more than 400 square feet of slightly cramped booths. The ambiance is that of a hole in the wall, family run business. This is nothing new to those of us who enjoy the benefits that come with smaller, family run eateries but I did desire a little bit more.

Food: My Mongolian Beef was very good. The texture was right, the sauce was tasty.. a bit sweet but tasty none the less. The portion size was good but not gigantic as some others have said. Where it fell short was in its spiciness. I asked for extra spicy and it still had less spice than any dish topped with hot salsa. My girlfriend ordered the Garlic Chicken (Bo Bo Chicken) I think it was called. It had a good texture, but lacked in the \"garlic\" part that was expected. The fried and breaded chicken chunks were placed on top of a thin layer of the garlic sauce which was weak.

Service: Outstanding! The lady running the operation was attentive to the point of predicting our needs.

Summary: I will try them again because I just have a feeling that my experience was sub par. I do not think a place with such great service can be so lacking in their actual product."}
{"text":"Usually I am hesitant to write a review after my first visit (unless the place really turns me off) but after 10 minutes in here I could tell this was going to become a favorite spot.

My friend took me to this place on a Tuesday afternoon and we were the only ones in there and the only thought in my head was \"awkward!\" But nevertheless, our server was prompt and super friendly. 

There is a fairly large selection on the menu with different types of rice, pork, beef, seafood, the usual stuff. So naturally I figured it would be like any other Asian restaurant but I figured wrong. 

I ordered the orange chicken (I'm white...I know) and it was tremendous. The portion sizing was unreal...It was huge (That's what she said)! I was incredibly hungry and I couldn't finish it. It was the combo deal so it came with egg drop soup, a side of rice, an egg roll and a crab puff of some kind. Needless to say the meal was marvelous and had a taste of epic proportions. 

When the bill came it was only ten something for both my friend and I, and I near soiled myself. This place is awesome and I will be back."}
{"text":"I can't comment on most of the food because I came here for hot pot but it was honestly really good hot pot. We got beef, pork, shrimp, fish, and vegetables/sides including mushrooms, napa cabbage, vermecelli noodles, tofu, and daikon radish. The quality of the meats and vegetables was good, the broth was tasty, and there was a wide variety of dipping sauces. It's cheaper than some of the other hot pot places on campus (Hot Pot Lab) but not by much. I would definitely come back but based on other reviews would probably stick to hot pot."}
{"text":"I enjoy Bobo China a lot. Their food is good, service is friendly and they deliver. I always get white meat for my chicken dishes and have never been disappointed. I moved from the area and still go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"It is the only restaurant in the Champaign area that serves authentic northern Chinese food. If you are from northern China, you can't miss it."}
{"text":"This place is great. A real hidden gem as someone else said. This place is run by the chef and and his wife.  Great service, great food at even better prices.

The egg drop soup is indeed the best here and I still haven't had better since moving to San Francisco."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Chinese food in the valley.  This place is very good.  It has all the favorite Chinese dishes plus many not common dishes.  Such as their specialty of BOBO chicken which is basically a fried chicken in garlic sauce.  The prices are the best on average a combo meal for dinner is about 6.25 and that is as of today.  It is a family ran business and they all work there.  The food is served fresh to order every time.  The egg drop soup is the best by far when compared to other Chinese places.  If you want to go out of the box and try something good at a very good price and have great service go here.  

My favorites from this restaurant are

Bobo Chicken
Mandarin Chicken (awesome)
General TSO chicken
Yakisoba 
Egg Rolls
Chicken Wings

The address can be kind of confusing but it is really easy to get here its right off of grand avenue  and 87th ave right next to a big lots."}
{"text":"I never noticed this place in the years of driving by occasionally until yesterday. It is in a strip mall on Grand Avenue next to Big Lots. It was close to lunch time, so I quickly checked Yelp and found out it was worthy of a try. 

I ordered a Happy Family lunch combo, spicy. The flavor was very good! I enjoyed my lunch, and it was cheap!! The ingredients were fresh and quality ingredients. The shrimp were good sized shrimp, not little dinky ones.

The only thing I didn't like is that the chicken was dark meat, not white meat. There was a lot of chicken in the dish, so it was a bit of a bummer. Now that I have their menu, I can see that there is an option to upgrade to white chicken (unless noted the dish is already white meat) for 75 cents. Not bad. I just wish I would have known.

The place feels clean, unlike a lot of Chinese restaurants. The owners are very friendly. I will return whenever I am in the area. Heck, I might even go out of my way a little bit."}
{"text":"This place was new On Grub Hub so I wanted to try it out. The food and delivery was fine. What I did not like was that the delivery man stood their looking at me waiting for a tip. I always tip using Grub Hub. When I looked at the receipt I understood why. It appears that the restaurant only places the very basics of the order. No where did it indicate that I had already tipped the driver. So now I am left wondering if the driver even got his tip at all or if the restaurant is pocketing that money and steeling from its drivers. On top of that, the receipt says the delivery fee was $3.00 because the trip was 3 miles. So it was $1.00 a mile not just a $1.00 as advertised on Grub Hub. This place is too shady and I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"My friends and I love getting Chinese food every so often, and Bobo China is our go-to. We get delivery and the person who delivers is always cheerful and gracious. And the food is delicious to boot. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could choose zero stars I would've. Terrible customer service to match their terrible food. I received my order late, and it was wrong. I called the restaurant immediately to let them know what was wrong and after the 10 minutes it took for me to get the woman on the phone to understand what was wrong and agree that there was a problem with my order, she said she would send someone. After waiting an hour for the replacement food to come I called to make sure it was coming, only to be yelled at and told my problem wasn't that big and they were too busy to be bothered with me and then hung up on. DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOOD CHINESE FOOD GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Searched the internet for Chinese food near me and found this on top 3. I was very excited to try a new place. I saw others on the list that were some of my favs but lower on this same list. I ordered online which was easy but did not expect a 1hr delivery time frame. I ordered the Bo Bo chicken which was overcooked, dry, and hard. I also ordered dumplings which were overcooked. These were fried and tasted as if the oil hadn't been changed. You have a choice of white rice, brown rice, or fried rice as a side. I opted for the fried rice and yet it was still bland with no flavor. I am honestly shocked they are on the top 3 list of places near me as I have had better. I do not recommend this place and will not eat here again."}
