{"text":"I literally had to spit the food out back onto the plate.  Gross I know.    This is my 2nd time here and the first was no better.   My fault I know for putting myself through this twice.  Everyone says oh the food is great so after my first time getting raw chicken served to me I thought I'd give it one more chance. People make mistakes right?

So tonight I get rubber chicken served to me. I couldn't even bite thought it.  

I won't be punishing myself a 3rd time. 

On a positive note. The fries were good."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite spots in sauga city to eat. Cheap tasty grub with a fairly large menu. Souvlaki plates and the fish & chips are solid options. Only con is that the location is very outdated and the service is very hit and miss."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Wally's for a quick bite to eat while in Mississauga, and for starter's, this place has all the trimmings of a greasy spoon.  Wally's is not a place to come to for the decor, that's for sure.  However, they do have good food and decent portion sizes at a reasonable price.  Dine in or carry out, enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner here.  Enjoy a Big Wally (a char broiled burger) with a decent choice of toppings, such as I did.  Service is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Looks sorta sketchy but don't judge a book by it's cover.

Everything from burgers to gyros to all day breakfast. Late night, early morning, your hangover cure; Wally's is pretty sick all around.

Food to cost ratio is pretty sweet however... after they had their fire a couple of years ago, their price has gone up a bit. Not gonna lie.

Licensed to serve alcohol as well!

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times when I used to work nearby. This rating is based mostly off lunch.

Their service is a really rare positive experience for similar places. They take your order or suggest meals if you're indecisive. 

The food is prepared somewhat fresh. I usually get the homemade burgers which are grilled on the spot. I've seen the toppings chopped up fresh twice a day which is alright.

The burgers definitely taste homemade which is a good thing. And portions are decent for the price. 

The atmosphere is the real downside to this place. Even looking from the outside you can tell it's going to be a dingy old school diner. Not somewhere you'd take your client or your date. I honestly wouldn't bring kids here either. 

Summary: Great service. Good food. Needs renovating."}
{"text":"This place is by far is the worst restaurant to go for breakfast.
Starting from the condition of the place itself to the level of customer service is appalling.
Ordering food is not a problem but don't expect to get your food brought to ur table, when the order is up they yell it out so the customer has to get up to get it. To make matters worse they will not give free refills on coffee if u happen to want more prepare to dish out $1.50 for a second one which they serve in a little tiny cup it's ridiculous!
Food is mediocre and I would rather pay a little extra and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place, go here all the time. The breakfast is awesome and only $8. Also get burgers, fish and chips, sandwiches, all great stuff. Big portions."}
{"text":"Only their breakfast is appetizing. 

Do not, i repeat, DO NOT order anything that isn't breakfast, you'll be in for a rude awakening. Do so at your own risk. 

I don't  want to be the one who said i told you so."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife since I really like diner type restaurants.  This was a disappointment.  I had a burger and it tasted like the kind you buy at costco in a plastic bag and cooked on a gas grill.  Not great.  

The place is quite dirty, and the cook who served our food kept asking me about my and my wife's ethnicity?? Quite uncomfortable.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great burgers after a night of clubbing in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and prepared right before your eyes. Typical diner fare, even the eggs Benedict was good, and I have high standards in that respect. 

Only thing... It caught fire a few years ago, and yet all the decor still looks thirty years old. 
Did they intentionally buy ripped booth seats?"}
{"text":"Cheap but awesome quantity. Must try is the home made burger. Fries didn't have lots of salt in them so good for low sodium lovers. Overall a good budget meal"}
{"text":"In a pinch for late night cuisine. Once one of Mississauga's good burger places."}
{"text":"The very epitome of a greasy spoon. Wally's has been a staple of the landscape at the corner of central parkway and hwy 10 for as long as I can remember. 

It has served me well after many a long nights with burgers, gyros, rings and other typical diner cuisine. The food is not spectacular but at 2am its damn well decadent!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with wally's!! You can come here any day of the week, any time and eat whatever you want and it'll be amazing! This place has been around forever and never disappoints!

I often come here during late nights when I'm in the area and go for their burger and fries combo! It's always so good! The burger is cooked to order served with crispy fries and a drink. Portions are big and you can get any toppings on it. Aaaand it's cheap"}
{"text":"Did not like the place and my order came in incorrect. Food did not taste good.  Come here only if you're drunk, not for sober people."}
{"text":"Oh Wally's... What do you really say about Wally's? It's open super late (3am weekdays/4am weekends), which makes it the perfect SquareOne-area, post-bar place to get food whether you're looking for something at 3am, or the next day when you wake up with that pounding headache and grumbling tummy and are looking for a greasy spoon... they'll be there, ready and waiting for you.

I personally have only been in the morning, so all of my experiences are breakfast-related. And speaking of breakfast, it's good. I mean, it probably isn't that healthy, but it tastes delicious. For about $7 you can get eggs (2), bacon (2), sausage (2), breakfast potatoes (more than 2) and toast (2). You really don't need more than that. Yesterday I got adventurous and ordered a bacon grilled cheese. OMG it was good. A bit nostalgic, because it reminded me exactly of the grilled cheese's that my grandpa used to make me as a kid... it was perfect. White bread with lots of margarine on them, 2 slices of cheese and bonus bacon. I wasn't like over the top hungry, so that was just enough food for me. At $4, I think that's a bargain.

Now, the decor is something you're really going to have to get over. It probably hasn't been refinished since the 70's... orange fabric seats which are in very bad shape (as a matter of fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they used to be orange vinyl, and the plastic layer has just worn off in the last 40 years of nearly 24/7 traffic), and an overall look that leaves a lot to be desired. There is always lots of parking which is great.

At the end of the day, it's a REAL business, owned by REAL people, not some standardized chain. I think these businesses deserve to be supported, which is why I've given Wally's 4 stars, when in reality, maybe it should only have 3.5."}
{"text":"Great family owned breakfast spot. Nice to visit a non restaurant chain. I haven't tried the lunch there. Prices are reasonable except for the tiny cup of coffee they subsequently try to charge you $1.50 for a refill for. Would recommend trying it"}
{"text":"its a bit of a dump and a total greasy spoon but the food is decent for a Mel's diner kinda place.  I'm guessing this was a truck stop or something and the city sprang up around it.  Its not gourmet cuisine but I'm sure you know that when you pull up in the parking lot.  If you want a burger and are with some friends and dont want to worry about being loud or just want some bacon and eggs and you are in the area, its an OK place to stop.  I've been going here for years and no matter how many times i say i need to eat more healthy food, once in a while the smell of bacon lures me back in"}
{"text":"Restaurant is old and usually late at night filled with drunk homeless people. Food is good if you craving burgers fries souvlakis and what not."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years. 

Great place for a ghetto burger joint. As I'm eating here now, there is a massive hair in my food but god damn the food is good.  You can always count on your neighbourhood crack head to be here always begging for change.  But again, 15+ years and I still come back to ghetto old Wallys."}
{"text":"This is my late night after 11pm go to place. It's 2 minutes from where I live. I've been coming here for years. Prices are great service is great and the food is what you pay for.  I like the old decor gives it that old diner feel. I mostly do takeout but I stay in on occasion. My go to is the club house simple but very good!!! #wallys"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is over 30 years old and the people are just as friendly today as they were 30 years ago it stays open after hours so when you need a burger at 2:45 in the morning it's the place to go it also serves breakfast that's to die for it's not fancy but the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"For those of you that know me you know how much I love my Burgers and you know I'm a huge critic when it comes to burgers.  Wally's has been on my hit list for a long time.  My favorite burgers come from places like Wally's.  Old school charbroiled burgers.  From what I understand Wally's has been around for ever and is considered one of the original greasy spoon places in Mississauga.  Well with rumors of Wally's closing down so they can build condos I had to get in there to give this a try before its too late.  As soon as I entered I was excited to see the old school decor and the original menu from decades ago.  As soon as you walk in you can smell the charbroiled burgers.  I ordered a banquet home burger combo.  Like all the old school places you can see them making the burger and when they are done you get to choose your toppings.  I had placed this order for take out.  The burger and the fries looked amazing and could not wait to sink my teeth in to the burger.  As they finished putting the toppings on my burger I noticed they placed the burger and fries in a Styrofoam container.  At first I thought that this was a great idea and to be honest a costly idea for business owners.  When I got home I reached into the bag to find the inside of the bad wet.  Well I clicked to me that what happens when you put hot food in a container like the.  Its causes moisture.  The inside of the container was soaked.  My fries were soggy and my bun was wet.  My whole entire meal was soggy.  So I ate it either way.  Here is the sad this.  The burger taste was amazing and the fries would have been so good also. It was a 5 min drive home from Wally's yet it was enough to make it soggy.  I believe next time I will try to eat in or ask them to wrap my burger in foil to avoid this from happening.  I believe that Wally's can be a 3 or 4 star place all day based on the taste of the food but unfortunately I have to give it 2 stars based on my experience.  When and if I visit again I will come back and update my review if need be."}
{"text":"I've lived right next to this place for a few years and I've never tried it.  However, I had nothing in the fridge and was too lazy to get my car out of the parking lot tonight, so I decided to walk over and be adventurous with my health.  It's a typical greasy spoon, diner-type joint.  The decor definitely leaves you wanting, but I'm not picky on decor as long as it's clean.  This place was surprisingly clean.  

As for the food, I tried the Eggs Benedict.  Yes, I had Eggs benedict for dinner...leave me alone!!! :-P 

It was under $10 including tax.  This definitely was a diner version of Eggs benedict. It didn't look anything like it, however the egg was cooked fairly well and the Hollandaise sauce was okay.  My biggest complaint is that the English muffins were not toasted.  

But I'd say that this place is okay when you have nothing else to eat and have a craving for greasy food."}
{"text":"Wally's has been a Cooksville mainstay for far longer than I've even been alive. It's not a 24/7 diner, but it's open late enough to cater to even the most extreme night owls.

If their long hours weren't indicative enough, Wally's value proposition is in their convenience. You don't go here for that special dish that's made better here than anywhere else. They are an average diner, with average prices, and everything is just A-OK. 

One dish I would recommend, however, is their fish and chips. At $13 (not cheap, I know), you get two large slabs of deep fried fish with a generous helping of french fries. Personally, I like asking for everything to be made extra crispy. The meal also comes with a small container of coleslaw and tartar sauce. It's not your traditional fish and chip meal, but it's definitely more filling.

I've tried a few other dishes from here and was generally satisfied. The food quality is just fine. I'm confident in saying that you won't be turned off by any of their food, but you won't necessarily be wow'ed either, and sometimes, that's just what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Late night eats at its finest!  Greasy spoon old school place if you want a good burger and fries, chicken fingers, etc as well as alcohol...food isn't the only thing greasy, the crowd that shows up at night are very sketchy."}
{"text":"This place has been around for at least 20-30 years. 

My earliest memory of this place was when I was 7 years old, when my father took me here after a shopping trip to Square One.  That was over 20 years ago.

A long time ago, the massive condo development was nowhere to be seen in Mississauga. The streets were empty regularly, people still held doors for old ladies and women alike. It was a very different time.

Wally's has survived the test of time - but no doubt exchanging owners over the years. Their menu, while nothing spectacular is of a simple, greasy spoon diner that perhaps was once a trucker stop in days gone by. Afterall, the highway is less than 5 minutes north of the location.

Anyway, your typical diner fanfare are all here, burgers, steaks, souvlaki, chicken and ribs, and all day breakfast items like eggs benedict, steak and eggs, bacon, etc..

Portions are generous, food is underwhelming and under seasoned, but cooked with love just right in especially the steaks.  The burgers are huge patties of meat, with toppings that have obviously been sitting in the fridge all day.  Definitely try the 12-15oz New York cut with the right thickness and cooked juicy. It would satisfy any meat lover's cravings.

Wally's decor looks like it belongs in the early 80s and late 70s - as if it was stuck in time refusing to change along with its surroundings.  Hell, where else in Mississauga does a old rundown greasy diner exist next to a hyper modern condo?

It's a good place to eat late in the evening when all the trendy and high priced restaurants around Square One have closed, and if you're looking for a cheap drink, Wally's provides all the beer bottles you can knock back with your 12 oz New York steak.  

I would be very sad if Wallys ever caved into the condo revolution.  I have no doubt they probably have been approached by developers looking to run this property into the ground.  I'm glad they've stuck to their guns.

Wallys provides a very simple and basic dining experience, here it is truly all about the food, as bad as it is at times.  I can count more than a dozen times where I have found myself here after 1am for a yearning for a greasy steak and fries, with watered down salad dressing on the salad on the side.  Perhaps it's the taste of nostalgia with my father that keeps me coming back, perhaps it IS the taste of nostalgia that Mississauga's denizens has kept this place around for more than 20 years or longer.

Nevertheless, Wallys will always have a special place in my heart and I hope it stays around so that I could take my own kids here one day."}
{"text":"Old school burger joint in central sauga 
Decent burgers and fries .The gravy is a bit sad .
They have beer and milkshakes."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Everything was going pleasant until I found a BUG in my salad!! A live crawling bag!! It was traumatizing!! The two workers had to search my salad to find the bug only to offer me a replacement salad. I left with my company immediately, meals unfinished and praying we didn't catch anything. Horrendous. Definitely never going back there again. If there was a 0 star rating I would use it. This has never happened to me and it was traumatizing and chilling!"}
{"text":"Whatcha gonna say about Wally's? It's simple. The food is decent for what you're looking for. Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner whatever you fancy, whenever time of day you need it. Wally's is a diner and It's also open late to satisfy your late night appetites. It's a Mississauga diner that's been around for decades and despite the occasional nasty occurrence, most folks keep going back. . Y'all  may shun the place for a few years like 10 to 20 , but at some point we all say, \" I wonder what Wally's is sayin these days???.. lol. I recently went back after about 15 years and Byys lemme tell ya, I had the Wally's Special one Friday night at about 2 am and it was delicious. I walked in and it was totally nostalgic. Everything about the place, as not much has changed in a while.  I ordered the Homeburger Combo with Cheese and Bacon and it came with my Favorite soda, a Dr. Pepper. My fries were cooked to perfection, extra crispy and seasoned with salt, as soon as they came up from the fryer. The place smells like a diner. My burger was also grilled just how I like it, with the cheese melted on top. All of the usual suspects for condiments of course. Dropping in brought back a few laughs as well. Treat yourself to a delicious meal at Wally's. And a few memories as well."}
{"text":"Food is decent! And let's be honest here when there is no food places open in sauga, this place will serve you good food!"}
{"text":"So we went to Denny's and it was way too packed. Decided to check this place out. I understand it was 2 AM but this place was full of drunks. From old welfare drunks to young thugs. Hopefully regular hours, they dont cater to people like this. 

The food was meh. Something you could cook at home. Burger seemed like you buy from No Frills---the frozen ones. Everything was extra greasy. If you have a weak stomach you will get sick.

Got my friends order wrong but was kind enough to refund.

This place is only for drunks and late night party people coming home hungry and no where else to go eat."}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to knock this back a few stars.  YUCK - went there a couple of weeks ago and, let me tell you, it's gone way downhill.  My husband and I both ordered homeburgers with fries and gravy (coming off a hangover from a wedding the night before).  The homeburger seriously reminded me of SPAM.  It had that mushy, puree-type texture and it was obvious that the meat was low-grade.  It also had some odd spice mixed in - might have been nutmeg.  The fries were so greasy and had no salt but the gravy was alright.  Anyway, we had to throw all the food out - nasty."}
{"text":"It was late hours, past mid night when our friends were looking for something to eat, everything was closed but this restaurant was opened. We all went and ate. Chicken souvlaki  comes with rice, fries, 2 skewers and salad. Serving is big. They also had burgers,breakfast , steak and eggs. The serving is good but the place is shabby looking, the tables feel greasy , the bathroom is dirty, not maintained."}
{"text":"My medium steak was well-done, rubbery, and overall pretty flavorless. The eggs were okay, and the home-fries I didn't enjoy at all. The service was friendly though, and I wish I could have liked this place more...despite their very grungy interior."}
{"text":"For those who live, work or go to school nearby, this place is just as important to have around as a hospital.  A friend of mine just moved to Edmonton and had his farewell party here (no joke); he needed to have a taste of that homeburger one last time.  Wally's has a special charm to it that keeps us locals coming back.

The restaurant has a bit of an old-time diner's feel to it, with its booths and bright orange chairs.  Their homeburger is to die for; it's monstrous in size and absolutely delicious.  Everything that I've ever ordered there (ranging from the burgers to souvlaki to pancakes) tastes delcious and fresher than you could hope for at a chain restaurant.

Probably the best part about Wally's is the hours (open until 4am Fridays and Saturdays, and until 3am every other day!) - so yes, you DO have alternatives to McDonald's!!

If you can put aside the fact that it's not the most visually-appealing restaurant in town, you'll be glad that you did and leave with a very happy, very full stomach."}
{"text":"Meh! Not very good, it is what it is. Greasy spoon with convenient hours and mediocre food."}
{"text":"First time going to Wally's AND MY LAST. I wanted a steak so my bf suggested Wally's we paid $40 for both of ours and asked for medium rare.. We got really stiff hard as rock steaks... I work in the culinary proffesion so I know what a medium rare steak, and what they served wasn't it. I decided just to talk to one of the cashiers. The cook came up and yelled at me what the problem was..I just said my steak wasn't done the way I asked. She started yelling cursing and I got so upset I went back to my seat. She started saying medium is the same as medium rare. Cursing under her breath for the whole restaurant to hear. And literally shouting at me across the room! I'm not so upset about the steak. Or whether they could replace it or not.. I'm upset how the cook shouted at me across the room. I am not ever going to be eating there again. Ruined my day. I was humiliated.. Thanks for my first and last ever experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives in the building connected to this one, so we come here once in a while.  

Good, cheap prices for what you get.  Breakfast is cheaper that most others (Denny's, Coras, etct) and is really good.  They serve a wide variety of food here, more than you would expect for this type of place. 

No servers, you have to go up and order yourself, which is fine.

This place is open late, so come by here for late night snack if you're in the area!

{"text":"This place has been around forever - a staple in Cooksville.  A traditional \"greasy spoon\" spot with a diner menu - everything from burgers to beer to breakfast.  Food is decent & so are the prices.  Not the nicest looking place, but can't expect much more from a diner! Open late!"}
{"text":"Wally's is a greasy spoon diner.  We placed our breakfast orders at the cashier.  The cashier was nice enough to fill my coffee order into my own traveller mug that was much bigger than their coffee mug.  She only charged me the regular price.  The food was ready momentarily, and it tasted okay.  The steak was a bit tough, though.  The portion was okay.  As the diner is 100% self serve, there is no free coffee refills, which I find uncommon in a diner.  Secondly, the presentation of the food was not very good."}
{"text":"I loooove the milk shakes here *_* ahhh.
The place itself looks run down, but if you think about it, it's been around for over 20 years. I feel like it makes it feel more classic.
The service is hit and miss, some are kind of rude (when it's busy) but when it's not, they're usually pretty friendly.
greasy spoon places are highclass for broke, university students, okay? leave me alone!"}
{"text":"From first glance, Wally's may not seem much, with it's outdated decor and style rivaling that of an 80's diner. However, if you can look past it's rough exterior, you'll be amazed by the the wonderfully nostalgic food, the hardworking owners who are just so full of heart and overall a satisfying meal. 

I come here pretty often, every time I'm feeling in need of some comfort, the food here just hits the spot without breaking the bank. $5 breakfast combos before 11am on weekdays (3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, homefries and  toast + coffee) HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH THAT? Their homemade burger is really great as well, nice and juicy, and it's made fresh every single day. Love their chicken souvlaki dinners, huge portions to fill even the hungriest bellys! Beer battered fish burger?? Well, I'm getting over excited here, but you get the point.

The owners are so hardworking and friendly, it just makes you enjoy the food even more. Knowing that you're contributing to a real business, with real faces and passion.

I've moved away from Mississauga now, but every time I pass by, I'll make sure to stop at Wally's for a burger or a poutine. It's just a really charming place with cheap, good food, and lots of personality."}
