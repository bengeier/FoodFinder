{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!  They have great shredded beef tacos, beans and salsa and are reasonably priced. I have been going here for 20 years and would highly recommend. They have a large selection of flavored margaritas as well. Every thing I have tried on the menu has not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend. Food never disappoints! Special 4th of July menu 1/2 off most items. Seriously this place is is pretty bomb.. Ask for Martin, best server ever!"}
{"text":"I have found that the quality of the food at many of the Mexican restaurants tends to vary depending on who is cooking that day and on what time of the day you come in for your meal.  Some time the longer the sauce has simmered the better it is.

I have never been disappointed with the food at this Manuel's.  Salsa is always great and the meal is always tasty.  I also consider their prices to be reasonable.  I used to love Macayo's when I first got to the valley, but they have gone downhill.  They seem to be too cost conscious.  Someone also mentioned Top Shelf as being better.  I found that to be totally bland.  

I pretty much like all the Manuel's, with the exception of the one over around Bell and 12th Ave.  But, maybe I just had a few bad days there."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food hands down.  Can't beat the machaca plate, extra crispy."}
{"text":"Come here everyone and then, my bf  loves the enchiladas, they are good but not my favorite. The servers are always nice and the food is fast!"}
{"text":"Wow, just rolled in and was like heck ya I'm down for some imports.. Beans ,rice and everything nice hit that plate.  I was a macking and my little chubby waitress was a stacking, OH yeah she got it going on. Love too much on.these chicks.. Food was good for start to finish.  Hell Yeah . Chancie  says it's his hidden gem, I see why. Love ya Baby"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley.  Everything is good, the food, the service and the atmosphere.  The food is delivered quickly and I often leave there amazed at how little time I've actually spent there yet have never felt rushed by anyone.

Love, the salsa, some of my other favorites are  the pollo especial,  steak picado and the rolled quesadilla."}
{"text":"We always leave here satisfied. A very busy family place among the many Mexican restaurant choices in the Valley. Their house margaritas are pretty zippy and their wait staff is normally helpful if you're confused about the menu. The senior/lunch special is great for smaller appetites. I usually try to practice my Spanish here and the servers are always willing to humor me. Esta muy bien!"}
{"text":"What can I say.... This is hands down one of the best places to eat!  Visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter.  Service is great, food is excellent, prices are perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food done right for years. One of my favorite places. Green corn tamale, cheese enchilada, and chicken taco!"}
{"text":"The food was great. However the waiter was rude and very unhelpful. spent an extra 20 bucks because he didn't inform us of the specials even though its what we ordered. was charged full price. I brought it to his attention after over hearing from another waiter and he didn't even apologies or correct. place smelled like urine in seating area"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. Best chips and salsa! Fast place to eat lunch if you only have a short lunch break. Amazing desserts; flan, fried ice-cream, sopapillas and hot apple pie Ala mode. The hot apple pie Ala mode is probably the best dessert they serve; it comes with this sizzling sweet butter rum sauce and a huge scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Absolutely to die for!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best mexican food in the valley great for the family get togethers bdays the whole thing is a great expierence!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. Free chips and salsa too. Oh and they have delicious margaritas. Very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been using Manuel's for years for my parties and gatherings and decided to use them for my Christmas Eve party of 25 people. Their mini chimi platters are great and you have more choices of fillings than at other restaurants. The red chili chimi is my family's favorite.  Another party favorite was the chicken layered enchiladas.  Everyone loved the food and the prices are great.  I would definitely recommend anyone looking for party platters to use Manuel's. Thank you Manuel's for another successful party."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Mexican food.  We go about once a week and always have great service and great food.  Very family friendly and the chips and salsa are the best!"}
{"text":"I judge a Mexican food restaurant by their salsa, and Manuel's has one of the better tasting salsas in the state. I like to mix their medium with their hot because I like salsa with a little kick.

I usually get cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans, however, I have had their shredded beef tacos, and steak fajitas.

Everything is very good. This is my Go to Mexican food restaurant in the Valley."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch. Service is fast and efficient. We loved the hot salsa, so spicy. Would definitely bring a group here. Food was delicious. Dirty Martini made pretty good for being a Margarita type restaurant. 
The beans taste homemade and not from a can. Homemade tamales are delicious. Going to take a dozen home with me! Will be back."}
{"text":"Best Margaritas in town! Love the Mini Chimi Platter..I get half shredded beef and half chicken. Also, the Nachos are Very Yummy! Love the pick up window on the weekends even if its just to order the delicious fried ice cream! Great atmosphere and friendly staff..Always!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place around.  I would go there for the salsa alone, but everything is good.  On weekends you can get breakfast, and I highly recommend the spinach and bacon omelet!  During the week we like to go for the lunch special and everything is awesome.  I especially like the green corn tamale, and the pollo especial."}
{"text":"My husband and I were originally going to go out to breakfast on a Sunday afternoon but everywhere was too busy. So that's how we ended up here.

They greeted us quickly and we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The waiter was nice, however, he only refilled our drinks like once. Maybe he had too many tables? Because another table near us also had empty cups in front of them. Actually, most of the tables in the dining area we were in had empty glasses.

There is a guy that walks around and fills chips only. He's pretty efficient with that. But can't he refill drinks too? Or help get to go boxes? It seemed like the waiter could have used more help than just filling bowls of chips.

I ordered the chimichanga dinner with machaca beef. That's my favorite type of meat but this restaurant must not know how to make it. It was completely bland, boring and unappetizing. The beans and rice were pretty much the same! Yuck

I'm pretty sure I won't be returning because the food was terrible and then overpriced to boot! Boo"}
{"text":"What else can I say?? We LOVE this restaurant!!! The chips are great as well as the salsa. I can't get enough of the Seafood enchilada. I haven't had anything bad in the 10 years I have been going to this restaurant. The service is good and everyone is friendly. What more can I ask for???"}
{"text":"We are here all the time.  We sometimes blow in late and announce to our waiter that we are really pushed for time.  They just smile and accommodate us.  Our food comes out piping hot, perfect and within an amazingly short time.  Their cheese crisp is the best in town, as is their tortilla soup.  My husband's favorite is the \"E\" (he says, \"E for Excellence.\")  It's a chicken chimi, basically.  They also make a really nice chicken taquito, ... you get four presented in a mini flour taco shell on a bed of lettuce.  Yum!  The service is friendly and I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who loves good Mex Tex."}
{"text":"Great family owned business where food always tastes good and you are always greeted with a smile"}
{"text":"I was pleased with my first visit to Manuel's Mexican Restaurant!

The chips and salsa were addictive and the waiters did an excellent job of giving us more when we ran out.

The food came out really fast after we ordered it which surprised us. The cheese crisp was quite good! I liked our tacos and our chimichangas as well. The service was good for the most part.

The only criticism I have is that it does seem a bit more expensive than it should be, but they served a good meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"haven't been to manuals in a while the food was tasty I had the spinach enchiladas with white sauce it was a grate change of pace to beef with red sauce the guacamole was really good smooth could not stop eating it salsa was OK a best just something out of a can the server was bad refilled the water only once I think she got mad because we didn't get any alcohol just had a attitude the whole time other then that it was good"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Manuels. I had never been to this location until last night. 

It is clean, the food is delicious, the service is friendly. The prices are on par with other comparable mexican food places.

My GF smashed her food quickly and was thoroughly satisfied. She told me to give them 5 stars. I told her to get her own Yelp account LOL.

I give them 4 stars. They lost the fifth star because I felt like the menu was pretty limited. What they did have on the menu sounded really good, but I felt like I was lacking options.

I tried the chicken fajitas. They were indeed good, but I was expecting more trim to come with my sizzling skillet. The skillet itself was delicious; chicken, onions, bell peppers, half tomato, and cilantro (on the stems?)...But on the side, just two tortillas, green sauce, guac, and sour cream. I am used to other places also giving me some shredded cheese, lettuce, and maybe pico de gayo. It was good, and that is their design. I guess I just care for a more vibrant fajita. 

Oh yeah and this is the kind of place that gives you rice \"OR\" beans, but not both (most meals)...I think there's something screwed up with that. Anybody want a Jelly sandwich? Peanutbutter is available if you order it seperate.

None the less, I was full, and my lady was pleased. I will certainly go back anytime. 

Popos is still king."}
{"text":"I came here today, brought a few family members for lunch . we had a great server.( Heidi S ) she was very attentive and we never had to ask for drink refills ,or chips & salsa. Heidi was the best server we've ever had here. The downside of this visit was the food. it took 25 minutes to get our food, Heidi apologized a few times for it taking so long to get our food. then when we did get it,  it was cold. we ordered mini chimi , \" L\" and 2 \"K\" lunches neither was warm, meat in the taco was cold and the beans on the tostada were cold, and the shell was soggy ( taco bell tostada is better) I've been coming here for many years, the last few months quality of the food has gone downhill. (I've been here  4 times since Nov.) Jan. was the better. of the 4 times. Our server offered us new plates of food, much faster the second time and warm. If it wasn't for the server  I  wouldn't have waited for my food. and I would have left very unhappy and hungry . I will return to Manuel's but not this location. they are doing renovations on the outside , but maybe they should start in the kitchen.
thanks

{"text":"By far not my favorite place, but others seem to love it.  Stopped here for dinner last night.  Chips and salsa are average, prices are high.  Best thing to me on the menu is the carne asada, but it costs about $17 for the meal so I don't get it often.  Had the combo #2 and have to say I liked it.  The beef taco was good, and the ground beef enchilada wasn't too bad either.  Think the plate was about $10, and came with a side of rice, but no beans.   They have made some changes to the decor since I was last there, but still think that the food is average at best.  I will say that even as busy as they were, food came out pretty fast which is great when you have hungry kids.  FYI - parking sucks."}
{"text":"Great food!  Always fresh and tasty. Good sized portions and great value for the price."}
{"text":"So I accidentally broke my wine glass. I have been sitting here for over 30 minutes for staff to clean it up. Me and other customers told them of the situation. They have done nothing. I tried to clean up as much as I could."}
{"text":"Decently good Mexicanesque food. I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've gotten here, except for the fish tacos. Right now, the carne picado is my favorite dish -- full of jalapeños and juicy marinated meat. In addition, their salsa is tasty and the chips are nice and light.

It's near my house and always good. The dining room is cozy and well taken care of. When I'd rather just pick up dinner for the family, they have a handy pick up window out back. I really can't complain."}
{"text":"People beware! I found a piece of toothpick inside of one of the taquito's I ordered. Confronted the owner to bring it to everyones attention and said its pretty typical that would happen. My son was only two years old and he was eating. Owner of the restaurant is a heartless being and only cares about his money. Hope you get your bad karma hundred times fold."}
{"text":"I honestly have never had such a horrible experience in my life... I expect dinner time to be busy at any restaurant but this was complete neglect of service. The short 20 minuet waif wasn't bad but we were seated and our orders were taken with in a few minutes. I was with my friend and her three children, aged 7, 3 and 15 months which in itself can make dinner out stressful. We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer and told the waitress we'd like it out first. Again I understand a dinner rush but this was beyond that! 50 mins went by with out food or acknowledgement, finally we ask her about our food and she says she will go check on it and let us know. Another 15 mins go by without her ever coming back to us. By this time the kids are starving and done waiting... crying and interrupting the dinner of those around us. Coloring is no longer an option and they are over chips by now. We decide to just leave and tell the hostess to please let our serve know since she's no where to be found. The manager approaches us saying she will get our food right out but we politely decline. At this point our appetite is gone and the kids will no longer sit. She then tells us she will get us a gift certificate, walks away and doesn't come back... at this point we just left. I used to love this place and have been craving it but after the experience I had I don't think I'll be returning. I wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"I really wanted to go out for lunch somewhere with a patio today, itnwas such a beautiful day. I decided to give this place a try. First we walked in and asked to be seated on the patio and were told there were no servers out there and they'd have to find one who wants to serve out there. Umm ok....didn't come there to put anybody out, so I said I'd sit anywhere. Waitress was nice, food was good but not really worth the price for a chain Mexican restaurant. Nothing was spicy. Salsa tasted like straight tomato and the hot sauce wasn't hot either. It was just okay and we had to sit inside the cold AC on a nice day at 3:30 pm. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Good place for some decent Mexican food.  It may be better, but I Mexican food seems to have a glass ceiling on how good it can be.  I ordered the Taco Salad (aka: the not healthy salad), and it was very good.  I also tried the fried ice cream, it was good, but somewhat disappointing.  I will say the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Manuel's is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Valley. We found it when they started in their 32nd street location. They continue to grow and they are very consistent.  Not sure why some folks have a hard time giving this place a good review. I've been to multiple locations and they are all excellent.  The margaritas are great and all of the food is great.  The Pollo Especial is excellent, but my favorite is the Fiesta Platter. I always suggest this restaurant to folks going to Arizona."}
{"text":"Went there on a coupon from dealchicken.com and enjoyed it very much.  We were there at lunch and  were seated in the bar area quickly which was fine with us as it was a booth.  The waiter was attentive and competent.  I think some may not be too interested in being attentive since we were there on a coupon but that was not the case here.  I had the machaca beef which was well seasoned and a huge portion that I was not able to finish (and I really skimped on the beans and rice because I could see how much beef there was!!).  The salsa and chips were very good that was a chunky type which is my favorite but they also brought a hotter version which was a thinner concoction that we added to the large bowl of salsa.  My wife had a lunch special combination which she also liked.  The finale was when the waiter asked if we wanted anything else to finish off the $30 coupon and we were at $28 and I opted for the sopapilla;s which is a favorite and I expected 4 or 5 with some honey but it was a huge bowl with 20+ in it!!!  We took almost all of them home and ate them for the next couple of days.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was just that I like to see things like barbacoa, adobada, etc on the menu also."}
{"text":"So for the food I am giving them a 2 star but because of the waitress I am giving them 3 stars. The food is not bad it was just blah, the rice had no flavor and was mushy 
, the beans were over cooked the salsa was not that great either. I had the 3 amigos and the best one was the chicken enchilada. Out of all of them it had the best favor. My son had the carne Asada burrito he said it was ok but not something he would want to eat again. My boyfriend had the chimichanga burrito he said the meat tasted like a tamale but not a very good one. Over all this is not the best Mexican food but it has not been the worse. I will say that the services was the best experience and I only wish I could have gotten better tasting food."}
{"text":"Great food and service inside. Take out is a different story. 3 times in a row now they did not check my order and I've had to drive back to get a missing item. All you get is an oops sorry here's your cold food that we forgot to put in your bags.  No offer of compensation like here's  a cheese crisp on us or would you like your tip back.  From now no tips for take out help. Such an easy job to do but even easier to piss off a customer of 20+ years."}
{"text":"I visit this place every time I'm in town. The green corn tamales are delicious! One of my very favorite meals! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  We go to Popos on 59th Ave now.  We used to be a Manuel's loyal customer but the wait times and the screw ups on to-go orders have ended our loyalty."}
{"text":"My sister and I went in for lunch, and we have gone to this location for a long time and it has always been consistent . Today it was like there was a new cook, the cheese crisp had no cheese in the center. I had the lunch special red chili burrito, deep fried with beans, It didn't come that way and it was awful and I didn't eat it. The waitress came by and was concerned I didn't eat my food and said she would talk to someone. A guy came to our table and saw my sister's plate, but mine was gone so he decided only her food was the bad food and since my plate was gone decided to charge me for mine and comp hers.
He should have listened to the waitress and realized both of our lunches were not good along with the cheese crisp!

Very Very disappointed in how our lunch experience was handled!"}
{"text":"Skip this place overpriced American style Mexican food. Only reason I can see why it's rated a 4 is that people who have never eaten real Mexican food think that this it. Rice was old beans bland. No flavor in the meat. Avoid this place if you want decent food."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited around lunch time and while the parking lot seemed full, the dining area wasn't particularly busy. Our waitress definitely took her time before making it over to us and even stayed nearby, sitting in the booth behind us loudly chatting with a customer(?)
I got the chicken taco salad and my husband got the chicken tostada. The chicken wasn't BAD, but it wasn't good. No flavor and it doesn't seem that whatever liquid it was sitting it was strained well before it went into the taco shell. My husbands tostada was a MESS. Basically a chicken salad without the taco shell. The rice and beans I had added to my salad were just bland and I almost could've done without them. 
While waiting for her to take a breath in her conversation behind us to let her know she'd given us the wrong receipt, my husband and I had enough time to decide that there's much better food in the same area with better service that we'd like to spend our money on. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a meeting and had time for a quick lunch. Found it on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I was greeted and seated quickly. Chips and salsa were pretty good - had a chicken chimichanga, which was good. Prices were reasonable. The service was mediocre - the server was working really hard, but it seemed like he may have been responsible for a few too many tables. It took a bit of time to get refills and the check, but it wasn't a huge deal. I am from New Mexico, so Mexican food in Arizona is always a bit different, but this is definitely a solid choice for some decent food. I would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are great. The waiter was great, good customer service. Food was okay, had the chicken chimi. Fried Ice cream, was average. Overall a decent place."}
{"text":"We love this place! Our \"date night\" always consist of Margaritas & this is the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Very good place. Salsa best in town but not hot. Just fresh and good. Senior meal deals are a good deal. Food is very good but a bit bland. Ask for the hot salsa.
Julie likes the chimi which is baked but not fried. Tamales good but a bit bland.
Rice and beans good. 
Draft beer cold in a cool glass.
Try this place. It isnt Los Dos Molinos but you wont have to go to the ER after eating the wrong salsa either. 
Probably the best mex on the west side"}
{"text":"Staff friendly and attentive.
Ordered a mojito and the bartender made it with one little piece of mint (grown there so that was a plus) and a lime simple syrup. It tasted like medicine. :( He offered to make it again with fresh lime juice when I said it was too sweet. I appreciated his attempts to make it right I just didn't have time to have him remake it. :("}
{"text":"My trophy wife and I and a few of the offspring decided that we wanted to try out this Manuels. We picked Friday night at 6:30 and the place was packed with a 30 minute wait, but the staff moved the customers in and out very quickly and we were soon munching chips and salsa. The wife is very picky about salsa, not really liking any restaurant's offering that we have experienced in the last few years so imagine my surprise when I looked at the bowl of chips and there were only little pieces left. We had very prompt and attentive service, me and the wife splitting the order of pollo especial because one of my fellow yelpers recommended it and they were certainly correct. Everyone was delighted with their food,and we all scarfed the sopapillas afterwards.This is a great place to take your family to have someone else do the cooking  and enjoy some wonderful Az style mexican food."}
{"text":"This was my family's first time visiting and we had an amazing experience! We were warmly greeted and immediately seated by the hostess. Then our AMAZING server Mauricio came and took our order. He was very polite and knowledgeable; he's been working there for 17 years!!! Then Julie, our food expeditor, brought our food and was amazing with my 3-year old... Told him his food was made special for him. I loved the atmosphere and the food was beyond amazing; its very true to the culture and authentic. We have found our new home!¡"}
{"text":"If your looking for great chips and not spicy salsa this is a good place to go, other than that meh, have had better Mexican food elsewhere. We had a party of 10 and all ordered different selections. The Mexican pizza is 2 fried burro tortillas with space beans, ground taco meat and lots if cheese topped with a sprinkle of chopped tomatoes and green onions. You could probably make a healthier version at home by baking it.  As for entrees, the carnitas are a total miss. It was basically your DIY pork roast minus any seasoning from the crock pot but shredded, reheated and dry. The tampiquena was average. Small piece of carne asada, well flavored but I would suggest have it cooked med. rare. The cheese enchilada was decent, good mole sauce but doubtful homemade.  The carne picada was interesting. Think of fajitas diced up and plated with a side of rice and beans. The steak is pre-cut and tossed with diced green peppers, tomato and onion then sautéed. The seafood enchilada looked okay, but is chopped shrimp and imitation crab smoothered with a cream sauce and baked with a mound of cheese. The menu reads exactly what get.  

Most was flavorless and a disappointment.  Basically American version of Mexican substance."}
{"text":"Went here for the $5.99 torta lunch special.  Wow!  Food was fantastic and the torta was huge.  Add to that the free chips and salsa and this is one of the best lunch deals in town!  My server seemed new, didn't know the menu all that well, was unaware of the drink offerings, and seemed awkward.  Anyway, other than that, this was a great value and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Don't come here much. Food came out quick and pieces are great. 

If you want decent Mexican food and your in the area stop by."}
{"text":"Cold Blue Moon is the best after shopping under 106 outside! Manuel's has bug bar.... Not many Mexican restaurants have bars. Nice menu ..... I need cold drink ONLY!"}
{"text":"Good customer service could use more spice on the food. Food was hot and the chips and salsa was good and very fresh. Clean and well lite space."}
{"text":"Ah, Manuel's, what has happened to you?

What used to be a favorite place for dinner now is a disappointment and I'm not sure we'll be back. This review is written in hopes that the management will read this and take the steps to bring the restaurant back to what it used to be a couple of years ago.

Last night, we were taken to our table and when I pulled out my chair, rice was all over the seat. I pointed this out to the hostess, thinking we'd be taken to another table but she just brushed off the rice onto the floor which had pieces of napkin and crayons under the table. I had the steak fajitas but the top peppers and onions were warm but raw. The small bowl of refried beans were lukewarm--the cheese on top never melted. My water was never refilled, we-and other people at nearby tables-had to ask for more chips and salsa-the point being that we were never asked if we wanted more like they used to do. 

My dad is elderly and has a hard time moving around and that is why we stayed. The high point of the evening, however, was Ricardo, a busboy, who came over and thanked my dad for his service (dad was wearing his WWII hat). That gesture is what gave this review a second star, it was genuine and he didn't have to do it but he did and it made my dad's night. Thanks, Ricardo!

This is the second Manuel's that has disappointed me with the food and the service. I'm going to Garcia's..."}
{"text":"I have ordered catering platters from Manuel's many times and it is always a hit.  I am having the chilquilas which I love!  It's s must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for a few years and have never had anything bad to say until now. We usually always get a bean and cheese burrito and then a bean and cheese burrito with rice in it. This time was VERY different and disappointing. My bean burrito was so small. I immediately noticed the difference when I unwrapped the burrito. It was so much smaller than my husbands bean and rice burrito. There was hardly ANY beans in the burrito, mine was mostly tortilla! And the other burrito hardly had beans, a lot of rice though. Just thought it was odd to pay this price for a bean burrito I could have gotten at Taco Bell for way less money. It literally looked like a Taco Bell burrito. Unfortunately, we will just be going Carolinas. And it's a lot closer. Don't know if they changed cooks? They are doing construction to renovate the outdoor part of the restaurant so maybe they're cutting back on costs and portion sizes? But they're BEANS! Sad to post this review... but we come here all of the time and it's totally different and not worth the price."}
{"text":"I  have been eating here for years.  The food and service was excellent I think it is kinda pricy but the portions are good so I guess it's worth paying a little more.  I love there hot sauce and chips and think there cheese crisps are excellent."}
{"text":"This is chain restaurant quality. Not very good Mexican food at all. And is very expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite local Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa are to die for! And that's my number one criteria for a Mexican restaurant. They also have specials everyday of the week."}
{"text":"We scheduled a rehearsal dinner here by suggestion of bride and groom not knowing their was major construction going on. The staff was excellent at making suggestions for a buffet food table with service on their outside patio for 38 the original count. However, the count was reduced and communicated to a manager but somehow they missed it and still charged us 38. We had no way of knowing whether there were that many people. The food set up was in a strange spot, the service staff was confused and the buffet did not have a few of things were asked for way in advance. We ended up taking most of the food home which is a testament that the food was very mediocre. This choice was in a convenient location to the venue in Glendale. If I had known more about the location, I would have selected a different location for our dinner party. In my opinion, the amount of money spent did not come close to equally the food and service provided. At best, probably a good choice for a short family run lunch or dinner but with the abundance of choice in restaurants in Phoenix this will unfortunately be a pass for the second trip. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Average

I do not visit Manuels often however, a few friend of mine had a hankering for Mexican food and Manuels was the closest restaurant. When we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and  our server immediately brought us chips, salsa, and our beverages. 

The menu at Manuels Mexican Restaurant is comprehensive, and offers a varied selection of entrée's.  On this visit we shared  a chili relleno, chicken enchilada,  cheese enchilada, red beef burrito, chips/salsa,  and a crispy beef taco.

Even though our entrée's arrived, piping hot, we all agreed the entrée's were just okay. The food was hot and plentiful, but was just kind of average in my opinion, not bad but not in a rush to visit again. 

After lunxh we decided to end our meal woth something sweet. For dessert we  had the fried ice cream which  was delicious, the best part of the meal, as we're the chips and salsa.

The service at Manuels is ourstanding.  Our server made sure our chip bowl and glasses were always full before we even asked.  Great service, generous portions, and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"My family and I gave this place a try last month and loved it! We've returned twice since and also loved their breakfast menu! Our daughter loves their street tacos. Fast service and we love the endless chips and salsa.  We are from CA and so happy to have found this place for whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"I can't help but give this place 5 stars. The food is always great. I love their chips and salsa, some of the best I've ever had. I love their shredded beef tacos, their green chili con carne burrito, and their taco salads. It's affordable, casual mexican food. Very easy to make this place a regular restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot for Mexican food in Peoria. We mostly come here for breakfast because their chorizo con huevos is awesome! I've had the machaca too and it's equally delicious. Sat and Sun breakfast from 8a-2p. The chips are yummy and the salsa is tasty; not hot."}
{"text":"The two stars as defined by Yelp as \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is a great definer.  In fact, I would amend it to say \"I've experienced A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT better.\"

To establish my credibility, I must first say that I had been in the food service industry for almost 10 years (highschool and college) and so I've worked low end and high end and I think after experiencing different levels of the food industry, I know what I'm talking about.  Additionally, as a food service worker, I would have appreciated a guest like me letting the restaurant know if there was something amiss.  However, there was so much wrong with last nights dinner that I could have had an hour long talk with the manager about the millions of things that needed to be done to fix the quality of the restaurant and in particular, Manuel's service.

So, I'm sure you're wanting to hear about the restaurant.  I came in with a larger group around 8:15.  I called ahead to let them know we were coming.  We had a range of people that I thought were coming - between 10 and 13.  They were busy and part of their restaurant (the bar portion) was closed due to renovations, so this already busy restaurant had limited capacity.  No problem.  My group was relaxed and flexible.  We had nowhere to be and the bartender made us a couple of drinks while we waited.  (He was probably the best part of the night.)

As we waited in the front room, a hostess in a very rude voice asked if we had any idea of the real total of our party yet.  She claimed that it would change our waiting time (which was of little importance to us) and said, \"you only have 7 people here right now, how many more are going to show up?\"  I calmly told her at least 10 and we'll squeeze together if we need to add more, no problem.  I don't know if she was having a rough night, but it was just her attitude, tone, and the fact that she did not approach us to have the conversation but rather stood by and hung on the seating podium that really irritated me.

Once we were seated (around 8:45 or so), we grubbed on some chips and salsa.  I must give a kudos to Manuels for this, the chips and salsa are tasty.  Its a shame that the same quality did not extend to the rest of our meal.

Around 9:20 or so, we hear this terrible clanging of silverware behind us.  All of the servers had decided to roll their silver right behind us.  So, for a half an hour, we got to listen to people rustling, quite loudly, silverware as they did their side work.  Ugh, annoying.

When our food came out, our orders were wrong.  If it had been one or two, then we would have changed it .... but... if we had all complained, pretty much every dish would have been taken back to the kitchen. At least on my side of the table, my tacos came out on the wrong tortillas, they were greasy, and the quality of the beef is very very fatty, oily, and tough to chew through.  My friend also ordered two fish tacos, also presented on the wrong tortillas, and the fish were in large fillets that did not span the length of the tortilla, so you were eating at some portions just pico and tortilla... kinda weird.  The server also got my husbands order wrong (he ordered the chicken fajitas) and she brought out a second shrimp fajitas.  Trying to be accommodating, he took the shrimp instead of asking for his original order.  She knew that she had made a mistake in this but still charged him for the more expensive shrimp fajitas.   Additionally, the chefs do not know how to portion equally as my husband had 5 shrimp in his fajitas and my friend that had ordered them on the other side of the table had close to 10.  Thats a lot of extra shrimp.  And the server did not even check in to make sure everything was ok.

Finally, when were only half way through our meal, around 9:45, they started rolling down the metal window coverings.  If we were there after closing time, which is I believe 11, I could understand, but there was still an hour and 15 minutes still left to service.  We just felt so unwelcome and with every passing moment, we were becoming more and more irritated with the restaurant.

I'm a Tucson native where Mexican food is not only delicious but there are plentiful options.  I just moved to phoenix about 6 months ago and I have been not only disappointed with Manuel's but with every Mexican restaurant that I have found in Phoenix.  Is there not even one that has decent food?  

My take on Manuel's is that if you're wanting expensive prices (12.95 for two tacos and a side of beans with a sour cream, kind of what might be considered a guac, and a tomatillo sauce condiments) with mediocre quality of food and irritating service, then this is the place for you.  If  not, well... you get the picture.

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Had Alex as our waiter  was ok in begining  but   he doesnt listen to well     one order was wrong   asked for red chili burrito  got green    told him for seperate check  gave a a full bill  of 6 and 2  seperate bills had to tell him   food was ok  would not refer it to a friend   prefer  other places    red  burrito was really bad couldnt even  barley eat it after getting green chil as a mistake  .. wont come here again  like other places so so so much better"}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast!! There's never a wait compared to other places! While we love coming for dinner, breakfast is definitely our favorite. The steak picado is PHENOMENAL! I've never been one to ever eat steak for breakfast, but on a whim I decided to order it-- 2 eggs any style over top of the most tender & juiciest chunks of marinated steak with caramelized onions, bell pepper, tomatoes, and jalapeños. Served with a side of beans, but instead I switch the beans out for their breakfast potatoes and mix it all together! You can make breakfast tacos out of it or eat it straight. I literally come here almost every Saturday or Sunday morning because of how in love with this dish my boyfriend and I are! The servers are always nice too... and they also have delicious red chili and menudo!"}
{"text":"The best bar service in the area
 Jose. Rocky. Drew. You rock. Consistently great. Good management."}
{"text":"It was pretty decent. Our service was great.  The food was good.  No complaints, but I also wasn't blown away.  They did give me really fresh corn tortillas that were really good.  I'll probably try the tacos next time."}
{"text":"If you live on this side of town, you've probably been here, or at least thought about coming in as you've past by. 

We had a group if 10, and although there was a bit of a wait (as expected with a large group), the food was piping hot. 

Their menu has most things you could ask for in a Mexican restaurant. Maybe too many things, which is why I believe there is such diverse reviews for this place as far as taste goes.

I personally got the green chili chimichanga, which was very delicious. The rice and beans went from just ok, to pretty good if you mix some of the chimi toppings and salsa into it. 

Our server was polite enough, but we weren't offered more to drink until we asked. Not a huge deal though.

A stretch from 'Fine Dining', and nothing to write home about, but I would still come back for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"I eat here once a year or two. It is always good. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long because it is very popular. This is a great place for groups and because of this, it can be pretty noisy. Love their thin chips and good, spicy salsas. I ordered the street tacos and they were delicious. All of my dining partners were quite satisfied with their meals. Pretty decent prices, too."}
{"text":"I for one do not understand how this place has 4 stars. Very slow service bland tasteless food served cold and that was every dish we received. 
Street tacos with chicken let me tell you what you do to make these go to Costco buy the cold drilled chicken and a bag of tortillas cut them into 2 inch circles throw the cold chicken and some brown shredded lettuce at it and you hVe Manuela chicken street tacos don't hear them up that would be to easy,  now the soup, take all the leftovers of everyone's plates throw them in a bowl with meatballs and water but remember no heat.
Again no clue why the high ratings this is close to the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to skip it"}
{"text":"The salads with the steak was very cold. If it was hot would have been enjoyable otherwise I won't go back again. Joe"}
{"text":"I love coming here for the green chili chimi and I even order it for take out! The take out girls are always friendly and helpful especially Maddie! I will be back again again just for service alone and the food is just a bonus!"}
{"text":"Great salsa. Great food. Great service and great prices. I could mainline their salsa."}
{"text":"We moved from the Glendale area 11 years ago.  Whenever we come back into town, we try and make it here. 
We visited Sunday, August 30th around 3pm
We were seated promptly 
It took a bit to get someone to take our drink orders .  After that, the service was fine. 
If you go, get the Tortilla Soup. This is the best we have ever had and we have been to a LOT of places.
They no longer serve just a carne asada plate, but have a plate with Carne asada. So I had orders that, was disappointed it didn't include beans, but I'm sure it said that on the menu and I just didn't notice it.
Carne Asada was still good
Food was great.
Ambiance, not so much. It just seemed there were a lot of people running around for the 4 tables that were occupied. Dishes dropping, clattering"}
{"text":"We live in the area. What got us hooked was the quality of the food. Eventually over time, the quality of the service diminished and that caused us to seek elsewhere... especially when a waitress decided to tech us a lesson of what a white sauce was compared to another sauce, again, it was what how she said it - nevertheless, we haven't been back since then recently, the experience is superior to the food, as always - a great time is always a way back to the environment... Good Luck!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Machaca con huevos! It is the best in town. The chips and salsa is really good. The service is great. I always look forward to coming here on random Sundays."}
{"text":"The average for this place seems about four stars. I concur. The service is pretty good but not extraordinary. The food is satisfying but not great. The price is fair. My gripe is that the food seemed burnt all around. Overall worth going but don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Tried booking a graduation party for an estimated 40 people. The assistant manager was so concerned about the time and day (Friday evening) telling me and reminding me that's one of busiest nights. Great customer service. Seeing as how I eat there with my family regularly and other then the waiter who shoved my ticket in my face and rudely asked me to sign so he could go home. That's what he said. I'm only looking at celebrating a huge accomplishment for my husband. I was looking at spending a large amount of money, and knowing a handful of my guest would happily like to spend some time at the bar. The AM told me that I would be able to reserve a space. Then told me that I my guests would be placed in a room with other customers. He couldn't even tell me specials for reservation/parties. So when I went to hang up, he tried to get me to stay on the phone. He was confusing to talk to and has no idea of how to plan a party reservation. Most annoying thing ever. Guess I'm taking my business elsewhere. He did want me to call and talk to the manager about the party specials, I told him I would be calling her to suggest he goes through some more training."}
{"text":"The best salsa I've ever had - and the only one I can actually eat by the chipful. The chips are always fresh and never stale. Service has always been fast and friendly. Prices are cheap, especially for lunch. 

I usually get the enchilada (ordered with no onions, green sauce) with rice and beans, all around $7. 

I could eat here everyday and never want for anything else."}
{"text":"I've been here before and it was ok, so we thought we would try breakfast. Umm, yeah, if you do, avoid the server named Willy. He never took our drink order. Luckily, Juan was kind enough to step in. He put my breakfast in wrong. Granted, he did take ownership of how mistake.  My friend's breakfast was cold. I never did end up eating."}
{"text":"We came for dinner 01/31/15 around 5 pm. 
The restaurant was busy but we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival . I had the best bowl of tortilla soup EVER !! It had grilled chicken , shredded cheese, fresh avocado, tortilla strips and an amazing , thick chicken broth . I'm posting a pic of it , but I'm warning you it won't do it justice .. My children ordered off the kiddo menu which was cheap( $5.55 each ) and the plates were each amazing . My son had the 2 mini tacos with rice and beans and he loved it . If you are in the mood for the best bowl of tortilla soup in the whole world .. Then you need to stop by here"}
{"text":"Meh xican food. That's how I'd have to describe this.

We were promptly seated. We were quickly attended to. Drinks ordered and they brought out chips and salsa quickly. The mild salsa was sweet. Wah. The spicy was really spicy. Mixed them together and it ended up working out.

We ordered a cheese crisp. That came quick. It wasn't too substantial. 

The good deal was 3.75 margarita. I got a frozen one and id say it was worth it. 

For dinner, I got the pollo especial. This is their version of the chicken chimichanga with jalapeño cream cheese. You can get this, called various different names, at many different restaurants in the Phoenix metro area. There is a pretty good baseline to compare to. I don't remember the wait being anything annoying, so It must have come out in a reasonable amount of time.

The food was annoying. For me, Arizona is a beacon of Mexican food hope. You should be able to bring your friends and family from out of state and have them taste what Mexican food should taste like. Just like every dick from New York or Chicago tells you how great their shitty pizza is, so shall an Arizonan blabber about the Mexican food. This food was not bragable . If this meal was typical of Manuel's, it will let you down. This pollo especial was very bland. Nothing stood out. Not the chicken. Not the jalapeño cream cheese, the beans, the rice, nada. I'll bet you can get the same flavors in Idaho or Nebraska, and that is just sad.

So, to make a long story short, I'll be skipping Manuel's for the indefinite future. If you choose not to, I wish you good luck."}
{"text":"Oh, Manuel's.... It is with much regret that I didn't write this sooner. For many years your Glendale location has been our go to favorite for celebrations, family dinners, date nights, and just because.  Not sure why there has been such a downturn in your service and food in the last year. I keep returning with hope that these repeated disappointments were just a particular server or circumstances. Sadly I say, \"No more.\" We will be finding a new go to favorite."}
{"text":"This place is our go-to for Mexican food!  We eat here at least 2-3 times a month!  Everything we have ever ordered has been great!  The margaritas are great!!  My personal fave is the spinach enchiladas or the pollo especial!  Service is usually great and we can get in and out quickly!  When you are craving Mexican food, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant with outstanding service by friendly people. My beef taco was filled with flavorful, tender meat and no gristle or fat. Enchilada sauce is creamy and delicious. All the right proportions of meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Great Gringo salsa, great flavor and not spicy. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place seriously is the best Mexican food in Arizona (of all the places I have tried)  I have been hearing about this place from my Father in Law, ranting and raving about it.  He was not wrong.  Huge portions and amazing fresh flavor.  I could have drank the salsa it was so good.  It was such good salsa I had them box up the left over salsa so I could take home and finish!!  hahah

I can't wait to go back and try more.  I had the taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans.  AMAZING.  Seriously can't wait to go back and try more.  Also was glad to hear they have a place in Mesa too (that's just a wee bit closer)

Check out the picture of my plate.  If that doesn't make your mouth water - you need to get checked out!  Go try this place - even if its a little bit of a drive."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  But, when the receipt has tip suggestions \"for your convenience,\" please note that the tips are calculated based on the total bill after tax.  Tip has ALWAYS been based on the before-tax total.  The difference is small, but it's the principle of the matter.  Trying to squeeze out a few extra cents through deception is wrong!"}
{"text":"The waiter was incredibly rude and impatient. He walked away AS we were ordering. We complained to the manager who came out to watch/babysit the waiter. Got a new waitress who was soooooo sweet(left her a good tip). Food was disgusting.  Won't be back ever again."}
{"text":"I have always had good food and service here. I have been coming to this Manuel's for as long as I can remember. I love it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Mexican restaurant in Glendale this is definitely in the top three. My family and I have been coming here for years and never been disappointed. Food and service is always amazing. My favorite waiter Martin always makes my kids happy and is always nearby to top of drinks or anything else we might need. He is definitely one of the reasons we love it. Very decent prices and their Mexican Pizza appetizer with the chicken is to die for. Their combination plates will always fill you up. My favorite has to b the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Today I tried the street taco appetizer as a meal with a side of rice. The appetizer comes with four tacos with either, steak, chicken or pork however I was told you can't split up it can only be four of the same. Bummer. They tasted great, but the tortillas were not warm or cooked in anyway. Not a huge fan. If you're looking for great service and food this is a wonderful place for a family dinner....or a date. My husband and I had one of our first dates here 14 years ago so I'm kinda partial."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! we always eat at the bar! Jose always takes care of us he's a very attentive! Had the strawberry margarita tonight and it was perfect we ordered chicken tacos they were good"}
{"text":"Ok first previous negative post is a bunch of \"snowflakes\". The food was delicious! (spinach enchiladas w/ bacon).  Customer service was cool she didn't get my joke about a misprint on the drink menu..(Midori $175 not $1.75) but I could tell English wasn't her first language (ish was funny) but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"What has happen? I have to say my favorite Manuel's is the one on 28th street. Never bad always consistently good. When my family comes in from out of town that is there 1st stop from the airport. Well, they wanted Mexican on there last night. Our 1st choice is PoPo's but it was crowded. So I decided on Manuel's on 59th/Peoria. It's usually my second choice with all the Manuel restaurants. It was a Thursday evening its was crowded. Got chips and salsa and beverages right away and then other order of chips and salsa. Took forever to get our order. Finally, the food came. Starving by then. Something has change with your food. How could your restaurant on 28th street be so different. Your machaca meat was burnt with large chunks of bell pepper and onion. Yuk. The carnitas were sweet and blah. And then the other 2 orders were not correct, didn't say anything because it took forever for the food. So out 6 orders only 2 were ok. My family is from NY so they love the fried ice cream. We got 2 orders. How can you mess up fried ice cream. Yikes!  Been coming here since you open. I know me. I will not return and will tell my friends don't chance it. What happen!!! To be honest the one Manuel's on Dysart don't go there either. Will stick to the one on 28th street. Your mom would not be happy."}
{"text":"Fernando is my new favorite server. He was happy and friendly and considering how busy it was he was not lacking in service. I love how he sung a little while he was talking to us. My favorite margarita there is the Texas Margarita. 2 of them and I am a little tipsy. I usually hate tequila. Endless Chips & salsa that are good. We got the cheese crisp this time at his recommendation which was delicious and I got the shrimp picanto (?) that was good. I would have preferred to have the tails of the shrimp already off. And would ask for it to be spicier next time."}
{"text":"There was a time in my life when I was coming here every week with my mom.  I probably still would be if we lived here, but we moved from Peoria in 2005.  (Yeah, I've been going for years and it's always been consistently good.)

But even though it's been a several years since we were regulars, our server Andrew still remembers us and can bring us our drinks before we even order.

They've got the salsa down.  I could eat a bucket of the stuff.  I don't know what makes it so special, but it's my favorite salsa ever.  Perfectly thin, crispy chips that aren't greasy.  And they aren't stingy with refills.

My favorite item (my favorite food, PERIOD) is the Pollo Especial.  Shredded chicken and green chiles fried in a tortilla, then smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar.  Sounds simple, but anytime I've gotten a similar item elsewhere, it doesn't hit the mark.  If you get this at dinner it's a lot of food.  The lunch sized version suits me just fine.

Can't say how their dessert is.  I've always been too full to try."}
{"text":"No complaints"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here-- my first visit was a few years ago, the last time I was in the Phoenix metro area. There are so many good Mexican places here that knowing which one(s) to visit can be a bit overwhelming, so I rely on the locals to give me tips.

My sisters have lived in AZ since 1995 and this is one of their fave Mexican places in the West Valley. One thing I must comment on is their salsa. I LOVE THE SALSA AT MANUEL'S. I'm a fiend for good salsas and Manuel's has some of the best around, in my opinion. The food is fresh, decent Mexican, though pretty Americanized by my standards. It's served by friendly people. Gets busy here on weekend nights but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Patio seating is great. Waiters are awesome. Food is middle of the road. It's a good place to go with it being close to my family's home.  Fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share.  Specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren't picky.  It's the go-to place for sit down mexican when we are in town."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 15 years and am always excited when I walk through the doors. I know I'm going to have a great experience with even better food anytime I eat here. The margaritas are very tasty and the staff are always friendly and accomadating. It is great for families and friends for any event. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Manuel's!  Our favorites: best salsa around, mini chimi appetizer, pollo especial, three amigos platter, margaritas!  We have never had anything that was bad, and the service and ambiance are excellent."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and daughter for some dinner. My wife and i have been here before so we figured it would be decent.

The service was lackluster. The waiter took my wife's order and mine, but ignored the fact that I had my daughter with me. I had to chase him down to give him her order. Drinks ran low a few times and we had to ask for refills. Empty plates sat on the table until another waiter decided to clear them for us. 

The food was.... well, the chips and salsa were the stars of our meal. The chili relleno wrapped in an omelet was.... different. I can't recommend it though. My taco and tostada were overwhelmed by scallions. The sauce for my enchilada tasted exactly as if it had come from a Banquet microwave meal. My daughter barely ate any of her two mini tacos. My wife grabbed her leftovers since she wasn't interested in finishing her chili relleno and said \"no wonder she didn't eat her tacos! These are terrible!\" 

We were very disappointed with our meal. I could have gotten better food from a Rolando's at a better price."}
{"text":"Great homestyle Mexican food. Excellent salsa. My favorite is Tuesday $6.99 special. Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada and rice and beans. For an extra buck I get a chicken enchilada instead. Have been coming her for over 20 years and it's just as good!!!"}
{"text":"Seems like everyone else liked this place, but the service was terrible, the salsa was bland and watery, and the tamale was not that great. They got the refried beans and rice right, but how do you screw that up? Avoid this place for the weekend lunch - the service was literally nonexistent."}
{"text":"We love this restraunt. They always deliver the best food, best service and best ambiance.  A little crowded on Fridays and weekends,  but that's to be expected when you're that good. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place with my family and the service was GREAT! Sergio and J.P. were our servers and made sure that we had a good supply of drinks, chips and salsa.  When our food came is when it went all down hill... the food was TERRIBLE, my 3 year old wouldn't even eat it, he eats everything. I had soup and the meat was HARD.... and well the broth was greasy. My g/f had the fiesta plate (she was sharing with our son) and there wasn't anything special about it at all, some of it tasted like plastic!
The only reason I gave one star at all was the service, chips and salsa. We didn't end up  paying and went and ate somewhere else. Such a disappointment this place was, and over priced too."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.  Service is consistently good, food is consistently good.  I often order the 3 Amigos.  The carne asada is excellent.  Can't go wrong with this place.  Been here at least 30 times."}
{"text":"We ate at Manuel's once about 15 years ago and have been addicted ever since.  I was raised here in the Phx area and was used to 'real' mexican food and Manuel's is it!  Great Chips and Salsa and Dinners.  Service is great and friendly and have had no problems ever with the service or food."}
{"text":"Good food! Never had a bad dish! I change it up every time. This is the real deal!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is average.  The food, the service, the building, the prices, etc.  Not sure what I can really write about.  Nothing stands out.  Picture your average Mexican family style restaurant.  This is it."}
{"text":"i use to love this place. food wasn't great, but it was good. last 3 times, service has been horrible. last 2 times, i had to have the hostess hunt down our server. both times the server disappeared after taking the order and never saw him/her again. someone else brought out food. when done eating, we just waited and waited until i had to go up front to ask them to find the server.  they apologized, but didn't seem like the manager cared. AT ALL. what a shame. good chips and hot sauce. but, bad service makes that all not worth the trouble. service use to be good. don't know what happened but after 3 trips in a row, i can only assume that is how they operate now."}
{"text":"So this place is meh I mean food is ok nothing amazing,chips are good. While on my visit here the power went out and just sitting in the dark for a good 10 minutes so not very pleasant visit hope this power comes on"}
{"text":"Been going to Manuel's for YEARS. Great place. I give 4 stars because they don't have queso dip. Come on Manuel's hit me with some queso!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I have not reviewed Manuel's. We have been eating with them for the past  maybe10 or more years. We eat there at least once or twice a month. Why do we keep returning?
1. They are always very nice and make you feel they are glad you are there.
2. The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting.( We always take food home with us. 
3. The food is priced reasonably. 
4. They are a neighbor hood family owned business and I always try to support this type of business. 
5. There is something on the menu for all tastes. (Some people that go with us like hamburgers.)
When we go there is usually at least 6 people in our group. No one has ever complained about the quality of food. It has always been good. 
They have always treat us as a valued customer. I often recommend Manuel's to other people."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast a week or so ago. The staff was all polite and the place was clean and packed so we had high hopes. We had a cheese crisp, machacha and eggs and a chicken chimichanga with fundido sauce. All were ok but really greasy and bland for Mexican food. Next time we will go to one of the other local places, Valle Luna, Macayos, Top Shelf even Garcia's."}
{"text":"Far and away better than....Garcia's, Top Shelf, Valle Luna Etc... The salsa is a little sweet with just the right amount of spicy \"bite\" to it. The best part is the \"pollo especial\" a chicken chimi covered in a spicy cream cheese sauce! My only gripe is that there isnt a location closer to me in the far west valley!"}
