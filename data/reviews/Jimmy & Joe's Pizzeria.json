{"text":"Arrived here 5 mins before closing and was turned away by the teenage girl working, even though there was 5 other kids dining inside. All we wanted was two slices. Very disappointed by this, especially since we enjoy their pizza very much. Perhaps the owners should give this teen proper training in customer service. Maybe then, she wouldn't have all her teenage friends there hanging out after hours. Make sure to go here during lunch hours, when actual adults are working."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good.   The wings were decent.  The pricing wasn't too bad, $5 for a huge slice and a beverage.  The service was adequate, friendly and quick enough.  The inside section is tiny and can get cramped pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the BEST pizza! This place is the real deal. I often have to make catering orders and Amy & terry are a treat to work with."}
{"text":"I used to come to the old jimmy and joes location in chandler but nothing has been the same since they moved. The main problem is the female manager. My entire visit she has been yelling at employees to get stuff done while she is doing nothing. She also yelled at two men that came to fix their broken soda machine and claimed it wasn't broken (which it is) and told them to leave. Listening to her yell all day does not make me want to come back to jimmy and joes again and if I do I'll need a pair of earplugs. Look into some new management options for your businesses sake."}
{"text":"I like this joint a lot...HUGE slices of pizza & definitely recommend trying 'joe's sauce'  Perfect for a quick cheap lunch"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! The pizza has great flavor and the wings are one of my favorites. The staff is always friendly and although the pizza is kind of expensive you get large portions."}
{"text":"Remeber the movie Mystic Pizza with Julia Roberts? They has some secret ingredient in the pizza that made is so so so tasty. I swear there is something in this pizza that makes it so good. I love this place and dont think I will ever eat pizza anywhere else. The lunch special is insane. They give you a slice of pizza that is equal to about 4 slices anywhere else.  PS. It is really small but they have a few tables outside."}
{"text":"What a slice!  Huge. I ordered the vegetarian and added ham. Really good pizza. Fresh ingredients, great sauce, and really good dough.  Much better than I anticipated. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Obviously when you are getting a 12\" slice of pizza during lunch it's not going to be the greatest slice of pie ever, but for what you pay, the ridiculous size, and how good it is, the lunch special almost deserves five stars on its own.  Not to mention the Joe's sauce is amazing. The staff is always friendly and helpful to the neophytes, and they have a huge assortment of toppings. 
I do have to agree with some of the reviewers however, the pizza can be a little hit or miss.  When it's on the pie is fantastic, when it's off, it's just average.

If you are in Chandler, and haven't had the lunch special, you need to try it.  Otherwise, consider it a pizza place that's just better than your average takeout place."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy & Joe's & have for YEARS since they opened!! Great food, staff & a fun place to hang out & lay low. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped in late afternoon not busy at all so I was a little worried but the pizza was great! The service was awesome Sammy was very polite and could answer any question I asked about the place without skipping a beat! The slices are SERIOUSLY Big! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Maybe we visited a different place from the other reviewers.

Upon entering the establishment we were assaulted with the most horrible orange paint. It reminded us more of a preschool or a yogurt place. The ambiance was distant and uncomfortable because of a high ceiling and space. It lacked an inviting atmosphere.

I must say we were very disappointed in the food. We ordered 3 slices of chess pizza, a salad, 6 mild wings, 6 BBQ wings and 4 drinks. Starting with the pizza, it took 15 minutes to heat up a slice on a night that only had one other table. When it did come, it was as tough as shoe leather or cardboard, take your pick. Its as if it had been sitting all day, then thrown back in the oven. It was also tasteless. The salad seemed to have the same problem, like it sat in the fridge a few days until sold. Terrible taste. The wings were good, but not the best, its a good afterthought. The drinks were spot on. Maybe not ordering by the slice isn't such a great idea?

I was disappointed because we were looking for a new pizza place that we could get good food, but on our first impression, I doubt we will be ordering or visiting just another corporate cookie cutter restaurant that cares more about the buck than the patrons."}
{"text":"Not so freaky fast are we?  I waited for approximately 45 minutes for my sandwich!!  AND to top it all of I said no tomatoes and guess what? it came with tomatoes.  Never going back...EVER.

The hubs liked it fine though, he got the number 9 italain night club."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza and wings in the valley.  The serious slice with a half dozen wings is a lot of food for a great price.  Service is fast on weekday lunches plus you can call ahead.  The big Jimmy is great for parties...what can I say, it's the best!"}
{"text":"They screwed up our delivery and the only way to get the correct order was to come in to the store.  They said that new people messed up the order... Not a good excuse.  Pizza boxes saturated with grease...very gross.  Also delivered to us in the past, but most recent delivery said they won't anymore.  Pretty piss-poor service...look for other options."}

{"text":"Okay, if you can eat more than one of their big ol' slices, then I will crown you some sort of food-eating royalty. Holy mashoogah, Batman, those things are huge.

Quality-wise, the pizza is solid. Not great, not bad, but solid. The slices are thin, the sauce is good, the cheese is also quite good. Not a lot of toppings to each slice, but that's totally fine.

Why is that fine, you ask? Well, you, it's because you go to Jimmy and Joe's to drown your pizza in the extra hot sauce and house sauce, which renders just about every slice, no matter the type, into a puddle of unmitigated pleasure. An unrelenting assault on your tastebuds.

Really, this place is a gem that you wouldn't even know was there, except for the people sitting at the outside tables at all hours of the day. It's a local joint, and the food is good, and the service is great, and it's affordable for even the most thrifty of us."}
{"text":"This is NOT New York or New Jersey (or any state for that matter)style Pizza.
We ordered a pie with extra cheese and it came home to us overcooked.
The crust is way too bready and although we didn't think it was the greatest pie the first time we ordered one, it did not taste like the one we recently ordered.  They'll know exactly who we are on this review.  It tasted like the cook threw the hot sauce from the wings all over the pie.  Although we had also ordered a dozen hot wings, we had not tried them yet but when we did (after we called to report the problems), the pie was hotter/spicier than the wings.  The manager said well, our sauce does have some hot pepper in it (WTH), I ordered a cheese pizza.  They would only offer us another pie (no thanks, I'm not liking the one I have) or half of the money back and all kinds of hoops until finally he agreed ONLY if we brought back the pie to refund our payment which we promptly got back in the car and returned it.  The wings were average and the pie is NOT pizza like we know it from NY or  NJ where we were born and raised.  A cheese pizza does not burn your throat or tongue when you eat it because it has hot pepper sauce and it should not come to you with brown spots all over it from being over cooked or too close to the fire!  SORRY folks, this ain't it."}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD, DECLINING SERVICE. My family and I have been coming in since Jimmy and Joes opened. I've never had service issues until recently; which are beyond the standard/forgivable restaurant \"issues\" (wrong order, slow, etc.). When ordering I've felt like my business is not wanted, like I'm inconveniencing staff by being there. Management has to get rid of some of the newer staff because they are driving away loyal customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price!   And the staff is super friendly.  I can't even count how many times I've been here.  One of my favs!"}
{"text":"Tasted good but made sloppy. The toppings didn't get very well to the edge. It wasn't sliced deep enough and sliced off center. The ingredients tasted good and was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Place is awsome.  Been going there for a bout a year when I'm on that end of town and only been bummed out once.  The pizza is perfect 99% of the time and the workers are always cool.  If your looking for a huge slice fer lunch its a must."}
{"text":"This was the worst place I've ever visited for customer service. I asked the lady if I could get a salad with no cheese or meat and she stated \"we are a pizzeria, we can do no cheese but can't do no meat\". This salad wasn't for me, I wanted pizza and she kept repeating \"this is a pizzeria\". I understand you are a pizzeria but you also make and sell salads. I will never go to this place again just because of the customer service and will never recommend this to anyone. The sad thing is I believe the person taking my order was the owner."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. The slices are huge! Similar to NY style pizza. The toppings are great. Reasonable prices, friendly staff. I will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"I visited the new location today, it appeared to be disheveled which I would attribute to growing pains of moving into a new space, however I had an sense that the staff was sacrificing quality for quantity .  I've been a customer for at least 5 years and my experiences prior to today's visit have all been favorable.  Today was different, the staff appeared to be disinterested in their jobs and the pizza slices as huge as they come, are not cheap so I expect the best quality/product.  Mediocre service and cold food are a recipe for disaster and will likely keep me away for a while.  I hope the owners settle into their new location soon and return to their roots of providing excellent food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great sauce with a fair amount of fresh cheese.  Boneless wings were cooked perfect and the sauce was excellent (mild with hot on the side).  For about $25 fed a family of 4 with some leftovers.
Girl at the counter on the evening of July 31 was extremely helpful in recommending the special with cheese bread and bringing us everything we needed.  This place is in our small rotation of pizza places around the east valley."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Great tasting pizza and they don't skimp on the toppings. I prefer The Works pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick pizza. Double stamp on Thrusdays!"}
{"text":"As pizza by the slice goes, this one hit the medium to low category for me. Sure the slices are fecking huge, but for even cheaper I can get two regular sized slices plus a drink at Bonos just down the street. And the pizza is much better there too.

 My pizza had almost no sauce, and was real bland. Although the crust did have a decent chewy consistency. The service by the teenagers on staff was also pretty poor."}
{"text":"You really can't beat a place that gives you a personal pizza slicer with your single pizza slice. For 5 bucks at lunch, you get a refillable fountain drink and this huge slice. All the ingredients taste fresh and create a great slice. I've been here once and I will definitely go back!

I ordered the lunch special that comes with 6 wings. These wings were good, but after seeing how large the slice was, you have to be hungry to order them! I think I'll be alright just ordering the slice and drink for now on!"}
{"text":"OK....I'm originally from New Jersey. Growing up, my family used to get out take out pizza from a place where the owner (Nino) didn't speak any English....he was from Italy.  Nino tossed the pizza by hand (with no rubber gloves - GASP!) and used to hide his money in one of the pizza boxes rather than use the cash register. This was an era before Domino's, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. So this has become the yardstick by which all pizza is measured for me. 

I'm happy to say that Jimmy & Joe's passes the litmus test ol' man Nino established for me years ago....a nice, family owned place with good value and an excellent quality pizza. Sauce can make or break a pizza and J&J's does not disappoint; it's tangy and delicious and the pie (that's right...pie!) has just the right balance of cheese and sauce. While I can't comment on any of the specialty pizzas (hey I'm a purist...cheese or pepperoni for me!) I can say that the pepperoni is spicy and flavorful and has a unique taste that I haven't found anywhere else.  

Jimmy and Joe's is small...almost hidden away but it it well worth the hunt for this Chandler pizza gem. Not really good for large parties (unless you are taking out - of course) but great to duck in for a slice. They also have a drive in pick-up spot (complete with one of those pneumatic rubber hose bell ringers!) that I make regular use of. 

You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was flabbergasted to see that the New Times said that this place had the best slice of pizza in town.  Maybe the slices are somehow better than full pies, but I felt the pizza here was on par with Pizza Hut.  The crust had that oily heavy-on-the-garlic-powder characteristic that makes most chain pizza unpalatable.  Perhaps I should give it another shot, but I'm sensing some serious Emperor's New Clothes action going on with this joint."}
{"text":"Good pizza and now Eegees.  Didn't give 5 stars cause they aren't exactly the friendliest and customer service kinda lacks.  Just good food."}
{"text":"!!!Do no eat here!!! Management is AWFUL! 

If I could give this place negative stars I would. 

My brother recently just started working at this Jimmy & Joe's location and got food poising from the wings he ate FROM work. Amy the manager made my brother continue his shift while throwing up at work.
After he quit his job shortly after the food poising incident she harassed him over text messages. A 16 year old boy getting harrased by his now ex-manager over text. 

This manager is rude, immature, unprofessional and violates so many health codes. Amy is the owners daughter and should have no right to be managing people. 

Personally I don't support places like this who don't treat their employees right. I will never be returning or supporting this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Yuuuummmm!!!

I am soooooo glad I ran into this pizzeria on Yelp! I decided to check it out and am glad i did!!

Their pizza slices are HUGE and delicious. They have great lunch specials"}
{"text":"Get the serious slice! You won't regret it! I've been to many pizzerias and nothing comes close to this one. They have this delicious pizza sauce that you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing and great. The wings are just as awesome and delicious as the pizza. I love going here to get the pizza. I've told all my friends about this place. However, I told them about the terrible customer service. They don't seem as happy to work as they should be. Which is why I just call to pick up my pizza and leave. If you want to enjoy this place I suggest you do the same. Also, this past Friday I called to place my order and the girl seemed new or something. I asked for any specials and she told me there was one that included 16 wings. After I confirmed the order and was put on hold TWICE she said I was only getting 12. I wanted to give this place 3 stars but after that I could only manage to put 2. So, great pizza!, but get it to go. Thank you"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the service.  I have never had a bad slice at any of their locations.  On 4/11 my son and I went in at about 8:20 to grab him a serious slice.  It started off pretty normal, but then the waiting began.  5-8 minutes for a slice is not unreasonable, but 20-25 and no notification that it's coming or an \"I'm sorry for the wait\".  Ridiculous.  When I was finally told they were making another pie for slices, the girl walks out to a table with a slice and gives it to a table that came in 10 minutes after I had.  When I finally asked to cancel my order at 8:50, there was no apology or an attempt to make it right or try to salvage my experience.  I won't be back, not because of the food, but because my business is not wanted or valued."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved in the neighborhood and we were very excited to find a new pizza place. J&J is quick, a good value and you get very large slices! I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I just went to this new location ordered a slice of cheese pizza to go! The slice was burnt for 7.50$ I would expect more! So disappointed !!!! Won't go back again! I was fan before this experience !!!! Not worth the money!!!!"}
{"text":"It seems like the quality has diminished over time. They now serve only RC cola which screams CHEAP at least to me. I probably will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, friendly teenagers working their tails off because it is always busy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Pizza is okay. Prices are super high - I don't feel like their pizza is worth the price. I don't get what the hype is about this place? Customer service is okay, not the best."}
{"text":"If you're needing your pizza and wings fix, this place is a very quick way to satisfy the crave. The slices are HUGE, and the pizza is better than most. Grab one with  6 wings and a drink as one of their main combos."}
{"text":"WOW ... what a refreshing change ... great pizza!
Tons of places in the valley serve up pizza, Jimmy & Joe's serves up PIZZA. There is a reason they have been rated the No. 1 pizza joint.
Starts with the ingredients, sauce with a nice zest to it and absolutely delicious cheese. A simple menu too ... but main offering is pizza.
No pretense, no flair ... just awesome pizza. Want a real challenge?
Take on the 24\" Big Jimmy, you will need an extra table and more plates.
One key to their success and popularity is their neighborhood approach. Stop by and talk to the owner Terry - you will be well fed and leave with a new friend. Kudos."}
{"text":"Took my family here because I saw their A-frame advertising Eegee's. Oh man we love Eegee's! 

Anyway onto the food. I got a dozen wings with joe's sauce, the wife got a slice of fancy cheese pizza and the kid got a regular cheese slice. The slices are huge! The family said the pizza was good.  The wings we're great. The wife and I especially liked joe's sauce. We'll be going back not just for the Eegee's but for the food too."}
{"text":"We Called this location in chandler and was prepared to make a VERY large order for myself and my fellow employees. Yet when we called we were met with an atrocious attitude and disgusting domineer from a Jimmy & Joe's pizzeria named Sally. We asked for clarification on some deals and asked for the manager. She continuously interrupted us on the phone and declared she was the manager. I really hope the real manager Amy of Jimmy & Joe's can get ahold of this store employee who gives her self promotions while simultaneously demoting her own company she works for, she single handedly ruined a $300.00 minimum order just went next door to the always fresh and kind Barros. Thank you sally for making she not only my self but my entire company will never darken J&J's ever again."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for pizza and after much debate I chose Jimmy & Joes. The atomosphere is a nice place to relax, watch sports, and eat GREAT pizza. The slices were huge and feed me quite nicely, I was very satisfied. Met the owner (Terry Black) who was bery friendly. 

I definitely will be going back anytime I am in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this pizzeria.  The first time we ordered pizza from Jimmy & Joes, there was barely any pepperoni on it.  Hoping it was an oversight by a new Ahwatukee business, we ordered again and mentioned the lack of pepperoni on our first order.  They apologized and said they would pass the message along.  A lot of good that did - pretty sure we had even less pepperoni the second time.  There is absolutely nothing special about this pizza.  It's expensive (comparable to Spinatos or Oreganos), but the same quality as a fast-food pizza chain.  Save your money and order from Dominos or Papa Johns - they actually taste better.  Want good pizza?  Go to Spinatos or Oreganos."}
{"text":"I like their pizza hands down best local pizza shop, but they don't offer delivery anymore and they tend to forget things, I get the serious slice once in awhile and I've received my drink once out of all the times i get it, also they forgot my ranch last time which wasn't worth going back for, all in all good pizza but the price is not really worth it. BRING BACK DELIVERY and coke products wtf is with the RC, another time i went in the guy didnt great me and didnt even ask who i was picking up for.. serious he had the worst customer service and he appeared to be a manager."}
{"text":"Terrible dinner. Not the same since they moved!!  Last two orders were not correct. Repeated the order 3 times and it was still wrong. They screw up a $57 order and offer you a $5 credit. Jimmy Joes you can keep your $5. I won't be back."}

{"text":"First let me begin by saying that I realize the pizza is very subjective.  N.Y. has good and bad and Chicago has good and bad.  Jimmy and Joe's falls in the very average range.  Not bad, but  certainly not a destination place.  In other words I won't go out of my way to make a special trip to eat here.  I ordered a 16\" pepperoni pizza.  They were cheap with the pepperoni.  On average each slice had 1 and 1/2 to 2 pieces per slice.  The pictures that they have hanging in their place obviously were some stock photos that they put up because the pepperoni pizza in the picture had an adequate amount of pepperoni.  The taste of the pizza was average.  If you don't believe me, try it for yourself.  It was was very soggy and it was also pretty pricey.  Round 2.  We ordered a medium sausage to see if they would step up their game with this one.  It also turned out to be average.  I told the young man taking my order that I wanted extra sausage and then I asked how much extra it would be and he said 'no charge'.  Well I would have paid more if it meant I would have received a decent amount of extra sausage (which I did not).  Service: I ordered on Sun. March 20th around 1:30 pm.  The young man looked part islander, like he could be from Hawaii.  He didn't smile, he didn't greet and he seemed so disinterested in the place, definitely a paycheck worker, in it just for the check.  Next....."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this one. The food was fast and HUGE and delicious, the atmosphere was decent, the workers aren't too pleasant though. A time before I visited, my order was incorrect because they were too distracted. This time, a child of mine spilled their drink accidentally and was trying to clean it. Finally they came over to mop but after, she was completely cold when she passed out the food. The people at the counter need to get their attitudes together...the food alone won't get me to come back often."}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Phoenix. The serious slice is the best deal around and the pizza taste amazing. I have never tried Joe's sauce (forever whatever reason I don't know why), but I am told it only makes the pizza better. I have been going to Jimmy and Joe's for 6 years. Whenever I try a new pizza joint, I always compare it to Jimmy and Joe's and its never a competition. JJP always wins!"}
{"text":"The staff is here is always friendly and usually pretty fast (sometimes they have lines out the door so I cut 'em some slack). We eat there a LOT and the pizza and wings are consistently good and very reasonably priced for the specials. We always get the slice and wings special, which comes with a drink. If you get the VIP card, this special is available any time of the day. Yes, there are better pizzas out there, but my family and I still choose to eat here. It's close, it's friendly, it's affordable and it hits the spot."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place. Pizza is amazing, wings are great and their bacon ranch french fries are delicious! But lately I've noticed how terrible the customer service has gotten.. I think that all th employees should really work to be nicer"}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza! HUGE slices!! 
It's a no frills kind of place but great food and friendly people. My kids loved that he got his own pizza slicer too. Lol"}
{"text":"Serious slice of pizza.  It's HUGE!  Taste's great.  Try them, you'll love the pizza."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe a year went by before I found this place. Ginormous slices from full pies that they make exactly when they're needed. They don't have them chillin' in the front (or the back) like *some* other places. That means you might have to wait a little bit but you'll get a cheesy slice with any toppings you want that has a great flavor, crispy and soft crust exactly how I think of \"New York Style\" that you can fold and down with your favorite soda. They even give you a pizza slice to cut that massive slice down to size. $6 flat for a huge slice + drink. Slightly pricey but worth it in this case. Great place for a slice.

Avoid smaller pies - too doughy. Loses half a star for this. Also, extremely limited seating and service is lacking - high school / college students don't make the greatest hosts, but the food is good. That's what counts in my book.

Oh - Venezia's in Tempe has similar size slices for cheaper, but I get a stomach ache after eating there. So, J&Js wins even though it is pricier."}
{"text":"Awesome slice!  Crispy crust, big slices, (perfect to fold over NY style!).  Sauce is balanced and pleasant, I'd go back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.  Service is always fast and good.  Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.   The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.  :)

It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.  1 slice is more than enough, and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.  If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to be delivered yesterday they came pretty quickly on the person on the phone though didn't give me the total price they just showed up and course it was kind of pricey for the pizza it was OK but it wasn't great so I'm not gonna pay $20 for pizza that was kind of mediocre"}
{"text":"Love them! Pizza is delicious! Great local spot! Everyone should give them a try! Staff could be a little friendlier but the pizza makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The owner is rude and cynical. I was told pretty much straightforward that I was a liar... When only stating that I had ordered that way before the owner replied \"I am the owner and you cannot order it that way\"... When in fact it was the same person I had ordered from before! I still placed an order. I called back seconds later because I forgot to tell them which dipping sauce I wanted. Minutes later they call back to ask for a dollar for the sauce! They told me I could pay the dollar at the door, which I agreed to. Then they asked for my credit card number again. Well, apparently they voided my payment so paying their precious dollar at the door was never an option to begin with. I asked to speak with the owner whom I placed the order with and I was told she was busy and couldn't talk to me...then when asking to cancel my order the owner was on the phone in seconds, stating she was standing right next to the employee talking to me the whole time... it now appears to me that the owners are teaching their employees to lie so they don't have to talk to customers themselves. The owner then told me I shouldn't cancel my owner because \"I'll still be hungry\". Ridiculous!!! The owner of this restaurant chose to make a terrible decision in regards to their business transactions with a customer that has returned on several occasions. I am very disappointed. There will be no more orders from this customer. \"I'll stay hungry\" as what was told to me. I hope this review will help others when making that crucial decision between one pizza place or another."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! I'm a plain pizza eating kind of girl so pepperoni is as crazy as I get, theirs is delicious. I've turned Jimmy & Joe's into a weekly weekend ritual. In fact I think I'm going after I finish this review. 

It's a small informal spot. The staff is friendly. You get a giant slice of pizza two times the size of your head with a coke for under $6. Some seating inside, lots of seating outside. 

Yummaaaaaay!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in Chandler. New York style pizza that requires a fold while eating"}
{"text":"We went to the one in Mesa (Dobson/Baseline) after seeing it was rated as one of the east valley's best pizza places. No arguments there!!
Delicious! We had the white pizza, some garlic bread, a dozen wings (Joe's sauce), and drinks...for about $25. 
Plus, if you sign up for their VIP club, you get some awesome perks! Read: free pizza on your birthday and anniversary, as well as points for every dollar you spend!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my all time favorite pizza. I it is priced so well and you get a lot of it. The dough is cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too crunchy, just right. You get a huge \"serious slice\" and a drink for $5. The slice is huge and cooked to order. The staff is always super friendly. They are always doing fund raising for local schools. :)"}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill. Last order we received was wrong when I called to let them know the person on the phone was extremely rude. He asked what the big deal was as we still got the correct number of wings. He didn't care that the flavor was wrong. There's a big difference between mild and medium. I couldn't believe his response and said fine and just hung up on him. The prices are higher than other spots. I will not be ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"On 2-17-18 at 12:45pm I ordered pizzas in advance for a birthday party. Pizza was 30 mins late from time requested in advanced, which made the party activities rushed. Pizza was a sloppy mess and not cooked all the way through. I paid $45 for two large pizzas. What a waste of money for what I received! Seriously I should of went to Papa Johns and saved the hassle. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice...I thought I left that back in NY. I was very happy to find a place that does slices. Jimmy and Joe's just does not do slices they do SLICES.  However, do not get too excited this is not NY pizza. Very far from it. The crust is super doughy and the cheese and sauce are just OK. This slice would never make it back home. It would be sent to Pizza jail for perpetrating a REAL slice. Hey but what do I expect this is AZ. 

I have been here numerous times and we order regularly from them for delivery. It is kind of hit and miss with the slices when you go in. I am guessing because they are usually sitting there and you have to reheat them etc. When we order delivery the pies are great, hot, cheesy with fresh toppings. So I would say if you are in their range for delivery then by all means do so or pick up a pie. They can keep the slices. The salads are OK. I think they should invest in better dressing. They use the  cheap store brought stuff and you can definitely tell. J and J upgrade to better dressing. 

The place seems to be run my a bunch of teenagers. I never see anyone in there older than 22 or so. But I have to say they are always attentive, cheerful and get your food out to you ASAP. However, if you are staying in to eat be prepared for teenage chatter as the staffers have friends coming and going. Can get a bit annoying but that could just be me."}
{"text":"This pizza is hit or miss and at this location, its been mostly a miss.  I absolutely hate pizza that is spicy.  Why are they putting chile flakes on a slice of cheese pizza? Its not Mexican food.  If you want to put chile flakes on a pizza, they should have some chile flakes at the table.

This spot is so tiny that it really is not all that pleasant to eat inside.  The Jimmy and Joe's located on Dobson in Mesa is better."}
{"text":"SO SO SO SO YUMMY. 

It was 9:45 on a bright Saturday morning after ACS Making Strides walk around the Tempe Lake. I was famished! My buddy suggested this place and he was utterly confident that I won't be disappointed aaaand he was so right. We got there 15 minutes before opening and waited in their patio area. Both of us ordered the Serious Slice with just plain ol' cheese. Let me tell you, it was quite a serious slice alright. At 14\", they gave us pizza cutters to slice it as a plastic knife wouldn't do the job well. It was fresh and the cheese was perfect. The price of the slice and everything else on the menu includes a drink. I will definitely be back when I'm craving pizza again."}
{"text":"Plain and boring interior.  Pizza is poorly made. I ordered the 16\" vegetarian pizza. Whoever made it is doing it by rite and not taste. The red onions were WAY to hot and there were too many on the pizza. It ruined the pizza. If the person making it knew anything about food this would not happen. 

No need to go again. Salad is boring and basic. Wings are also out of balance as all you taste is heat

Clearly the food is made by formula not on how it tastes"}
{"text":"The slice of pizza is gigantic. Barely finished one slice and had a few pieces left over. My niece who is super picky about her food really liked her pizza. She also ordered a Pina colada eeges slushy. So so so good, the girl said it was a company out of Tucson which is awesome because I try to eat or buy at local owned and operated spots."}
{"text":"1st time going to this place and the pizza was pretty good. We went to the location in Awatukee. I was a bit surprised that it was not busier. Restaurant seemed clean and I had no interaction with the staff, so not sure how they are. I was with visiting family and they ordered before I got there. I would like to try this place again and give another review."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a large piece of great pizza.  It is great place to get filled with some great Italian- fast food Resturant."}
{"text":"We often come here because it's convenient and they have really good chicken wings. But that's about it. The pizza is simply flavorless and just plain gross. The toppings, no matter how many combos you try, they never make it taste any better. I've given them a chance too many times just because I wish they would have good pizza to go with my wings!
But I've given up on this place because the service is consistently rude for no reason at all. Forget it."}
{"text":"I only enjoy the finer pizza's in life and this place is amazing.  Its more of a grab a slice for lunch or order take out for the family place rather than a sit down dining experience.  The pizza is amazing, I am a vegetarian so I usually hit the regular cheese or the veggie pizza and they are both awesome.  Enjoy!  Go for the big Jimmy... I dare ya!"}
{"text":"Good pizza! Not as good as azp at all though. Idk what they changed but azp is just was better. Also love eegees so that's awesome. Also no azp ice. I wish it wasn't compared to so before I went because I was sad when it wasn't the same"}
{"text":"The pizza is just OK. Pretty crowded at lunch time and seating is a nightmare. Get the lunch special, you get a personal pizza slicer and a pan. Would get it to go if I didn't live in the west valley. Good idea to have a separate take out door but don't count on this place to be acceptable for those of us with disabilities to get around."}
{"text":"Impressed. Isaac at Jimmy & Joe's in Tukee gave a stellar performance in his handling of an issue I had the night before with a new member of the crew. Well Handled Sir. Thank you for dinner as well. We are loyal to J&J's. We look forward to our next meal. Amy thank you as well. Love your Pizza & Joe's Wings. See you soon. RF."}
{"text":"You want a slice bigger than your face?

If you answered \"Yes.\" then this is the place for you.

This is by my daughters' school, so sometimes we'll grab a bite there on our way home.  The slice is enough for them to split and share.

Save yourself some money and order the lunch special."}
{"text":"Pizza is ubiquitous in America. Strike up a conversation with any of your friends, and you will hear them rattle off names, which I can only guess has something to do with being in a capitalist society with brave entrepreneurs competing for a slice of that pizza demand curve amongst a glut of supply. Its not easy to decide when there are so many choices. 

However, thats why I'm here people. :) I'm going to point you at the lighthouse through all these storm clouds, and that place is in Ahwatukee, and it is called \"JIMMY & JOE'S PIZZERIA\". 

Allow me to explain. This place is different than the others. Its not just the fact that the decor and quality of design inside makes for a visually impressive and comfortable experience. Their menu is UNIQUE. Upon my first experience, I came under the pressure of some of my coworkers that dragged me along against my will. Reason being, I was trying to drop a few pounds, and I was averse to stuffing my face with the appetite kryptonite that pizza is to my Regularman. What I found, though, was that I could order a freshly made slice, instead of a personal size or some other portion destined to tempt me to overeat. Simple concept it would seem right? Well, maybe not, because their aren't many places where you can get a slice that is made at JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. There were also combo options, with the drink included, and ways to add a salad and select the toppings you want. Its kinda like Chipotle took off its clothes and became a pizza joint. A compliment I intentionally invoke because of their similarities; and these things are the cleanliness, quality, and ability to customize your order. Well done JIMMY. Well done.

I haven't had their delivery yet, but I do know that they do offer that. Since its my opinion I'm sharing, with the intent that it will persuade you also, I would recommend coming here to eat with friends. Its affordable, spacious, and you can even move the tables around if you have a big group with you. 

I will conclude with the BEST thing I like, next to their thin New York style slices, and it is this: 

REWARDS!

If you sign up for their loyalty program, you are rewarded with special offers via text, such as free slices and discounts, which I have thankfully benefited from when money has been scarce. More importantly though, you get the feeling that your business isn't being taken for granted. I like this particularly, and I will continue to rewind my visits, rather than fast forward. :)"}

{"text":"I've been taking my family to Jimmy and Joe's for over 5 years and despite the location, the pizza is always consistent and great. Unlike the previous review, I don't mind waiting a little bit longer for fresh pizza and salad. However, If you like cheap pizza places that offer some of the best slices in town, try it out.  If you want 5-star service and overpriced mediocre pizza, check out Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Jimmy and Joe's is my favorite slice joint for sure! Come hungry because the slice is served on a 12\" pizza tray. I love that they give you your own personal pizza cutter to slice and dice your huge pizza into bite size pieces. The sauce is made in house and has a little zing. The Joe's sauce wings are a must! Also, for the drink enthusiasts, they have the crazy coke machine that does over 100 flavors. Family owned, great service, great food."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot! The slices are huge, no you don't need two even if you're really hungry. The Joe's wings are delish. Every time I'm in Phoenix I make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"VALUE. That's what this place is about. Best pizza and wings I ever had? Probably not. No matter. I usually get their special - wings, pizza, and a drink. I can never finish that. Their \"serious slice\" is pretty damn serious. Giant slice off a giant pizza. That should be a meal in itself but I still get the wings anyway. I usually get that for lunch so it becomes lunch AND dinner basically. Can't beat that with a stick or a 2 by 4. That's all I ever had here. I'm not someone who eats lot's of pizza and often but it's good to have a place like this when you need a quick meal in a pinch. Service is usually decent. Lotsa parking since it's in a mall with Chase Bank, Autozone, CVS PHarmacy, and Zipp's."}
{"text":"Normally amazing pizza! BEWARE OF THEIR HAWAIIAN.
They put green pepper on it.

Get real. Or warn every person that orders this.
\"Oh, we are sorry our pepperoni comes with onion\".
Sounds ridiculous, right??????"}
{"text":"Huge slices, decent prices. Quality of pizza is very good. I'll be back. The Jimmy sauce for the wings was basically buffalo sauce, nothing out of the normal. But that pizza slice though... It's really like 2 costco slices put together but better quality."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday.  We had called our order in ahead 30 minutes so our pizza would be ready as we had only 20 minutes to eat.  Besides the pizza we had also ordered a salad.  The person who took our phone order said \"no problem\" when asked if our order would be ready on time.

Well, when we got there, the pizza was still in the oven and the salad wasn't ready either.  Not that the place was busy, there were only two other parties dining at the time.  

There was a high school kid working the front counter and after he took our money, he apologized for the delay and scurried to the kitchen to make our salad......we could see the entire kitchen from the front counter as there's a big opening in the wall.

While my buddy and I were standing at the front counter, we observed the kid pull some lettuce bins out of the cooler and place them on a table next to where he was going to prepare the salad.  

WITHOUT washing his hands OR putting rubber gloves on, he put his bare hands into the lettuce bin and grabbed a couple fistfulls of salad and tossed them into the plastic salad container.  My friend freaked out - she hollered back into the kitchen for the kid to stop immediately - she told the kid he had violated just about every health code there is.  

That was it for us....we had seen enough of this new place.  We asked for our money back and headed down the street to McDonald's.  No pizza for us yesterday!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Dobson location. This place has the stumbling block of being located in a desperately unfortunate plaza that has all but died and been forgotten about and is a real pain in the ass to get into. I am sure the place would be cleaning up if it had a better spot. That being said, the value for food volume is sure to have the rabid fandom of all of the Dobson high school male athletes.

Eating one of these serious slices is too much food for anyone not doing wind sprints on a daily basis. They are friendly and up front about their slice size giving a life sized outline of what you're getting on the ordering counter and the menu level...so you know what you are in for. Massive pizza consumption. 

Good pie, not the best, but definitely not the worst. Mostly I was pleased with the girls working in the shop, being friendly and engaging, explaining to everyone ordering how it worked and not seeming to get tired of it. 

I like that they offer wings regular or boneless, and the streamlined menu, curbside service and great staff will most likely put it on a regular rotation for me. Plus it serves as two meals (for me) which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Tasty and quick pizza spot. Very NY style pizza, thin and chewy and have large pieces basically two slices in one(I believe they call them a serious slice, ). The sauce on the pizza was great with a slight spicy kick. What I really liked was they had green Chile on toppings list (a staple in NM) so i got a Green Chile and cheese and it was yummy. Wings were nice size and crispy but sauce was just ok.

Lunch special was decent price, not cheap but no really expensive ~$10 for 6 wings, drink (had the crushed ice which is a big plus) and a slice. 

Very small place with a bit of outdoor seating, very simple inside. The staff was very friendly and made it a nice experience. Parking in that area is tight with Zipps and other shops next door but manageable."}
{"text":"This was the first time going to Jimmy and Joe's, but I am sure I will become a regular.  For me one of the most important parts of a pizza is the crust.  It has to just the right amount of crispness on the outside and chewiness on the inside.  The crust on my pizza today was delicious, and the toppings were excellent also."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and authentic. If you asked me to name a real pizza place that isn't a massive chain in the AHWATUKEE area, I would say Jimmy & Joe's! Not to mention that they've made a speciality pizza called \"Healthy Choice\" which is cheese less and full of amazing veggie toppings! Cherry on top? They were right on time. In fact, they beat their quoted time."}
{"text":"Guess what? They don't deliver until 5pm. After filtering our search for delivery, this is the third pizza place that yelp info has gotten wrong, we are now frustrated!  

Just wanted to order pizza for delivery by the pool at Legacy Resort and get pm with our day."}
{"text":"My wife and i were at Zipps watching a game and decided to have lunch at this little joint.  We were not expecting much because the place looked like a teeny bopper joint. There were high school kids all over the place with skate boards. The girl working the register was 16 and slow and didn't really know how to take an order. Even the kid making the pizzas behind the counter seemed like he was 17.  They were all wearing these black t-shirts with their logo on it as if it were a high school senior year shirt.. Yeah, the place looked like a Jamba Juice populated with kids  However, we were hungry and it was too late to ask for our money back now.  We also spent 10 bucks for two salads, two slices and two drinks.  That's obviously not expensive but it's not exactly a deal either. 

We were shocked. The pizza was a 5/5.  It was better than Rays. It was better than Gus. It was better Venezia.  The crust was crispy but not burnt. The sauce was tangy but not overpowering. The mozzarella tasted like real mozzarella in that it was slightly rubbery and had that great salt water aftertaste. In other words, it tasted like a genuine NY pie. I know the New Yorkers are not going to give it's full due out of pride but if you put this place in NY and removed the Jamba Juiece ambience, any New Yorker would be fooled. Anyway, that 1 slice was practically the size of an entire pizza.  The flavor was spot on.  We go to NYC a lot so we know what real \"pie\" tastes like and this place passed the litmus test. If you have read my other reviews, you know I'm rather picky in regards to critiquing places and this pizza passed my standards. It's also much better tasting than high profile places like Gus' pizza in Tempe. In fact, there is no comparison, this place is significantly better..

The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it's tiny and doesn't really have any place to eat. Rays and Gus' feel like a large 10,000 sq foot Chinese buffet by comparison.  Also, the teenager Jamba Juice atmosphere is a little annoying"}
{"text":"The pizza here is ok.

I seen signs of a new pizza place opening in Ahwatukee and couldn't wait to try it out.
 I've been disappointed in other pizza places that opened in the area, so I was skeptical.
Anyway I ordered an 18\" sausage pizza, waited for about 20 minutes and brought it home. The pie was a whopping 25 bucks + tax. 
The pizza review, the crust was hard and chewy, the sauce was put on sparingly and had a little kick to it, it had very little cheese and just a few sprinkles of sausage, Seriously it had about 7 pieces of sausage on the whole 18\" pie! I thought they actually made a mistake, and called to speak to a manager about it, the \"manager\" said that it was the proper amount of sausage as they weight the toppings/ product for every pizza. I thought that was bull, how can you sell a proper premium pizza then skimp on the toppings? 

The Verdict - Bad Jimmy & Joe!!
The prices at Jimmy & Joe's are too high for the poor quality and quantity of pizza you get... So Jimmy..& Joe.....You get Only 2 Stars ;(

The next time I pay for a 25 dollar pie, It will be at Spinato's Pizzeria, not jimmy n joe's, at least at Spinato's you get what you pay for, an abundance of toppings and the quality and taste matches that of a premium pizza."}
{"text":"The closest I've found to the pizza from Blasdell Pizza and Wings in New York. We love their pizza!"}
{"text":"This place blew me away! I was shocked at the taste, really good pizza! Good flavor too, I just got a serious slice with pepperoni. The Joes sauce was good on the wings too, I recommend it! A good lunch spot: quick service, cheap, and good!"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza at best.Bland sauce and crust.When I ordered mushrooms on a \"Serious Slice\" they were so bitter I had to remove them.The size of the slices don't compensate for the lack of flavor at this \"pizzeria\". Much like the mushrooms the owner is quite bitter,I can't support a place where \"Joe\" or Terry rather,belittles his employees in front of patrons. Theres a wide selection of quality pizzerias to choose from, avoid this one if your expecting taste."}
{"text":"Just OK. I think the pizza is fair but the lack of space inside and the customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"You are seeing a continuing trend here. When it first opened it was a 5 star place but since then the pizza has been inconsistent and going down hill. The last pizza I ordered, the crust was soggy and it had too much yeast. The cheese was also too rubbery and tasteless.

I grew up watching 90210 like many of us \"old folks.\" They had the Peach Pit. Do you remember that place. Well Jimmy and Joes is the pizza version of the Peach Pit. Yes, me and my 30's felt age inappropriate when I arrived. And I immediately felt like I was in high school again when I went to grab a tiny ketchup cup to grab some wing sauce and they said it was 60 cents. Another person walked in and they gave him a hard time because he didn't have his coupon on him even though he read the coupon code over the phone. It had that high school vibe..you know the one I'm talking about the...\"I owe you 3 dollars and I'll pay you back tomorrow.\" vibe.  That vibe is felt when you park there. There is limited parking as it is and whatever parking they have, there are signs that limit you to 20 minutes parking almost implying they don't want you to eat there. I was too afraid to take napkins because I'm sure it had some price or limitation attached just like everything else there.

I've eaten here several times and I've reached this conclusion: eat at the place but don't pick up pizza here. JJ specializes in the one slice and drink. Their short slices are done well and if you don't eat it hot when it comes right out of the oven, it loses it's flavor fast. I've picked up pizza and it's almost like two different pizzas. When I picked it up, the cheese was exrtremely rubbery and the crust was so chewy like steak. This is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but I wouldn't order several pies if I was hosting a Superbowl party or had people over."}
{"text":"I know my pizza and this is by far the best pizza in the state of Arizona. HUGE slices. Great location, staff and most importantly food. Serves eegees as well. Always a place I bring friends who enjoy pizza. We keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"The first time we tasted Jimmy & Joe's pizza, we thought we'd finally found great pizza.  Tonight, we ordered our second order and are so upset:  the toppings cover only half of the slices, the pizza is soggy and under baked, and the garlic bread has no garlic on it.  Terribly expensive and a bad mistake.  We had such high hopes   If you go to their FB page, my wife posted some pictures of the mess described above."}
{"text":"Unbelievable pizza and portions! Nothing gets better than the boneless wings with Joe's sauce. Highly recommend any one of their locations. Can't get better for price, quality and service."}
{"text":"meh. looked up pizza by the slice on Yelp. this place came up. it's not really pizza by the slice. you have to buy a $6 slice/drink combo. staff's attitude is indifferent at best. slice came with a fortune cookie which is weird."}
{"text":"This place is great for a large (huge) slice of pizza! and it is fast! I like to grab a slice and return to work. If i stay I enjoy that they serve each piece of pizza with a pizza slicer and a fortune cookie (not sure why but I like them)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 10 years and while I understand price increases, at these prices at least serve Pepsi or Coke products, and not under the guise of a \"free drink\". It's normal for a drink to be included in a combo. The food is still good, Joe's sauce is still great. Just seems to be missing the pizzazz of the good ole days of like 2008-2009 with what feels like penny pinching.

Service is another story, basically non existent and they should review their hiring practices."}
{"text":"This place makes the beginning of the week a lot more bearable with their 24 wings for 12 bucks!  I always get mine extra crispy and covered in hot sauce!  Their slices are HUGE but so delicious that I happen to always finish it lol.  Ask for extra pizza sauce on top of your slice- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good, solid slice pizza but a bit pricey. This is my second time eating here, both times were good. Crust is very good, however the sauce was a bit bland this time. One other thing, I asked for tomatoes and they put raw, diced tomatoes on top (the kind you would expect on a taco) rolling off the edge of the pizza - bad idea. Still, this is a step up from Ray's or Barro's if you're in the mood for a slice. But I still think the best sliced pizza in the area is AJ's."}
{"text":"Gross meatball sub and inconsistent food. Their meatball sub is a sliced up meat product that is subpar. And a meager portion to add insult. Had a calzone a few weeks ago and it was good, tried the other day and it was a different story. Taste was ok but it didn't have that wonderful golden crisp top, literally looked like a bad pizza folded. Look at my picture then the one on their website, that is not what I received. Wings were moderate. The only redeeming thing for me is they offer Eegee's ice drinks."}
{"text":"Superb pizza!!!!! I always have a hard time finding good tasting gluten free pizza. This one is delish. Great customer service, clean, friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I like this a lot better than any of the other take out pizza in the area. This is a quick and tasty Sunday night dinner."}
{"text":"This pizza is literally some of the best pizza i have ever had! We live in east Mesa and drive to Tempe just for it! So yum! The Joe's sauce is EVERYTHING!! So good on the wings & i love dipping my pizza crust in it!! They're always busy which is a good sign to me... The only thing i can recommend is to get cilantro as one of your pizza toppings!!! Definitely come try this place out! Oh and also! They give you a fortune cookie with your pizza! Its like getting FREE dessert! :)"}
{"text":"We moved to some apartments nearby and found this gem. We truly love this pizza, the cheese tastes very fresh, the dough is thin but still fluffy, the toppings are truly delicious. We love their italian sausage!

Also their wings are delicious! We normally get their hot Bone-in wings (I never get boneless). Those wings are meaty, big, amd the sauce is on point. Also their garlic or cheesy bread is soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside...Man my mouth is wathering."}
{"text":"I can not understand how this Pizzeria got 4 stars! Maybe something changed shortly before my patronage? From what I understand though, This shop had only been in business about 4 months before I gave them a try about a month ago. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a combo of some kind, I don't recall what it was, but they were very bland, almost flavorless, and the crust was very mediocre!! I can truthfully say this was some of the worst pizza I have ever had!! I have had better frozen boxed pizza from the supermarket!"}
{"text":"I was quoted 45 minutes to an hour, when I ordered delivery. After an hour and a half I called to make sure my order was coming. The lady that answered the phone said my order was already out for delivery, without asking my name. So I must be the only delivery order if she didn't need my name right? I live 1 mile from the store...and still waiting. I ordered from here bc I've seen one of their pick up trucks leaving the neighborhood super early in the morning, and thought \"yeah let's go local this time, they deserve it.\". Well I also actually want my food. Can't even rate the food. It may never get here.

Waited over 30 minutes to call since last call, so waiting 2 hours for delivery, this time phone hostess asks name and say they'll send it out when driver returns. The driver that was already delivering our pizzas since last call? Even asked, please be honest this time I have a child to feed. So sorry son, dinner will be ready JUUUUST after bedtime. Current delivery time, with no food actually delivered, 2 hours and 10 minutes. Actual distance for delivery, still 1 mile.

Food finally delivered! 2 1/2 hours later. And I feel so bad for the driver. He was so nice, but they never asked payment method, it was debit, so he expected cash. I had none on me. They had it marked as pick up, even when it was on its way. Hmmm why would I give my address, including cross streets, if it was pick up. 

Moral of this story...skip delivery, they're expecting you anyways. Great way to get your kids to eat dinner, starve them with Jimmy & Joe's delivery."}
{"text":"I don't care what they put on it, the crust is SO GOOD!!!  I love a good crust, but it is so hard to find.  This place has it, I ate my crust and my kids crusts!

Thin crust pizza with a variety of toppings.  I had the White Pizza (mozzarella, garlic, tomato and basil) while my kids split a cheese slice.  Nary any grease on my pizza and all ingredients tasted fresh.  Good sauce, with flavor- but not overpowering.

As mentioned, I brought my kids with me and felt comfortable with them there.  The service was prompt and very friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the menu selection was pretty good!  $4.50 for a huge slice and a regular drink...seemed like a pretty good deal to me.  Already looking for an excuse to go back!  Also love the idea of supporting a local independent business!

After reading previous reviews about heavy lunch traffic I went a little after 1pm, and still snagged the last indoor table.  Next time around I think I'll do their curbside pick up and bring it home.  Too bad they can't expand their dining room."}
{"text":"Called at 8:17pm put me on hold for 4 minutes and then came back and said I couldn't order for delivery. I would've appreciated to know that before getting placed on hold. They didn't seem to want my business so I won't give it to them."}
{"text":"When they say serious slice, they are serious. You order one of the slices and you will be full for hours. Complimented by their very own Jimmy and Joes sauce which is tangy with a little heat, you will be left satisfied. It is a great place to grab a quick bite, hang out, and just enjoy pizza."}
{"text":"A Friday night routine' it's not NYC but it's good."}
{"text":"I love the wings here!  Joe's sauce is seriously the best thing ever!  I have taken a lot of people here and they have all enjoyed it as well.  The pizza is pretty great as well, and the single slices are huge.  A slice and salad or wings is plenty for a meal.  And the best part it, they have that available for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Gave it three star mainly because there was a lot of hype given to me for this place, and it was simply OK. I did like the food, and I love that they like Eegee's. But I've had some bad specialty slices there and for the most part I don't think the employees want to be there at all."}
{"text":"There must be new management. It used to be the best but it's now not even a consideration. The last pizza was so so. Tonight my wife wanted to try again so we did it. After 1 hour and no delivery we called back   The girl I talked to put me on hold forever. I called back talked to a guy and wanted to compensate with a free deliver and free pizzas. Sorry I don't want to wait another hour. Nobody called us and yes, they had our number. 
Sorry, if they're only working for tattoo money and don't give a damn about customer service,I'll pass. 


Not worth the time. Too many choices.

I received a very nice letter explaining that they were very busy making pizzas for the teachers yesterday evening. I certainly support the teachers efforts as well as the company's that support this cause. 
For years this had been our favorite pizza place and based upon the message I received, we will try again and hopefully things will be on track. We do our best to support local businesses."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but no more. I was just treated like absolute crap by the employees and will never go back. The pizza is good, but there are plenty of other places that make good pizza and don't treat the customers like they are disposable."}
{"text":"I have eaten the wings here a few times, and they are big and meaty. I have to take them home and add some extra heat for my taste. This week I decided to try the Pizza. It tasted good down, but about 2 hours after eating 2 slices of the carnivore pizza I got the chills, and body aches. I didn't associate it with the pizza, until the 2nd day when I had 2 more pieces, and again 2 hours later I was sick. My wife had the popeye and said she never wants it again after the first night due to the horrible gas she got from it. The rest went to the trash."}
{"text":"I go here once or twice a week. It's quick for lunch and a great value. The staff is always super nice. The slices show up quick and for the price it can't really be beat. Is it the absolute best pizza I have had five stars on taste alone? No, but it's still very good and when you combine the price, the staff, and the speed this becomes a go to lunch spot. I can't speak to the menu beyond the pizza but my coworker I bring in really like the wings. They have salads but alas I am not a rabbit so I have never partaken."}
{"text":"The first time I had one of thier gigantic pizza's I was in heaven.  It was so so so good.  Since then I have ordered pizza from them twice and it just hasn't been that good.  The last time the sauce on the cheese pizza was spicy and my kids wouldn't eat it.  I will not order from them again."}
{"text":"Eegees and Pizza! 

The pizza was good, the customer service was good, and the eegee was... you guessed it.. good. 

I like the pizza cutter they give you with your slice of pizza. This place is worth a stop at lunch just to check it out once. Don't forget your eegees."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because the pizza is good and it's really cheap, it's really that simple...

Some of the best pizza in AZ, the slices are huge. I've been here for lunch a few times and I've never been disappointed. The wings are pretty good too. It's cheap ($5 for a huge slice and a drink @ lunch) so it's definitely worth checking it out.

There isn't a lot of seating so I wouldn't go with more than 4 people.
They have Pepsi products which I hate so I get Ice Tea."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a group of co-workers and was very appalled by the managers' unwillingness to modify a simple salad to meet my diet needs.  I was really at a loss at how dismissive the manager was and did not care one bit about a paying customer.  I can tell you for sure that I will not be coming back here.  That is really a shame as I prefer to support local businesses."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty damn good. I am a New Yorker and have very high standards. This place passes the \" ok for AZ\" taste test. I do have 2 major issues. They are way too pricey and they do not deliver until after 3 on Sundays. You guys ever here of football? I actually had a pie from here tonight and was a bit upset that it was soggy. Keep that crust crispy."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their chicken pesto pizza slices. And their slices are truly big and filling, so before you think it's not enough for your hungry tummy, just wait till you're done with the first (and possibly the only) slice you'll have. They have a nice patio area too, and their deals are good too if you can grab them in time."}
{"text":"I'm going to try out writing this review with bullet points... Just so that you all get the just of it!

1.)  Fantastic Pizza.  Great Portions.  Tasty Toppings.
2.) Great for Lunch, as they have tons of specials.
3.) Easily accessable, located right next to the Chase Bank.

The negative?

4.) They have almost no room to eat in the store.  The chairs are tiny and uncomfortable.  It's dark and extremely close-knit.  Not a great eat-in experience.

My recommendation?

5.) Order ahead of time, take the food home, and enjoy yourself.  It's a fantastic slice of pizza, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service.  The girl up front tells me she's waiting for my wings after waiting 25 minutes, I went to check with her and she finally goes back to check and they never put the order in.  You would think she would have checked when I first asked, but she was too lazy to do anything.  My wife told me don't go there because they have such horrible service and she quit going this May.  I didn't listen to her and I should have.  This place is going to go down. There are better options in Ahwatukee:  Nellos, Florencios, Zzeeks, to name a few.  They care about their customer.  I will never go back and I will never recommend anyone to go here."}
{"text":"This is another one of my favorite lunch spots in Chandler. If I feel like pizza for lunch when I am working in our Chandler day spa, I always visit Jimmy and Joe's. The slices are giant and come with an individual pizza cutter. There is outside and inside seating and the staff has always been friendly.

Definitely worth a stop if you want a slice of pizza in Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! Wings are super tasty! And customer service is spot on! Every time I come here I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great pizza and huge slices. Every time I go I get the lunch special with wings. Try their special wing sauce, it's tasty. Service is good and fast and always friendly. Once when our group was leaving and they had an extra pizza and sent it with us, no charge. We will be coming back time and again."}
{"text":"Pretty legit and reasonably priced pizza. Serious slice (1 gigantic slice + 2 toppings) comes with a drink (unlimited refills) goes for about 6 bucks. Make sure you use their Joe Sauce, it is amazing! Probably the best pizza I have had in AZ but then again I haven't had all that much."}
{"text":"Horrible customer experience.

Situation: I'm calling during a lunch rush (which I understand it is a busy time). I'm placing a big order for a party my family is hosting.  The lady on the phone was not polite at all.  At first, she kept asking my name, when I'm trying to ask a question.  At one point she was being super aggressive in asking my name, when I simply wanted to let her know I wasn't picking it up until 330PM.  I called her out that she was being impolite, and she rudely told me that she has a \"line out of the door and I'm asking a million questions\".  I asked one: can I have this ready for later pickup?  Of course she didn't hear that bc she wanted to be a robot and just get my name first.  

Point is: 1.) You can't treat customers - on phone or onsite (yes I've ordered a lot from you guys over the past few years) like that, EVER.
2.) I understand I was calling during busy hours, but it makes no difference.  I was a recurring customer looking to place an order (even though if it was for later pickup).

UPDATE: Looking at reviews, it seems like the manager is pretty consistent on how she treats her customers.  That sucks."}
{"text":"Jimmy & Joe's Pizza oh how I love thee and miss thee.  Terry Black (owner) is one of the friendliest people I have ever met and his daughter Amy that runs the store when he is not there is equally so.  

On to the pizza.  Its good-got a little kick of spice in the sauce.  You can't beat the lunch special and if you are feeding a crowd make sure you order the Big Jimmy.  I would have given it 5 stars but I have had an occasion or two when the pizza was a little below average."}
{"text":"I looooovveee Jimmy & Joe's there pizza is so good, and the Joe's sauce is awesome! The price is cheaper than it should be, for the amount that they give you. I'm not complaining. The slices are huge! and there wings are bomb! I always order from them on Sunday's for football. All my friends that come watch football love the pizza. Keep up the great pizza!"}
{"text":"After living around the corner from this joint for almost a year, I decided to venture in. I had previously avoided the place because I am from NY and am often disappointed by pizza. I just wasn't up to it. I would rather make the 23 mile drive to Ray's in Scottsdale. Besides, this place kept sending me coupons and I figured any business that has to do so much direct mail advertising probably does not have a product that speaks for itself.

I was wrong.

It was a chilly Friday afternoon when I finally succumbed to the call of pizza. I walked into the glorified shoebox of a place (a good sign) and was immediately disappointed that there were no slices on display. I like to look at them before I order. Then I can be prepared for way to much cheese or to thick a crust or some other pizza travesty. I was actually only here to look, so I told myself and the guy behind the counter.

Well since my super hero power is supreme lack of self control around potentially delicious items, I ordered a slice. Every day from 11am to 3pm they have a slice and a soda for $4. I didn't think this was a huge deal because in my head a slice still should cost $1.50. That makes the soda what, $2.50?

Well I was a little more than floored when my slice arrived at the table. It was served on a pizza pan with a rolling cutter. Why, you may inquire? Because the damned thing was bigger than my head! Apparently it's a slice of a 24 inch pie. OK, so maybe the $4 was a good deal after all.

As I have been so trained to do by my years on that fish- shaped island, I pressed my right thumb into the middle of the crust to help create the perfect pizza fold. A delicious crunch accompanied the saucy steam rising off my pie. And the whole thing held itself up as I prepared to take my first bite.

Tangy sauce, not too much cheese, crunchy crust... nice. I can't wait to try their specialty pies- the Popeye looks amazing. And I don't even have to say \"light on the cheese, extra sauce, and crispy crust- you know, NY style\" and just hope something edible comes out.

I shall return."}
{"text":"Pizza was good not great. Sauce was a bit spicy for my kids. Like that they have by the slice."}
{"text":"Wow! If your looking for a local pizzeria w/ fluffy, and crunchy yet soft dough where you always eat your wives crust, Jimmy and Joe's is your new spot!! I have been consistently blown away with every item that's made it into my mouth, from a simple cheese to a full blown Supreme. I have finally found my Friday night pizza spot!!
Thank you to JJP #seriousslice"}
{"text":"Best pizza, I've ever had!!! The chicken pesto pizza was AMAZING!!! 
We will definitely be back!! So happy to have found this gem"}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza, but definitely not the best pizza I've had, not by a long shot. But the size of the slice, for the price, is a really good deal! And when you eat in, they give it to you on a platter, with a little personal pizza cutter to eat it with. The novelty of that never gets old."}
{"text":"Eegees in Phoenix!!!!! Thank you to Jimmy and Joe's for carrying eegees.  I read on my friend's facebook page that she bough eeggees at Jimmy and Joe's and I quickly made my way down there. Anyone who is grown up or been to college in Tucson can appreciate how amazing the eeggees drink is, yum!  I was not surprised that while I was in the restaurant, several other patrons came in for their own personal serving of eeggees.  Although Jimmy and Joe's is not close to home for me and I am almost never in the area, I will be making the trek several times this summer to fill up on my eegees cravings.  
Thanks again, I hope your other locations start selling eegees soon!"}
{"text":"Please start selling eeggees like your location Ahwatukee.  I guarantee that all of us ex-Tucsonans (and there are a lot of us in Chandler)  will flock to your pizzeria and will become loyal patrons very soon!"}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious. Great choices of topping and friendly staff. I like their joes sauce and they have good ranch. Pizza, wings and bacon fries are what i have enjoied so far!"}
{"text":"Great service, hot pizza, delicious wings (with plenty of sauce options) - consistently excellent.  Oh, don't forget to ask about the daily specials.  And now serving Eegees!  It's a bit too cold for me to enjoy one but during the summer, I'll be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"We love supporting our local Ahwatukee restaurants, and we eat out often...probably too often. So on Friday nights it's a ritual for us to have food delivered and unfortunately in our area the only choice is pizza.  We were so excited to have a local pizzeria come into the neighborhood, and since their opening we have been loyal customers.  That changed tonight. We called Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria at 6:56.  We were told 45 minutes to an hour for our delivery...no problem we thought.  At 8:03 we called to make sure they had our order, and we we told yes, the driver left at 7:24 and sorry for the delay we should have called you, we'd like to offer you $5 off your next order.  That seemed fair...so okay we'll wait. Well at 8:34 we decided our pizza and wings weren't coming. Called the restaurant (for the third time) to cancel our order. Seriously, who wants cold unfresh pizza and wings?  We walk out to drive to another restaurant (like I said before...anyway) and the delivery man pulls up.  I ask him \"how long since our food left the store\"....he looks at his receipt and says since 7:30.  I ask \"how many stops before us,\" and I'm told seven.  So, it's Friday night and Jimmy & Joe's can't deliver 8 pizzas in an hour and a half? Oh, and chicken wings...cold, undercooked (yes that's an issue) wings.  Do yourself a favor, get in your vehicle and drive to Nello's (always great pizza) or Native New Yorker (who isn't as good as they used to be, but who is 10 times better than Jimmy & Joe's.) We are happy we did."}
{"text":"By far one of the best mom and pop pizza joints in Chandler AZ. Their serious pizza slices and calzones are delicious with their in house Joe's sauce. They also have eegees here to order!

I've ordered delivery from here as well and when they mess up my order, they own up to it and try to win me back with free slices of pizza. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Looks:  Jimmy & Joe's is a pizza joint with a couple tables and a soda fountain.  There's outdoor seating, but half of the year in AZ is too hot for that (and the reflective metal tables don't help.)  You're better off doing takeout.

Food:  They're known for their giant 24\" Big Jimmy pizza that barely fits through a doorway.  At lunch, they have 1-slice combos w/ drinks + salads or wings.  Trust me, one slice is plenty of food.  The pizza is good, but not great.  It's a notch above  delivery chain pizza.  (For a quick lunch, I prefer the pizza at NYPD.)

Value:  The lunch combos go from $5 to $7 and they're a good value.  I think the whole pizzas are a little expensive, especially the Big Jimmy.  But hey, I guess charging a premium for a pizza that massive is acceptable.

Miscellaneous:  The place has a stamp card that gives double stamps on Thursday.  People really seemed to like the Jimmy sauce, a tangy buffalo wing sauce.

Verdict:  I'd go back occasionally for lunch, especially on Thursday."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for pizza and wings . They have awesome pizza and wing deals ! Stop in !"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza by far! With slices as big as your face and a personal pizza cutter how can you go wrong... oh ya and the secret Joe's sauce will rock your world indubitably."}
{"text":"Horrible service from Registrar. I visit this pizzeria often and order out often, today was the first time I experienced awful customer service."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Why have i not been here before. Serious Slice means SERIOUS.  This is their special of the month - Southwest Chicken.  If you not into jalapeños,  this will kill you; for me - FEEL DA BURN!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best pizza I've ever had in my life. And I've had lots of pizza over the years. The people working there are very helpful and accommodating. Their chicken wings are FANTASTIC too! Plus they have one of those new Coke machines that lets you choose from about 10,000 options. They also have Eegee's -- if you don't know about Eegee's, it'll be your new favorite drink!"}
{"text":"So back in Nov & Dec I tried a few more orders from here.
The consistency and quality control seems much improved.

Still not my favorite pizza or wings, but not bad either.
The sauce still has a bit of sting to it, so if spicy isn't your thing - avoid."}
{"text":"I would like to rate zero stars but there was no zero option. We spent well over $50.00 dollars for a single pizza and order of wings that was easily the most horrible dining experience of my life. The pizza was so grotesque that nobody even attempted to eat it. The oil/lard had congealed to a solid state and smelled absolutely disgusting.

The wings were so raw they were rubbery to the touch and nobody attempted to eat those either. We asked for the wings to be well done as this the only way we have ever eaten wings. Suffice to say I will never ever eat this crap hole again and suggest you dont either if you value your health. I spoke to someone who claimed to be the owner and was not offered my money back on completely uneaten and satisfactory food. Needless to say I will be calling the department of health as soon as they open."}
{"text":"Where to begin! 

Pizza is great. 

But this place is CONSISTENTLY understaffed. I've only been here on weekends with one person running between the line of customers, the phone and bringing food. The first time we went, we were in no rush and I totally felt bad for the person running around trying to take care of everyone else. But even so, we waited at least 30 minutes for the first slice we ordered and then maybe 10 more for the second, and we just grabbed the third to go. That time it was great besides the waiting. The second time we ordered delivery. We live like 2 miles away, so we didn't think it would be a big deal. But after an hour, we called to check in. They said they couldn't reach us about the payment not going through, and that they hadn't started making the pizzas yet (we had no missed calls and double checked the phone number they had). After another hour and phone call, we were told there was still another delivery ahead of u and that our pizzas were ready, waiting. So we just drove over and got them at that point. The one kid working that Saturday night was shaking in his boots when we got there, and said his manager  (who was not there- over the phone) gave him authority to give us 2 coupons for next time. After 2 hours, and picking the pizzas up myself, I politely declined and went home. 

Bottom line, in my own opinion, this staff has zero support or set up for success from it's management. And I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. First off, the pizza is so good! Don't forget the Joes Sauce! The wings are magnificent! And now to top it off, they have Eegees there!"}
{"text":"A really good pizza experience.  They give you your huge slice on a pizza tin and give you little pizza cutters to slice it up.  Mon-Tues you can get a second dozen wings for $1.00.  Great owners.  They are always crowded which is always a good sign.  Very good food and service."}
{"text":"Edit 1/2010:  

I'll leave my original review untouched, but feel that I need to add that this place, as other reviewers have noted, can't seem to turn out a consistent pizza from day to day to save their life.  We've switched over to Venezia's for our slice cravings, which not only has better prices, but a much friendlier staff.  Also, we don't have to navigate teenie-bopper hell to get to the register.

Farewell J&J's, you lost us with your ever increasing prices and inconsistent quality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Old review:

Normally I like thick crust pizza, not New York style.  But this is probably the best thin crust pizza I've had in the valley, and I'm a pizza snob.  I have regularly stopped in for a Serious Slice since they opened, and it quickly became a favorite.  Even though I occasionally get an inconsistent piece, it's mostly 4 to 5 star quality.

However...

As great as the pizza is, they've gone ahead and raised the price for a slice for the second time in a little over a year.  It went from $3.99 to $4.50, and now to $5 for a slice and a drink.  At this point, I can no longer justify the price.  I wish the owner would allow a no drink option at a reduced price, so we'll see what happens."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes like cardboard with cheese on it. Very tasteless pizza and is way way to expensive for what they offer.   Service is ok but basically take order and bring food.   Not special price for 2 slices. Just one slice and a drink.  Needs a lot of work!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great prices!  Only problem is delivery gets backed up during peak times.  Wait time over 1 hour?  Plan ahead if you want to eat here but you won't be disappointed with the pizza.  The sauce they use is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love jimmy and joes. This location is no different. Wings are great slices are huge and amazing the specialty pies are all so good.

Try getting pesto on the crust of your slice. Makes a great crust even better.

Don't forget the one of a kind Joes sauce. Out of this world. Don't believe the haters. I got nothing but love for JJP."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza from a amazing local family. Support local chains and the best pizza in the valley!! 

The slices are amazing , get pesto the crust. Love their wings the Joe sauce is amazing. My recommendation would be a pepperoni, sausage and meatball slice with pesto on the crust... So amazing"}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying, I'm a pizza aficionado. Pizza is love, pizza is life. That being said this is my favorite pizza joint, hands down. Great service, the wings are delicious some of the best I've had, and the pizza is a gift from God. It's a good value for what you get as well. Calm environment inside, with great music. Usually have great coupons too. Would recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Besides being a small place (which any small biz starts out in) this place is as close to the NJ and NYC pizza i love as it gets in az. I was lucky enough to do one of the owners wifes hair and she gave me a coupon for a serious slice to try it out and i have been going there ever since. It isnt easy to see from the street but its a great place and worth the money for sure. the serious slice combo for lunch is a great deal. Try the joe's sauce on your pizza you wont be sad if you like spicy stuff.

keep being amazing guys!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great wings ! I am happy to say that they also have a gluten free option! The atmosphere is super chill and the people who work here are very kind. One reason we stopped in is because I saw pictures of egees and I am a sucker for egees. They even ha the flavor of the month!"}
{"text":"So I would just like to start off by stating that this business understands how to make their customers happy. I am now a loyal customer to Jimmy and Joe's. And I am really thankful for how accommodating and understanding they were with my situation.

It began with their website. I live in the Ahwatukee area, and I see that another reviewer said that they do not offer online ordering for this area...at least this wasn't true about a month ago when I tried ordering from Jimmy and Joe's for the first time. I ordered two of their specialty pizzas and anticipated their arrival. The delivery guy came at exactly 45 minutes, was friendly and handed over my pizza. Once I sat down and opened the boxes, I realized that the pizzas that I received were not mine! I immediately called the Ahwatukee location I ordered from and the worker said she would call the delivery guy right away to let him know. About 5 minutes later, she calls me back and says that I was the only customer he delivered to. I assured her that this was a mistake because I did not order this (disgusting) pizza! She read off my receipt and I began to get pretty upset at this point because what she was listing off was not what was on the two specialty pizzas I was super excited to eat. 

I started cussing saying how f$#@king disgusting the pizza looked, and I think she got the hint that I was not happy. I was hungry, tired and had just spent over $40 on two pizzas I could not eat! Hell yeah I was upset! The worker put me on hold for a few minutes while she told her manager the situation. The manager ended up apologizing for the incident and agreed to send out the delivery guy to pick up the wrong pizzas and to drop off the two pizzas I originally wanted, free of charge. At this point, I really did not care that I had to wait another 45 minutes for my pizza. I was ecstatic that the manager and the worker were so accommodating and really heard me. 45 minutes later, the same delivery guy came to my door, we exchanged pizzas and he apologized. In the end, the pizzas were TOTALLY WORTH IT. You have no idea how disappointed I was going to be if they were just \"okay.\" But they really held up to their name.

So the root of the problem? It turns out that their WEBSITE, at least for the Ahwatukee location, was at fault. What had happened was that because I CHANGED the SIZE of the pizzas (literally from a 14\" to a 16\"), the website TOOK OFF all the ingredients that made up both of the separate specialty pizzas and added on RANDOM ingredients!! So, without noticing these changes (because honestly, I've never experienced a website having a mind of its own), I accepted the payment and anticipated the pizza's arrival...without knowing the hell I was about to endure.

I'm hoping that by sharing this particular experience, it can prevent a lot of hassle for other people. Also, I think people need to recognize how great their customer service is. 

But for your future order, I suggest CALLING them. LOL."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good. The wings are good. As a Tucson resident, I also really appreciate the fact they have Eegees. The combos are also a seriously stellar value, where you can get a huge slice of pizza, wings, and a drink for a super low cost!

Then they removed the drink from the combo meals.

And I lost it.

I told my wife of 12 years that our marriage wasn't working anymore. I abandoned my kids because I just couldn't handle it. I stopped returning my friends' calls because I didn't know who I could trust. This entire country is going down the dumps and these duplicitous politicians make me want to move away forever. I left the house and started living in the forest, away from all these capitalists that try to lie and take away what's valuable to me. If I can't get a drink with a combo meal what's really left for me? Nothing but the sweet release of death.

The Southwest Chicken pizza is my favorite, the taste is really potent with the ranch dressing"}
{"text":"Such amazing pizza!! White Pizza is the best! Too bad it's kind of expensive. So we save it for special occasions! The 24 Inch pizza is a challenge....haven't been able to do it yet!!"}
{"text":"Tried calling to place an order for delivery and some guy answered pretending to be a girl and when asked if I could place an order he handed the phone off to someone else while laughing. The next person got on and when asked where I was calling they hung up on me. I confirmed the number was correct. Totally unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Very good, very consistent quality pizza. Huge pies. Nice variety of toppings! I can personally recommend the \"Top 2\" on the menu (The Company Combo and the Chicken Pesto; so different that we split our 24\" between the 2), as well as the BBQ and The Popeye.
Have ate there and taken out 3-4 times now and NO COMPLAINTS.
We will definitely go back but unfortunately, we have a few other closer places (Oregano's and NYPD and Vincent's) that are my family's \"go to\" favorites..."}
{"text":"Love to come here for lunch. For 5 bucks you can get a huge and I mean HUGE slice of pizza and a drink. I love their special hot sauce for the pizza. Its a mix of Italian dressing and wing sauce from my study of it. I never used to put hot sauce on my pizza until I went to this place. I only put it on when I eat pizza here, every once in a while I like to savior a few untainted bites though. The full size pizzas are even better but never in the area to take home a full size pizza at night."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start...How about I LOVE JIMMY & JOE'S!!! Since this is a food review site, I will start with the food. This pizza is phenomenal! The BBQ Chicken pizza is probably my favorite, but the ability to create my own slice is always a good thing too. Massive slices of pizza that come with their own pizza slicer!

Next up is the wings...the Joe's sauce is basically like a hot sauce mixed with Italian dressing, and I am hooked. Being a wing connoisseur, I can be very picky. I am looking for the right amount of crisp and something a little different when it comes to sauce. Jimmy and Joe's covers it all with these wings. 

The lunch combos are great! Working down the street allows me to frequent this pizzeria and the prices are very good for what you get. You never leave overly full, and you certainly never leave hungry. Their rewards program is pretty awesome too and really helps get you back in the door. 

Lastly, and most important of all is the people! Since day one, I clicked with Amy! She complimented me on my choice of salami, onion, and fresh garlic pizza...not the best if you work face to face with people, but absolutely delicious! She remembered my name and order the next time, and ever since continues to impress me with the type of person and business owner she is. Both Amy and Terry have such generous hearts and are very willing and able to be involved in, and help out the community.  

Look no further than Jimmy & Joe's when you are looking for a great local spot who cares about their customers, employees, and the community around them AND has incredible food!"}
{"text":"I have never had such a negative experience with a food chain until I got in touch with Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria, and from the looks of it I'm not the only one. I, along with many others, attempted to order pizza and were met with a highly unprofessional and quite rude representative on the phone who was dismissive and hung up on us when asking only simple questions. We attempted to contact again and were again shut down. From there we went to contact the company directly and were met with someone who actually tried to help! This was a nice change and, almost, changed my opinion on this establishment, that was until today. The representative, who will remain unnamed, gave us her personal line to take a credit to have a more positive experience. However this wasn't done to remedy our past experience and was only done with the intent of removing our negative reviews. This was discovered when we attempted to use the credit and were met with immediate push back. The contact was out of town and stated that the credit could be used tomorrow. As we were hungry, we simply asked if the credit could be applied today. Nothing aggressive was sent. No foul language was used. Just a simple, why not today, we were hoping to use it today. Nothing out of the question in my eyes, maybe I'm crazy. That's when this representative responded in probably one of the most unprofessional ways I have ever seen. She called us a bully, said we \"needed a lot of prayer\" and then stated we will remove the credit. Mind you, the credit was given so we could have a positive experience and be able to put positive review. All this for some pizza. I honestly am pretty shocked that a company as a whole could be so unprofessional. Especially when this was supposed to fix a previous experience. I would recommend even getting gas station pizza over this place just on service alone."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite pizza places in town. Typically get your order in a timely manner. I always call in ahead of time and their systems always recognize me. Always their rewards is possibly the best around! Always saving up for the \"Big Jimmy\" and as always with a side of Joe's sauce"}
{"text":"Awesome workers I would recommend coming here good food and clean inside and outside the pizza was on the money and so good"}
{"text":"I always get the #1 with pepperoni and a side a ranch. Fast, quick, and lovely customer service whenever we have gone in. You could never go wrong with that. FYI: They are serving Eegees here now, but it's only the permanent flavors and not the flavor of the month."}
{"text":"This place has the best gluten free pizza we have ever tasted.  One of the downsides to becoming gluten free was giving up one of our favorite comfort foods. The gluten free pies we have had usually have a cardboard consistency but Jimmy and Joe's have really solved this issue for us. You would never know its a gluten free crust. Its delicious!"}
{"text":"I just live around the corner and have MISSED this great pizza place I could walk to! The owner frequents the starbucks I work at and was generous enough to offer us a coupon for a \"serious slice\" of pizza! I took my 17 yr old son and what a great SLICE it was! The place was crowded and a line of 8-10 ahead of us. Tables outside were full which are always a good sign and the staff friendly! The young lady behind the desk, Isabelle, adorable and friendly as can be! (in cute pink polka dot tennis shoes too!) I had cheese, he had pepperoni and both were hot and delicious! I thought maybe the slices were pre-made before coming in.... but definately not! Lots of teenagers but all were respectful and will be back soon! Great deal for slices of pizza with soda (5.50) especially when an entire pizza is too much! Not many places have this quality for slices. They also offer wings, cazone and their salads in the case looked fresh....will be trying and yelping about them soon! Serious Slice get a 4.5 stars!! :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in the state!!  You'll crave it after trying it once and the Joe's sauce is the kind that makes you want to drink it! :) Mmmmmm! Salivating!"}
{"text":"I shouldn't have come, but the BBQ sauce and pizza drew me in. I love this pizza, and I was really surprised about the chicken wings. They where very good. I'll be back for the big Jimmy one day."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I love thin crust. Their Serious Slice is definitely enough for one lunch meal!! And they're always very quick. They did lose our order once but you could tell there was a bit of maintenance going on in the back and things were a little frantic. They gave us each a free slice for next time since they lost our order. I appreciate when restaurants try to make things right for the guest, so that was a good mark for them in my book. 

Oh also...... THEY HAVE EEGEES!!!!!!!!! Anytime I need my fix I can get it here without having to drive to casa grande. I sure do wish Eegees would make their way out to the valley finally. I've emailed them. I hope they make it out this way soon. 

Anyways. Jimmy and Joe's is a great place. I love the new location as well. They moved, they used to be next to the Chase Bank across the street. New location is much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Tried calling to order a to go order and was on hold for five minutes. Then the picks up and asks for my order I tell her the first item I want and she puts me on hold again. They either need to hire a more staff or just put another person on the phones. As far as how the pizza taste don't know went somewhere else for my Togo order."}
{"text":"It's a great place! Been going here for years. I just wish it was bigger! It's always crowded and there is never any room!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food at great prices.  Had a long day moving my daughter and she bought me pizza for helping and this place rocks with fast fast delivery"}
{"text":"As someone that lived in the NYC area for many years my \"bar\" for good pizza is very high!  

I found the pizza to be good.  The slices are very large and the sausage was good Italian sausage. 

I actually enjoyed their buffalo wings the most .  Slightly crispy and not drowned in too much sauce.   You have a choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing which isn't always the case in AZ."}
{"text":"I had to write a review update because we had great experience here last Saturday. To start off my fiancé had constantly been asking me to give them another shot since our last visit because the pizza and wings were so good. I finally gave in on Saturday because I too was craving pizza and Jimmy and Joe's definitely has great pizza, it was just the service that was not so good in the past. So we got there around 6:30pm and it was rainy and cold that evening so as you could imagine, the small restaurant was packed and a very busy place.

We went to the front to place our order and a really nice, younger gentleman took our order (I didn't catch his name unfortunately). He was wearing a Disney pin lanyard which I immediately thought was awesome because I am a Disney fanatic and I too was wearing one of my pins on my jacket. We instantly connected over it. He took our order and we decided to eat in. It was quite packed inside (very small interior) but a nice couple was leaving and kindly gave us their table. As we were waiting I observed the very nice gentleman who took our order, really taking the lead and running the front service and giving pizza orders the back of the house. Finally it looks like the owner got the message and maybe hired someone who actually has got it together. This is the first time I have been in here where the restaurant actually looked like it was being managed and running smoothly especially on a busy night.

Our pizza came out, a 14 inch with green chilies, pepperoni and onion and it was absolutely delicious as usual. One thing that Jimmy and Joe's does right is pizza and now that they have service back on track it makes me a happy customer. I hope that they can hold on to the gentleman who took our order. 

I will be back..."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and have been wanting to stop by for a while for a slice of pizza just for a quick snack. Well, the slice was huge, and they gave me a small pizza cutter which allowed me to cut small pieces up for my kids. I'm a huge pizza fan, and there's was a solid 8.5 out of 10. The staff were friendly and it didn't feel corporate. The music was loud enough but not too loud and was actually good pop music. I like how it's small and reminds me of a pizza shop in a big city. Even when it was busy, it didn't feel crowded. Great experience and I plan to eat there again soon."}
{"text":"Took the kids (4) on a Sunday. Got a meal for under $30 bucks. 2 pizzas. Wings garlic bread and drinks.  Great Value."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The girl at the counter was incredibly helpful and so nice! I ordered one of their slices and added a few items, the total was almost $9. I'll probably stop by here every once in a while since that's an expensive lunch for me. 

When I got my slice I realized why it was so expensive - it was huge! Seriously, two people could eat this lol! 

The only reason I reduced 1 star was because the slice was so big and difficult to maneuver that, sadly, all my delicious toppings fell off the pizza. Next time, I will ask them to cut the slice in half to make it easier to eat."}
{"text":"Just had the worst pizza in Chandler(Or whole PHX) from a pizzeria , including several franchise chain in it(Pizza Hut dominoes etc are better tasting). It felt some old pizza was served with solid frozen cheese served on thin slice . No taste to top it .  It was so bad I had to throw it away after few bites . I rarely write reviews but this place needs to improve.

10$ for a slice of worst tasting pizza and drink"}
{"text":"Hands down my all time favorite pizzeria! I've been going to this place since they first opened and I haven't found a place that some closes! Friendly staff, amazing food, and decent prices. If you get their pizza make sure you get ranch or their joes sauce to go with it!"}
{"text":"Not cheap but it is good pizza.
My family   likes white pizza  and since the place where we used to get white pizza  is no more this is the next best thing.
Monday and Tuesday are THE bargain nights.  For something like $15.95 you can get any 3 item 16\" pizza .  They're regular $21.50!
And for $5.00 more you could get a second.
They also have slices that are about the size of an entire pizza .  YOWZA!!!  
Good location too.
I just pop in here, order a couple pizzas  and stroll over to Zipps for a beverage  and some music  while I sit and peruse the stuff on my smartphone, then go back to pick up MY delivery order.  
Parking lot can be a challenge depending on time you're here and what game is on or what Holiday  we're celebrating.
You know what they say -it is what it is."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a tasty slice of pizza. The joes sauce is to die for and the staff is always so friendly. It's a great atmosphere and ever since they have started to serve eegees I give it even more taste value! SO GOOD! A Tucson favorite brought to Phoenix. Love Jimmy and Joes! I finish the slice every time and it leaves me satisfied."}
{"text":"Amy B. You say one serious slice has 10-11 pices of sausage on it.

Well if you had read my post I said mine LITERALLY only had 8 pieces. 

I will still stick to not EVER visiting ANY of the Vallley (Phx) locations again. I don't care if its Premium or the cheapest bought sausage 8 pieces was a joke and 10 to 11 pieces is a joke as well."}
{"text":"Went to a gathering last night where they served a giant sausage pizza from Jimmy and Joe's .  Not only was there hardly any sausage on it, there was absolutely no pizza sauce on the entire pizza. Tasted like cardboard with cheese.  Terrible pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely love jimmy & joe pizza. Lets just say papa johns, pizza hut, etc has nothing on them. 
The prices are fairly cheap, the amount is crazy, and the taste is amazing!!! 

I love their buffalo chicken pizza:)"}
{"text":"Good pizza but kind of expensive for what you get. Other pizza places offer way better deals."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but could be a little more generous with the toppings. A little pricey as well, in my opinion - 16\" pizza with 2 toppings is $22. Wings were ok. They moved across the street next to Albertsons, so now they are on the NW corner of Ray & McClintock, not the NE corner. 

They also do by-the-slice options for those interested in a quick lunch. They have specials on Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good alternative to pizza delivery since a couple of our favorite spots closed. Well, we may have found a winner. J&J Pizzeria offers a nice selection of pizza, wings, calzones, and other sides. We tried the italian sausage pizza with the \"joe's sauce\" wings, both bone-in and boneless. We were not disappointed. The phone order went well- very nice girl on the other end offering her help. The pizza arrived earlier than expected and was HOT. The wings are good sized and delicious- great value for $7.50/dozen. The pizza was excellent- great crust, mild (but tasty) sauce and cooked perfectly. The prices are right- it's a great spot to feed the family without having to leave the house. I would definitely recommend to family & friends."}
{"text":"So, my opinion on this restaurant as a whole is that they are a good pizza place. Easily a 4-star at the other locations. This location has issues, though.

First off, I witnessed the management of this place screaming at an employee through the call up window. Apparently she misjudged how load she was being. What she said to this poor employee was unprofessional and down right rude. That is a star off right there.

Second, the last few times I have been here, the pizza doe is still raw towards the crust. I was told they changed their dough and this is the root of the problem. I cannot confirm or deny this. To me, it seems like they run the oven too hot and blast the outside, but still have some raw dough in the back.

Today at lunch, I went to get a soda and the machine kept spitting out black flakes of something. Needless to say, I didn't drink the soda.

This place has potential, but it seems like this location suffers from poor management. I also visit the location on Ray rd and have none of these issues."}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail for a really great deal at this pizza place that is right in our neighborhood and so we decided it was time to give it a try.

Pros:
I was impressed with the large selection of toppings they have available and a few of specialty pizzas on their menu are rather unique.

We ordered for pick up a 16 inch pizza with salami, ham, and mushrooms, a dozen traditional mild chicken wings, and the cheesy bread that was included in the deal.

I liked that the texture and flavor of the pizza crust was definitely more traditional Neapolitan style, which is not too thin with more gluten, chewiness, and little charring. The sauce was good and there was also more good cheese on the pizza than you'd typically get at franchise.

I really enjoyed the wings, which were meaty, juicy, and had just the right level of heat for me.
The last time I ordered chicken wings from another restaurant I decided to try the \"boneless\" variety, which, as we all know, were actually chicken nuggets. After this most recent experience I'm pretty sure I'll be sticking with traditional from now on.

Cons:
The pizza crust was a little soggy in the middle by the time I got it home.

At the same time, Jimmy & Joe's crust failed to win over my fiancee, who happens to be a huge fan of the Sicilian style crust at one of the large franchises, which is softer on the inside and more crispy on the outside with no charring.

Without the coupon, which was a very good deal, our pick up order for pizza and wings, which did not include a specialty pizza, would have easily come to $40 or more.

They do not have online ordering available and so are not offering regular specials at this time as far as I know."}
{"text":"Portions are large, pizza was average. Place was moderately busy, so service was slow. I will not be in a hurry to come back."}
{"text":"3/2/11

I've wanted to try this place since a coworker suggested it to me back in December.  I trusted his judgment since he also mentioned liking Pomo, which I've bookmarked to try a LONG time ago, when Yelp was all a-buzz about how great the pies were THERE.  I could never locate Jimmy & Joe's though, when I was hungry for pizza.  I'd always see the sign from the road when I had just eaten, or was on my way to another restaurant, but today I actually wrote down the cross-streets so that I would finally get to try their Gourmet cheese.

Since I usually get a cheesy no-sauce pizza, I try to get my veggies in by either adding aritchokes or, even better, asparagus (extremely rare to find at pizza joints, but I have ordered pizzas w/ it before!), but today I decided I'd have a Greek salad, which included mixed greens and romaine lettuce, chopped tomatoes, pitted whole kalamata olives, sliced red onion, and feta.  I was very hungry, which might have prejudiced me into really enjoying the salad.  It was so HUGE!  Even after I had more than my fill of it, there was still so much left-- it almost looked like I hadn't touched it!  I found the feta to be creamy enough not to use much of the delicious blue cheese salad dressing.  Warning: I thought that all of the saltiness I detected came from the olives.  I was wrong-- a lot of it came from the feta itself, which I detected later on, when I had more of the salad after arriving home.  Just thought I'd warn you, in case this was an important issue...

The pizza arrived about 15 minutes after I ordered it.  First thing that struck me is that it had tomato sauce on it!!  What??  I wondered what made me think it was going to be all-cheese?  Oh, well.  The chunks of ricotta looked promising, so I let the matter of the sauce go.  I initially thought the crust was going to be perfectly-crisped, but I very soon found out that this pizza is VERY doughy!  Whatever crunch I found didn't last very long.  The sauce was also VERY salty-- a fact that another coworker highlighted when I told him I didn't care for the pizza at Jimmy & Joe's.  We actually chimed \"It's too salty\" in stereo!  I found that funny :)  The different cheeses (mozz, ricotta, provolone, and parmesan) didn't really translate into great flavor, either.  There was too miuch stringy mozzarella, and I couldn't even taste the provolone.  This pie had \"FAIL\" all over it!  

At least dessert was OK- I really wanted to try the chocolate cake, but since no one had the ingredient info, I had to pass on it, and instead, I went for the Grandma's Black Cookie, which was essentially a chocolate chip cookie w/ walnuts and oatmeal.  This cookie was so big, it spanned the whole length of my open hand!  I really enjoyed its flavors, as well as its textures- crunchy outside and moist and chewy interior.  A bit too salty in the end, though, but it tasted really great accompanied by a cup of \"super-charged,\" yet burnt Circle K coffee just around the corner...

Customer service was friendly enough, if a little ill-prepared when it came to answering some of my questions: Are the veggies used fresh or canned?  \"Don't know.\"  (Although the kitchen was able to answer, after I'd asked the girl at the counter to go and ask.)  Are the salad dressings made in-house?  \"No.  Everything's from a bottle, but we do make our own BBQ sauce.\"  O-K...  If you sign up for their emails, you can get coupons or SMS texts to use at J&J's.  However, good deals won't get me to stop at J&J's for a second time.  Sorry, but w/ so many other delicious options out there, I will have to pass J&J by!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Italian \"food\" I've ever had the misfortune to throw out half-eaten. The pizza was limp and soggy with a chewy \"crust\" that was more like Wonder bread than an actual pizza crust. It had an unwanted surprise aftertaste of hot chili flakes that left me angry nobody warned me about. And I could not find anything that resembled an actual meatball in their meatball sandwich. It appeared to have small dense cubes of something slightly resembling beef hidden in an overly tomato pasty sauce enfolded in a long limp bread roll. I had to toss it after a few bites. The store seemed to be run by a game bunch of teenagers giving it the feel of a frat house, and it reeked of stale vinegar. In three words...don't go there!"}
{"text":"God this place is overrated like none other. I think its because its the only place that does slices in the area? It is like a revelation apparently. Its pretty busy during the weekday lunch hours. Its good pizza, don't get me wrong, but people talk about this like its SO AMAZING. I think the hype comes from all of the high school students that go to Corona Del Sol who haven't had better. There is stuff out there that is just as good if not better. Also, it doesn't cost as much.

$30 for a 24\" pizza. hmm, lemme think about that. NO. venezia's is cheaper on wednesdays.

oh the lunch specials? yeah, venezia's is cheaper and just as good. in fact, they have combo deals available all day that are cheaper, just as good, and just as filling. 

service is retarded. just like someone else noted, its a bunch of teenagers. i'm not sure what you would expect from them. maybe hire someone who is hmm...not a teenager?

i'm really not sure what all the hype about this place is about. it is good stuff, but doesn't live up to the hype. the pricing leaves something to be desired, and if it was a bit cheaper it'd be a more viable option. however, as it is, i think the pricing keeps this place from getting a 4-star."}
{"text":"This is the story of two cold and soggy pizzas, the never arriving pizza, an incredibly rude man who identified himself as \"THE OWNER,\" and several failed chances to get it right.  

One Saturday night I called Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria to order a pie.  There was so much banging and loud noise in the background it was nearly impossible to hear the feeble seemingly untrained phone worker.  I ordered one of Jimmy & Joe's specialty pies.  What arrived at my door a mere hour and a half later was a cold soggy cheese and pineapple pizza.  Absolutely not what I ordered.  I called the driver and he promised to bring my specialty pie back.  A mere 40 minutes later he arrived with another cold and greasy mess albeit the pie we ordered.  Because we were starving, we accepted the pizza but finished baking it in our oven.  It wasn't too bad it you don't mind a lot of grease.  It's noteworthy that only two pieces were ever eaten.  

I called the driver back.  He promised not to run my credit card or void the charge or something of the sort. 

The next day I checked my bank activity.  Guess what?  The errant pizza delivery driver had in fact NOT voided the charge.  I immediately called the store.  I endured more banging and loud noise.  I thought Jimmy & Joe's may be actually killing something or somebody in the kitchen where the phones must be located!  It's incredibly loud!  The manager, Amy promised me a $30.00 credit attached to my phone number for my next order.  She was very nice and said the chicken pesto pizza is often greasy because of the oil based pesto.

The next Wednesday I called to give Jimmy & Joe's another chance to get it right.  While I could again hear them clearly murdering somebody or something, I was promised my \"FREE\" order and ended the call.  Wondering if maybe I should call the police because of the murder going on in the kitchen, I salivated waiting for my pie.  

A short time later a very gruff and angry man called and said, \"I'M THE OWNER.\" Then he said, \"My driver is too damn busy and backed up to deliver a FREE pie.\"  I reminded the grumpy man that this wasn't a \"FREE\" pie.  That I had paid over $30.00 last time and only ever received two cold soggy greasy pizzas and nothing I ordered was eaten.  He none the less refused to honor Jimmy & Joe's prior commitment.  

Bottom line folks, go somewhere else.  Clearly this mom and pop chain Jimmy & Joe's is out of their league.  I gave Jimmy & Joe's not one but several chances to get it right and Jimmy & Joe's blew each opportunity to get it right.  What continues to worry me is if they are hacking somebody to pieces in the kitchen.  But then again, maybe it's \"THE OWNER.\" Or perhaps it's just their business they are killing."}
{"text":"Pie is okay. It's definitely over priced. The female who answered the phone did not say hello, or thank you. Was slightly awkward. She seemed very unpleasant. I'll be ordering from somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I love the slices and wings here but the service is the worst! I waited 40 minutes for two slices and waited over an hour for wings. I get that most pizza places have kids working for them, but could you at least hire more friendly and efficient staff?"}
{"text":"The food is good however the way the staff talks to you is outrageous. The woman on the phone was absolutely ridiculous. Shes rude and i will never eat at this establishment again. How are they even in business???"}
{"text":"Called in an order two weeks ago. Haven't had big city pizza in a while. Pepperoni was my wish and I wasn't disappointed flavorful sauce,ample cheese and a wonderful thin crunchy crust. Counter service fast and polite. I also appreciate the free parmesan and red pepper flake packages. If I'm back in town I will make this one of my stops."}
{"text":"This gotta be one of my favorite pizzeria. Carnivore serious slice with wings, always hits the spot.  Don't think I'll ever get tired of this place.  Service is always great/fast."}
{"text":"My calzone was tasteless and very very bland. It also costs 15 bucks. The soda taste super watered down and they only have RC cola products..."}
{"text":"You've got to try this place! After living in Chandler for a year and half we finally got around to trying Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria and we are so glad we did. First off the place is small but they do have a few tables inside and a handful outside. We were lucky because the sun was down and it was a breezy night, so we opted to stay but sit outside. We both ordered the serious slice; pepperoni. It's always good to test out a classic before getting into the complex pizzas. The pizza slices are pretty serious! One is the size of two large slices. They're similar in size I'd say to Venezia's but just slightly wider. They come on round metal pans and accompanied by a pizza cutter! At first I was thrown off by the pizza cutter and just wanted a regular knife but I soon got used to it and thought it was fun. The pizza itself was soooo- good! It was mostly thin crust New York style; I say mostly because the outer edge, where you'd normally hold a slice of pizza, was thicker. I wish it was as thin as the rest of the crust. Anyhow, it had thick melty cheese and oregano sprinkled on top. I always add more oregano and we both add the red pepper flakes. We both were in heaven with these slices. The serious slices are $5.50 and come with a drink, .50¢ extra for additional toppings. Jimmy & Joes does offer pick up, of course, and delivery. This place was so good we decided to go back two days later for lunch. I'm pretty sure Jimmy & Joe's will be our pizzeria of choice for quite a while."}
{"text":"Normally I LOVE the pizza here. It's thin crust (the best kind) and the serious slice was my favorite thing there. It was all good up until the last time I came here and they gave me pizza with uncooked dough. I haven't been back since and i dont know if I can"}
{"text":"Writing this review makes me very sad because I love Jimmy & Joe's and I've been a loyal customer for the last few years. However the last two experiences have been terrible. This last visit I was waiting for my wings pour over 40 minutes period only for the girl to realize that it was sitting inside the warmer for the last 20. Not to mention they completely lost the order of the woman in front of me. This is after they put me on hold for 20 minutes and I had to drive over there personally to order. 
Last time I went they took 30 min to make one order of fries. All the while yelling me that it was almost done."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy & Joe's and go to their various locations often, but I've yet to receive even decent service at this location. Unfortunately, this location is the closest to my house and is the one I visit more often. The staff is very young, which is completely fine, however they are constantly too busy goofing around and chatting with their friends rather than helping their customers."}
{"text":"Impressed. Went there last night after drinking at Cactus Jacks.  One slice filled me up.  Not overly priced.  

Interesting facts: They have a tangy/spicy sauce to dip it in and it comes with a fortune cookie.

Will be back..."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in town. The pizza and wings are great. I do have to say that gluten free pizza seems to not have been at least one time (based on gastrointestinal distress afterwards), but everything else is awesome. And it's the only place in Phoenix to get Eegee's frozen drinks.


Today we had an issue with a gift card and an order and the management was so helpful and professional. They turned a bad situation into a great one that guarantees we will be back many more times"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!! Has got to be the best pizza in town. Just don't count on any real customer service."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, giant slices, and don't forget to get your card stamped to earn a free slice!"}
{"text":"New spot, same delicious pizza!

Nice tvs, large dining room, and helpful staff make this one of the best pizzeria's in town.

If you haven't eaten here, you're an idiot."}
{"text":"If you want pizza. Real damn good pizza. This is your spot. Pizza is at the top of my food menu in all situations and once I discovered JJP I never once have ate pizza anywhere else. Not in the mood for a full pie? No worries,  slice's as large as the sunday paper. 

Don't just take my word for it. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the #1 jimmy and joes location. I have never been disappointed by the customer service here. The slices are consistently great."}
{"text":"I love that this place boasts a New Times award for 2008 & 2010 on it's pizza box.  Well, it's 2013 and this place is not the best of anything. I've recently had to change my diet because of gluten intolerance (I know, everybody has a gluten issue these days). So I went online to search for a pizza joint that offered gluten free crust and delivered, as I had to stay at work late and was getting hungry. I found this place on Yelp and the reviews seemed okay, so it was worth a shot. They have an online ordering system, which was very nice. I got the 12\" gluten free thin crust, with 1 topping (sausage), and cut into squares. They said it would take about 45 minutes. No problem.
About 30 minutes after completing my order online the delivery boy was at my door. I was impressed by the fast service. I shouldn't have been. It should have been telling. Like when you go to McDonald's, order your food, and they have the tray with your food sitting on the counter before you're even done paying. You know that stuff has been sitting there for days.
So I go and sit down with my pizza.  Mmm, smells good, and I'm super hungry. So I open the lid and first thing I notice is there is literally 12 little sausages on the pizza.  Little, as in M&M size.  They charge $1.40 for one topping.  $1.40 for 12 little pieces of sausage?  My god, I can buy a Little Caesar's sausage pizza for $6.00 and that thing is covered in sausage.  I could pick off all the sausages from a Little Caesar's pizza, throw them in a bag, and sell them on the corner for at least 5 bucks. Apparently Jimmy Joe's can't afford it.
\"Okay\", I think, \"That's okay, I can forgive the sausage shortage\". So I grab my first piece.  Or I tried to grab my first piece. The pizza isn't cut.  It has indentations in it.  It looks like someone tried to cut it, but the blade didn't go all the way through.  What? How does a pizza place not have a blade that goes all the way through a pizza? I'm frustrated and a little disappointed now. Apparently Jimmy Joe's wants me to rip the 12\" Frisbee apart with my teeth, like a cave woman. All right Jimmy Joe's, challenge accepted.
So I rip a chunk off the edge of the pizza and take my first bite.  I immediately have to spit it out.  THE PIZZA IS NOT COOKED.  It's dough.  It's a pancake of raw dough with melted cheese and sauce on top.  It's inedible.  Gee, I wonder why they couldn't get a pizza cutter through the pizza.  Now I know.  The funny thing is, the complete crust of the pizza is burnt to a crisp.  It's a thin crust, 12\" pizza.  Can someone explain to me how you can completely burn the crust of a thin crust pizza and yet have the rest of the pizza completely uncooked?  Especially when you are a pizzeria?  How?  How is that even possible?  I use to cook pizzas when I was in high school.  You make the pizza, stick it in one end of the oven and the thing comes out the other end fully cooked.  And if it's not cooked, well gee, I don't know, maybe you put it in the oven for 5 more minutes.  Isn't this their job?  Cooking pizzas?  And you can't even do that right.  How sad.  So, you can imagine, by this point I am seriously pissed off.  I can forgive the stinginess on the sausage.  I can forgive my pizza not being cut.  But how on earth am I suppose to even be able to say if I like someones food or not, if I can't even eat it?  It's unforgivable.  $16/pizza + $3/delivery + $2/tax + $3/tip.  Wow.  $24 later and I get a piece of raw dough with some little rat dropping sized sausage on top.  Lucky me.  Now I'm at work for another 2 hours, with no dinner.  Thanks Jimmy Joe's!
Now I have to waste my own time and gas to drive to this place, give them their disgusting pizza back, and get a refund.  I get there and I realize as soon as I walk in why this place can't cook a pizza. It's pretty obvious there is no one in charge of anyone in this place.  No manager, no owner. Just a bunch of people standing around doing nothing. Guy at the front asks me what I need. I told him I wanted a refund on this pizza I ordered.  He asks me if it's from today. Really?  Do people hold on to food for longer than a day to return it later? Gross. I told him yes and he asks what was wrong with it. I told him, \"It's not cooked. It's a piece of dough, it's inedible.\"
Swear to god, he says, \"Oh, ok. \" Wow.  No, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that\" or any kind of shocked reaction that they would have sent out an uncooked pizza to someone.  It's apparently such a normal occurrence for this place, that the acceptable reaction to a customer returning something is \"Oh, ok\". The guy goes to get my refund. There is a kid in the back eating cookies over the prep area. Nasty.
So I finally get my money back and a very delayed, \"Sorry about that\". Oh Jimmy Joe's, it's okay. You keep up the great work. I know you'll be in business a long time with such great food."}
{"text":"Huge slices and amazing service. Their pizza is so good and by the slice. One slice feeds two easily!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I saw a kid at lunch at my school with a \"seriously\" big slice of pizza.  I asked him where he got it and he showed me the soda cup that came with it.  Jimmy & Joe's eh?  Gotta try that place. . .

Okay.  Today I did.  I got their Special #1, which is a \"serious slice\" of pizza and a bottomless drink.  The pizza wasn't the best I've had, but it was a pretty damn big slice.  For $5, this was a good deal.  They apparently also offer a 25 inch pizza here for about a $1 per inch, and they also deliver, which is a plus.

Great, I found a place near my work where I can fill myself up for $5 and refill my drink one last time to go. . .sounds like lunch to me."}
{"text":"They are starting to fail with quality ordered green chillies got green peppers. Basic knowledge there is a difference. Looks like next generation needs to pay attention to knowing the toppings. Venezias never has failed me, guess it is time to go back. They never get it wrong and 5 bucks cheaper."}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust pizza for home delivery last night,.  The staff and delivery person were friendly.  They offer gluten free in the smaller 12 inch size.   I ordered a 16 inch size and found it to have very flavorful and fresh ingredients, conveniently delivered to my house after a busy day.  .  

I consider the crust to be more like New York subway zone style pizza.   It was not crisp in any way, not even on the edges. I do enjoy New York style pizzas an this crust seemed like it was hand tossed or home made, which I liked.  If you like crispy crust, this is not the place.  

I am not sure what to think of the cheese.  It was either very skimpy and didn't put hardly any on, or they use a different type of cheese that is almost transparent.  

I also ordered meatballs on half the pizza and I believe they used small ground meat chunks instead.  If I say meatball, I am picturing an actual full sized ball of meat, sliced up and applied to the pizza.in a pepperoni like fashion.  So what I received was not quite what I had in mind, but still flavorful.  

I may return again soon when the mood for soft New York style pizza strikes. 
FYI, other reviews can be found under Jimmy & Joe's Pizzaria - slightly different spelling of the restaurant name there."}
{"text":"Why so serious? Because I am uncomfortably full after consuming a serious slice. lolz. I'm so funny. But seriously, if you're looking for to feel uncomfortably full on some pretty tasty pizza, and you happen to be around the area for lunch, I recommend it. But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"\"Serious Slices\" really means 1/4th of a pizza!!

My first time there was last Sunday. I walked in and was immediately asked what I would like (I was impressed ..remember, I live in Yuma). I explained it was my first visit there and was curious what type of pizza slices they had. In a very clear and friendly manner the employee (maybe Jimmy or Joe?) explained the slices were custom made to order and told me all of their current specials. He then handed me a frequent buyer card (Buy 10 slices get 1 free) and gave me two stamps since it was my first visit. Nice! 

The slice was ready in ~ 5-10min...delivered to the nice outside table.
Excellent crust, plenty of toppings/sauce, and served hot/fresh!

I signed up for their VIP club after I ate. A different employee (younger girl) helped me out and was very friendly.

Gas to get there from Yuma...$30

A pepperoni and mushroom slice with a drink.....$6.45

VIP club....$0

Great customer service giving you the \"I cant wait to come back here\" feeling... Priceless!

I am going back this weekend and am looking fwd to trying the other menu items...garlic bread, calzone, etc..."}
{"text":"It is good pizza.  The slice is huge for lunch.  Ordered the 24 Big Jimmy.  It gets soggy in the middle.  Stick with their regular size large.     More and more of these pizza companies are using the toaster conveyor to cook.  Im not a big fan of that."}
{"text":"After an hour and a half the pizza was excellent.  There was a charity event here last night where half the proceeds went to the family in need.  Their volume had tripled due to the event and they handled it very well.  I've never seen a pizza place on overdrive like that as I saw about 65 pizzas slung out in an hour.

My pizza was excellent.  Pepperoni and cheese with just the right amount of sauce.  Great crust and not too doughy made it perfect.  One dozen wings with Joe's Sauce had just the right flavoring.  Not too spicy but not plain either.

I was mainly a Barro's fan but I will come back here for the customer service and the great pizza."}
{"text":"I give the pizza 4 stars, but the service was a -2 so the overall rating is just 2 stars.  We ordered pizza from here one week ago for the first time and that experience was great!  The people on the phone were great and the delivery guy was as friendly as can be and was excited to have new customers.  We just moved here from Minnesota and have been trying out local area pizza joints to find the one that could satisfy our taste buds.  We were all set tonight to try out 2 more pizzas and were anticipating an enjoyable meal.  Pizza arrives and the deliver guy starts out by saying \"just for future referene, we don't deliver to baseline\" (we are 4.5 miles from their location).  We were going to give the guy a $10 tip for a $30 dollar order, but decided to hold back $5.  When we opened the boxes only one of the pizzas was what we ordered.  I guess the gal on the phone fat-fingered the second pizza and all we got was a cheese pizza.  We called to report the error, but the gal on the other end said we got what we ordered, but if we wanted to bring the pizza in they would replace it (WHAT?).  Who would do that, we ordered delivery because we did not WANT to drive out to get dinner.  This gal also reiterated that they don't deliver to baseline.  We told her we got the message and told her we asked that question the first time we ordered a week ago and they told us they did.  I guess we will take our business elsewhere.  Sorry Jimmy & Joe's, you lost a customer."}
{"text":"I'm impressed! A huge slice filled me up. Good pie! Can't wait to try a calzone! Love the buffalo italian dressing."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Can't go wrong w any type of pizza you order. They now have speciality sandwiches, Eeggs, bacon ranch fries and of course the Big Jimmy! 

Fast, friendly and good pizza. Dine in or take out and patio seating."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone in for a slice it's always been fresh and absolutely amazing, pizza is my favorite food and Jimmy and Joes is definitely my new favor spot I haven't gone since they started serving egees at all the sites. But I'm very excited to go have a slice and egees!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza but service not so much. Kids that work there don't seem to know how to smile and talk with mono-tone. I always do take out so doesn't matter if they are unhappy but I would give it 5 if they were little bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Ok we had a run in with this place today. My buddy loves it and swears it is the best pizza around. I'd had it once and thought it was ok at best, definitely not the best in town like new times says. 

Tried to order today for football... they do not deliver until 3 on sundays?! WTF! They HAVE to be Mormons, with the limited Sunday hours. We ended up getting Domino's yuck."}
{"text":"Love this pizza!  Serious slice price so reasonable!  Service always friendly!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Affordable, quick and tasty. The pizza slices are so huge that you get a pizza cutter with your dine in order. Pizza is piping hot, fresh and made to order. Employees are always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Single (ENORMOUS) slice with a drink is $5.99. It's a HUGE slice and delicious! They give you a pizza cutter with it because they recognize that it won't be an easy task to eat it with your hands. The employee was extremely fast and helpful. The pizza came out quite quickly and Tasted fresh. Topping were pepperoni and sausage and were tasty, too. Top notch fast food pizza shop compared to its competitors."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to spots for a quick slice of pie.  HUGE portions, numerous options, and the quality is always tip top. So many places that I've been to for a slice are cold or greasy.  It's nice being able to go somewhere that's always consistently tasty."}
{"text":"My son and his friends go for the lunch special (huge slice, 6 wings and a soda) for $4 all the time.  I decided to go with him one day.  Wings with Joe's sauce were really good (as good as The Vine in my opinion).

The pizza was fantastic - it reminded me of my high school days in NJ when we would go to the local pizza joint for 'a slice'.  It was huge!  The crust was fantastic.  I love pizza this pizza was very, very good.

Just a few cafe tables inside and a few tables outside so don't go with a group.  If you have a group - order their 24\" pie to go  - that's right they make a 24\" pie and I'm looking for a reason to order one soon.  They call it \"The Big Jimmy\".

No beer, no wine, just really good pizza.  Just wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"Good product, horrible customer service. After the first time that they were rude, I gave them a chance to redeem themselves, but they decided to add insult to injury. They didn't seem to mind at all, when I told them they just lost a customer for the rest of my life. When a company is like this, and they fail to understand that the more people like me, the less chance they have for survivability."}
{"text":"They would have gotten 5 stars but the young lady at the counter would not give me my pizza?!  She took FIVE orders before she'd hand it too me. After the 4th person I said, excuse me, may I have my slice. She actually said, no, not until I take all the orders. I finally waved back to one of the cooks, and he handed it over the 4 feet I was away from it  to me. Really strange.

Past that, pizza was great. It's a big slice. Fresh Mushroom.  Not too greasy. Not over cooked. Just right. Sauce was a little sweet as it should be. A little heavy on the spice but still very very good!

We may have the scooter club of metro phoenix do an event there if the server does not mind actually \"giving\" us our order ;-)"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, new to the area and obviously am struggling to find comparable pizza. I found you on Google. I called to see if you have slices because I'm short on time. I arrive at the store on Ray and McClintock this afternoon - Thursday, April 14, 2016 at 1:20 PM to grab a slice. I walk in and the employee was cleaning and talking to another patron, no acknowledgement of my standing there until I cleared my throat. She then said \"I'll be right with you\". So I waited and I watched while she continued to wipe down the condiment bottles and pull out the cheese shakers and other shakers that where half filled. She placed them on the counter and I thought...finally, maybe she'll take my order. I'm the only person waiting so, she could get. Back to that. BUT NO! She had to spray down the table and wipe it, while I was still waiting to order. I count a total of 4 customers (as I sit in your parking lot to write this) all of whom are already served. I looked at her while she was spraying and wiping tables and I asked \"REALLY?\". To which she said nothing. So, I laughed and said, \"it's ok...I'll just go somewhere else where they want my business\". I walked out without so much as a word from her. Is it because I'm Black? I don't play the race card but that's the only obvious difference between me and the other 4 patrons in the establishment. I would like to think it was just poor service but I'm trying to find a real reason for the lack of service. Is my hair too short, am I too tall? What makes it ok to make me wait while you perform your other duties. She wasn't knee deep in anything, she was WIPING DOWN The condiment area. Why not take my order then come back to that? Again, I was patient until she decided that she needed to wipe tables NO ONE was waiting to use, and there was no one behind me. Nice impression. I'm sure I'll find some place else to try. THANK YOU?!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was pretty impressed by the calzone. There was no sauce in it at all, but they gave me sauce to dip in on the side. It was pretty excellent. They did burn my calzone a bit, but they offered to remake it. When I said that I would eat the slightly over-darkened pizza, they brought me out a coupon for a free giant slice. It was a good day."}
{"text":"Biggest and best slices in town!!! Great lunch specials and the service is always good!"}
{"text":"Giant pizza slices. Great combos if you want to include a a side like a salad. Salads are just as big as the pizza slices! But I don't have a problem knocking back both of them. Last time we went in the cashier didn't give the drink cups that were included, had to ask. No biggie."}
{"text":"Normally I call in my pizza but I decided to walk in without calling ahead and the girl at counter was on the phone when I arrived.  
Very unprofessional for her to proceed to take another two calls when I'm standing right in front of her waiting. 

All she said to me is  \"I'm going to take this last one ok\".  She was telling me not asking me.  The pizza wasn't as good and I remembered.  Return factor is low."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a slice and wings. Great deal, awesome food and the employees are outstanding."}
{"text":"OMG! This was our first time here and thanks to yelp we found Jimmy & Joes! We were craving pizza and boy did this hit the spot.  My fiance got the Serious slice, which was seriously big and so tasty.  I got the calzone and holy cow is it huge! Best to share with someone unless you got a mean appetite.  All in all really really good stuff!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is always good, great wings. It's nice to see a local pizza business doing well! Go and get the slice and a soda, best $6 you'll ever spend!"}
{"text":"I ordered this place for delivery, so I can't speak to their by the slice pricing that everyone seems impressed with.  Their pizza is not bad by any means, but they are more expensive than comparable quality places IMO.  I have not try any of their specialties because after trying a simple pepperoni I just couldn't justify $20 for a large.

I have also tried their wings and calzones, which both of which I enjoyed.  \"Joe's Sauce\" for their wings is a mix of their medium and Italian dressing, and it is quite tasty, but their wings are very low on actual meat quantity.  The calzone I got was fantastic though, and was definitely huge!  Next time I order this place I am skipping the pizza, and just getting a Calzone :)."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations for sure! Really good pizza we'll order again and again and tell all our friends :) The wings were also a hit!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere and friendly staff! Try the buffalo chicken pizza with ranch, it's ridiculously good! Great value for lunch, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this location opened up.  It's so close to home and honestly better than any other pizza place I have ever been too.  The serious slices are as big as a new born baby and taste like GOD himself kneaded the dough.  I would recommend this place to any and everyone I meet."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place but they don't offer online ordering for their ahwatukee  location. I don't want to talk to people. So I'm rating this 1 star only because of that. I'll have to order Zzeeks again."}
{"text":"Jimmy & Joe's has been a staple of our diet ever since this Chandler location opened many years back. This thin-crust pizza is complimented with high-quality cheese. You can't beat the seriously slice, which is the perfect amount for a hungry individual (side of ranch, please!). Also, make sure to try the joe's sauce to add some spice! Consistently great pizza with friendly service."}
{"text":"Visited this place last night. I love supporting local businesses and these folks have decent pizza. I called ahead about an hour and the pie was fresh and hot when I got there from work. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The slices are large but to get two slices I had to buy a combo twice. I got two large slices and two drinks which I didn't need the second drink cost me almost $15 just with one topping on it. The pizza was not that great. They served RC instead of Coke or Pepsi and they don't wait on you but want a tip when you order. After paying for toppings on my pizza the toppings were very sparse. They were very stingey with the amount of toppings. I won't be back  They say its the size of a 14 inch pizza but  its not. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love coming here with my wife.  I'm pretty basic and go Pepperoni and Cheese with Boneless Wings.  She's more fancy and gets the Pesto Chicken Pizza with Boneless Wings.  Only complaint here is that they need more locations."}
{"text":"So it's probably not very fair or objective, but hey, first impressions, right? I went over for a slice for lunch around 1 pm. I've always noticed that this place does not provide much space to sit or hang out and I thought the 'lunch crowd' might have died down by then. Not so much!  There was 1 girl passing out orders and taking them. She was super friendly and upbeat though. I had to be the girl to point out there was no ice in the soda fountain but she was more than happy to hop up there and put more in. So considering that there was only 1 person behind the register and a ton of patrons, say maybe 20? It wasn't a bad experience. I waited about 10 min. from the time I walked in to when I walked out with my slice. Pizza slices are ginormous which is always fun and better than every other place with just regular sized slices, right? However; it was mediocre pizza. I mean, I definitely prefer, Buonos, Pestos or Barros for this area. Thin floppy, greasy slices are not what I like in a pizza, but I would like to go back when I can sit down and spend more time checking everything out. It's always busy so maybe I need to give it another shot. It's not like pizza can ever be that bad, right? Like sex? Even when it's not that good, it's stil pretty good!! Jimmy and Joe's, you're all right, but unfortunately, \"I've had better!\""}
{"text":"I have wanted to try New York Style pizza slices ever since seeing Mystic Pizza for the first time about ten years ago. We never got thin foldy pizza in the midwest. We have never lived anywhere near a realistic one. We stopped in here based on Yelp reviews and ordered a sausage and onion slice. I am now five pounds heavier because I cannot get enough of this stuff! I literally love this pizza. Even a cheese slice. Coming from a family that only ordered combination or all meat pan-style thick crust pizza, I always made fun of the cheese pizza eaters. Now, my husband and I always order thin crust at places like Oregano's, but it is the crispy cracker style, not the soft foldable flavorful New York or Jersey style like this. For a quick carb overload or lunch fix, Jimmy and Joe's is my new go to."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time and the food was about what I expected. I got the slice/wings combo and the wings ended up being better than the pizza. The wings reminded me of the great wings you can get from Long Wong's and the pizza really wasn't anything special. There wasn't a lot of sauce on my slice, but that just might be the way this establishment prepares it. The lady that helped me was really nice and accommodating and really made me feel like a valued customer. Not ready to write the place off yet and will try again."}
{"text":"Medicore, greasy pizza. I don't think they even have a bottle of olive oil in their kitchen as none could be tasted on my pizza. There were 3 young, under-worked employees behind the counter chatting and playing with their phones, and one over-worked cook in the kitchen. There were a couple eating, one couple waiting for take-out and me. It took 20 minutes for me to receive the \"slice' I ordered. Does the Jimmy & Joe's dress code encourage the wearing of sweatpants for their counter help? Why can't I order a slice with no drink at a lower price than the slice with beverage that they offer?"}
{"text":"A co-worker picked up the rest of us lunch and would not tell us where she was getting it. She came back and our eyes were huge! The most delicious pizza slice with a side of ranch was in front of us. Everyone from the office came to see what we were eating and wanted a bite! She finally said that it was the \"serious slice\" special. And, well...it was. 

The following week, it was my turn to pick and I couldn't stop thinking about our FIRST serious slice. This time, we all headed down and sat inside. Looks like this is going to be a weekly ritual. Mmmmmm.  Can't wait for next week!!!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy and Joe's has the most delicious pizza and a lot of variety. The \"Serious Slice\" is great when you are dying for pizza but you don't have the need to purchase an entire pizza. If I was giving stars solely based on the pizza I would give Jimmy and Joe's five stars, however, there are many areas that need improvement. The delivery service is off/on, this time, that time, \"not today, no fee, extra fee\" very confusing, inconsistent and depends on who answers the phone. The same goes for the customer service. Honestly, if it were not for the incredibly great pizza and wings the customer service would slam the doors shut for myself, many friends and family members. The customer service is inconsistent at best, lack of knowledge of menu, menu prices, delivery service and just plain lack of courtesy, tact and friendliness has been an experience that has kept me away for long stretches. The food is great the customer service not so much. It is definitely worth getting your pizza and wings on, just order it to go, check, re-check your order before you leave and go eat in the comfort of your own home."}
