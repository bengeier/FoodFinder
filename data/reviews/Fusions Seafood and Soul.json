{"text":"This the first and most likely the last time that I will be going to this place 

I figured I would give it a try since it is new and actually the menu card seemed intriguing 

I purchased three meals

For myself I got the bacon cheese burger and fries. Not that bad. A little more well done than I like it but juicy and the bacon was cooked well. The fries that came with it could have been cooked longer and lacked any crispness. this meal I would give them a 3

Friends dinner 

The second meal was the Philly cheese steak with fries. Although tasty, you can tell that the meat was the a thin stuff that you can purchase at the supper market ( steak ums ) and the fries as above should have been cooked longer . this dinner we would give them a 3

Friends dinner 

The third meal was the Chicken wing dinner candied yams and green beans and a side of Mac and cheese 

This meal was a disaster: first off she wanted to order collard greens but they stated that they were out of them so she then chose the Mac and cheese 

The yams were good but the beans were straight out of a can and extremely over salted. The Mac and cheese seemed to taste as it it was out of a box ( powdered cheese ) and considered inedible.
The wings, although tasty were very small and wouldn't fill a cavity. This meal received a 1 

With all totals the average was 2.33333333

Giving my score for this place a generous 2

I rounded down to a 2 because although they stated that they deliver, they could not tonight since their diver quit.....I wonder why 

Best regards"}
{"text":"I recently went here last week for the 3rd time and it was not so good as the first time I went. 

The first time I ordered a chicken Philly potato but instead received a sandwich. The manager was very accommodating and made me the potato and also let me have the sandwich. The potato was huge and very fulfilling. I also got the Sweet Jesus sauce on it. I was very pleased with the customer service. My niece ate the sandwich that evening and was very pleased with the way it reheated along with the fries. 

The second time I got another chicken Philly potato and it was awesome. 

The third time, I was not pleased at all. I ordered a wing dinner with greens and yams. The yams were soupy and the greens weren't cut, they were big leaves. The wings were very tiny. Nothing I would have paid $9 for at all. The Sweet Jesus sauce was amazing as always. 

Next time I want to try their fish. If that disappoints I know I can always go back to old faithful which is the loaded potato."}
{"text":"I went to this so-called restaurant last Friday and it was by far the worst food I have ever had, I would have taken that trash back but they were closing as I left. I bought  the 5 wings and fries for myself, and the shimp dinner with a double order of broccoli and cheese for my wife. The wings tasted as if they were cooked in old grease that wasn't hot enough because the wings were not crispy at all and left lots of grease in the bottom of the box   and fries were limp and soaked in grease I threw everything OUT! The shrimp dinner was awful as well the shrimp was not cooked throughout I took one bite and could tell that they from the frozen food section of your local grocery store also as I said I asked for a double order of broccoli and cheese but they gave me those greasy ass french fries and cole slaw tossed that box also! These people are incompetent and cannot cook the basics. $25 wasted. Stay far far away from this place."}
{"text":"I ordered catfish and shrimp dinner.  Catfish ok, but the shrimp is processed shrimp.  They don't cook in fresh. It's like seapack or Gordon's shrimp or something.  What's so hard about cooking fresh shrimp.  I may try it again."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and worth the wait. I will go back again and again. Second and the third time that I went there to fish always came out the same excellent it is worth going there for their catfish dinners"}
{"text":"My family got fish/Shrimp dinners. The seafood was seasoned well and the fries were good. I wasn't too particular about the Mac and cheese. Seemed processed. But the greens and Cole slaw were OK. I'll be sure to stop by. Tip: call your order in if you can. Especially in a FRIDAY!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured from Shaker Heights to Euclid to try Fusion Seafood and Soul food. 

The service was great, The owners son who took our order took care of business Kudos' to him.

My wife had catfish dinner, food was well seasoned and hot also crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The fries were hot and fresh. She loved the whole meal and will return again!

I Had the wing dinner with the Sweet Jesus Sauce, had me saying \"Sweet Jesus\" it was so good!.

Wings were fresh, hot, crispy and well seasoned and so were the fries. I will be back. 

If your looking for a black owned business with great food and service your search can end with Fusion Seafood and Soul!"}
