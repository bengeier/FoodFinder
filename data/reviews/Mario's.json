{"text":"Not excited about coming here again. Food prices are high. Kitchen closed at 10 or something early. I asked for peanuts or chips and they had none for sale, just \"sorry, kitchen closed\". Half hour later the cook comes out of the kitchen with garlic cheese toast for the workers and VIPs!!! 

It is a clean restaurant/bar, nice 50\" Samsung TVs for watching sports though, I'll give them that. 

Service needs to we worked on."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this new place...not impressed!!! The Buttermilk Wings were super crunchy (like break your teeth) and dry.  I had the Chicken Under a Brick and everything was unbelievably salty!!! The other meals were greasy and the fries tasted more like the oil they were fried in. Don't bother with this place!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Mario's after all of their online talk, and the fact that it's right around the corner from us. 

In regards to the service, we figured they would still be working out kinks at this point, but it was pretty poor. Servers seemed so stressed, and it was uncomfortable to watch. What bothered us the most was that there wasn't a manager helping out the servers. He was socializing instead, which spoke volumes to us. The bus boy was just standing around watching the tables like a hawk and trying to take plates and drinks way too early. It is clear everyone needed more training but also additional support staff like a food runner. 

The food itself was good but needs to be worked out a bit. We like the breaded wings idea but they are overly breaded (as other reviewers pointed out). Sweet potato fries tasted too much like a dessert and regular fries were too soft and bland. Pretty sure my kid's mac and cheese was the kraft microwaveable. A little more effort could have been made on the kids menu. Prices were a bit high too. 

We will give Mario's another chance, as we want it to succeed along with other local places. I would recommend that the social media person (manager or whoever that is) thinks before posting though. Discussing your inexperienced severs and \"fake reviewers\" is pretty poor etiquette and will not help your business. Instead, just post pictures of food and advertise specials or events. Or better yet, focus less on posting to Facebook and more on supporting staff and taking care of customers. 

Hopefully we will have a better experience when we go for a second try."}
{"text":"Not good, folks. Nobody here can seem to get it right. The fish and chips looked good when I saw it go out but everything else, blah. It is a bar. They seem to try too hard to be something else and lack the talent to do so. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The place was very slow but our service was slower
Salad came out with meal even when I asked for it sooner

Got the pan seared chicken which was good just a small piece of chicken

Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Here right now to see a musician friend play, ordered loaded tots as an appetizer and a salad and wrap for our entrees. Food was tasty but took over 30 minutes to get app and 45 minutes to get our food. Servers disorganized and two servers came to take orders. No attention or refills. My fiancé asked for hotsauce and never got it. Server said she would look for it and never came back. Servers seem to be working hard and frazzled, not enough common dining out courteous service."}
{"text":"Surprise!!!!! This place will not make it like every other restaurant that has attempted a go at this address.   Walked in sat down right away, no service for 10 minutes.  When we finally got the menus I was a little disappointed with the lack if Italian food to select from (silly me I thought it is an Italian restaurant) just typical bar food with a few Italian items. We noticed right away that things were not running smoothly, so when the waitress came to get out drink order, we ordered drinks, app and meals (figuring we would not see her again for awhile.....we were right).  She brought out 2 drinks and said she would be back with a beer, never came back with the beer. When she did come back she asked if we needed anything and we said the beer we ordered.  She made up some crap about not being allowed behind the bar.  We then watched people that got there after us get served their food.  
bottom line:
1.  We waiting 1 hour and never got our food. Went up to talk to the owner and he did not even come back to say anything.  He sent the waitress  (that was the fastest she walked to us all night).
2.  Just be honest and don't throw your co-workers under a bus if you forget to place an order at the bar (probably our food order too since we waited an hour).
3. Learn to say \"I am sorry, is there anything we can do for your inconvenience?\"  own up to things.  I get if you are short staff or have new people that are learning the job and what customers service is.  
4.  You either got it or you don't.... you don't.
5.  First and only time I will walk in this place."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Mario's is a decent neighborhood restaurant / bar that serves traditional American food, with a mix of craft, domestic, and import beers on tap and in bottles. Beyond beer, Mario's has a good selection of liquor and wine.

During my first visit, I had the taco special, and 12 Dogs of Christmas for my draft beer. The first taco was ground beef; the second was chicken. I liked the beef taco, and especially the low price (around $2.50 each). The beef taco tasted fresh, but the chicken taco tasted processed, like the kind served in frozen TV dinners. The beer was reasonably priced at $5.00, which is standard for a craft beer on draft in a Cleveland suburb. I also ordered a take-out Marguerite pizza for later, which was very doughy, had a decent amount of toppings, and huge portions. I am not much for doughy pizza, preferring the New York-style thin crust, but for fans of dough-based pizza in mass quantities, it was a good deal at $10.50.

During my second visit I had the Royalton Burger, which included an egg among other toppings. The burger was well-made and tasted good, with a lot of bread on the bun. It was also a big burger, so again, the portions were good. The burger was $12.00, which was overpriced for the taste, in comparison with the $10.00 burgers available at The Boneyard in Broadview Heights. However, the portions softened the feeling that I ordered an over-priced burger. I thought that it was worth about $10.00 in the end. I also had the 12 Dogs of Christmas again on draft, and was satisfied with the price of the craft beer at $5.00. 

The service was decent, both times. The bartender doubled as server, and there was only one other available. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Due to the number of customers, I did not receive a lot of attention, but did not get ignored either. The pizza took 45 minutes to be prepared, because the original got burned in the oven. Errors happen, so this wasn't a huge issue. The server offered to give me another beer for free, but I already had two, so I said no. I would have appreciated it if the server offered more options; I did not think to ask to take one of the beers off the bill until after I left. I appreciated that the server offered compensation for the time it took to make the pizza.

The décor in the restaurant is bare-bones, with some flat screens on the walls for sports. There are several traditional photographs on the walls, like the classic shot of construction workers sitting on a high-rise, legs dangling, eating lunch. Classic vinyl records (Rolling Stones comes to mind) appear nailed to the back walls. The floor looks like hard, polished cement. There is a section with games - a claw machine, basketball shooting, an arcade cabinet, etc. near the front. I enjoyed using the TouchTunes jukebox, as I was the only person playing music. It was loud enough to be heard, without overpowering the conversation. Customers seemed to appreciate a variety of music, including Rock, Country, and Pop. Overall it gives the feel of someone's basement rec room, which adds to the atmosphere of a friendly neighborhood bar. 

The clientele spans all generations, with the feeling that anyone is welcome. There were construction workers, \"alternative\" young adults, older people, and families. There were no obnoxious outbursts, and I saw the actual Mario socializing with some of the patrons. My only concern was that I caught the scent of marijuana coming from the bar, and looked up to see someone finishing a roach. The person quickly got up and left, so I'm not sure if the bartender was aware of it. If this type of behavior is permitted, it will turn away some customers, especially those who bring children out for a family dinner.

The atmosphere is relaxed, and other customers are unobtrusive. I also liked having the opportunity to play music through the Touch Tunes jukebox, without competition. I would go back for the taco special and craft beer."}
{"text":"My mom and a bunch of her church friends from Assumption Church went there today for lunch. There were 22 in their party. She said that the food was good, the owner was friendly and everyone had a good time. They even gave free slice of cheesecake for the ones celebrating a birthday. 

They were there for almost 2 hours and I'm sure they'll be going there again..."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere if you want to step out and have fun . Luved the live music by Justo and the energy level is very high . Lots of dancing on Latin music and simply luved it. Bar is cool with good wine selections. Good food and everyone is very friendly. Special thanks to Karen and Margarita who make sure everyone is having a great time. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Stopped for the first time after church last night as it was on our way home from NR to Independence.  Checked out the website and yelp as I usually do before trying a new place and decided to give it a go.  Inside was very clean and not to dark not too bright.  A nice big bar with plenty of big screen tvs nicely spaced tables and comfy booths along one wall.  Looks like it would be a great place to watch a game but it didn't feel like a \"sports bar\".  I think families with young kids or a group of buddies or girlfriends would feel equally welcome here.  The food was REALLY good.  Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked to medium as requested and very high quality beef.  My wife had the salmon in cucumber sauce special,  nice presentation and a unique twist on the sauce.  Not the kind of dish I would expect in a neighborhood place but when the chef (yes chef!) helped deliver the food I realized they had someone in the kitchen who knew what he was doing.  There were also some carrots as a side dish which were incredible!   And a bowl of chicken noodle soup that was clearly scratch made in house.   Decent draft selection too.  Only negative is service was a little spotty at first.  Our waitress was very nice but seemed distracted by something,  another waitress hopped in to help...not a big deal and not a complaint just an observation.  All in all a nice find and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would HIGHLY recommend this diamond in the ruff!! Stopped in for lunch and our group of four was very satisfied. The pizza is amazing, sweet potato fries with powdered sugar (can you say yum!!), Rueben was the special and a soup and salad...we will be back and I hope more people try this place out and experience the good food we had!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Not much from the street.   This place is a scratch kitchen; tavern food (not Italian!!) 

Server was very attentive.  Food was great.  We all had burgers which were a blend of 4 different beef meats:  sirloin, chuck, short rib, and brisket.   Very flavorful.  

Also, the owner went above and beyond by actually going to the liquor store to buy more Tito's because they were out and my friend ordered it.  Who does that?   Very much appreciated!!

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you're in the hood of Cleveland than feel free to stop here. The owner and his friends were at the bar, and so was all the service. There was a total of 15 people in here, and 10 were workers, the owner and his buddies. Don't waste your time!!! Better to go home than here!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my bf and his family last night...Everything was fabulous including our waiter, Piettro (if I remember correctly). Between the 4 of us we had the Royalton burger, the Cobb salad, summer salad and the special which was ribs and German potato salad which was amazing and I am eating it now as I type!  Genius to fry the potatoes.  Reminded me of my Oma's cooking!  We can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so we read the reviews and took daughter here for her birthday. HOLY SALT! burger was ok but SALTY. Fries were squishy. Wife got chicken under a brick. Shoulda left it under the brick. Forgot to put lemon or so little you couldn't taste it. On a good note the Brussel sprouts were the only reason this place got two stars outa me. Needless to say we are headed somewhere else for desert. Don't be fooled by the scrumptious online menu. I have often wondered if the same owner just flips the name and theme of this place when the \"hey look a new place\" crowd dies down. Never a for rent or lease sign out front. Have been to the other three restaurants that have been here and the food is exactly as mediocre as the last every time. In less then six months there will be a different name on the front of the building. Mark my word. WAIT A SECOND!!! I forgot the wings! Waaaaaay over breaded and over fried. First time I ever almost broke a tooth on a chicken wing. Yuck and farewell Marios."}
{"text":"Stopped by because needed a quick lunch. Had a great salad with chicken. Food came out quickly and service was friendly.  I'm dressing snob, dressing was real tasty!  I would highly recommend Mario's."}
{"text":"Non-existent service - is this a biker bar?
We thought we would try out this latest restaurant after the North Royalton animal fair. This location and building has gone through several management and name changes. We remember Marge and Tom's 82nd Street Grill and Pub which set the standard for fine dining and service. Later it became Caribbean Cowboy whose owner drastically \"renovated\" the interior with horrid corrugated metal awnings off the walls. She could not take food criticism very well and eventually shut down. Now we have Marios. we approach the front door and notice that the false brick front is still crumbling. Inside we are greeting with a chopper on display. So is this a biker bar, inappropriate for kids or is it an Italian restaurant? There are some mixed signals here. Very little if any renovation has been done to the place. The horrid corrugated awnings are still there but thankfully someone had the common decency to paint over that gaudy Caribbean Cowboy mural. The sign said that we should wait to be seated so we waited. There was customer at the bar and guy and his son at a booth. A waitress was seen by the kitchen chatting with the help and a bar tender was at the bar. We waited over five minutes by the door. We waived at the bar tender who looked up, saw us, ignored us and then went back to her much more important conversation. We left, never to return. If a restaurant is incapable of at least acknowledging customers waiting to be seated then it is doomed to failure. I can not recommend Marios in North Royalton due to non-existent service."}
{"text":"Went couple weeks ago and will never go through their front door again. Took over 1/2 hr to make a grilled cheese and a salad with a restaurant over half empty. 5 kids sat next to our booth and ran around yelling, jumping in and out of seats while so called parents were even louder sitting by the bar. No waitresses had enough sense to say anything to kuds either as they were hanging out by the parents area. Over priced average food to boot....."}
{"text":"First time since they changed hands.  Started with sauerkraut balls and they were big and very good, came with a side of spicy mustard.  Wife got the chicken Marsala, ate half and the other half is tomorrow's lunch.  Big thumbs up.  I got cheeseburger and sweet potato fries served piping hot and large portions, recommend both.  Menu had enough other options to warrant a return."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try.  Unfortunately, we will not be back.  Menu is minimalistic.  Fries were frozen, not fresh.  Table of annoying unattended children behind us while their parent was busy at another table drinking totally inexcusable.  There are so many other places which are better and less expensive to choose from.  Very disappointed.  North Royalton could use a nice, casual, quiet place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Came in to check out taco Tuesday for happy hour. Place was clean and modern. Bar was nice with enough TVs for watching. 2.50 tacos and $5.00 margaritas.  Service was fast and very friendly.  Taco's were good.  I got one chicken and one beef, sour cream and salsa went well with the taco's. Bumble berry on tap. I'll come back to try the entrees with the family."}
