{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I've been there several times and it has been delicious every time! I usually get a chicken or turkey plus two side dishes and I have yet to be disappointed. The chicken is always tender and juicy with always the right amount of flavor and seasoning. Love the tomato cucumber salad, roasted potatoes and summer slaw!! The prices are also reasonable and the staff is always friendly. I look forward to going back for lunch as well as trying their made to order breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. Excellent each time.  I feel like I am in Washington DC or NYC when I'm in here.  Good prepared foods, fresh sandwiches, quick, healthy options. All for $10 or under."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last week while vacationing in Pittsburgh with my family and had a great meal. Service was quick and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. What a great little spot downtown for lunch. I could eat this every day! Great sandwiches and sides (need to go back to try the salads next). Fun atmosphere. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Corner Mercantile is an upscale, fast casual and healthy bodega. It's located right in the heart of downtown. Their sandwiches and re-heated prepared food are perfect for a quick lunch. The coffee/tea bar is also unique and serves great coffee. This locale offers products from company's both local and all natural.   This is the best quick grab lunch spot in downtown Pittsburgh, has mostly all natural products and is allergy friendly. I recommend this spot to all of my coworkers who work downtown."}
{"text":"Corner Mercantile is my go-to place for lunch.  The variety of food is great: quiche, sandwiches, salads, entrees. I love that I can go into Corner Mercantile and find something that tastes good and is relatively healthy.  My personal favorites: Broccoli Crunch Salad, the flat bread pizzas, the gouda pasta salad and the beet salads. (But I'll be honest, I have yet to find something I didn't like).   I should also mention that the staff is fantastic. They are friendly and they know their products (and make great recommendations)."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Corner Mercantile about 5 times (maybe more) before writing this review.   Staff: Very friendly. Each time I've gone to CM I've been immediately greeted after entering. The general manager is visible, accommodating if you're looking for a certain item and also works the register.   Food: Everything is fresh. From the sandwiches to the vegetable sides to the pastries and the house made iced tea. I try something new every time I go and everything has been great.  Cost: For getting fresh made food that actually is nutritious and filling the value is there. You're probably looking to spend around $10 for lunch.   What you should try: Prime rib sandwich - simple sliced prime rib on a fresh roll with salt. Also, cheesecake!   Overall Corner Mercantile is a great addition to the downtown Pittsburgh breakfast and lunch scene for those looking for quick food that isn't chain fast food."}
{"text":"If you're looking to switch up your meal options during your day downtown, Corner Mercantile is definitely a potential place to visit. You can grab breakfast, lunch or dinner here (note that they close at 6:00 so it's not a late dinner spot) and they use a lot of local ingredients in their cafe options, which goes a long way in boosting the taste of their meals.  You have a couple of options for food here. One is more or less styling your own meal at the cafe/deli. Another is ordering their special entr√©es and sandwiches of the day. And finally there's the bakery and coffee options, which are sold at a separate counter than the main courses.  I typically go for their daily specials when I visit. Most notably I've ordered a rotisserie special with pork, pineapple and cilantro. The addition of peppers and cilantro helped to balance out the meat and fruit, both of which were quite sweet. The result was a tender sandwich with the right blend of tender and crunchy ingredients. It ended up being more memorable than a prime rib special, which was supposed to come with a few toppings but was mostly prime rib and salt. The prime rib was delicious, but I wish there had been some other toppings for extra flavor on that one.  While I'm usually here for lunch I've also stopped by in the morning and can safely say that the baked goods here are a great way to start your day. And since Corner Mercantile works with so many local ingredients, it has a very seasonal menu that changes on a regular basis. They're definitely worth repeat visits and I'm always interested in what they'll be serving next."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time was good, second time was a disaster. I was enamored with the buffalo chicken wrap my first time so I decided to get it again with some gourmet Mac n cheese. They must have mistakenly used regular chicken salad instead of buffalo because what they sold me wasn't spicy or flavorful. I asked for a refund and the whole team got involved; 4 people came over to ask me what happened and one of them tried to convince me that it was in fact buffalo chicken but \"there wasn't much red dye in it today.\" How could that statement possibly be (true or) helpful? Ugh. The mac n cheese was completely overcooked and a waste of $6; not exaggerating, it was mushy. I ended up throwing half of the Mac away. Also it had entirely too much smoked Gouda. Probably not going back."}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced. Best value in town in my opinion. I usually get the chicken and 2 sides option. Lots to choose from. Never a super long wait like at hello bistro across the street. Service is always friendly and professional. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"A reliable, convenient downtown lunch spot. Quick service, substantial premium sandwiches, friendly staff, and plenty of seating. I really enjoyed the Bloomfielder - ham, genoa salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, pesto mayo, marinated olive salad, spinach and mozzarella on crusty ciabatta. The house-made cold brew coffee is a winner too. Good for solo dining and small groups."}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced for lunch. It's usually pretty fresh too. Breakfast is a little expensive for what you get: a pre-made egg patty with average cheese and bacon on a meh bagel."}
{"text":"This is a great addition for downtown lunch! The prices are reasonable for the quality of food you are getting, especially compared to some other places downtown.  They have a daily sandwich special which was a lamb sandwich on ciabatta with greens for $8.99. I would definitely order it again and look forward to trying some of their other daily specials! They sliced the lamb and made the sandwich to order. They had a few other sandwiches to choose from, one was all veggie, one was chicken pesto and there were a few others.  With my sandwich I went for a side of mac and cheese which they have in a warming area by the check-out. I wasn't blown away by the mac & cheese for the price, but it was ok. There are pre-packed soups, hummus packs and salads in that area as well.  Next to the sandwich station, there is prepared food that you can mix and match to make a meal. Lasagna, chicken breasts, risotto cakes, veggies, and plenty of other options. I didn't try any of those but I plan on doing that soon. My friend got veggie lasagna with 2 sides and it was only $6.99!   My only complaint is that it is sort of hard to navigate with a crowd. This can be dangerous with a downtown lunch rush! There isn't a clear area for a line to form, so people were just sort of standing around confused and waiting to order. It would be helpful to have some of those retractable waiting line barriers to organize the crowd a little better.  I foresee myself making many trips here and will update with all of the delicious food I try!"}
{"text":"Corner Mercantile is a tasty corner gourmet sandwich shop in downtown Pittsburgh.  The bread to meat portion is on-point, meaning there's plenty of meat and the bread is petite.  It's a perfectly healthy lunch size.  We tried their prime rib sandwich (served Tue and Thu) and loved it!  The prime rib was moist, thinly sliced, and salted.  I would've loved it more if they had some mushroom/onions to go with it.  Or something crunchy to play up the texture.  That's something to ask for next time on my part."}
{"text":"Great options. Prepared foods. Gluten free, vegan, carnivores and paleo folks. Mmmm...mmmmm  They even have whole roasted chickens to go.  Great coffee bar and snacks of all types.    Super excited to have this in our downtown neighborhood.  Just another great addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Looking for a late lunch (nearing 3:00 PM) and thought I'd stop by as I've been passing it walking around downtown.  The had a vegan mole meatball sandwich was was very flavorful on some soft and crusty bread - yum!  When I walked in, I had a look of confusion not knowing where really to go but the staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and how the place works.    The sandwich was more than enough for me and everything in the place looked delicious.  Will definitely be one of my go-to for a quick lunch downtown."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of my boss one afternoon, I ventured down the block to try the Corner Mercantile. The entrance is located at the corner of the building, facing the intersection (right across from Hello Bistro). When you walk in, you'll find yourself in the midst of a buzzing little shop that's got something for everyone. There are fresh, pre-made salads, sandwiches and soups. There's a line for hot foods, a line for made-to-order sandwiches, and a line for coffee. There's minimal seating in the front, however I think there may be more seating in the back. I took my lunch to go so I didn't stick around to look for seating, but I got the impression there was more than what I saw.  Anyway, I bought a salmon salad with berries and goat cheese, and although i was a little hesitant about buying a pre-made salad, I was pleasantly surprised.  The salad was fresh and light, although very filling. The soup I bought was pretty good, although not really what I was wanting. They only had 2 to choose from that day, so I chose the one that sounded most appealing, but truthfully it wasn't what I wanted.. so that's on me.  I'd definitely recommend the Corner Mercantile to anyone looking for a quick lunch, or even looking for somewhere to linger a little longer.  They're options were extensive, and I'm told they have different things everyday. And yes, they have vegetarian and vegan options, as well!"}
{"text":"I have gone to corner mercantile a few times since it has opened but have only tried one thing, their Asian salmon salad! I would love to try other things there and can't wait to convince myself to do so. However, that has been impossible because I am obsessed with the salmon salad! The salmon is fresh and it comes with mixed greens, edamame, red peppers, oranges and crunchy noodles! What I'm really in love with is the miso dressing! I could drink it! It is the only dressing I need in my life! I will continue to struggle to convince myself to try something else from their menu but if it never happens, I won't be upset! Did I mention it is about $8! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I like switching my morning cereal at times and Corner Mercantile has just what I want, steel cut oats.  These healthy oats are piping hot and ready for you to customize with a variety of toppings: almonds, brown sugar, and mixed fruit.  The price is fantastic @ $1.99 + tax!"}
{"text":"I come here everyday, the cooks are awesome, great service, ask YB for his famous sauce. Made to order breakfast sandwiches and omelettes are the best part of my day. Lunch always has healthy and abundant options from sandwiches to salads to sides and more. I love their variety and everything is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced. Management must be really really cheap. $2 for a single banana - they have mints for 0.50 which any other restaurant gives for free.   Not enough healthy options. Everything is very heavy.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want to grab something quick, relatively inexpensive, and delicious for lunch. Located right under the Tower at PNC, this place features a bunch of delicious, handmade sandwiches that rotate daily, entrees, soups, salads, sides, and coffee. This place has a separate lines for each of their main offerings, so you won't wait longer than a couple minutes to get your food and be on your way.   So far I've tried their chicken parmesan bacon ranch sandwich and the turkey artichoke spinach sandwich. The chicken parmesan sandwich bread was incredibly soft after being quickly toasted and sturdy enough to contain all the sandwich contents without falling apart. The flavors of the sandwich worked really well too. Their turkey artichoke spinach sandwich is elevated to the next level once it's toasted, I just wish you could taste the artichoke spinach spread a bit more on this one.   I'll definitely be back at least once a week to try the rest of their sandwiches and their entrees. Everything looks absolutely delicious here and just from the two sandwiches I've tried, it's definitely a strong contender to be my new go-to lunch spot downtown."}
{"text":"This is my go-to since the day they opened. The service is impeccable, their lattes are better than the chain-that-shall-not-be-named, and their food is seriously delicious. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth the price in quality. My go to order is an iced latte and the protein grab and go box, but I've had their sandwiches, flat breads, and a variety of their hot prepared foods and everything has been extremely fresh and delicious. They also bake all of their sweet treats from scratch!   I would highly recommend stopping in for lunch!"}
{"text":"I wandered past Corner Mercantile and decided to stop in for a look.  The store is located in the new PNC tower and is a little bit reminiscent of some of the corporate cafeterias (run by Eat n' Park group) but with a bit more style.  Inside they have a hot bar, featuring today's special.  A deli case featuring many prepared food options, a small bakery or desserts area, and a case featuring ready-to-go sandwiches, desserts, snacks, sushi and soups.    Overall, I was pretty impressed with the selection and choices.  It looks like a solid option for a quick lunch when you're downtown.  They also have many healthier choices, which is a bonus!"}
