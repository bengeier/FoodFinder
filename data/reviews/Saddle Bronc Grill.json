{"text":"My wife and I go there regularity with and without friends for a fast and reasonably priced good quality dinner.

The broasted chicken ( yes, broasted) is a must try if you have never had it before. 
Taco Tuesday - Fish Tacos are amazing 
The dinner salad is great. Lots of stuff in it.  


Everything is fairly priced, good size portions. Friendly staff.
I gave it 5 stars because it is just what it is.

A nice, casual place to have dinner when you don't want to cook at home.
Try it - it'll surprise you"}
{"text":"First impression... place was busy and nicely noisy.  The staff was welcoming, the atmosphere very nice, and it appeared clean.  We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich ($9) and a Pulled Pork Sandwich ($11 or $12) with a diet Pepsi and water. Bill was $23.12, added $4 for tip.  

We REALLY liked the place, too bad that $9 Grilled cheese was near cold as were the fries.  Because it was cold, the edges were pretty hard.  My wife ate a few bites from each half.  A BLT is the same price... shoulda tried that.  Who charges $9 for a grilled cheese?  We had to see what it was!  (It was a $5 sandwich at best!)  OK, My Spicy BBQ pulled pork.  It was hot as were my fries.  My guess is the Grilled Cheese was done well before this, so it got cold.  The BBQ sauce was delicious, but just put on top of the mound of pork.  The pork itself was OK, not much flavor, and a bit dry.  

Both plates came with a few deliciously tangy pickles, and a small portion of fries.  We did get replacement fries for the cold ones.

It wasn't bad, but for the prices, I'd just expect a little better quality.  I know I sound whiney here, but when I go out and pay for a meal, I want better than I can cook.  It's a family friendly welcoming joint... give it a shot.  I'm not sure if we'll go back."}
{"text":"Great place with excellent food and customer service. Had the Saddle Bronc burger and fries. The burger was fresh, hot and could not have been any better. Have been watching baseball and other sports there on the many flat screens throughout the clean and friendly environment. Beer drinkers need to check out the cold and frosty craft and domestic beers on tap. I'm guessing over 20+ varieties. Friendly patrons and a happy looking staff. Relaxing place to be, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is an ok place. Nothing spectacular. This place is good if you want an average food. It's pricey."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant I did not have extremely high expectations for the food as we walked in right around closing time. The hostess kindly checked with kitchen to check the availability for food. The pork in the Pulled Pork sandwich was extremely tender and juicy, also the sauce was very tasteful. The fries were crunchy and seasoned well- no need for ketchup. All in all the service was great and the food was delicious. Definitely a restaurant I would return to. (Also the Rattlesnake Eggs are a must try!)"}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine walking into a restaurant that you have never been before and immediately feeling like a local regular.  The staff treats you like family and are very personable.  Great music and fun atmosphere. TV's all over the walls for the sports fan  and good company for everyone else. Our waitress, Dana was so awesome.  She was super fast and always made sure we had everything we needed. You won't regret a visit here."}
{"text":"We are locals and usually stick to our two favorite places in town. We heard some good things about Saddle Bronc grill and decided to give it a try. Their website advertised a special for Wine Wednesday's and offered 1/2 price off a bottle of wine. When we arrived we confirmed with the hostess that the special was still going on. We ordered a bottle of Chardonay that was very good. When the bill came we were charged full price for the bottle. I showed the bill to our server and she left to make corrections. About 5 minutes later she retuned stating that wine Wednesdays is no longer and she charged my card the full price. I was so upset that I opened their website on my phone and showed it to the bartender. I also explained that the hostess confirmed the special was going on. Their response was \" sorry special ended a few weeks ago, hostess is new and website must have an error. I then asked to speak with the owner. Instead of coming out and speaking me he sent out the hostess and refused to give us the discount. The bartender must have felt bad for us and finally decided it was the right thing to do and gave us the discount. We usually dine out 2-3 times a week and I can say with full confidence that we will never ever return to the Saddle Bronc Grill!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the owner who took the time to respond. The only  thing I can think of to make the restaurant-bar better would be to expand the menu. Thinking of a prime rib dip, chicken sandwich, Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Why no wifi, beer list, or cell coverage?!"}
{"text":"Arizona is well known for its Mexican food, but western cuisine, e.g. chicken fried steak and rib eyes, are just as much a part of the culinary landscape. This is a nice attempt at the latter, and a must visit spot in Fountain Hills if in town for a couple days. Would rate at four stars, except ribs were baked not smoked, and salad was average. Also, service at the bar was just so so. Lead barkeep is a treasure, but the secondary bartender did not know an IPA from Adam, and was not versed on how food was prepared. When in town again, I will be back. Have every inclination it will grade out as a 4 over time."}
{"text":"With new management the Saddle Bronc has improved, 
Service: 5 star (our waitress was excellent)
Ambiance: 3 stars (casual setting, noisy and crowded)
Cleanliness:  4 stars (appeared to be clean)
Food: 4 star (fish & chips were very good)
Price: 4 star (good food & service, $14. for fish & chips)"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Beer selection okay.  Service was bad.  Took 10 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, with what appeared to be plenty of staff simply avoiding eye contact.  Then never got place settings. Got wings, tasty!  Really good.  But had to eat without napkins.  Rest of food took forever.  Wait person was more interested with chatting with our neighbor, than with getting us napkins....or food.  Guy next to me stood up and hostess said \"have a great rest of your day\"...he then stated \"i havent even ate yet, my food is taking forever, at this rate my whole day will be spent waiting for my lunch\". Sounds about right.."}
{"text":"We finally realized the thing that makes this place so awesome - there are so many- but in particular, it's the staff. To a person, they  each treat you like a long-lost friend. They have fun and make you have fun too.  And they really care that your food is perfect. Meredith took care of us tonight and we had tons of fun. Thanks Saddle Bronc. We remain raving fans."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times...we love theSBG burger and patty melt. Food has always been great. We didn't have the best experience last night. Yes, it was a Saturday, but we were there on the early side of the rush.  They need to have more servers during peak time. Our drink order was wrong and she didn't offer to correct it, we had to ask for water three times, the food took twice as long as usual and the server never checked with us during the wait to see if we needed anything.  And we got the wrong bill. We will not return on a weekend again unless its mid afternoon!"}
{"text":"It took over 45 minutes for three orders to come out of the kitchen. One order was wrong. It appeared that the server was ignoring us. When we finally got his attention, he said our order was \"In the hold\" ?  Still took another five minutes for our food to arrive at the table."}
{"text":"This place is great for Fountain Hills. We love the broasted chicken and the ribs are excellent! No kidding! Also kids color a picture and great free brownie ice cream dessert.... Oh don't get the nachos go to Mexican restaurant for that."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and hungry please do not go to Saddle Bronc Grill. I suggest you go to El Canto. It is in the same parking lot. 

Saddle Bronc is overpriced and the food is below average. The service is inconsistent and slow. 

We were overcharged and told by the hostess that there was indeed a mistake but they could not change the bill. She advised us that we should remove the amount from the tip! How awkward of a situation to put a customer in. 

If you do go check out their stale and water-downed Ketchup and other condiments. They are disgusting."}
{"text":"No stars if I could. First time there, told the waitress that. Ordered 2 flat-iron steaks MEDIUM RARE. Came to us medium well. Shoe leather to our palate. We didn't send either back, instead we told the waitress that it was a bit tough and she might want to let the cook know they were over-cooking things a bit. At $33 total for both, you'd think they might offer a dessert, a beer, a discount. Nope, just the full prices beer for our courtesy. Could have easily sent both back at cost to them, guess decency doesn't get you far these days. Tipped 15%, always tip 20%, and it pissed me off to do so, because I don't think the waitress even mentioned our shoe leather to the manager. Complete and utter fail.  Took 3 years of living in Fountain Hills to try this place because we always heard less than positive reviews. Now we know why. We'll never give this place another shot. If we can save others from wasting their money on this over-priced place, that takes the sting out of our wasted cash. Never, ever again will I waste my time or money at this tourist trap."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...the food was out if this world..the music and environment was fun but the best were the owners Jim and Gwen Wallace...we felt like family by the time we left...highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food was mostly really good, but the service was very poor, even rude.

First experience: To go order. Bartender took the order while managing the bar with live music in the background. They got the order incorrect and left out the utensils. I called to let them know of the mistakes and got a voicemail during business hours. I left a message. Nobody called back. The food was very good, however.

Second experience: Called to place a to go order. Went round and round with the gal as she insisted they didn't have the item I was ordering even though it was on their Web site menu. Turns out the Web site is outdated. When I arrived, I let them know about the mistakes on the previous order. The server asked if I needed utensils as though it was an unusual request. She then said they were out of utensils but if I really needed them she could probably find some. Translation: she didn't want to bother looking for them. Another server brought us utensils. As I checked out, I asked if she heard what I said about the previous order being incorrect. She said she did hear me, but she wasn't working that day, had no control over what happened, and isn't a manager. I asked to speak to a manager. The owner came out and apologized and offered us free dessert. 

Third experience: Called to place a to go order. Got the same gal I had issues with previously. She said she would need to get another server to take the order. She then argued with a coworker over who was supposed to take to go orders and left me hanging on the line and never returned. I called and asked for the owner and he took my order. When I arrived, the catty server walked by and smarted off at me. I left the restaurant. The owner followed me out and asked what happened. I told him, but he did not apologize. He just walked away. My wife went in to get our order and received the same catty treatment from the server and gruffness from the owner who just asked her \"What do you want me to do? We cancelled your order.\"

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Generous portions, good food, reasonably priced - what more do you need? The wife had baby back ribs which she enjoyed and fell off the bone. I had the chicken fried steak which was also good. Quick service by a friendly waitress. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat!  Our servers, Collan and Tracey, were outstanding - refilling our drinks and making sure everything was to our liking.  The pulled pork, sweet potato fries and burgers were excellent as were the drinks from the bar.   Kudos all the way around.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The chicken is amazing! Friendly staff! Live music... Wish they had a mixed drink menu!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Everyone is very nice and great customer service. Me and my husband  come here at least a couple times a month. Food is always superb. Very laid back feel. One of the very few restaurants in fountain hills that I will keep coming to."}
{"text":"********** If you're a fan of BROASTED CHICKEN ....... This is \"The Place\" ***********

I did a Google search for Broasted Chicken ....... I came across the Manufacturer  of the Broasters .... Walla ..... I discovered The Saddle Bronc.
                   http://www.broaster.com/slocator.htm

The Chicken was scrumptious ....... I had the 2 piece with 2 sides ($8.99).
They permitted me to eliminate the Wing ..... thus I had 2 breasts .... with no up-charge.

They've got a bunch of other choices on the menu ..... along with 30 different Drafts on tap.

Arrived at 6:30pm we were seated immediately ....... they already had a nice crowd.
Since this was Saturday ...... Live Band ....... began at 8pm.

 The wait staff were exceptionally Friendly ...... a real nice plus."}
{"text":"We just moved to FH and we love this place. The pulled pork is so yummy and the prices are cheap. We always have great service too. We've tried other restaurants in FH and none top this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place to hangout. Western atmosphere. Great music on weekends. Great beer selection. Good food. Large screen tvs for sports games. I'm keeping going back."}
{"text":"Food is good and the staff seem friendly. Decent place to have a cold one and choke down some grub."}
{"text":"We stopped there after the big art festival and had great beer, great service and great food. Perfect after a day of walking around."}
{"text":"the wait staff is very friendly and the menu is predominantly what you'd expect for \"bar food\" but they have great options for sides. i got the john wayne burger and it was awesome. the only downside to this restaurant is that its Loud. Even if there's only 10 people in there its Loud. I think its the acoustics of the room but if you're going to have conversation this is probably not the place, but If you're looking for a great classic hamburger in Fountain Hills i don't know of a better place.e"}
{"text":"Outstanding food service and drinks. Fun atmosphere. Great casual place."}
{"text":"3 of us girls stopped in on a Sunday after kayaking . None of us had ever been there before. We sat at the looong bar and had one of the best Bloody Mary's ever! Breakfast was also very good.
Great atmosphere with plenty of tv's to catch all the games. A mixed crowd
kept it lively with nice midwestern to N.Y. transplants. All of us happy to be here. i will be back again."}
{"text":"Dont buy this lunch Groupon it is a total SCAM!!!  First of all you can only use it for lunch and the place is only open for lunch one day a week on Sundays through the summer until it expires. What a scam!!!! Second of all the service is TERRIBLE...the waiter is a complete idiot and handed us cocktail napkins with out food, no silverware, the food is messy....you need a STACK of regular napkins....obviously people with kids need A LOT of napkins...they had some party going on in the back so we had to sit at a pub table with our baby sitting about three feet below us in a high chair which was stupid and annoying....food is mediocre and underwhelming....service sucks. Groupon is deceiving and wish I never purchased from a business that is SO unethical to try to run such a SCAM!!! I will not be going back. I dont know why businesses do a Groupon like this only to seriously piss people off."}
{"text":"Very good food!  We would come back for sure!  Went during annual street fair so was VERY busy and very loud.  Food took a while too, but was so tasty when it came out we didn't care much!  Pulled pork and fried (broasted) chicken delicious!  And to top it off, the brownie and the locally made pies are to die for!  Cute place with reasonable prices.  Only giving this a 4 because of food wait.  We'll be back..."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad but the service is horrible. Brenda could care less if your order is correct, out on time or any good. She put the order in wrong and then acted as if it was our fault. No apology and nothing taken off bill. Won't be back for long time. Can't afford to lose your year round customers. Think about it."}
{"text":"We picked Saddle Bronc Grill from the 4 star Yelp review while on vacation. What a mistake. I had the two piece breasted chicken with mash potatoes and gravy, and mac & cheese. When I ordered the mashed potatoes and white gravy I asked if the gravy had lots of pepper in it (thinking of country gravy) and the waitress said no. This gravy must have had white pepper because it was very peppery. I couldn't eat it. The chicken was good but the Mac & cheese was less flavorful than boxed Kraft. The sauce was very thin and I had a hard time tasting any cheese flavor. The waitress offered a new side but I refused since I was getting full. My husband ordered the flat iron steak with coleslaw and baked bean. The steak was pretty flavorless and the coleslaw was so so. The beans were the best part of his meal. Needless to say we will never come back to the Saddle Bronc Grill."}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar. Javier is the friggin man. Hilarious guy. Had the blt with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"It's a place where everyone seems to be local and friendly. We went Saturday on a whim and Sunday returned when staying in the area. Staff is attentive and food is good. 

If you aren't friendly go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We did ask for the manager and the\"hostess\" told us clearly she was the manager and could do nothing to improve the service. It's apparent that you have marginal employees that don't understand customer service. We certainly will not return and will share our experience with our friends and relatives. Word of mouth advertising at its worst."}
{"text":"We had passed this restaurant many times as we drove around the fountain Hills area and were intrigued by all the cars we saw there. After visiting the craft show we decided that the Saddle Bronc would be our selection for dinner. We got there at about 5:30 on Friday evening and were lucky to grab two spots at the bar or wait 30-45 minuet wait. The beers on tap are impressive and priced right, and service was great for such a busy place. I ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and no disappointment from a avid lover of this dish, my wife ordered beer battered fish wish was lightly breaded and not greasy. All in all a very fine restaurant to satisfy both your thirst or food needs. I will remember this place when I visit fountain hills."}
{"text":"SBG burger soooo amazing with sweet potato fries in beautiful fountain hills 

Elliot very pleasant & awesome bartender"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for some time and have only considered a review.

the restaurants food is consistently good,  

being well versed in the food industry I know the owners have gone above and beyond typical bbq fare.  the pulled pork is made from a great from scratch dry rub recipe and cooked overnight to make it melt in your mouth good. and the ribs soak in a wonderful in house recipe marinade before they are cooked too.

 they have Flat Iron Steak which is a rarity to find...new york strip Salmon and the grill is a great gas fired broiler grill for Chicken breasts marinated in a great from scratch recipe. the WOG is fabricated right there in kitchen.  More labor intensive and time consuming work is put into every part of the menu here than the average consumer reliezes.

And broasted chicken WOW,,,just doesnt get any better.  Im sorry YES it does.  try one of the wonderful pies.. wow I beleive they are Rock Springs Pies...WOW

Ive have not had one bad eating experiance there.  Ive moved too far now and its over 50 miles round trip. but when I was in the area I did eat there."}
{"text":"This was probably the best fried chicken I've had this side of the Mississippi. Our waitress Hailey was super attentive and made some excellent recommendations. The beer selection was varied and exceptionally tasty. I will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was fabulous, I had the chicken wrap and hubby had a burger. The waitress was happy, funny and attentive. It was located only 5 miles from our hotel. The ambiance was cool too. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We went there on a busy Saturday night.  We were told there would be a wait for the table,possibly up to 30 minutes, but that we were second in line.  Approximately ten minutes later, a large party got up and left so I was happy that we would be seated soon.  Instead, some other customers started moving tables together for their large party to be seated.  Apparently they were friends of the owners.  However, the very sweet young hostess knew that we had been waiting and was very concerned that we were being overlooked.  She very promptly had someone check with the owner to see if this had been pre-arranged.  It hadn't, and we were seated as it was our turn.  We were very happy to see that this young lady was watching out for her customers and willing to take action.  She also checked on us periodically to make sure we had everything we needed.  I feel she went above and beyond her hostess duties - definitely a great employee.  We come to Fountain Hills quite often and love the Bronc, especially the flat-iron steaks.  This particular time, they were not up to their usual standards and we had to send our steaks back twice.  But again, to their credit, our waiter was wonderful, it was no problem at all, and they aim to please.  We have probably been to the Bronc 15 times at least, and this was the first time there were any issues whatsoever.  Also, to make things right, we were treated to one of our meals and given a piece of pie.  So, the Bronc will remain five stars for me, because the one time things weren't quite right, they did their best to make it right.  Did I mention our waiter was awesome too?  We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Well my chicken was good, guy who seated us not too friendly,  food was ok though, thought it was pricey for final bill, experience was not the best!"}
{"text":"The food is good, especially for a dive bar.  The best thing about this place is Lindsay, the server.  She is awesome.  Best service in the valley!!  They could give more options for happy hour."}
{"text":"I wish there were 10 stars if there were this place would get it.   We stopped in due to coupon from entertainment book. So glad we did.  The place is so cute and very western which I love.   I am so bad with names but our waitress was fantastic.  (Date 7-23@5:00). Very friendly went over menue with us.  We both had the burger with bacon ,fried onions.  FANTASTIC.  I will defiently be back.  Great experience."}
{"text":"We were somewhat disappointed in the food. Everyone was having pork ribs so my husband decided to order them.  They were just okay ... quality of pork was not great as a rib joint, spicy sauce just okay.  But the onion rings were very good and so was the Cole slaw.  Shrimp were not good ... breading was tasty but shrimp were terrible.  Service was great, drinks good. Overall experience was ok. Would try other menu items next time."}
{"text":"This place appears to be one of the main \"local's places\" to meet up with friends and have some food and drinks.  We've gotten very good service and there was a large selection on the menu and a decent selection of cold beers. They serve large portions and have special rotating menu items posted.  It's truly a great atmosphere especially in the bar with friendly wait staff.  My wife and I have had only good experiences so far (we've been in three times since moving here two months ago).  I think this might become our regular watering hole."}
{"text":"Tried the burgers there. Good flavor, nicely seasoned. Fries were very good also. The broaster potatoes were ok, could have been crispier (batter dipped would have been nice!). Decent atmosphere, waiting staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Super fun place. Friendly staff and crowd. I wasn't as impressed with the broasted chicken as others were, but it was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.
Western bar theme. Lots of good beers on tap. Nice menu.
Good service. Busy crowd for Saturday lunch.

Meatloaf sandwich sounds strange, but is delicious.
Will be back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Me and dad both had John Wayne burgers and they were very good! The French fries were crisp. 

Everything was good which is hard to find."}
{"text":"First Time to Saddle Bronc Grill and we WILL go back!  Great Service, Great Food, Fun Casual Atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The burger tasted like a frozen pattie and the chicken was cold.  Do not go to eat here.  The owner is rude and the place is somewhat disgusting.  If u want this type of food go to All American Sports Bar in Fountain Hills instead."}
{"text":"A group went to Saddle Bronc for a few drinks after dinner. The bar had a very friendly bartender, a good selection of beers at decent prices. 

There was a musician playing throughout the night which made it difficult to talk, but was fun to listen/watch. 

The decor is very much a Southwest style bar."}
{"text":"Had the saddle bronc burger with green chile. 

The burger was pretty good and was cooked per my order. Which if you know me, is a big deal. My only complaint is the green chile. A spoonful of the canned hatch mild added to this burger was both a waste of money ($2 something extra) and taste. As in you couldn't taste it. 

The bartender attentive and friendly. The atmosphere appropriate for a bar and the cleanliness was good. 

I'll definitely be back but I'm going to try something else.

Edit:  1-19-16. knocked a star off because of an auto tip added to receipts at our Sunday breakfast meeting. We could not find on our menu that tips were automatically added nor how many In a party trigger the auto tip.  This is the only place In Fountain hills that has added an auto tip to our Sunday breakfast checks that we've found so far. 

If the server would have mentioned the tip was already added, it would have worked better in her favor as I was planning on giving her 25%. As it was, I felt like I was being scammed.  

Breakfast plates are average at best for fountain hills.

Edit:  recently went there to meet some people for lunch and had the chicken fried steak. For the first time in my life I had a chicken fried steak I couldn't/ wouldn't eat."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting this restaurant and it was a good experience overall. The wait staff was excellent and very friendly. The food was very good... Especially the Broaster Chicken - Dark Meat...I highly recommend!! My only negative comment was it was so loud in there (music playing and voices) and we had to large parties right next to us back to back. So, just know that... But otherwise a very good experience and we will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"We came to lunch on a Sunday and the place was packed. Every TV had a football game on and you can tell this is a great place to enjoy a game. The full slab seemed a bit small for me and the serving of onion rings was also a bit small, but everything was absolutely delicious. The owner came out and met us and he is the owner of a great catering company right next to his restaurant. He is very active in his community and involved with many charities. Over all we had a blast and the food was very tasty. The decor is fun and the service was great. Our waitress was very fun and everyone was so attentive. If the servings didn't seem small I would for sure give this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"We love bbq and seek it out all over the country. This place stacks up with some of the best for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place while driving around Fountain Hills just to check out the area. It was so cute on the outside with its western theme that we decided to check it out. Boy, are we glad we did. The food was delicious. The waiters, management and owners were all very friendly. Plus, the decor was the coolest that I've seen anywhere. We will definitely make the drive back on one of their live music nights."}
{"text":"What a disappointing evening at a restaurant that used to be so reliable for good food and service.  

We were seated at a small two person table near a closet door.  We waited for fifteen minutes before finally flagging down a wait person who kindly reminded us that we missed happy hour by ten minutes.  We smiled and let her know that we have been patiently waiting for fifteen, which usually elicits an accommodation but no such luck.  

We ordered and waited and waited only to be interrupted by a flurry of activity in and out of the closet door, which must be a storage area.  We asked to move and were told that everyone was in a panic because they thought they ran out of paper for the credit card machine.  

At our new table we waited and waited ....but at least it was less busy. 

We finally got our food, ribs and chicken, very very good.  But the side of veggies were so disappointing.  They were clearly frozen chopped that you can buy in bulk then steamed.  Do yourself a favor and get a salad, you'll be better off.  

After we ate we waited fifteen mins before someone came to remove our plates.  We were told that the restaurant decided to go down to one wait person tonight and the poor lady was running ragged.  

Saddle Bronc, we hope this feedback helps you improve your service.  You had a restaurant full of aggravated diners."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Saddle Bronc Grill for the first time this weekend (picked the place because we had a Groupon), and we were both very pleasantly surprised at what a great experience it was.  When we first got in we received a friendly greeting, and were immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant.  Decor was also fun and inviting.  Next pleasant experience came when we ordered our drinks.  Price was extremely reasonable, and mixed just right (I had a jack and coke tall pour for under $6).  Finally the food.  I had the bacon burger.  Had great flavor and was incredibly filling.  My wife had the chicken wrap which she also thoroughly enjoyed.  If there were a downside, it would be the food was a little slow coming out, but we were in no hurry and enjoyed the music and atmosphere.  Had we not have already had plans we would have returned that evening for the live band.  Next trip we'll be adding Saddle Bronc Grill to our itinerary."}
{"text":"Stopped on way to casino,  glad we did. Both got the SBG burger, it was awesome.   I had the sweet potato fries and friend had regular fries.   Nice atmosphere, friendly service and great food.    There was a good singer  playing his guitar who added to the ambiance.  Diners of all ages out for a nice meal and evening.  We will be back.   Menu has a wide variety of entrees, sandwiches, salads and much more.   Larges selection of IPOs.    We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the business. Food is great and the bartender had his game on lock down. It was slammed and I didn't wait for food, drinks or a good time. First trip in Elliot at the bar was handing out high fives for a dbacks win. I highly recommend this place from open to close seven days a week."}

We had the clam chowder,  rattle snake eggs (lil on the spicy side), grilled cheese (AWESOME!), and chicken wings,  like huge,  double wings with a perfect fry. VERY impressive.  Jamie, our waitress,  was very friendly and handled the floor with ease.  
We'll come back when we're in town again :)"}

We don't have our food yet, but what I have seen looks wonderful. Huge portion."}
{"text":"Just had an great appetizer. Have been coming here for many years, various owners.  Elliot and Ha've are great bartenders.  Tonite had their deep fried pork rib tips salted and peppered appetizer were awesome. Ask for them."}

{"text":"Strap on your spurs and mosey on over to the Saddle Bronc Grill.  Pickin's can be slim in Fountain Hills for good eatin' (at least that's what the locals tell me), but this waterin' hole can be a fine alternative to traipsin' all the way to Scottsdale or further to find a good meal.  Likewise, if you'd like a change of scenery and the somewhat cooler clime of Fountain Hills, well here ya go.  It was the latter that was true for me, my wife, and a few saddle sore compadres.

What we found was a smallish eatin' place with a decent sized bar.  Lots of windows in the bar.  Not so much in the dinin' room.   A big group of 12 cow pokes took their time and we had to wait an hour for a table, though there was plenty of room in the bar if we'd opted for that.  The management was more than accommodatin' and checked with us often to make sure we were OK with waitin'.  

Speakin' of accommodatin', when we were seated one of my pardners was having a bit of trouble with his blood sugar and our server got him some food - STAT - to help him out.  His quick thinkin' probably saved the evenin' for us.  Oh, and by the way, they comp'd that extra bit of food.  Mighty neighborly.

The rest of the crew decided on meatloaf and a patty melt.  I was goin' to go for the broasted chicken, since it's been a good number of years since I've had it.  At the last minute I changed my mind and opted for the ribs.  I'm pretty particular about ribs as I've had some really good batches.  It's kinda my personal test of a restaurant that offers 'em.  If they can get the ribs right they're worth a second visit.

Well, times a wastin' so here's the score.  The meatloaf got high marks from my two compadres.  They said they would have it again.  My wife told me the patty melt was \"OK, but nothing special.\"  Well, what do you expect?  It's a patty melt.  The ribs?  Well, the sauce (I ordered the sweet rather than spicy variety) was tasty if not earth shatterin'.  The ribs themselves, though, we're so tender I never touched my knife or bothered to get my hands greasy.  I just poked them with my fork and the meat fell away from the bone.  Pretty tasty too.  I would probably rate it a 7 on my 1-10 Taste-o-meter.

I will be returning to the Saddle Bronc Grill again.  If for nothing else to try the broasted chicken.  Heck, I'm smackin' my lips just thinkin' about it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service but rather expensive. Was very busy when we went.  Bar chairs uncomfortable. Waitress was excellent and kept good tabs on us."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back from hiking at McDowell. Everything was so good, the service, the food. The ribs do fall of the bones, the pulled pork sandwich was tasty. The owner stopped by our table to chat bit and the waitress did all she could to cater our 9 year old twins. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"First time here. We'll be back often. Broasted chicken fantastic. The bar is fun. Barmaid was fun and very nice. They have ice on the bar ledge with horseshoe coasters to keep drinks and their many beers cold."}
{"text":"Service is not good. People who came in after us have finished their food and we have not been served"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a very busy Saturday, due to the Fountain Hills Arts & Craft Show. The place was packed, but only waited about ten minutes for a table. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The interior of the bar of  is of course a western theme, and reminded me of similar bars in Prescott...and that's a good thing! The food is very good, and the portions very generous. We shared the homemade Spinach and Artichoke dip, and it was great! My Ruben Sandwich was delicious, and came with piping hot french fries. The other meals were salads, and were more then either of the people I was with could finish. It's also a bit of a sports bar, with several TV's playing over the bar. Not a quiet place for sure, but its a western bar, not supposed to be! Wouldn't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place for what it is.  Food is great, service is great, live music some nights - great fun.  Mountain views from the window tables.  Just really fun.  Fountain Hills can be a bit boring but this place kicks it up a notch.  Broasted chicken is excellent.  Mashed potatoes remind me of the Colonel's from years back!  If you get mac n cheese get the homemade, the regular side is just Kraft (confessed by our waitress).  

Maybe we are getting older but we love Fountain Hills these days.  Saddle Bronc is one more reason to come up through the pass."}
{"text":"My last time here is the last with a smart ass bartender who like to insult people with average service I'm out ! they did great the first time and fell short at best every since now I would eat and drink before you get to fountain hills"}
{"text":"The bartender is great. Hustler, he should be managing the joint...the service for the actual restaurant...sucked ass!  Make sure you don't come too hungry cause you'll be waiting a while...food was moderate for most of our party, they ordered burgers and pulled pork special, I ordered broasted pork chop...stick to the burger and save some $"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary, but decent wings and good broasted chicken, cold beer, friendly folks."}
{"text":"Stopped there on a motorcycle ride.  They were slammed with 100 Bikers hitting them at one time but they quickly took care of everyone and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great place great service and great food. The bar is a cool place to hang out and grab a drink they have draft beers some craft brews and standard miller, Coors, wine, cocktails. Menu consist of burgers, salads, steaks, etc. The dining room isn't very big but there's plenty of pub tables around the bar. The food isn't out of the world but if your looking for a place that isn't a Chilis, Applebee's, then this is your place. Their deserts pies are excellent brought in from an outside place in AZ."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy eating at this restaurant.  The food was always pretty good.  But on December 15, 2016 we had a really bad experience with the restaurant.  I even contacted the restaurant by a bear contact us on the website and I got a form email back promising they would get back to me.   Well it's been two months and have sent them another email and got no response.

We arrived at the restaurant at 8:45 PM.  According to their website and everything else the restaurant was open late for dinner.  I've seen other people's review saying they had dinner at 10 PM,  I think they probably need to look at their watch because I doubt that the restaurant ever serves pass 8:30 PM.

I was looking forward to getting a nice dinner.   We showed up at the restaurant and we sat at the bar,  and we ordered a beer,  and I asked for a food menu when I ordered my beer.   The bartender then served our beers,  and then said if you want food go to McDonald's.   I was floored at his sarcastic attitude.   I would've given a rating of zero fight could've.  Giving them a rating of one given the bartender's attitude is very generous.

To make matters worse the bartender and one of the servers after we were about halfway through our beer (and I don't drink very fast) shared a plate of food right in front of us.

We paid our bill and walked out.  I went back to the Marriott at McDowell Mountain,  and we had a great meal at the bar.

So if you're looking for good service and a friendly atmosphere don't go to the saddlebroncgrill!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and just stumbled upon the Saddle Bronc Grill and I loved it.  They had 20+ beers on tap, with some local favorites.  I had the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwhich, with the sweet potato fries and it was excellent.  The best part was the bartender, Javier.  OMG, I haven't laughed so hard in a really long time.  My favorite beer was the Moose Drool, out of Montana.  If I'm in the area, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Jamie was an excellent server!  Made sure I enjoyed my meal!  I ordered the breasted chicken and had the martini potato - I'll be back!  My cousin said the clam chowder was to die for!"}
{"text":"We loved everything about the Saddle Bronc Grill from the friendly waitresses to the wide-range selection of food. We were given the off the menu selection from previous night specials. The food was brought promptly and cooked perfectly. On Wednesdays the have a fresh Canadian Walleye special, Friday fish fry and Saturday Prime Rib special. All in all, a great find in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly shocked how good the food was here considering its a western bar. The meatloaf is to live for! Apparently there is an 83 year old man who goes in everyday just to make the meatloaf. Yummm"}
{"text":"Thank you Barb and Brad. I think it's commendable that you answered Yelps reviews. It shows good business sense and that you care. I will be back for sure. We did like the atmosphere and we thought that it was clean bright and we were comfortable. We will come again. The food review was of course is totally subjective. Sorry but the service was not that good. The only time someone visited our table was when we flagged them down."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good!  I have never had fish tacos ..... 
My husband and I now have a favorite Tuesday night affair.  It is the special and I will never have fish tacos anywhere else.  These are SUPREME. The other food is also tasty and the service has always been ok."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesomeness!!! I was in this town visiting from San Diego,Ca and saw this little place to eat. I like trying out small no big name places. I will say the food is by far the best I have ever had! I go out to eat a lot and out of all the places I have been I would rank this at the top of my list!  Great food and great service. Its all around a happy humble place. They have TVs everywhere so for the guys its great! Sports,news.... Awesome! Try the martini potatoes!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Reliable friendly service with a lot of good beers. The broasted chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy are a must have. Decent prices and Javier rocks. He is super friendly and funny and sometimes performs a little magic. Literally."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers on tap. Food is good. Not a large place but has some good views of the mountains and the fountain."}
{"text":"The five stars are because of Havy!  Brian is not so nice ut luckily Havy makes up for him!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on 7/5/17 @ approx. 7:30 pm.  On the way to seating my husband and I, I stopped to review the special board which clearly listed walleye and prime rib sliders

We both decided on the  sliders after I told my husband what they specials were.  We clearly told our waitress what we wanted and she took our orders. What arrived was pork sliders with cole slaw. 

We immediately told the server guy the one with the man bun the error and he took one plate to the kitchen to see what could be done. He returned with the waitress telling us that the cook said there was no prime rib around and both the server and waitress insisted prime rib was only on Sunday. I proceeded to walk them back to the board and had to point out the sliders to them and they were both in shock but still insisted there was no prime rib. 

We had no interest in wanting pork but being a diabetic I needed to eat.  So I made do and so did my husband. 

To console us they brought us 2 free pieces of corn bread and charged us for the meal. Still insisting there were no prime rib sliders but leaving it on the special board. 

This is our second bad experience there. First time we waited almost an hour for our walleye and no excuse and or apology offered.  

We will not return again.  Such poor disorganized service"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar located in Fountain Hills. 

I knew of this place for a long time but never had a chance to come in until recently.

They have live music on weekend and the musician was pretty good with keyboard, violin and trombone.

Staff was friendly, service got slow but they were packed and busy.  Fellow customers were very friendly too. We ended up chatting with some of them.

They have over 10 TVs playing different sports. Great beer selection and surprisingly good wine selection being a sports bar.

Food was good, it wasn't great but good and went well with IPA."}
{"text":"This place has a great beer selection. Wish we were a bit more hungry. But the food was great!! We did wait a little bit for the food to come out... I think it was because of my dads ribs. We will be here again if we can."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. Lots of beer selections.  The bar staff was very friendly and greeted us immediately even though the bar was pretty full. A manager came up and let us taste test some beers they were deciding on which my husband thought was the cats meow. We had the spinach artichoke dip, yum! I had the broasted chicken which was pretty good and my husband had a full rack of baby back ribs which he said were the best ribs he's had in three years! He said they fell off the bone and he was able to get both the spicy and sweet BBQ sauce. We enjoyed our time here. Not a fancy place but good food, nice waitstaff, and about six good sized TVs at the bar. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is totally fun, happy and has great entertainment. The broasted Chicken, Cole Slaw , mashed potatoes reminded me of my childhood...simply fabulous. Met the owners Barb and Brad, makes you feel like one of the family."}
{"text":"Just had the most disappointing meal ever! I ordered the fish and chips, which I have had in the past and was delicious. I asked the waitress if they were beer battered. She said yes. Not only were they not beer battered, this fish was so dry it was inedible. She offered me something else, so I ordered a Reuben sandwich. It took over 15 minutes to get! When I finally flagged down our waitress, I told her to just wrap the sandwich to go. When she brought it out, she said she had told the cook to put it up first but he didn't. Still for the life of me can't understand the delay in getting a simple sandwich out of the kitchen in less than 15 minutes. I felt that the least she could do was comp my meal, but that didn't happen. At least the person I was with got their meal in a somewhat timely fashion. Not sure what's going on, but you can bet I'm not returning to find out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at this restaurant many times, for the most part the food is very good. When we sit in the dining area, we have wonderful service. Tonight is the second time we sat at a high top bar table and was assigned the same waiter, Steve H. Same thing happened previously as this evening. We sat down at the  table and he took our drink and food order and then we never received our waters after 10 minutes my husband had to go the hostess for waters. The kitchen brought out food and we did not have any silverware, my husband had to ask the hostess for silverware. My husband had to return to the hostess two other times for refills as well as to order our dessert. The only time the waiter came by our table was to bring us the check. The check had a beer on it which we did not order. My husband had to track down the waiter in the restaurant to tell him we did not order a beer and he said he would change it. Again, this is the second time this is happened with the same waiter over the past 4 months. Terrible service at the high top section."}
{"text":"Great decor, the food was good! The brownie sundae was amazing!! Big enough to split. Tons of GOOD beers on tap! A lot of tvs- bar area and a separate dining area. The owner was walking around talking with people and helping out the staff. It was a great experience and will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"The Broasted Chicken is AMAZING!  Well worth the price.  It was the nightly special, so 2 bucks less than the menu price.  I ordered the 4-piece; a breast, thigh, drumstick, and a wing.  I can say this is the BEST Broasted ( fried ) chicken I have had in years."}
{"text":"Not our favorite place. Food is just OK.  Be sure to watch your bill as the Happy Hour prices are never right, sent the bill back and it came back different but still not correct. Gave up trying to get the bill right."}
{"text":"We just moved to Fountain Hills a few months ago...youngish professionals who moved here from Chandler.

Saddle Bronc has become our go-to dinner place.

Steaks are really excellent and we are very picky about steak. Also love the quesadilla and shrimp margarita...and the super yummy poblano mashed potatoes.

Service is fantastic..very friendly. Owner is very inviting and always stops by to ask how we are doing.

And live music Fri nights..sometimes Sat too.

Love this place! Tip: sit at one of the high tops in bar area..very festive and fun."}
{"text":"Poor food and inattentive service. Décor was uninviting. Would not recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Friendly place, excellent comfort food. My favorite is the fried chicken dinner. It's a great version of an American classic."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner while out for a ride because of Yelp reviews. I was under pressure by my group to pick a good place...and this was not disappointing! Other patrons recommended the broasted chicken and wowzers was it tasty!!! Perfectly cooked, crunchy and juicy. Total finger licking goodness. Meatloaf was tasty and would order again and another in our party ordered the ribs and was very pleased. Enjoyed the live music, good service and great food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's really fun!  However, the mac & cheese side - really folks?  It's Krafft from the box - which I actually like - but you are watering it down now, so it doesn't even taste cheesy - PLUS - you are charging an extra 2 bucks for it?  Really!  You 4 owners are better than this!  Come on now!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Good atmosphere and good food. Friday live music. Saturday prime rib is superb. My wife love the bbq chicken. Overall I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"First timers. Great food.  Great band tonight. Great service (thank you Laura!). My wife and I will definitely be back. 

WELL DONE SADDLE BRONC!!"}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant and a very friendly staff. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had....I also recommend the enchilada dip."}
{"text":"I give this place a big \"meh.\" It was okay and that's about it. Your typical bar and grill. When we walked in, it was SO LOUD. I can't decide if it was the acoustics or just the particular people there that night, but it was almost unbearable. 

It's not too pricey and there are a good amount of options. The menu isn't huge which I appreciate, but no vegetarian options (the name probably suggests that anyway). I ordered the fish and chips. The fries were actually awesome. The fish was a little chewy and not as crisp as I generally expect for fish and chips. My boyfriend had the chicken fried steak - he said it was good. 

Probably a good place if you're just getting drinks and you can handle the noise. Overall, a \"just okay\" place for me."}
{"text":"This place has awesome service and great drinks! Came here many times for work events and was never disappointed. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"In the remote Fountain Hills vicinity? Love to eat red meat in a rootin'-tootin' Western type joint? Enjoy live music?

Yes? Well, then I suggest you high-tail it down to this local honky tonk watering hole.

Steaks are by far the must-have of the menu. Their chili is killer too.

Service is very friendly and patient. Oh, and check out the bar stools along the bar. They are leather saddles - very nice touch."}
{"text":"After a little too much wine during the Oscar's, I really needed a great burger, and found it here. The John Wayne burger was great; tasty, moist, and big!! Fries were great also. I feel much better now"}
{"text":"Updated review -
Back in Fountain Hills with my sister visiting Grandma.  Decided to eat-in after talking to Barb (owner) to see what I was missing.
Amazing decision!  
Excellent steak and meatloaf.  As suggested, I mixed the Mac and cheese with their chili and it was spectacular.
Lyndsie (sp?) the waitress did a great job taking care of us and making sure our bar orders were always filled quickly.  Can't wait to come back.
---------
Whenever I visit Fountain Hills, I take my grandma out to dinner.  Tonight she was feeling tired, and in the mood for a Rueben, so I searched for a local place that would make our corned beef sandwiches.
The takeout process was easy, and the Ruebens were excellent.  We'd get them again.  The rattlesnake eggs appetizer was suggested and it was okay (fried balls of potato with a ranch dipping  sauce)."}
{"text":"We headed here due to a buy one get one free Entertainment Book coupon. What a cute restaurant with rustic charm but very clean and well kept.  I believe it was the owner, Lou who came by several times to check on us and he even out on a kids TV station for my toddler. The food was delicious and they have healthy options which is important to me. I had the Sante Fe Chicken with steamed veggies and they accommodated my request for no butter/oil. The veggies were steamed and seasoned perfectly. My mom had a paddy melt that looked amazing!  

They run specials every night so check their website. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I was disappointed with my salad and entree. 
The salad was wilted and was starving for water. The honey mustard dressing was really thick. I had the cowboy prime rib with two sides: the salad was one of them and a baked potato which was literally a baked potato with only sour cream and nothing else. The baked potato wasn't rubbed with oil and/or seasoning, cooked just plain, right out of the sack. 
The prime rib was thick and the first couple days f bites from the edge was salty, but the majority of the prime rib was cooked and tasted okay. All that was included was the horse radish and no au jus. My wife had the broasted chicken with two sides and she enjoyed her meal.
After all that, we still will patronize this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars as I've been here under the previous ownership and it was excellent.   However,  our experience this evening was highly unexceptional which took off three stars.  

The waitress, whoh didnt even bother to giver her name or welcome us dumped a good amount of water on the table and never bother to clean it.  This also helped in soaking the menus.  Quite frankly, she was rude.  But perhaps I could cut her some slack as the live \"entertainment\" was so loud that no one person could hear the other.  I am a musician and am well aware as to the proper level music should be for that size of  venue.  Disgusted, we left.  This was all too bad as the place used to be quite good.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"We were browsing options for dinner in the Fountain Hills area and were deciding between one of the numerous Italian restaurants here or \"The cowboy place.\" The cowboy place won! 

Saddle Bronc Grill looks like an old school saloon, with wood paneled walls, cowboy paraphernalia, and other Western style elements. The menu offers burgers, sandwiches, broasted chicken, and various steak dishes (To name a few). 

We entered the restaurant to be greeted warmly by one of the servers (In charge of the bar seating area) and we were free to sit wherever we wanted. We chose an area off to the side for sit down service and the server that greeted us said Brenda would be with us shortly.

Well... It turns out Brenda thought it would be better to clear every single dirty table and then completely ignore us even though we were sitting in her section and were the only ones sitting down in her area. The gentleman who initially greeted us saw we had been waiting and decided to make up for it by taking our orders and serving us instead. As we waited for our orders I noticed more people trickling in and sitting at tables right next to us. Brenda decided to stop her random dilly dallying and thumb twiddling to hurry on over, take their orders right away and provide speedy service to them. Hmmm... Throughout our whole dining experience here she continued to chat with the other tables and pass by us but then act as if our table didn't even exist. I might be paranoid, but I get the sense she flat out refused to serve our table when we sat down and the bar server had to serve us instead. 

Anyways, I ordered the special for the day, the prime rib. I ordered it \"cowgirl size\" (About $19 I think) but they also had a bigger \"cowboy size\". When it came out it was a giant portion despite it being the smaller size, and a thick cut of meat. I requested it medium rare and it came out just as ordered. It was a great deal for less than $20. It wasn't the most tender prime rib I've had but hey what do you expect for such a great price. The sides I got were a baked potato and vegetables. The baked potato was good, it's hard to mess up a baked potato after all. The steamed vegetables tasted institutional, it looked like the kind of stuff you might get from the freezer section at the grocery store, and had a weird artificial butter taste to them. 

Overall the food is OK, and aside from the rude server that we were supposed to have, our actual server and the friendly server that brought our food to us provided us good service.

EDIT 10/18/16: The manager messaged me about my review and apologized for our experience saying there was a miscommunication about who was supposed to be serving our table. Upgrade to 3.5/5."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the BEST spot in Fountain Hills. The staff is amazing and the food is always great! We have been here twice now and will be coming back again and again. Our server Lynsey was on top of everything and when our food came she told us she would take our 9 month old so we could eat. You just don't find that kind of hospitality these days. Saddle Bronc grill has my vote and I would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great bar area with many taps in a town known for its geriatric population. Beer selection is pretty good, but when I asked for Yuengling, knowing it would not be available, the waitress gave me a blank look. A minor flaw. They did have Moose Drool.  The food is pricey but well done. And I am told their prime rib specials are great and the line goes out the door for seating when that is on the menu. 
The setting is painfully urban, but that is what one expects in this part of central AZ.  
I will likely go back, and rub elbows with all those AARP members."}
{"text":"First time eating at the Saddle Bronc Grill and it was delicious. My family really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The good: Best beer selection in FH: 30 taps and only about 5 big domestics. Great local and US craft beers you'd be hard pressed to find in almost any other bar in the Valley.

The Bad: No beer list??! This is NOT the way to either sell beer or serve the customer. Unless you want to make the server or barkeep rattle off 30 beers, the only way to see what they have is to walk over to the taps, standing behind patrons seated at the bar and squint at the often obscure tap handles.

There should be more & bigger TVs (one idea - get rid of the huge \"Pendelton Whisky\" sign and put more TVs there.  The SoundBoxes are nice but you have to ask for them - they're hidden in back.

Javier (aka, \"Haahvee\") is friendly & obviously well-liked by most, but not efficient and is often over-worked/inconsistent.  Especially on Tuesdays, they should have another bartender.  He can't keep up, and you'll see him glad-handing and quickly serving some customers while others wait.  He often forgets orders, etc.  Also, should bring an itemized receipt instead of just the total.  He disappears for literally 10 minutes at a time (another patron at the bar said he was probably actually cooking food), meanwhile, the entire bar's worth of customers have empty drinks/dirty plates, waiting to order/pay, etc., etc.

If I was the owner, I'd realize he is costing me revenue & repeat business at the expense of bigger tips for himself.

Fish tacos are great but need salsa and/or hot sauce.

NO WIFI???!?!?  AND CELL PHONES BASICALLY DON'T WORK IN HERE - POOR COVERAGE.

It's a shame - this place should be doing about 2-3x as well as it is..."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon from way back that had lost the promotional value.  Still got our original $12 off.  The burger my husband ordered was big and juicy.  I had the half brisket/half bbq sandwich on a hoagie roll.  It was pretty good but left me wishing I had ordered a burger.  The fries were standard ff like other restaurants.  The beer was cold and the service by the bartender was nice.  He was very attentive on a Friday afternoon.  We would return again when we are in the area to try other things."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while so when friend came to town, we went here for lunch.  I ordered a patty melt and my friends ordered the fish and chips.  The coleslaw was pretty good but the patty melt was just ok, not seasoned well really no taste. Just blah blah blah, but then after about a few hours when I got home I got sick to my stomach, and was told I had eaten meat which was bad.  So I have not been back - Getting sick from eating out is not a good thing.   But they have lots of tv so if you are a sports fan place to go just don't eat the meat."}
{"text":"Great place to relax & enjoy food and beverages. Broasted chicken is outstanding but everything ordered has been very good. Bar area seating is recommended if you want to watch any of the televised sports events."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was excellent. I took my mother there for lunch with a groupon and there were no issues. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was great. Atmosphere was fun and the service was good. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Broasted chicken is THE BEST! Only have gotten take-out so can't comment on atmosphere. Highly recommend the rattlesnake bites appetizer! Mashed potatoes & gravy are really good, too."}
{"text":"My wife and I go there regularity with and without friends for a fast and reasonably priced good quality dinner.
Te broasted chicken ( yes, broasted) is a must try if you have never had it before. 
The ribs just fall off the bone...delicious.
The dinner salad is great. Lots of stuff in it.  
Chile...excellent. 
The drinks are all good. 
TVs in the dining room. 
Everything is fairly priced, good size portions. Friendly staff. 
I gave it 5 stars because it is just what it is. A nice, casual place to have dinner when you don't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"Would have given five star but service was horrible ... Forgot everything .. We had to ask for our chips and salsa.. I didn't get my salad and took forever and there was not anyone here! Food was amazing ! Will come back in evening ... Maybe service will be better"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars based on the food alone. I had the ribs and their texture was awesome. I'm talking cliche falling off the bone delicious. They also had a nice little subtle spice to them. I'm also a big fan of the poblano mashed potatoes.

The extra star, however, is for the owner. He came out after our meal was finished to see how our food was and spent about 10 minutes having a nice conversation with my party of 6. I'm sure he had other things he could have rushed off and done, but his personal touch really meant a lot. It's not something you see much anymore outside of ultra-high class restaurants."}
{"text":"Some of the best service in a restaurant I've had in a while. The gentleman at the door made everyone feel welcome and thanked many people he passed on his way though the restaurant.

The food was top notch, I had the meatloaf and it was filling. Served exactly as you would expect.

Stop by if you can!

I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place can be a little off putting if you have never been here before. I am not a country girl or a cowgirl haha. Once the staff approaches you they are friendly and kind, they make you feel at home even though you might not fit in with the decor. The food is AMAZING!! I know this is going to sound crazy.. but I got the grill cheese with Ham, it was epic. It was so good with dripping cheese and ham. Perfect portions. I highly recommend trying it. It's worth the drive and I don't even like grill cheese so this is saying a lot! I will keep coming back and eating grill cheese! This restaurant is awesome and welcomes everyone. I promise you won't regret it if you give it a try!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal and evening here Friday night.  Service was perfect...staff very friendly and didn't make us feel rushed.  Good food at a very fair price....would recommend and definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've not had better \"broaster\" chicken yet! Good service, fun atmosphere!
Worth a try!"}
{"text":"The bartender, Javier, was awesome!  Funny and very nice.  Food was really good!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great little place! We stopped in for lunches weekend, and the food and service were great. We ordered a few things and everything was great. I had a salad (it was gigantic!) and was able to try the meatloaf and hamburger... all were great. Can't wait to try the chicken next time!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Saddle Bronc on a Sunday, choosing it for the primary reason that it is one of the very few places that are open late on Sunday.  And by late I mean 10:00 PM.  Fountain Hills is a sleepy town that rolls up its streets very early.

The location was familiar to us; we've been there through probably every iteration since they built it. Another thing about Fountain Hills is that very few restaurants survive for long.  Of those that have occupied this site it seems Saddle Bronc has latched on to a good game plan ... basic homestyle cooking and a friendly local bar with several TV's tuned to sports.  It's hard to go wrong with that agenda.

We got there about 8:00 PM and the place was reasonably busy.  Fortunately they have a dining room that is physically separated a bit from the noisy bar area.  The overall ambience was friendly and more-or-less local (considering the high percentage of part-time residents in Fountain Hills).

My choice for dinner was a BLT. Why? Because it sounded good and I wasn't super hungry.  The sandwich was plain-jane looking when place before me and my expectations were for it to be pretty bland but I was surprised.  Despite being on the small side considering the price it ranked as one of the better BLT's I've had. I'm not sure what gave it the unique tangy flavor, my guess is that they mix something in with the mayo, but I would definitely order it again.  The cole slaw likewise had a kick to it that made it better than average.

At one point a guy who I assume is the owner came over to the table. He was pretty friendly.  Our waitress was friendly too.  As was another woman who works there.  If you're searching for a place to eat right now and \"friendly\" is one of the important deciding points for you, Saddle Bronc may be your best choice.  Did I mention that they're really friendly?"}
{"text":"This place is great. I go often. But the other day I had the Reuben sandwich. I can honestly say it was the best Reuben I have ever had. Really good juicy fresh. Can't wait to have another one."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to like about this place.  Has an authentic old small western town saloon feel to it - and not in a touristy way.  Very cool vibe and everyone is so friendly.  No, jolly.  Jolly is a better word.  Food is great, I love their steaks."}
{"text":"Good Food,  fun decor and good service.. Javier behind the bar can serve you a frosty tall one from the 20+ draft beers they have on tap.  Sit at the bar and keep your beer cold on the frozen chill rail built into the bar.. what the heck.. if you behave.. you just might get a small snowball fight going.. I mean very small... TACO TUESDAYS Rock !  Broasted Chicken,  Great Burgers and BBQ with a
 friendly staff.. My wife and I have been going there about once a week for months now.. getting to be a habit.. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Morgan are there and ready to greet you, thank you for your business and answer questions.. Where else do you see that ?"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, really cool decor. Came here w a large party from out of town and we were starving. The food portions were large, food was really good. Only giving 3 stars because 3 of us ordered the \"broasted chicken\" and it was served late after everyone was done eating our food came out. If there was an issue w the preparation of the chicken it would hv been nice to be given the option of changing the order or i feel our meal should hv been discounted for the wait and inconvenience. I would def come here again but i would never order the broasted chicken"}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab dinner on our way home from Greer.  Looked it up online and checked the hours and it said they were open.  Came in to order food and the kitchen was closed.  Bummer.  Bartender was nice anyways.  I guess call ahead to make sure the kitchen is still open... regardless of what it says on the internet."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and it was great! Portions were generous, service great, cool atmosphere! Clearly a favorite for the locals and I can see why. Will definitely return for more options off this menu."}
{"text":"Saddle Bronc is one of my Fountain Hills favorites!  They have a very hearty grilled chicken breast salad if you're looking for something light and healthy and if you want a home-cooked feel meal, you can't go wrong with their meatloaf dinner or ribs.  Walleye dish is good too.  Their selection of tap beers is top notch and it's always ice cold. You want to try a place with good ambiance, great food, great drinks and get treated like family then you need to try the Saddle Bronc.  Also a great place to watch your favorite team regardless of what season!  They will accommodate you and make sure you can watch your game while enjoying food and drink."}
{"text":"Saddle Bronc Grill is located in Fountain Hills. If you happen to be around here and want good bbq, stop on by to get a very hardy meal. We stopped on the way back from Salt River Tubing/kayaking. We had lunch but it might as well been dinner. 

Each entree was huge enough to have leftovers. My BLT was loaded with bacon enough to make two sandwiches. It came with choice of sides or premium sides such as sweet potatoes fries/onion rings for $2 charge. It was also accompanied by two different style pickles. It was delish!

Their John Wayne cheese burger was also excellent. It didn't have any sauces so you can add your own mayonnaise, ketchup, or mustard to your liking. 

Overall, very good meal, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Above-average food, friendly service. It gets noisy especially around the bar area. If you want to enjoy your food and still be able to have a conversation with your companion without screaming, request a table away from the bar...especially around happy hour time. The prices are reasonable and the food portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here while visiting Fountain Hills on a Saturday. I had a chicken sandwich that would warrant a five star rating, but the overall experience really was only mediocre. We arrived shortly before noon and there were only a couple of parties there. We were seated right away and shortly after our waitress came and took our order. Just two sandwiches a soda and an iced tea. An hour later we finally got our meal. It was pitifully slow. The French fries were the ones that have some kind of coating on them. Some people like them I'm sure, but neither my husband nor I like them at all. So overall, one really good sandwich, an incredibly slow kitchen and fries that didn't meet our expectations."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner. Made a reservation that we arrived early for. We were told our table was not ready. There was no place to sit in the bar to wait except a reserved table. They did clean off part of the bar in a corner & eventually brought us drinks. Our table took at least 20 minutes over our reservation time. The table they gave us was wedged in the corner where we had to split up to sit comfortably. Then had to almost shout at each other to be heard. When our food came it was quite good. When we requested our first drink to be on the house because they were late & we were stuffed in a corner because they had given our table away, we were refused. Then once the bill came which was just over $90. I paid with a $100 bill. I never received any change but when the waitress came back, she handed us another bill for the bar drinks. She never brought any change, but just assumed I was tipping her. Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place sucks! We told the waitress when we got there we had limited time due to an important Mayo appointment.  We sat at the bar and watched while a couple that came after us got served and it got later and later. Finally after speaking up, she said 
she would check. We also had a to-go order that included 4 breasts ( which upon checking later was only 1 breast  and  some legs, etc.) so needless to say, we had to box up our lunches and hit the road. The fact that I had ordered the special of the day and watched it served to the folks that came after us when I get it  more than 20 minutes later just make it suck more! Yes we did order the chicken to go which yes I know, takes 20 minutes to cook... But to wait  over 45 minutes sipping a shit#y watered down coke and then paying for food that we had no time to eat and also paying for food that I did not correctly get, I would love to send you the tab! But hey, thanks for actually putting our food order in when you remembered NOT putting it in when we gave it! And yup, we noticed!"}
{"text":"I went for a motorcycle ride and stopped by this place to get some chow and a beer. We were first ones in and the place was pretty dead but the bartender was ready to go. He was I'm a good mood getting us drinks, country music playing... I ordered the bacon cheese burger and it was bomb diggity! The fries that came with it was just as good! I had a hard time only having a few beers cause it was just a free of us but the vibe was great! I'll def be making a stop here whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I actually worked here for a short time when I moved from Kentucky. It was brand new and the staff was so friendly! I found pretty quickly serving wasn't for me, but that happens. Javier was the most fun! He is such a friendly character and it's definitely better to visit when he's around.(: the owners are super friendly and accommodating when they can be. I still take people here when I know they enjoy good home cooked food. Especially my family when they're in from Kentucky. My favorite thing is the chili and cornbread. The cornbread is so delicious it is close to cake! The stuffed poblano also was delicious...not sure if it's still around. I can't say enough great things. Oh, an the view and bar are fantastic as well (;"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, the reason is the extremely boring and limited menu.  I am not really clear how they stay open, since there is nothing appetizing to offer.  I guess if I were 75+ and looking for a bland early bird special this might fit the bill.

The menu used to offer a better variety, and maybe things have changed in the past couple months but they lost me after the last couple tries."}
{"text":"The was my first visit ... and my last, sorry to say.  Our waitress was very discombobulated, very tardy in getting to us for our drink and meal orders, very unpleasant ... acted like she was in a contest to take our order the quickest, not really even looking us in the eye, just her notepad ... when questions were asked, she still stared at her notepad to take the order.  The food was very mediocre ... maybe just off the Sysco truck.  There are plenty of better restaurants in this darling town."}
{"text":"My parents and I went here on Valentines Day with a coupon. It was busy with the holiday but we had great food and Laurie was great making sure we always had what we needed. We got free flowers and my steak was huge and perfect. Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stopping at this restaurant by chance after doing some bumping around in FH.  This is a pretty cool establishment.  When you walk in, there is a feel of a country western establishment.  At about 4pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't packed, but it certainly wasn't empty.  There were quite a few people in there.  

My friend and I were quickly seated in the bar area at one of the high tops.  I quickly noticed the selection of beer on tap and ordered a yummmmy Kilt Lifter from 4 Peaks. 

For dinner, my friend ordered the Buzzard Wings.  I ordered the Patty Melt.  When our food came out, I immediately saw that the Patty Melt was on Rye bread.  I dislike Rye Bread.  I realized I didn't look at the description of the sandwhich.  Before I could even get out that I didn't see it on the menu, the server said, we can do it over with whatever bread you want.  Of course,  I thanked her for quickly getting me out Patty Melt on sourdough bread instead.  Both of these items on the menu were yummy to me.  The wings cooked in the broaster have a delicious unique taste to them.  I highl recommend these wings to anyone.  My Patty melt was also very delicious and savory.

I enjoyed myself at this restaurant even though it is in F.H.  I would see myself going back to this place.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"With family, went here for my wife's birthday. The place was a little loud when we got in, but it was a nice atmosphere (after 1/2 hour it quieted down a little). Our server was friendly, personable, and on top of everything. Everyone enjoyed their meal, and all of the servers came out and sang happy birthday to my wife. We were impressed, and we'll definitely be back. 

PS - you might want to call ahead and make sure they don't have a poker night or something else scheduled. We tried visiting a week beforehand, and the place was packed!"}
