{"text":"The best diner ever in the markham/thornhill area. From the chopped steak and scrambled egg breakfast, too the mushroom and swiss burger. Eighty eight is truly one of the best family diners out. The lady always makes sure you're taken care of and brings fresh fruit to you at the end of your dinner meal at no charge. Thank you guys so much"}
{"text":"WOW Delicious, Cheap, and fast.  The salads and soups are fresh and you can tell the home made gravy is a killer."}
{"text":"Excellent service and an appetizing meal.  The server behind the counter greeted the guests warmly and the regulars who came in were welcomed by their first name."}
{"text":"Kind of a hidden gem. I would rate the food at 3.5 stars, it's always consistent and simple. I'm a breakfast person and their breakfast is on point! I've also had their lunch specials and their homemade soups are great. Yes it's not the fancy \"School\" or \"Mildred's\" but I still like it for the mom and pop feel! Service is great and friendly, so they get 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Just ran my first ever 10k early morning so decided to get some yummy breakfast food close to home. We came across this place in our search and wanted to give it a try. Upon entering, a lady greeted us so nicely and apologized as she was with another customer so she let us seat ourselves. This place was busy and customers knew the owners. I can see why. They have all day breakfast and other delicious menu items. I got the poached eggs with corned beef hash and I asked to have hollandaise sauce on top as I saw a picture on this app. We also ordered a regular eggs benedict. It was quite good. Very pleased. What made it was the friendliness of the staff. The lady was so energetic and friendly! It was mothers day and she gave a flower to every mom! I would definitely come back and try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Very, very \"home style\" restaurant. As in, I could make the same level quality at home, but I could come here instead if I'm feeling lazy. However, considering that the prices are pretty standard/average to other breakfast restaurants, I'd rather go somewhere else where the food quality is much better than anything I could make at home."}
{"text":"The first time i came here was in 2012 bro i been messing with eighty8. Let me tell you this, if you're into diner food at a fair price and GREAT service this is where you wanna go. Bring your friends, family, date or whatever. Nice relaxed atmosphere, old TV, old bar, none of that matters. Get the hollywood sandwich, corn beef n hash, or the mushroom burger, i can vouch for those. This spot blows away wimpys and all those chain diners. Home is where the heart is and the eighty8 family makes you feel welcomed , and if you can't appreciate that . .   Go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The biggest surprise about this place is that it has survived...this location has seen several restaurants come and go over the past three years...this restaurant has however been here for over a eighteen months now...which is a formidable achievement. It is your average local neighbourhood \"greasy spoon\"...food is good...place is clean...staff are nice...and it has survived!"}
{"text":"Nice Dinner, really friendly staff. Great food....the fries are fresh cut, and amazing."}
{"text":"The cafe is larger than expected from the outside   It's a little dark and dingy inside and to be honest quite dirty looking   Ordered the steak and eggs and it was very peppery, home fries a little underdone   Poached eggs were good however   Bathrooms full of crap they are storing and again dirty   Free wifi .... Great  Service .... Ok  Venue .... Crap"}
{"text":"A classic greasy spoon in a strip mall. Good coffee, good eggs and great bacon.    The family run atmosphere is great.  It shines in ever aspect of the service.     If you want a fast, cheap and good quality breakfast give eighty8 a shot."}
{"text":"A really wonderful family restaurant. The food is very delicious ans inexpensive! I come here very often, usually for breakfast and the atmosphere is great. Very kid and family friendly, but also great to come on a date or with friends. The staff is amazing, especially Sheila and Victor. Super friendly and just an overall great experience. I definitely recommend this restaurant.   Some favourites - Fish and Chips - Mushroom Swiss Burer - Hot and Sour soup - Wonton Soup - Mini Combo (get their chocolate chip pancakes) - Mediterranean Burger  Always a good idea to support local business such as this wonderful place.  Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service!  Coffee was always full, the breakfast again was great and you cannot beat the value!"}
{"text":"I live on John Street and have been going here for take out and eat in for years.  Service is good, (Breakfast )Food quality is okay  About a year ago the old chef left and they are using someone from the family.  Anyhow food quality has been getting worse and worse every week.   We keep going for breakfast thinking it was just last time but every time is the same or worse :( Really too bad I loved this place"}
{"text":"Now that's more like it.   Several weeks ago I wrote a scathing review of my ex-breakfast diner. (Sorry, but I feel strongly about my bacon and eggs.) I vowed never to return there after yet another botched breakfast. I had to find a new diner-style establishment close to home. Not a fan of the brunch buffets. I was looking for a no nonsense reliable place where I could enjoy a couple of eggs over easy. Not as easy as it sounds. A few places looked promising but they were closed on Sundays. Finally I went to the one place where I knew my search would end - right here on Yelp. Lots of great reviews on breakfast nooks in the area really helped me to narrow it down to a few places.    Eighty8 caught my eye. Cool name for one. Plus they scored high in value and good home style cooking. I decided to give them a try. The trek from Markham to Thornhill is a short one on a Sunday morning. The restaurant is tucked away in a little plaza on John Street. As soon as we walked in, I knew this place would be perfect. Quaint decor, cheerful, friendly staff and great coffee. We were off to a good start. Simple menu, check. Low prices, check. WiFi, check. The final test was the actual meal. Eighty8 passed with flying colours. A simple breakfast served hot and quick and free coffee refills.   Thanks, fellow Yelpers! Never would have found this place without you."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful.  I have only eaten breakfast here but it never disappoints.  Friendly service, great food Nd very reasonable prices.   My breakfast place of choice!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years since it opened. The owners are the most friendly and sweet people, and they really make this feel like your home away from home, to the point where they greet many of the customers by name and have your order memorized after a few visits. The atmosphere is simple, casual, warm and welcoming and so is the food! They have a great selection and every thing I've tried here over the years has been great. My personal favourite go-to dishes are the mozza onion ring burger and the eggs Benny."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the strip plaza at the northeast corner of John St & Leslie Street in Thornhill Ontario Canada.  The owner Victor waits tables and his wife is super fast in the open kitchen.  I have been here probably 50 times and the food is consistently good, fairly priced and the restaurant attracts alot of people from the North York and Thornhill areas.  It also attracts sports team of all ages as it is family friendly.  Also has an outdoor patio and lots of free parking.  Highly recommend this place as it is family owned and very friendly."}
{"text":"Best value breakfast in town! Located in a hidden strip plaza, this family diner serves up a great breakfast dish at an excellent price.  You get 3 eggs, 4 strips of bacon, 2 slices of toast, home fries, wedge of fruit, and a bottomless cup of  coffee...plus friendly customer service...all this for only $5.95! Great value, the eggs are cooked perfectly, bacon strips are full strips, and the coffee is pretty good too.  The price is truly unbeatable when you compare to other diners/restaurants where they charge the coffee as a separate item.  Would I go again? Hell yes, I'm already a regular for their breakfast...however, I can't comment on lunch/dinner as I've never had it."}
{"text":"Holy food poisoning! My wife and I have been sick for the past 24 hours from eating here. Either the eggs were bad or the pea-meal bacon was rotten. The place was empty for breakfast which is never a good sign. Really a shame because we both thought the service was nice and it was close to the hotel we frequently stay at. Never again."}
{"text":"This place was cozy and the customer service was amazing.  They definitely seem to have regulars since they often knew their patrons by name.  The food was ok.....but nothing more than I expected."}
{"text":"3.5  Pros: Friendly service Homey feel  Cons: Food won't be the best you've ever had  Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try for brunch.  Eighty8 is the very definition of homey if you ask me.  If any of you are old enough to know about the Cheers TV show, this is what I think of Eighty8.  A place where everyone knows your name kind of deal.  It's family run and the owners really make it an effort to get to know their customers.  I'll be honest, the place is kind of dingy.  It's not well lit in some places as well. If you can look beyond that, you will have an enjoyable time here.  They have a bunch of diner foods to choose from here.  Breakfast is all day so if that's your thing all the better.  The prices here are pretty good.  In other words, it's your no frills Chinese restaurant masquerading as a diner.  I ordered a banquet burger with a poutine and my GF had an omelette.  The food here isn't the best you will ever have.  It will satisfy you enough though.  My burger was OK, freshly made to order.  The gravy in the poutine was a little on the salty side for me.  They load it with cheese curds though which was nice.  My GF's omelette which came with home fries were OK as well.  Again, it's the recurring theme here.  They gave us an extra plate of fruit for our little one which was a wonderful thing to do.  The staff and service here is what makes this place.  I've come here twice and always see the staff here engaging in conversation with their regulars.  It's like they're all family and are catching up every time they meet.  The service here is excellent.  It really gives this place that special homey feel you don't get at most other places.  Eighty8 is they type of place that can be really enjoyed if you're a regular.  The staff will go out of there way to make you feel welcome regardless though.  It's not the best, but if you're looking for a simple and inexpensive diner meal, this place is a good start."}
{"text":"I tried something new today at Eighty-Eight. It was the Mediterranean burger and I'll give it 9/10. I would give it even more if there was more garlic in the tzatziki sauce. I'll be going back for this again soon. Do you remember when you ate something that left a great flavour lingering in your mouth and you didn't want to spoil that by eating something else? Well, folks, this is it. You just have to try the Mediterranean burger. I would tell what is in it but I am sworn to secrecy. Mind you, there are a lot more items to choose from on the menu which make this restaurant very unique and stand out from your regular diner-type restaurants."}
{"text":"After reading another review of this family run restaurant we decided to give it a try and it was definitely a great find as suggested! Loved the bubbly hello from the owners, very prompt service. Always made sure our glasses were filled (with good reason because it's 34 degrees outside).  We had the combo breakfast (twenty2 and meat lovers). The pancakes were so fluffy and the peameal was delicious! I find it difficult to find places that have peameal with their breakfast even though it is a Canadian thing. Came with a piece of cantaloupe which was fresh and juicy, nice to finish off the meal. The prices on their menu are fair and not overly expensive. Loved it - fast, friendly and delicious. Will come back again to try their fish and chips as one of the regulars suggested to us!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that 4 stars is ridiculous. Food and service warrant 3 at best.   I have visited the eighty-8 a few times, always at breakfast, looking for the perfect combination of starch, grease, and caffeine to start my weekend or *when underemployed*  weekday right.   As rooms go, the Eighty8 is weird. A long corridor with vaguely surreal along one wall, and a fireplace that's never on. Chairs and tables look like they were stolen from a few fancier restos (and the occasional patio) in town; they're a bit beat-up, as though hurriedly loaded in the back of a truck under cover of night, before Nicky and Henry Hill lit the joint up.   Service is similarly weird. Neither impersonal nor perfunctory. It's awkward, but eventually you give your order, they take it, and food appears. Generally as you ordered it.   The food can be weird, if you stray from the breakfast menu. If Greek diners redefined chili through the addition of spices like cinnamon and cloves, then Chinese diner orders are busily redefining the menu with fanciful takes on pastas, soups, and other stuff. I admit, I stick to breakfast.   The breakfast is pretty damn good. Eggs arrive properly over easy; bacon is burnt to hell, as order. Sausages are sometimes overdone, but no complaints. Home fries can be swapped out pour leur cousines francaise, mais vous etes plus content si vous choisisez les flapjacques (translation: skip the toast and taters. Get the pancakes. They're huge and spongy and awesome).   Coffee ranges from diner dreck to damn fine.   The whole experience won't set you back a wack of cash, either.   The Fourth star is for being a cartifiable greasy spoon in a neighbourhood that sorely needs one. For all the mid-market chains, there's something to be said for anti-corporate unfriendliness when you walk into a place unshaven and smelling of last night's stag party. Not that I'd know from experience.   Now, why are you in Thornhill, anyway?"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with my girlfriend on day and felt the food as only \"all-right\".  The food they offered was definitely not bad, but not very good either.  Prices were reasonable and service was great.  They advertise themselves as a family restaurant in which they were absolutely correct.  Everything about this place felt very homely.  I probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the monster fish and chips and the burger with bacon. I didn't really find the fish and chips very \"monster\" like. It was rather small. It tastes great though fries were crispy and fish was nice and flaky with the perfext batter level. Not to mention it was take out too and both were still crispy! The burger was alright. I suppose don't expect too much compared to all the new swanky burger spots. Overall not bad and will return."}
{"text":"Live in the area - visit the restaurant regularly. Good family folk. No frills food. Always consistent and reliable. Very friendly - they know all the names of regulars that come in. Hard to find that kind of hospitality anywhere anymore.  Comfortable and low key restaurant - people keep on coming back b/c owners are hospitable, make patrons feel comfortable. Relaxed environment, read the paper, have some breakfast, no fuss, no hassle. Fair prices. Hot and fresh food."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant. Head server looks like he's the owner and he actually cares about his guests.   Pancakes are huge but not fluffy enough. They're a bit dry so takes away from the flavour.  Omelettes and other pan fried eggs taste great - hard to go wrong there.   Breakfast combos are huge with large portions. Worth the price if you can eat a lot."}
{"text":"Pretty average greasy spoon. Prices are good and portion sizes are also pretty substantial. I had a twenty2 combo while my fiancée had an eggs benny with spinach substituted for peameal for an extra dollar. It seemed silly to charge extra money to substitute spinach for peameal but oh well.  My food was ok, can't really go wrong with an eggs and meat pile. It was a little odd to serve my sunny side eggs and assorted meat on top of my pancakes, it would probably make more sense for it to be served on a side plate. The eggs benny was just ok, Hollandaise tasted like it was store-bought powdered stuff. The spinach was a little bland and mushy, probably frozen which was disappointing because it was a relatively expensive item on their menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a poor high school student who paid restaurant bills in piles of change (embarrassing but hey I definitely wasn't the only one)  Well I came back today with my brother for a quick brunch before he went back to school.   You really can't go wrong with the prices, they are extremely reasonable.  I got a breakfast with eggs, sausage, toast and home fries for $5.95. That's cheaper than fast food! Only off thing was the home fries were not crunchy at all, but I didn't bother sending them back.   My brother got a club sandwich which he liked too.  Some of my other menu favourites are the won ton soup and omelettes. They have all sorts of food for all times of day.  Will definitely return, it's a good Thornhill go to and doesn't seem to be leaving any time soon!"}
