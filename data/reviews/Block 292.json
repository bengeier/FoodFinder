{"text":"Great space, nice fresh butcher based menu.  Block 292's interior is interesting - clean lines with an industrial look.  High ceiling with exposed ceiling joists.  Food was excellent.   Fresh tasting and we'll executed.  Mussels were delicious,  as were the dry rubbed chicken wings.  Pate on the charcuterie was dense and flavorful.  Meat dishes consumed by our crew - beef selection of the day and lamb chops - were seared just right.  Both were excellent.   Fish dish - Arctic char - was moist and very tasty.  Our vegetarian companion had the veg selection and he was impressed.  There is a butcher shop next to the restaurant with in house cut meats.  It was closed during our visit but we will partake next time!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the lamb chops with gnocchi and grilled peaches with a pesto cream sauce. His description of the natural juices and flavored sauce on the lamb permeated the entire dish for a suburb culinary experience.  He enjoyed a killer diller IPA and the flourless chocolate cake. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't bother!! Terribly over-priced and disappointing!!
No air conditioning with an open air concept - flies at no extra charge.

The menu was extremely limited 6 appetizers and 6 entrees. 
Portions were very small and the tastes were hit and miss.
 
Shortribs and burgers were recommended. 
I ordered the Braised Shortribs. The plate came with one rib (with meat) was mostly fat. Placed over it to look like there was more to the dish were two large bones. These were set on a celery root pate which was bland and not very tasty. The 3 grilled leaves of bok choy were mostly black and charred with a little Blackberry BBQ drizzled on the side. This certainly is not a dish I would want to repeat. At $15, the Block Burger was dry and overcooked. Served with fries, this meal rivaled Wendy's. 

The meat on the one shortrib was the only thing that had a good taste.

Come on guys!! We need a good restaurant!
We have been neighbors to Beverly Road for over 35 years and we expected to experience unique place with especially good food. A place where we could walk to and bring our friends if we did not want to cook. A place to feel like we were getting something special - It was not!
Go a few doors down to Green Garden for food that is worth your money."}
{"text":"Dinner here was average at best, but this is a review of the \"market.\" I've called the butcher shop 3 times in the past month looking for unexceptional cuts like lamb shoulder chops. They never have what I am looking for and are unable to offer an option of ordering them. Stopped in to pick up some fresh herbs, and even that was impossible. I will stop trying."}
{"text":"We have been looking forward to the opening of this place for months.  I will say it's a pretty spot and nicely decorated.  Service was fine, she was trying.  The limited menu is the biggest hindrance, only 5 entrees (no fish option) and they were out of the lamb chops - we were there before 7pm, so not late - they shouldn't have run out.

I had the burger - fine.  Beet salad was good. Cured salmon appie was way more cucumber with two very thin strips of salmon...not worth it.

At this point, unless I see a big shift in reviews I'll walk 3 doors down and dine at IO.  I realize it's still early so hoping they can make some changes - it's a great location and I would love to go back, but we're going to wait until we hear more positive reviews."}
{"text":"Visiting from NJ.  Service was exceptional, and the food great. We had an appetizer of PEI mussels which had a terrific Smokey flavor. The main courses were large and tasty. Jess our server was extremly attentive and sweet."}
{"text":"Had Brunch and was just ok.  Tries to be too fancy.  Had chicken and waffles and there was a very small portion of chicken and it was dry.  Waffles overdone.  Kids had pancakes which were very thick - like hockey pucks.  A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new restaurants- fantastic atmosphere and friendly service. Plus- they have wine on tap! The cocktails are also so creative and tasty- it's hard to choose a favorite. The menu is small in the best possible way because every dish is so well thought though. And- most importantly- incredibly delicious. I love that this place uses local meat and butchers in-house, too. Everything tastes really fresh and seasonal. Block 292 never disappoints- I definitely highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here with my grandma who is not easily impressed with food.  The menu was small and limited with choices... but when my food came I was extremely happy and surprised!  Both my grandma and I enjoyed our meals and thought that they were both very delicious and creative. My grandma said after eating that she would give the food an easy ten if it wasn't as expensive."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the drinks, apps, entrees and desserts.   Our waitress was kind and attentive. We are thrilled to have this high quality locally owned restaurant and market down the street!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a truly superb dinner last night at Block 292.  

Started with a nice wedge salad.  The sweet bacon, smoked tomato dressing, and root veggies elevated this dish.  Wife had a wonderfully seasoned and crusted walleye that came with a yogurt dressed salad with hazelnuts and a root vegetable (squash?) in layers of thin slices.  I enjoyed the lamb steak with béarnaise sauce, snap peas, mushrooms, and a lovely root vegetable with a nice char.  Lamb was tastefully seasoned and high quality, mushrooms were of nice variety, and I don't think I have ever had fresher tasting snap peas (seriously).  Mom had the primavera gnudi and raved about it.  All ingredients in these dishes were matched very well and nothing was mismatched.  

Desserts were the chocolate cake with ice cream and the earl grey creme brûlée.  Wine was an acceptable pour and the gin cocktail was on par with other restaurants.  Portions were nicely sized, especially the lamb.

If I could nitpick and to put this meal over the top, train the servers to heat the brûlée table side and have the silverware taken after starters if left on the plate.  I've never had a properly prepared brûlée in the USA.

After reading some older reviews, we were hesitant.  At home later that night and reading that the chef is none other than Christian Schulz from Crested Duck and Root 174, everything made sense about this terrific meal.   We look forward to future meals and enjoying what Chef Schulz creates.  

We have been to many of the hot restaurants in the now nationally known Pittsburgh restaurant scene and this place stands among them.  Further, Block 292 certainly stands out among the dining choices in the South Hills.  Congrats to the team at Block 292."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Pittsburgh. The Lamb was perfect, my son devoured it. I had Chicken and Waffles for the first time ever, the gravy that touched the waffles was full of flavor. Another dish was the pancakes that were like none that I've seen or tasted before. Our eyes enjoyed the display on our plates and our taste buds were overjoyed with our meals. 
We checked out the Butcher Shop/Market which had a great choice in meats and other products. We were so full today that we will come back again to shop."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today. Food was great. Service was great and the coffee was awesome. The whole place has a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went with a vegan friend. Got there at 5 to beat the crowds. Girl at hostess stand said we could not be seated until 5:06 because chef was not ready. Shouldn't she have directed us to the bar or seated us and offered us to order a drink while we waited. Neither. She told us to go next door to the store which we did. We came back in 5 minutes and we were at the end of the line!!   
Menu is very limited. The only options for my vegan friend were appetizers. No fish or entree salads! We ordered glasses of wine which were pricey, $11. The wine on tap was warm. We ordered the smoked salmon app and asked if bread came with it. Waitress said it was frozen and would be a few mins. We waited. She brought it I. A basket wrapped in a napkin. We were excited for warm bread but it was ice cold!! The table next to us ordered sane app and they got curled cucumbers and looked like some sort of toast. We got neither. Place is nice looking. Menu is very limited but nicely presented. Overall they have many kinks to work out. May give them another chance in a few months."}
{"text":"This new restaurant disappointed in every way. The food we ordered on 10/8/16 was awful. Mussels were over-cooked and tiny and tasteless. The burger was over- charred on the outside despite an order of \"medium\". 
My glass of wine at $11 (least expensive glass of red...others were $12 and up) was so under poured that I wanted to say something but my date asked that I did not. 
The atmosphere is loud and there is bright lighting which is not conducive to evening meal relaxation. Service was fair. 
We could not have been more dissatisfied. The owners did not ask about our experience but stated \" Come back and see us\" We laughed as we agreed that we would return on \"the 12th of Never\". 
This new spot needs to hire a new chef. The food as presented was low quality and completely, ridiculously over-priced."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but I had one of the worst burgers ever for lunch today. It looked and tasted like a pre-formed patty. This is also a butcher shop?"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today at Block 292, shared the wings & Cuban sandwich with my husband.. Both were outstanding!  Perfect cooked pork in Cuban with crunchy pickles in a perfectly toasted bun! The wings were seasoned & very tasty.. Shared the bottled water.. Need to come back for dinner- can't wait! Great friendly upscale atmosphere.. Running into lots of familiar faces! Explored the adjacent Butcher/ market.. Lots of great items for meal prep at home. Definitely recommend & we will be back!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this new place in the South Hills.  Have been there 3x for lunch and plan to go back often.  One of the best burgers I have ever had (Block Burger).  Loved the Cuban as well.  The place has a unique and clean look for an overall cool atmosphere.  Great to visit the adjoined market after to pick-up a fresh dinner. Try it out."}
{"text":"Went there before Slow service, pricey, and Good food. Just went there and walked in for brunch.  The place was almost empty and they said \"do you have a reservation\" and we didn't.  So left and called from the car and asked when there next table was available.  They said \"come right in\".  I was infuriated."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place and unfortunately it disappointed big time.   My friends had the short rib Mac and cheese which was really fatty.   A couple of us got the butternut squash and pear soup which tasted like water mixed with something that wasn't good.   Even a ton of salt didn't help it.  Bread wasn't warm and didn't taste fresh either.  Hoping maybe with time the food gets better but I do not think I'll take a chance going back to see.   Service was fine, people were friendly and the atmosphere is really nice, go if you're just drinking!"}
{"text":"I went with my husband for lunch. Wait staff wasn't that friendly!  They could have been more pleasant, considering the area ! I've  tried every restaurant in Lebo and they're way better than this. We had the Bolognese, soup, and mixed greens salads, and appetizers.  Wasn't nothing \"impressive\" about them!   They could of given more of the balsamic  and not been so \"skimpy!\""}
{"text":"By far the best new restaurant in the South Hills. We waited to come check it out since early reviews weren't great. Glad we did. Tonight our experience was extremely positive. The wine, beer, & cocktails lists are brief but well selected. We had a few glasses of a nice Tempranillo that was priced reasonably and complemented the roasted beet salad and pork chop beautifully. Those were the two dishes I had and they were both executed well. The pork chop was a bit on the large size but it was seasoned and cooked nicely - not too rare and not overcooked. The sweet potatoes and grilled cabbage accompaniments were delicious. My husband had the mussels which we both agreed were of high quality, and well prepared (too often other places overcook mussels). However the smoky tomato sauce was less than stellar. A classic creamy shallot white wine sauce would have been a better choice. Hopefully they'll keep the mussels on the menu but change the sauce. His entree was the lamb chops. Seasoning well but here preparation was a bit uneven with one chop being overdone, while the other was perfectly medium rare. The sides (gnocchi in pesto & a lamb sausage) were winners. And the service was excellent! From hostess to waitress to everyone who filled water glasses or brought or cleared dishes, each was friendly, & professional. We were especially pleased to see Stella (previously of Sushi Three) who was our waitress tonight at Block. She is always so friendly and attentive. Congrats to the team at Block! We are kind of hard to impress but we will definitely be back! So please keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened. For weeks it's the only place I would purchase meat. I've all but stopped going because I am literally the only person in the market each time I go in, there is never anyone else in there so it concerns me in wondering just how much product they are moving out of there weekly and how long it's sitting. The staff is \"eh\", they can muster a smile, but are not into much small talk, which is fine, I like to be in and out, but they seem very timid, like they are afraid to talk, they don't offer much help. We've gone back to driving all the way to Whole Foods to get sustainable meat, and we'll plan on going to the new one as soon as it opens. I really had high hopes for this place as we live so close and want to support local businesses when we can. We haven't bothered to eat here based on what friends have said. Maybe someday we'll give it another try, but we are in no hurry."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Block 292, but I think it's mostly style over substance. Here's why:

The location is right on Beverly Road which might be the second most popular place for businesses other than the main Washington Road Route 19 corridor. It's down near the school towards the far end (Banksville End) of Beverly road. It has a bunch of tables outside, bright windows that allow a lot of natural light inside, and even a cute attached shop selling a myriad of unique, mostly organic, items. Great location, nice modern building, limited parking. But so far, CHECK.

I really like the fact that provenance of the ingredients plays a big role here, and the servers and menu are pointing out where things are grown and sourced from. The menu is short, nothing obviously frozen, CHECK.

Service is friendly, knows and describes the items well, and seems efficient enough, CHECK.

So then why the 3-stars, Keith?

The food and poor value are simply not strong enough. The cocktails, while fairly tasty, range from about $12-$15. $15/drink adds up quick, even if you're having just a couple. I know Morton's and a few other places can get away with this level of pricing, but for a neighborhood restaurant, you could be a little more reasonable!

We ordered the charcuterie board for an appetizer. It was presented dramatically and looked great, but everything just tasted OK. The homemade kielbasa fell apart, the Genoa Salami wasn't great, the pate reasonable tasting but some might be texture-adverse to it. The cheeses were the best part and relatively mild.

The mac and cheese, ordered separately, had great crunchy bits on top for texture contrast, and was good.

While it could be me, the locally sourced organic ribeye steak that I had was just not great. The color was definitely off, although the cook on it seemed ok. This is the first steak I've had that didn't have a distinct red color to it --- in any part of it. I was told that perhaps it wasn't red because it lacked fat and marbling throughout. Well the reason I order a ribeye is because I WANT THE FAT. I want the marbling! If I wanted a lean piece of meat, I'd order a filet! It just wasn't good for $38.

Essentially, the meal was just OK, and a bill of $200 for two was presented including tax, tip, and (4) alcoholic drinks total. We felt suckered. I know it's Mt. Lebanon. I know it's Beverly Road. I know it's a desired location. But the flavors are just simply not there."}
{"text":"This review is for Sunday brunch which was quite lovely.  We made reservations but I was surprised by how slow it was. They have an outdoor patio, private room in the back and a small store in the front.  The service was great and they have a nice drink and dessert menu. For brunch they have about 10 different entrees you can choose from with many lunch options. I went with the traditional egg breakfast with toast, a choice of meat and potatoes. I went with scrambled eggs and got the sausage which I highly recommend. It is the best sausage I have ever had and they make their own (warning the kind I had did have nuts in it). The potatoes were multi color so it looked great on your plate and as another side you also got asparagus which added some healthy greens to the meal.  Others in our party ordered the chicken salad sandwich served with chips which looked pretty good as well as the bagel sandwich with pulled pork-it sounded better than it tasted or looked.  The prices for each entrée where between $10-$15 dollars.  I have not been for dinner but they do have a pretty unique menu that is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try somewhere new for brunch/lunch and found Block 292 on Open Table. We made reservations just in case, but when we arrived, found that the place was nearly empty. But it was an odd time (1:45 PM) and tables started to trickle in after us.

The decor was inviting and the staff was very friendly. Id like to go back when it gets warmer and they open the garage door style windows.  

Despite the hour, they only gave us the brunch menu for food. We were hoping to see the lunch selection as well since we checked it out online and it had other sandwiches and pastas. We ordered the brunch burger and the open faced breakfast sandwich. The fries served with the burger were great - we couldn't stop eating them. But both were served on burnt buns and the breakfast sandwich was pretty small for $14. The braised pork on it lacked sauce and flavor. 

We stopped by the market after we finished our meal just to have a look. Crazy high prices. 8 bucks for a pint of ice cream? Yikes."}
{"text":"I have only been here once so far. Everything was pretty good, but the menu is very very small. The menu is something that would make more sense for a place that is mainly a bar with just small bites you can order, but for somewhere that is supposed to be a full fledged restaurant they need to add more options. The things we did order were very good, but again I ordered them because I had to order something, not because that was what I wanted to eat. Kinda pricey for what you're getting too, this isn't downtown or Shadyside."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Appetizer was just ok. Had to cancel our entree after waiting over 30 mins after our kids were given their meal and still hadn't received ours. Not sure why they brought the kids meals out so quickly?  Maybe they assumed me and my husband wanted to have a leisurely long meal with kids who had finished eating long before us???  Umm no. And they were not busy. Overcharged for my wine.  Acted like they did us a favor to take our entrees of our bill --we never got them!!  So in the end we paid over $50 plus tip for two kids meals, drinks and an appetizer. Very expensive - wish more restaurants in Lebo would realize that families with kids like to go our for a reasonable priced meal.  The area is full of families.  Hope they get their act together -- the place looks great and I love the local concept.  But $30 for an entree better be worth it. Maybe next time I will actually get my meal and find out. I will try them again in a few months after they have had a chance to work out their kinks."}
{"text":"Neat place, outside dining which is a plus in my book. Pricing on the high side, but customer service was great from the management (that's why 4 stars otherwise it's a 3). Had the bacon burger, pretty good but not sure it's priced right at $16, felt more like a $12 burger even though the fries were included and were really good!  May try the place again to see how the up scale dinners are."}
{"text":"Attended Block for a Yelp event! Loved getting a tour of the place! Nice to see a real meat shop in action! The butchers cut up an entire lamb and packaged some sausage before Yelpers eyes! It was such a site to see. 

The hors d'oeuvres were pretty tasty! Lots of meat items! There was a bacon-pear treat that was surprisingly so good! I wish that I remember the name of it! Ugh! 

Wine was served and we had the chance to purchase items from their convenience store. Great event to laugh with some new people and see some new things!"}
{"text":"Have been back a few times (including an elite event which was fabulous). I would bump up my rating to 3 1/2 stars - but since no halfsies it's a 4 :-)

Staff is nice as can be.  Hubby always gets the lamb chops (which he loves) except this last time he got the trout.  For some reason we thought it would be a white fish but I think it was a steelhead trout because it looked orange like salmon and tasted like salmon too - it was pretty good but they should clarify what kind of trout it is on the menu - he was in the mood for the white trout.  

I got the block burger with perfect French fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was so big I couldn't eat it all-maybe because I polished off all those delicious fries.  

Wine selection is great and service was good too.  

Love that you can book on open table now and also that they have wines in the market that you can buy to take home!"}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable. The atmosphere is lovely. The food is fine. Those are my basic points. If you go for brunch, GET.THE.SAUSAGE. It's as simple as that. I didn't, and I've been experiencing food envy ever since. I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, and while it was good, it wasn't anything too special. Sounded amazing - braised pork on grilled raisin bread, topped with a dippy egg and complemented with fingerling potatoes. It was the prettiest dippy egg I've ever seen, but I almost didn't notice the pork and the piece of bread was on the tiny side. My two cents, but try it for yourself and GET THE SAUSAGE!"}
{"text":"My parents were visiting from out of town and I wanted to take them to a fantastic local restaurant for dinner.  I called Block 292 around 6:15pm on the Saturday before Easter and was told there was no wait for a table, woohoo!!  We arrived shortly after and were seated outside on the covered patio.  It was a gorgeous evening and we enjoyed the airy atmosphere.  Although all of the other tables were filled with happy customers, it wasn't overly loud and did not feel crowded.

Our waitress was awesome, I regret not getting her name so I could give her proper kudos on here!  She was attentive and not overly intrusive, checking on us juuuuust enough throughout our meal.  We started with the charcuterie tray which consisted of house made sausage and pate, as well as three delicious cheeses that were all available for purchase in the market.  What a neat touch!

My dad had the Block burger and it was MASSIVE.  He was only able to eat about half of it before deciding it would be best to take the rest home in a doggie bag.  My mom ordered the primavera which was served with gnudi.  They were so fluffy and like little pillows of ricotta happiness on a plate.  Mom really enjoyed how fresh and light her meal was.   I ordered the carbonara because I have a really hard time NOT ordering it when it's on a menu.  Block 292 does carbonara right... no cream sauce here.  Give me those egg yolks!  The whole snap peas were crisp and the guanciale... so good! I could've ate my body weight in that delicious, fatty, pork.  

Their menu is a bit more refined, with only a handful of items in each category, but I think that's a testament to how much they care about the food they are putting out.  Quality over quantity.

This is definitely on my short list of places to be this summer for a good meal or cold drink.  The ambiance both indoors and out is spectacular and this is a great place to sit down and unwind with friends and family alike."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a drink one evening after work.  Bartender was very nice and made a great drink.  She was chatty and engaging, I think that's what makes a great bartender.  She maintained some small conversation and chatted with other guests.  Her martinis was awesome too.  The place is decorated very nicely.  Look forward to returning for a meal."}
{"text":"Amazing arrive and great product!!! One of the workers made a cheese plate with apples artichokes cheeses and turkey on the spot for my wife and my visit to Pitt for the night. Along with the chilled wine they had in stock, made for a nice cheese and wine night at the hotel!!! Definitely a spot to stop into!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Block 292 twice.  The first time was on the second day they opened.  On that occasion things were a little crazy and did no t think it was fair to review.  

On my second visit a couple months later, I went with a group of 10 people so I was able to taste a lot of different things and hear a lot of different opinions. We had a bunch of appetizers including muscles (which I loved), a couple salads, a meat and cheese plate, and someone had the soup.  Everyone was very happy with the size and the preparation of the appetizers.  For dinner I ordered lamb chops which came on bed of ricotta dumplings (like gnocchi), with pesto.   It was fantastic. Everyone else in the group also enjoyed their meals. We ordered flourless chocolate cakes for desert, it was ok.   Would have been better if the cake was warm, but I ate it all. 

Some other things we enjoyed was the beer selections, while not huge there were a lot of good beers on the list, and the house wine that was on special for happy hour was very good.  The service was very attentive and friendly.  

This place got a lot of grief when it first opened, somewhat justified perhaps, but I can honestly say on this visit they did a great job and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the meal I had at Block 292.  Had the charcuterie and flat iron steak.  The flat iron could have used some salt, but the accompanying mushrooms were very good. The market had a lot of nicely aged cuts of meat which would be perfect for summer grilling. I also enjoyed the environment and will plan to stop again when the doors are up in the summer."}
{"text":"I had a holiday lunch with 2 friends at Block 292.  I was concerned about the limited menu as I don't care for \"fancy\" or \"sophisticated\" menu items, but I opted for a Block burger.  My friends had the rice pilaf (served on their dinner menu).  I ordered my burger without the blue cheese as I don't care for it.  After 2 bites, my friends asked how my burger was and I never hesitated when I responded, \"i think this might be the best burger I've ever had\".   I offered a bite to my friend and she laughed and said, \"OMG this IS the best burger I've ever tasted\"!  It's a bit pricier than the average restaurant, (burger with fries and iced tea = $17) but worth every cent!   I have told everyone I know to try it.  You won't be disappointed.   We visited the market after lunch and noticed higher than average prices ($28.99 lb for beef tenderloin); ($10 lb bacon), but I'm sure no one would be disappointed with the quality."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try Block 292 this evening and we're very disappointed. The roasted half chicken came with a side of pilaf with walnuts that was chewy and tasteless. The acorn squash that came with the dish was dry as could be, without any culinary life. There are so many simple things anyone could do to make an acorn squash moist, buttery, or, savory, bit the chef completely missed the mark.
I do want to point out that our waitress provided excellent, very attentive, service and the atmosphere was beautiful. I was compelled to write the chef a note on the beach of our check, it was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time. It is a unique concept having a butcher shop attached to a restaurant. We wanted to really like it but just wasn't crazy about the food. The food was just average, nothing to write home about. We sat outside. There were people who sat next to us that had a dog on a leash while they ate. Every time another dog went past it went nuts barking at the other dogs. It was annoying. I don't feel they should allow people to have dogs with them while they eat. They should consider their other patrons who are paying money for a lovely and enjoyable dinner. I had the pasta bolognese. The sauce was not one of my favorites nor really tasty. My husband had the steak. It was a bone in ribeye and it was thin and chewy. The waitress was very good and friendly. With so many wonderful choices with restaurants in the city now, I can't really say that we would go back to this one. It's just mediocre."}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad sandwich, which was great. My friend commented that there could be more salad options although she enjoyed her dish too. Beautiful restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is hopefully a  corrective criticism review since the place is newly opened, however with that being said there are still some things that should be worked out even its a \"soft opening\" I might preface that with there is no soft pricing. We arrived with the understanding that there were limited hours (5:00 to 8:00) and a limited menu. There were 6 entrees and approximately 6 starters. We ordered drinks and I have to say the drink list was rather impressive, however they took quite awhile to arrive and we only ordered one of the drinks from the cocktail list and 2 glasses of wine   Because our table was ready before our drinks ever arrived we were sat and then the server who took our drink order finally arrived with the drinks and now required a separate check kind of awkward   Upon looking over the menu our server informed us that they were out of two of the six entrees, now it's really a limited menu. Sorry your open 3 hours that's not acceptable. We ordered mixed green salads that were very good as well as a beet and peach salad also very good. For entrees we ordered two burgers and fries and a pork chop, the burgers were ok but nothing special we expected a better burger with a higher quality bun not a store bought one, after all it is $15. The pork chop although tasty enough was inadequate size wise for the price. Sorry a flimsy bone in chop (about 6 ounces) doesn't make it these days especially for a place boasting about its meat and for $22, served with grits and greens a nice side but the greens were vastly under cooked and were very tough   Please understand this is corrective criticism hopefully, I will return in a few weeks to see if things have improved and I hope they do.  The place looks great and I do love the concept of having the market and meat counter etc.."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at block 292 last night. I was starting to hear good reviews from friends who'd recently enjoyed dinners there. I loved that they were focused on the \"source\" of the meats etc that they are serving here. 
The only fish on the menu was Barramundi. The preparation Sounded delicious. I asked our server if the fish was wild since I try to stay away from farmed fish. Knowing this restaurant seemed to care about where the food comes from, I was astounded to hear that the Barramundi was farmed.  I passed and had a gnudi entree instead. 
My daughters chicken was over cooked, bordering on dry. The filets were very good. The mixed salad was too sweet which over powered the other flavors. ( candied pecans)
The beet salad was excellent. 
The restaurant is a very pleasing space but I hesitate to return because it is expensive and I can get farmed fish anywhere."}
{"text":"Block 292 is a fun place because it combines the neighborhood market and butcher shop vibe with a restaurant. 

We ordered the charcuterie platter and the flat iron steak. 

The charcuterie was excellent, but it was unclear what was house made and what wasn't. 

The flat iron steak was sadly under seasoned and a touch over temp, but it was good tasting meat. The smashed potatoes and the mushrooms were spectacular however. 

The Manhattan I ordered was good as well, but nothing to write home about. So overall, a weak four, but not quite a three."}
{"text":"Had the steak panini with a side salad, honey mustard dressing.  Very good sandwich and salad.  Decor is simple and elegant service was fast and efficient, servers attentive."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch this afternoon. I got the double bacon cheese burger medium rare. The burger came out almost well done. The server had them make me another one, it came out still over done but I didn't say anything because I was too hungry. I ended up not being able to finish it because it tasted unappetising. The fries were decent but over cooked and the soft drink I had, tasted flat. The server was good, unfortunately, I did not get her name. This place is trying to be higher end with not so high end product. If I'm paying 16 dollars for a burger, it should be fresh and cooked to perfection. I do not see myself revisiting block 292."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive because pretty much everyone I know who had been here was disappointed in both the portion size for the price and the service. We got off to a bit of a rocky start (a crowd at the hostess stand and no hostess in sight for a good five minutes, just lots of staff walking past and pretending not to notice the crowd). Once seated on the cute patio it took us a while to get served, and the cocktails we ordered came out veeerrreeee sloooowwwleeee but after that all was well - my entree, the pork chop, was very good - I would have preferred a little less of a char on it but it was still tasty and the sweet potato/hazelnut/balsamic combo is one I will re-do at home. Husband's steak and potatoes were very good, as was his beet salad. All in all, we will be back, although I think I will prefer the outdoor seating as the interior seems a little less cozy."}
{"text":"I am very excited for Mt. Lebanon and the surrounding area to have such a fantastic place to eat and shop!  I am back in town visiting from LA and ate lunch and dinner at Block 292 today.  The food was delicious.  I had the butternut squash soup (vegan and gluten free without the croutons) and the grilled chicken with frisée, potatoes, French green beans and cherry tomatoes.  Both meals with great!  Portions were right on.

Then I returned for dinner.  I was so happy they did takeout.  I ordered the mixed greens salad with pecans, apples and shaved fennel topped with a maple mustard vinaigrette.  For dinner, I had the Arctic char, apple fennel brussel sprout slaw and polenta cake.  My husband had the Jamison Farms lamp chops.  Again, both entrees were good.  

Yes, this place has a smaller menu... but that doesn't make it bad!!  The food that they are serving is on point.  The market looks great as well.  Lots of organic and speciality food... that's why it's a bit more expensive.  

I don't usually write reviews but was frustrated with the reviews I read regarding this restaurant.  Give it a try.  I'm pretty sure you will like it!"}
{"text":"We went here for my fathers birthday party of about 12 people. Every person who ordered steak or a burger received it completely RAW... they sent it back multiple times and it still came back under cooked or completely burnt.  They also would not take it off our bill, and still charged us for food we did not eat. Don't recommend coming here..."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The food was well prepared and plentiful. The menu isn't huge, but has enough variety to satisfy most everyone. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Just picked up what turned out to be a stale $4 baguette today. Was reminded why we don't eat or shop there. Food is over priced, menu is not quite right. Too bad. Everyone in the neighborhood was excited about the place until we tried it. Now the consensus is \"no thanks.\" The atmosphere is great though. At least they got that right."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my wife and decided to sit outside.

We were seated promptly in the outside area and selected the seats we liked since we had the place to ourselves! To be fair, we arrived 5 min before they opened for lunch!

I went for the extra bacon burger as recommended by our waitress which was pretty awesome! My wife took the clam pot which was great but not the best we've had.

Service was great and decor was nice.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We only went to the restaurant, but the market looked pretty neat.  It was 4 of us on a Friday night at 7pm.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It was moderately busy and the atmosphere was cozy.  I got the soicy old fashioned and it wasn't very flavorful.  I tried another cocktail, the Capiroska and that was just ok.  That's unfortunate because the cocktails were between $10 to $13.  We got the chacuterie which was pretty delicious with a good variety.  I got the arctic char.  It came with Israeli cous cous.  It was pretty good,  but I should have gotten a salad as it was really just the fish and some cous cous.  We finished with some French press and the creme brulee.  It was ok, nothing special.  All in all, it was ok.  Probably wouldn't go back for dinner, bit maybe lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"This place is good, but I think they'll do better business with their quality meats and other offerings in their deli/store. (The Greek Hummus is delicious!) The restaurant has a very limited menu and is overpriced for what you're getting in my opinion. The atmosphere is neat, but be prepared to wait. The parking is very, very limited with only a few spots out front. Otherwise, look to park on a side street because Beverly Road during peak hours is usually full. I'd probably go somewhere else for a meal and come here for shopping in non peak hours."}
{"text":"im so sad to see you go!! we recently moved here and this was first and really only decent food we had in the south hills area!! please open an other restaurant soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is really nice experience inside. 15 or 16 bucks is a lot for a burger. At that price can't be a regular. We had the double bacon burger it was good. Consistency was something new (is bacon and hamburger together in the patty). Service is good. Prices just too high and limited/to no \" \"average joe\" options. Fries were super btw. Maybe a happy hour would be cool???"}
{"text":"So we have been aware that Block 292 was coming as there was an article in the Mt. Lebanon magazine a while back.  I pass by the location several times per week on my way to work and noticed that they appeared to open for business.  My wife and I stopped in for lunch to check the place out.  The floor plan is split with perhaps 1/3 of it set up as a butcher shop and small specialty grocier.  The remaining 2/3 is the restaurant and a bar area.  The decor was nicely done with large garage doors along the front of the building which I assume will be opened up on nice days which is the latest trend in restaurants.  The inside is lined with white subway tile and the ceiling is the exposed underside of the roof which is again a trend.  The lunch menu is VERY limited with only four starters and four features.  My wife had the soup of the day which was carrot along with the chicken salad.  I had the black burger and fries.  Everything was very good.  The carrot soup was topped with orange peels that burst with flavor when you bit into them.  Everything we ordered oozed freshness, however, I would have liked to see the portions a little larger for the cost.  I didn't get to see the dinner menu but understood that it was larger than the lunch menu.   I do not know if the shortened lunch menu is the norm or if it's been simplified until they get their groove but I think they need to offer more than four items.  We'll most likely be back to check out the dinner menu once they have had some time to settle in and gets things sorted.  Lunch for 2 was ~$50 (with 20% tip) which was a tad on the high side, in my opinion (we had iced teas, so it's not like we had wine/beer inflating up the price of the check).   Other than the menu limitations, they are off to a good start.

UPDATED:  I bumped my rating down a star as the more I thought about the limited selection and high cost, the more I thought I over rated on my initial post.  I'll revisit my review again once we go for dinner.  Hopefully the menu expands and the value improves in the meantime."}
{"text":"What happens when you take a former service station with three garage doors and turn it into a cafe and a small grocery store? The answer is Block 292! It is named for it's address on Beverly Road in Mt. Lebanon.

I arrived at 11 and was please that they have their own private lot. It is small so if you plan on dining there it is good to get there early since it is small. Once inside I was told that the sit down lunch hours don't start until 11:30 and run till about 2. I was however, welcome to browse the grocery store.

A lot of the food is farm fresh and home grown. The meats in the display looked good quality as well as the fruits and vegetables. They even sell plants there. I was looking at their honey with is raw and farm made. Mind you these prices are not cheap but you are paying for quality. I saw on the chalkboard that you can order some takeout sandwiches. The also sell scones for $2.00 brought in from the Strip district and they also sell artisan bread from the North side. They also sell a different type of \"pie\" brought in that day for about $15.00. Today's was a potato pie which really caught my eye but was saving for my lunch.

What's really neat is how they rearranged the garage doors so that part of them can stay open while it is warm and cool you off.

At 11:30 I returned and asked to be seated. They do have outdoor seating available if you prefer. The menu lists a soup of the day as well as a salad as \"starters.\" The waitress told me what they were but i wasn't in the mood for soup. There are 4 menu options to choose from as well as their daily special. Today it was a turkey club sandwich with chips. I opted for the grilled chicken with this special type of lettuce, cut potatoes, and green beans.

The portion wasn't all that big but it was delicious! They are a little on the pricey side but I remember that I had recently dined at one of the other restaurants in this small business district and this place is right on par both with size and pricing.

My waitress was very attentive to my needs and I inquired about dessert. At this point dessert is not listed on their menu but they do have two offerings. The one I choose was a flourless chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The other was a type of sponge cake with frills on it which I can remember for the moment. Desserts run $8.00 for either one so I decided once to indulge.

I got my cake and it wasn't too heavy but full of flavor. Nothing special about the ice cream but it was a nice touch. The cake also had a mint spring on it.

I really wanted to get the scones since they are huge and sell for only $2.00.  I decided to do that next visit. When I completely my meal I stopped back and saw they had 3 different types so I purchased a blueberry lemon one for my daughter. I took it home to her and she literally devoured it! I was able to sneak a couple of bites and believe me it was so good!! 

As I had noted they also have in their freezer small pints of Millie's ice cream from Shadyside as well as a flavor which I recall named Black and Gold from Betsey's ice cream over in the business district on Washington Road.

For me however, it seemed the best part was the free parking because if you park anywhere else in that section you have to pay metered and you never know how long you'll be. The Yelp app does say get on the waitlist so I would imagine this place gets pretty crowded.  They have a full bar and they are family friendly. Over at the next table I saw some kids eating macaroni and cheese for lunch.

The way the remodeled it is worth a mention as well since from my vantage point I could see that the garage door was split into thirds with the two outer ends capable of opening up and the center just a regular door.

I was very pleased with my visit and will most certainly return especially to get some great home grown food from their grocery section and perhaps grab a scone for myself next time."}
{"text":"Went back after Yelp Elite Event and had a couple of drinks at the bar after a little shopping in the market and meat purchasing from the butcher shop. Store, restaurant and bar are very clean and organized. Meats were fresh and tasty. If in the area I'll stop again."}
{"text":"We came back for Sunday Brunch around 1:45 pm. We were seated right away. The lack of stars reflect the food and not the service. Unfortunately the food was not as good as last time. We ordered a bloody mary and a mimosa. The mimosa was delicious but the bloody Mary was not good. In my prior review I said it was lacking flavor and spice. This time it was full of flavor, full of horseradish. It tasted like cocktail sauce with a little vodka. The other issue we had was that both of our dishes arrived at room temperature. I ordered the vegetarian breakfast and it was still lacking flavor but the veggies were still super fresh, which is why I ordered it a second time. However, the black eyed peas on the dish were not cooked properly because they were still somewhat hard. We will probably give this place another chance but we will definitely not be ordering bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to the restaurant, but only the first for lunch. I have to say that I was disappointed overall. I am not a big eater, but the portions were too small. My son ordered Mac n cheese with short ribs, and while he reported that it was very tasty, it was a very small plate for the price of $13. My own beet  salad was just okay. I also ordered the soup of the day (bean and tortellini) and it was nothing special. 

My other visits - again, all for dinner - were far more satisfying. I probably will return for dinner in the future, but will go down the street for lunch."}
