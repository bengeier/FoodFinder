{"text":"The view from the patio deck makes this place worthwhile by itself.  This was my second time here this year.  The service was great both times.  The menu is not overwhelming and it had enough options to make us happy.  The lamb gyro was very good, and the fries were perfect (I'm a fries expert as this is my favorite food).  Only 2 kinds of beer on tap, but both are good selections. If you're looking for a 5 star destination restaurant, go back to the city.  But if you're looking for a great, relaxing, out of the way, laid back kind of place, then here it is."}
{"text":"Nice view but food is just mediocre ... wish they would get it together I would definitely come more often !"}
{"text":"Don't recommend this place. Service was very rude and their salads are not worth the price. I don't like to give bad reviews. Just wanna pre warn."}
{"text":"Eat there for the view or if you are on Saguaro Lake boating and are really hungry. Service was not stellar; the waiter seems flustered (Sunday of Memorial Day weekend on a lake during May in Arizona, gonna be packed buddy) and at one point tossed extra menus in a pile and let them fall to the floor and sit there.  Decor is very cheap. Orange ceilings and yellow walls with painted cacti and dusty mini silk flowers in pots on the windowsills. Cobwebs in the corners. Definitely would be better to eat outside, not in.  Since service and decor sucked, my party did not expect much in terms of food, but the food was good. WAAAAY to overpriced though,  but portion sizes are good.  The type of view provided and the cheesy decor was almost embarrassing. I understand that people are coming in off their boats, wet, but let's bump it up a bit and offer some more healthy choices on the appetizers instead of just greasy bar food. Train the wait staff to be more polite and attentive; lose the teenager attitudes (they are all teenagers). I will never eat there again unless they lower their prices and/or I am on a boat all day and starving."}
{"text":"You go for the beautiful view, not the food. Two stars because it has an amazing view, if it wasn't for the amazing view I will give it one star.   I went with my family.    We had to only wait  two minutes be seated only because It seems like the hostess was also the waitress.  Lemonade tasted like they made from the powder. Not real lemonade  Orange Juice tasted like Sunny D.  Hot Cocoa was made with water not milk. So basically tasted watered down.   Even the WATER tasted horrible.  Very likely from the tap. Not even filtered.    We ordered Nachos. It was ok. Slightly burned, but only like two chips.  No big deal I guess.  I will only go back for view. That's it. If wasn't for the view I will not return.  Next time I will order a bottle of beer. Can't go wrong with a beer. They dont make it. I will stick to ordering Nachos for every one. It fed all the three of us and our three year old. I refuse to spend any more on food if it's not even that good."}
{"text":"We have been here an hour and no food as of yet! You are a restaurant for God's sake!! If you cannot feed someone a cheeseburger faster than this you need to shut down! So disappointed I will not come back here. The people don't care!!"}
{"text":"Worse meal I have ever had in America  I had a gyro which was allegedly lamb but I doubt it as the\" meat\"was perfectly rectangular and I don't know many rectangular lambs  Beware"}
{"text":"Love the views! Food is also good!! Bloody Mary's are yummy!! Great place to visit.  Enjoy the outside settings"}
{"text":"I'm shocked, really shocked. The food was really good. I completely expected mediocre diner food but I was really surprised and happy with what we ate.  My little guy got the pulled pork sandwich and fries and loved it. My bigger boy got the french dip and it was HUGE and wonderful looking - hoagie, tons of beef, covered in cheese ( I can't remember if it was mozzarella or provolone ) and onions, I think we had them hold the mushrooms or peppers I can't remember. It came with au jus and french fries.   My husband got the rueben - rye bread, sauerkraut, swiss, thousand island and cole slaw on the side. Very good.   I got the Gyro with greek salad. So fresh! Tons of cucumbers, tomatoes, tatziki (sp?) and the pita was so soft. Wonderful meat - great sandwich. The salad was big and super fresh.   We were on the boat without food or snacks so we were really hungry but the food was genuinely good. The prices were a bit high everything seemed to start at $10. They had liver and onions on the menu and someone ordered it while we were there! Blast from my childhood! (that just aged me, didn't it?)  We were boating so no drinking but everyone else sure was! Nice food, nice but clumsy service, never came back to ask how everything was - luckily it was good."}
{"text":"Typically, I'm a bit weary and critical of places with an average of only three stars, but we tried this place with family on a Monday morning for breakfast during a recent vacation to Phoenix.  If you find yourself in the area, it is well worth the scenic drive out to Lake Sagurao.  The food was great, but the view was spectacular!  As I mentioned, we had breakfast. I had the corn beef hash.  It was made from scratch, big portions and very hearty.  The bacon was prepared perfectly as well. Don't expect a gourmet breakfast, but be ready to eat some great, home-cooked food.  I recommend eating on the outside patio overlooking the lake.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The view is pretty and then food is good. However, the waitresses look angry and wound up tight. Not as comfortable as I expected."}
{"text":"Went here after a great sight seeing tour on the Desert Belle boat cruise (definitely recommend this tour).  As for the restaurant: It is located at the marina and has sweeping views of Suagaro lake and the canyon...absolutely stunning.  The outdoor dining area has tables that all you to take in the beautiful view while dining (see pic).  Hands down one of the best views I have ever seen from  an outdoor eating area.  This makes the place...deserves 6 stars for the view.  For the food/service: Mediocre at best.  The wait staff seemed overwhelmed with the # of tables they were each serving.  After the boat tour, most people headed up for dinner so they did get a rush...but I imagine by now this is predictable and could have been handled better.  One server was use profanity with another server and we observed customers complaining about the poor service...apparently not just us.  I ordered the fish and chips (see pic).  The menu indicated this was 'World Famous' and it had a box drawn around it on the menu...how could I resist this one-two punch??  Fish/chips was just ok.  Felt like I could make this better at home.  Wife had a cheeseburger and was pleased.  Nothing to brag about but no complaint.  Daughter had grilled cheese.  During dinner, service continued to be poor.  Waiter did not ask how meal was of if we needed anything.  Both my wife and I could have used a refill long before we finally flagged the waiter down.  Lastly, prices are high for the quality of food.  You are paying for the view, not the quality of the fare.  Overall, still happy with the experience due to the beautiful view.  Next time, may skip on the meal here and find another place locally to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal.  I would have given this 5 star, But its hard to ignore how filthy and outdated this place is ...cobwebs hanging over my head, chairs sre filthy, floor is gross.  Clean and update is needed."}
{"text":"If you go, it's for the view of the lake while eating. Food is decent but nothing special. I had the French Dip which needed seasoning. Cole slaw was good. Prices are higher than elsewhere because of the location no doubt. Parking is hard to come by since it's shared with other attractions. I had to park up a hill. Ugh! Tough going to get the car after."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  One star for the view ONLY.  The restaurant was filthy. Stains all over the carpet, bird poop on the ledges and so many flies that were biting us that before we even ordered our food, we asked to be moved inside.  No vegetarian options. My hubby ordered the chicken Caesar salad minus the chicken. They still charged for the chicken, which we weren't initially upset about, but when the salad came out, we immediately noticed most of the lettuce was brown and the croutons were missing. How the server did not notice this when she brought our food to the table I don't know (?), but we asked for his salad to be re-made, and they did.  I had the chicken fajita salad. There was absolutely no flavor and the chicken was borderline undercooked. I didn't send it back because at this point we were just disgusted and wanted to leave. High prices, low quality. Never going back and what a shame because this place could be a GOLD MINE!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant location with a beautiful view. Service was quick for the most part but the food is mediocre. Since this is a tourist trap, they've made sure to add 20% to their menu prices. $21 for a salad and an awful bloody mary."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Saguaro Lake near Mesa. This is a very beautiful location. The place is located at the western end of the lake, so in the evening one has (could have-see below) a beautiful view from their terrace on the rocky eastern shore of the lake. The place has also a boat rental. So far so good.  When we saw it, we immediately decided to have a drink and enjoy the scenery. We went upstairs to their deck and were seated on a table right at the edge of the terrace. In principle this should have resulted in a happy experience. Unfortunately, the terrace is surrounded by an ugly concrete wall topped by a child proof additional barrier, which safely obstructs the gorgeous view. A typical US 'law suit prevention device'. So we sat there on bolted on plastic seats and looked at the barrier. A glance at the surrounding tables and the menu immediately suggested to eat elsewhere in favor of avoiding future heart problems. Extreme hamburgers, fried chicken and fries piles abound. Old folks stuffing themselves everywhere. This explained the old fryer oil smell wafting across the entire outdoor seating area. Our clothes were smelly after leaving the place after 30 min.  It is just sad to see such a waste of prime real estate!! I am just imagining how this place would have been an elegant restaurant or a trendy bar for rich kids parading their bimmers in the evening sun if it had been located on the west or east coasts or in Europe. Think of having a well lubricated mojito with fresh mint leaves and an elegant appetizer in such a beautiful location...sigh...well, I guess we have to be content with a Bud Light and a beautiful view of the children barrier for now. Maybe in a few decades the hipsters of Phoenix will wake up and storm these trenches!"}
{"text":"I would say that the food here is nothing special. The prices are double over what you would pay for this meal. I got the chicken wings which were about $13 and a beer. Altogether the bill was $20. I noticed that all of the food on the menu were over $10 regardless of what it was. Pretty much simple barfood with a hefty price."}
{"text":"Unhelpful hostess wouldn't allow us to sit outside as she was seating others. Waitress was friendly but only stopped by to get order and deliver food. Drinks were never refilled and she seems confused when we asked to split checks. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Food was so-so and service was mediocre. Server hardy checked on us and there were only a few people in here. Severely overpriced, with sneaky charges for splitting a sandwich with my sister. I won't be returning. They can do better."}
{"text":"Lakeshore is a cute little restaurant in the marina.  You can chose from indoor or outdoor seating, but regardless you are going to get a great view of the lake.    The food is burgers, sandwiches, etc.  Nothing fancy, but it tastes good.  I do not recommend taking a trip to the lake just to attend this restaurant, but if you are in the area it's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I understand the difficulty a small, out in the middle of the desert restaurant would face to serve great food, but come on...a little more effort please.  The spinach salad my wife had was simple and had pickled artichokes in it.  How does anyone in a kitchen who claims to understand food put pickled artichokes in a spinach salad that has nuts, fruit and a sweet dressing??  Wow...  My taco salad was miserable.  Server had a deer-stuck-in-headlights demeanor about her the whole time, without an ounce of hospitality.  If she was serving me a shot of whiskey in a fly infested dive bar I would expect more warmth.  It is a place you should go to only if desperately hungry while stuck out in the middle of nowhere.  If you do eat here, I would probably stick to ordering the fried foods.  I am sure they get those menu items closer to the mark than salads, etc.  A pity such a beautiful landmark as Saguaro Lake has this mess as its only restaurant.  Next time we are packing a lunch and going for a picnic at the lakeside park."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!    I ordered falafel and I was brought over fried cat turds.   Worst meal ever. Enjoy the views and the drive but please bring a sack lunch."}
{"text":"Great for a lake side restaurant. There were four of us and all were very happy with our food. Items included fish and chips, Cesar salad, deep fried shrimp and chips and the summer salad was superb. All large enough portions to share if desired. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Had the best Minnesota pike I have ever eaten. Actually best pan fried fish I have ever had. Found it odd that you could have fries or coleslaw but not both when the entre was $23. Soggy vegetables. Would have liked homemade fries but that's probably asking for too much. Service was slow. Staff was very friendly and accommodating although we had to search her out because we were tired of waiting for the bill. This place is dirty. Wine glass was dirty. Flies on the windowsills,dirty tablecloths and floors. It could be a lot better for the price"}
{"text":"A terrible choice for an eating opportunity at the lake. The food is way overpriced and mediocre in quality. The only saving grace is the view of the lake and it was a nice setting, especially from the patio. My advice, take a picnic lunch and enjoy in an outdoor setting.  BTW, the Lake cruise is a great opportunity to see the lake up close. It's a great ride and Captain Tom made it so interesting."}
{"text":"200th Review!  Beautiful view of the lake and marina...  We typically bring our food and drinks for the whole day when we go boating.  This time is a little more special...Mother's Day lunch.    My hubby docked the boat  below the restaurant.  The website made the place seem like a liitle more upscale than what it really is.  It's a very casual restaurant, I hope we didn't smell too much like what we caught.  The dated interior needs a little improvement.  The balcony, especially, needs to be cleaned and power washed!  I was half joking about the fish line that lined the frames, not as a decoration, but as a distraction from the spider webs in every nook and cranny of the exterior.    The food.  Not bad.  Just don't expect a high end lake view restaurant menu.  I had the Fish and Chips ($9) I shared with my son.  What is white and black that sits on a dining table which adds flavor to the food?  They could've brought out the flavor of the fish if it was seasoned before it was battered.  I'm not too fond of cornmeal breading, but the lightness of it worked.  Again, it needs to be seasoned--what are you afraid of?  My husband decided on the Hot Wings ($9).  My FIL ordered the BBQ Wings ($9).  They both decided it was mediocre.  There is a little To Go store right around for some snack and ice cream I would like to check out next time.  Will we come back to this place again?  Probably, if we run out of food and drinks!    Just a word to the management:  Please work on your food!  Take advantage of your million dollar view!  Not many places have that in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food turn around was quick. I recommend eating outside. The view of the lake and mountains are breath taking and adds a beautiful ambiance to the whole dining experience"}
{"text":"Waiter was friendly but the other reviews here seem to hit the nail on the head.  This place has great potential but the food is bland and overpriced for the quality. Was forced into coming since some family had set up a reservation."}
{"text":"Two stars...for the location and that is about it. If someone with a half a brain would actually take the time to put some effort into this place it would be and actually could be alright...I feel like opening a hot dog stand right down the street, and would probably provide better service and food.  Thought this place would have a great view on the patio but no, the view is obstructed by  a fence and a wall. the chairs a re small and uncomfortable I think they were originally stolen from a child's play ground. In general it was dirty most of the tables were not clean and there were flies everywhere.  The staff was not only rude, but extremely slow, and it was not busy there. There were some dead people two tables away from us gumming their food ...now when I say dead I mean these people reminded me of the dead people from Michael Jackson's Thriller video...they all looked like they had one foot in the grave. For the most part there could of been maybe 7 people in the whole place. Not busy for a s slow as it was.  Plus this place is extremely overpriced. almost $20.00 bucks just for me and all I got was the burger and fries with some Ice tea.  I would say skip this place, pack a picnic and maybe go up to spend a quarter in the viewfinder for a 300 yard view of the lake another rip off...don't waste the quarter...I wouldn't even trust the vending machines outside this place. Find another place at the lake."}
{"text":"I had the fried clam strips and my other half the fish and chips.  The clam strips had no clams but really strips made of cornmeal and flour.  The fish in the fish and chips were either meaty big chunks or majority breading and thing fish leather that was overcooked and over breaded.  Pricey for no quality, not even a little quality. Bleh. Great location, but awful food.  Shall we talk about the fishing line decoration on the balcony that was interesting with the spider webs everywhere? Maybe stick to french fries."}
{"text":"Hmmm... where do I begin... did some kayaking on the salt river and decided to stop at the marina for lunch and a beer. I walked in and not a single person was in there... mind you it was around 1:00 pm on a Monday... most people were probably at work or off the lake for the day. Anyhow... we asked to sit outside... who wouldn't want to look at the lake! My friend and I ordered 2 beers and she got the chicken caesar and I ordered the club croissant . We asked our server, in advance, for extra plates because we like share our food choices. He politely said there was an 'extra plate' charge for splitting . I get this concept when two people order ONE item and split... but not when two people EACH order an entree . Whatever we said we were not splitting 'a' meal , just wanted him to bring a couple extra plates. He said he would have to 'ask his manager?' Whatever! Let's speed this up... we got our food and bill at the same time! I cannot stand this... what if I wanted another beer? Something else? Bottom line... server was young and obviously inexperienced...dropped $50 and had my food bill and paid within 1/2 hour... not the nice relaxing lunch on the water experience I was looking for! Not to mention the chicken on the salad was not grilled... as stated on the menu... but rather pan seared. Croutons were the best part of the salad... too much dressing! The club had a generous portion of turkey... that was good... but where's the mayo? Mustard? They probably would have charged for it. I will find another place next time I'm out on the river!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. We just wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy some beautiful scenery. The menu is basic with few choices. The food is simply plated with no appeal. I ordered the chicken salad croissant. Messy and fell apart. My husband ordered the reuben sandwich. Bread was grilled too crispy. Pricing was a little high. Probably wouldn't come here again just for the food. But would come again because of the solitude. The best part of the afternoon was driving the back road that takes you to Red Mountain area."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Lakeshore a couple of times. The first time I got a burger, no bun, the second time I got salmon. We weren't sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. Our food was pretty good. Now, it's not a gourmet, high class restaurant but it's great for before or after heading out on the boat. Both times we have had the same server and she was awesome both times. I see a lot of negative comments in other reviews, from our family of 5s experience, it was nothing like how horrible others have made it sound. We will definitely go back. It's very convenient."}
{"text":"Went to see the lake of course, but decided to stop at the restaurant. Great location, reasonable prices, very friendly service, generous portions ...not at all the settings of a tourist trap. I am local and I  think we ll go back for dinner at sunset  !"}
{"text":"I didn't have the food but the dessert was awesome, and the coffee was great too. We didn't even realize before coming here for the Desert Belle boat ride that there would be anyplace to eat at all, we were pleasantly surprised to find this place.   We came on a Thursday afternoon in February and it was pretty crowded, we had no reservation but only waited about 10 minutes for a table. Didn't care about a view (there's plenty of view outside and on the boat) and got a table outside overlooking the parking lot, but no complaints here since the scenery around was breathtaking.   Our dessert came in huge dishes and we couldn't even finish it (well alright maybe we could). I ordered the brownie sundae, Mom got the strawberry shortcake with vanilla ice crearm, and my daughter got ice cream. We were impressed it was so good. We got a nice hostess and waitress and our service was just the right pace and we didn't feel rushed.   I contemplated ordering the pulled pork sandwich, which I may next time, because I'm sure I'll be back. I wouldn't come here expecting a fancy and definitely not romantic waterfront restaurant, it's really for casual dining amongst beautiful scenery and tourists. Pair this with a boat trip on the Desert Belle."}
{"text":"A good local restaurant/bar with nice service and tasty food options.  Service is always good even when it is packed.  The food is just good all around, we haven't had something we didn't like.  There are a few standout wraps and the wings are very tasty.  As with most places like this, stay away when there are games on TV.  People screaming makes the place kind of loud during games.  Otherwise it's pretty typical.  If the weather is good, you can sit outside to avoid the people screaming at TVs."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place would blow me away like It did. Unassuming, casual, older building next to the lake. This is the one place to eat if you are out here. It's remote. But rest assured, it's amaze-balls. Number one, portions are huge. Number 2, the old school waitresses are awesome. Number 3 the view is fantastic.  But there is something here special... The fryer. Whatever kinda fryer they have. Ack there, I want one. We literally had the best French fries and onion rings we ever have had in our entire lives. Onion rings so good, fresh, meaty, sweet, heavenly, a meal in itself. Do yourself a favor and order the onion rings appetizer plate for $12; WORTH IT. French fries just amazing as well. Hamburger,  taco salad also great. But trust me, get fries & onion rings. 10 stars."}
{"text":"The To Go area resembles the final days of an amusement park eatery.  You ring a bell for service, you order food and beverages that are inline with the amusement park decor, in price and quality.  Wouldn't you know it, the service is the same too (As the employee handed me my order, I said thank you and she grabbed the singed receipt, closed and locked the window, without so much as a word).  I didn't expect much and tah-dah that is exactly what it was."}
{"text":"Very good place to catch a bite before spending time on the lake. They have indoor and outdoor seating, nice views and the food was decent, altho a little pricey. We ordered the hamburger (which was great, as well as excellent fries) and the fish tacos (not what I expected as far as a breaded somewhat dry single piece of fish on a tortilla, but very tasty thanks to the nicely spicy slaw). I was torn between that and a salad and later see on Yelp that the salads look much better, unfortunately no wifi and i wasn't getting phone service in the restaurant. The service was very attentive, food came out fast, able to get in and out and avoid any delays. It was a nice little spot on the lake to relax."}
{"text":"Sunday midday, decided to go have lunch at the restaurant on the lake. Seated on nice outdoor patio. Food on table nearby smelled great, getting real hungry. And it stops there, waited for about 20 minutes at the table without water or anyone checking on us. Noticed people at table that were there before we were seated without any drinks also, they finally received food and drink together. We were not served after that and decided it was time to leave. Mentioned it to employees inside, and better luck next time. Bad service is not very ideal when you make it a point to drive out to this location to have lunch."}
{"text":"Good food, great views! Has the lakeshore hamburger and it was really good, my husband had the steak and shrimp and he liked it too."}
{"text":"For a lakeside, who-cares-what-you-look-like restaurant, this place is fabulous.  The food is always good, the staff is friendly and gives good service.  The onion rings are a must-order and I'm generally a very healthy eater.  But who doesn't like a splurge every now and then? The scenery is just beautiful.  I'm not sure what people who give this restaurant a low score are expecting, but it's 5 stars all the way with us."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by our experience here.  We were out for a day of exploring and leisure with our kiddos and stopped in for a bite.  Expectations were surpassed thanks to our waitress who was kind, patient, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  The food was good and the view of the lake was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms are outside of the restaurant. There are vending machines near the bathrooms.   Best part is outdoor seating with the lake view. The view I give 4 stars. Music is playing at a low level, so easy to hold conversations here.   No steep driveways to get into parking lot, but there are speed bumps and a divider that won't let you cut the speed bumps. So really low cars this place is a no go. Parking spaces are a good size.   Food Fries are bland. Coleslaw is ok. Ruben was fine. The corn beef was moist and tasteful.They had thousand island on the side.Gyro was fine as well. Food here is nothing to rave about. The food is ok, but for the price not worth it. Only place here to kill time before the desert belle cruise. Best thing about this place is the view again. Overall the food here is bland, lacks flavor, lacks anything special to make this place pop.   Service  Is good they check up on you regularly. They're pretty fast with orders and food.    I wouldn't recommend this place to my family or friends. We will not be returning to this place again. If we planned on going on the cruise again we would bring snacks while we wait."}

{"text":"Here at the Lakeshore Marina eating breakfast with the family.Amazing food service prices and views a very niceeeeee  place to be"}
{"text":"The service, view, and strawberry lemonade here are really great. Unfortunately, nothing else is.  We started our meal with some buffalo wings, which were dried-out (overcooked) and insufficiently sauced. We didn't even finish them. I ordered the stuffed tomato, and husband ordered the BBQ Pork sandwich.  The food came out after we were only two wings in, so the food had to be placed up on the railing because it didn't fit on the table. Timing, people, timing!  My stuffed tomato wasn't a stuffed tomato. It was tomato wedges on top of a bed of lettuce, topped with a pile of chicken salad. The roasted red peppers in the chicken salad were a nice addition, but it wasn't good chicken salad, still, unfortunately. I really wanted it to be... It also says it's served with fruits and vegetables--just be aware that means a handful of grapes, a few wedges of orange, and a handful of precut baby carrots.  Husband's BBQ Pork looked and tasted like it had come, pre-made, out of a tub, not made in-house. It was thoroughly mediocre.  We thought, \"Well, no biggie, it's lake food,\" until we got the bill! It came to well over $50 with the tip for one appetizer, two entrees, and two drinks! The strawberry lemonade alone was $4.55, and the really bad buffalo wings were $10. I didn't even take any leftovers, the food was so bad, and husband decided his leftovers weren't worth keeping either and threw them away before we left. Ultra-disappointing--this place has some real potential given its location and great patio seating, but the food is terrible and outrageously overpriced to boot. We won't be back except perhaps to try some of their neat-sounding desserts."}
{"text":"Five stars for the lovely view and 3 for the service which was decent.  But the food?  Way over priced and so bland.  Ordered the fish and chips and the fish was flavorless, tough and dry.  Yuck.  Fries were lukewarm and if you can call greasy a flavor, well then.  Coleslaw actually wasn't bad because it wasn't drowned in sauce.  We went here basically because it's the only restaurant right by the Desert Belle and we were hungry.  But general consensus of group was that it's overpriced and not very good. They definitely take advantage of those coming to cruise on the Desert Belle."}
{"text":"We ate here because of convenience and location. We were at the lake, hungry, and not ready to go home yet. They have an okay menu selection, but I would never go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I called ahead to advise we would be a party of 11, but got an answering machine.  When we arrived, it appeared they had not picked up the message.  But we were seated, as it was mid afternoon and there weren't many people there.  The reason for the one star is the service was awful.  It took over 1 hour from the time we arrived for the first order to come out. A few of us ordered the fish and chips with should be an easy order to get out. It would be understandable if they wanted all the other orders to come out together, but they did not.  The other orders came out one at a time with extensive waits in between.  I was finished with my fish and chips before the 10th order came out.  When that order came out the waiter announce that the last order (French dip) had to be redone because he ordered it without onions.  This was an hour and 20 minutes after our arrival.   The food was unremarkable.  Nothing that required an hour to prepare.  I was really disappointed because I've eaten there a few times and really enjoyed it.  But never again"}
{"text":"Don't bother going here if you are a minority.  After sitting at the table for 20 minutes without a waiter bothering to even make eye contact we walked out.  Our money is just as green as the next persons, and it will be spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice stop when out at the lake or out riding the motorcycle"}
{"text":"I would recommend ppl. To eat somewhere else before heading to the lake as this is the only restaurant around that place. The food was awful. It was tasteless, more like frozen packaged food. We had the falafel which was wayyy over cooked and my fish tacos didn't even taste like fish. The cole slaw they put in it looked and tasted like it was a day or two old. Food was definitely not worth what we paid for. One star for the fries."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  The breakfast was amazing!   Eggs were nice and golden, indicative of fresh eggs and they not only looked fresh but they tasted fresh and were perfectly cooked exactly how requested.  The biscuits and gravy could not have been better!  I will always order them for breakfast here.  Absolute perfection!  The potatoes were flavorful and I loved them.  The toast was also fresh and hot.  NOT ONE SINGLE COMPLAINT!  Add to that, the perfect service and view!  Whooooooohoooooo!  Jackpot!  Love this place, especially when we have this wonderful weather.  Just saying...................."}
{"text":"Myself and six other women ate at this restaurant on a Sunday. We arrived at 10:30. Only breakfast was served. Four of us had to wait 30 minutes to order lunch. SIGH. My friend and I ordered the Reuban sandwich to split. They added a $2.95 charge to split. So $15.95 and $2.95, so $18.90 for a sandwich and fries. The fries were very good and both of us had a large portion on the plate. The Reuben was awful. The menu said corned beef, I expected corned beef but what they put on the sandwich was a mystery meat. It was some kind of processed deli meat. No flavor, awful texture. And extremely small serving. My half barely covered half of the palm of my hand. No matter because I couldn't take more than 2 bites. But I ate every fry on the plate. My advice, stop and enjoy the lake view, have a soda or beer but don't eat here."}
{"text":"Waited 12 minutes no service. Bad service. Went home. Terrible, staff member was smoking outside near us, made the whole thing way worse."}
{"text":"Seated at 4:02 by a snippy person who did not speak to us, but carried on a conversation with 2 other employees.  She soon returned with dinner menus stating she did not know it was after 4pm.  Ignored by several servers who went to other tables.  4:10 two small groups seated within a few feet of us.  2 different servers followed them in and took their drink order.  Their drinks arrived immediately.  During the next few minutes 3 different servers came in, looked us in the eye, and turned to different tables.  Our menus sat closed on the edge of the table, while we waited patiently.  At 4:18 we left without being acknowledged by the wait staff."}
{"text":"Nice view of the lake and mountains, but the birds (bird poop everywhere) and flies stopped us from enjoying our dinner on the outside patio. Dinner was good but really overpriced. The cod was $15.95 and onion rings were $11.95. A bit outrageous."}
{"text":"The previous review had it right by not ordering anything. Both of my stars are for the scenery and the location - nothing for the food at all.  We were here for a Easter lunch today as we wanted to go someplace out of the way and peaceful on a beautiful Easter Sunday. The restaurant is on a beautiful location in the Saguaro Lake Marina, with a great view of the lake (and the aforementioned retaining wall).   The location definitely deserves a better eatery. Our hostess was not very pleasant and seemed uninterested in our business or our reservation. The server was virtually nonexistent and also did not seem to care about the tables. We opted to sit on the patio so we could see the lake and it was a beautiful day.  A lot of the tables reminded me of a McDonald's table - molded plastic with fixed swivel chairs.  The menu SOUNDS a lot better than it actually is - and we found out why from a conversation overheard with a server and customer at another table: The food for the restaurant is all purchased at Costco. That's right, Costco. That explains the uninspired Gyro with precut strips of meat, \"Greek\" salad consisting of what appeared to be bagged salad with cubed feta, olives and thick italian dressing. Another selection that sounded good until the plate arrived is the Malibu Chicken sandwich: Your standard Tyson chicken breast on a roll with a slice of Oscar Mayer ham and some rubberish cheese.  Please let someone renovate this place - it could be a real gem with a good menu, solid food sourcing and a staff that cares more."}
{"text":"You're better off with an empty stomach!  Take my advice: don't stop by this restaurant, there's Fountain Hills nearby with really good options as far as dining with a view. And here's the problem: this is the only restaurant on Lake Saguaro, no alternatives.   We were three people for lunch on a Friday, the place was empty. I made the terrible mistake of ordering the liver and onions. The worst liver and onions I've ever had. Ridiculously dry and tough, no flavor. I asked for more sauce but nothing, it seemed getting dryer. The salad then, don't make me start. Flavorless iceberg lettuce. My parents made a better choice with the fried shrimp.   Service was also poor. The guy who served us can only be justified by his inexperience. He was absent the whole time. I had to call other waitresses around to get service. But then he brought the check in the middle of the meal. What good waiter does that?   Bad. No more."}
