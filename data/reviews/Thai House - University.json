{"text":"Been to this place many times. Always get a thai curry. Definitely my go to place for take out. I have dined in before too. Good friendly employees"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I go there for lunch often and the staff and owner are great. The food is excellent and keeps me coming back for more. The Krapraw is excellent."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for the food and the decor. But the service is awful, there is a waiter who always try to act really smart and funny. He assumes Indians don't understand english and I feel is extremely racist. The regulars here, would know who I am talking about."}
{"text":"Lunch special for roughly $8 per person prior to tax and tip.  All 3 in our group enjoyed the pad Thai.  University area of Charlotte in a plaza near Walgreens.  My wife also enjoys the Potak soup."}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food in town. I love the ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Food is not as consistant but its alright for a quick lunch. Service is so-so. Food is not worth the bad service! Lol"}
{"text":"Oh no! I loved Thai House so it sinks my heart to write this review. 

About a month ago we went for our usual. We ordered from the very stoic waitress (we usually have great service but she had the grating demeanor of an annoyed teenager). My husband decides to go to the bathroom only to be greeted by a few cockroaches running around the stall.

Now, I have worked in restaurants, I know they aren't hermetically sealed and bugs get in. But even a few German cockroaches (the small reddish ones) are usually a sign of infestation. 

So he goes to the waitress and very quietly and politely (so other patrons are spooked) tells her that there are roaches in the bathroom and that management might want to know. Her response? \"Why?\" What? Why? What do you mean 'why'? Is this an existential question?

She calls management and they start arguing back and forth with my husband standing there. No one acknowledges him, apologizes, anything. So after a few minutes he just lets them know we are cancelling our order and leaving.

So, the possible infestation is a concern but I could always hope they would address it and I would return after a little while. They do have great food. Although, we felt that the way they treated it was not very professional and because of this, we will probably not be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. This is the best Thai food I've has in Charlotte. The staff is friendly and it is always clean."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Love the clear soups that come with the lunch dishes. The green and red curry along with the pad Thai tofu are among my favorites."}
{"text":"Very good Thai faire! I hate any food bland or dummied down \"Americanized\" and this is not that.  I really enjoy authentic places like this."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant a couple times for lunch and Dinner. I have to say they  have good Thai food, but their service it's not great. The servers that greet you don't serve you food, or let alone do they check on you at all. I always get check on by a different server. Or there times were I don't get check on at all. I give it 3 stars because the food. They really need to work on their service."}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order though I wish I ate on site; the decor is warm and inviting.  The chu chee was delicious!  If I am in town again I will definitely eat here and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Thai food can be one of the most fragrant, delicious cuisines with all sorts of spices playing well together.  That being said, this restaurant is not the best example of how good Thai food can be. It is not necessarily bad either, just the consistency is not there. You can have a great meal one night and a mediocre one the next.  The best thing there are the curries by far.  They pretty much always taste he same.  H problem comes in with the stir fry dishes.  The can be good or bad depending on the day.  The service is not bad but can be kind of indifferent.  I have had a hard time finding a great Thai restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I must disclose I have only ever been here for lunch (several times). It makes for a very relaxing place to eat. The dim lighting, fancy wood carvings, and kind waiting staff provide good atmosphere.

They do a great job with their tofu! Also the veggies, the sauces, the rice... yep, they have been solid (tasty) every time. It's definitely not the best Thai, however it's consistency and atmosphere make it a four."}
{"text":"Great service and incredible food. 

Our family had a couple of the curries and noodle dishes. We then got the mango sticky rice, which was 100% worth trying. There was absolutely nothing to complain about from the entire experience. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"We got the Thai iced tea which was sweet but not overly sweet like a lot I had in the past and knock out rolls which were pretty much summer rolls. I could tell they were made fresh as the rice paper wrapper was so soft and QQ! They were delicious! Now onto the lunch I got #61 which was a yellow curry and my husband got the pad see ew. Both came with soup and one spring roll. Both entrees were seasoned well and not greasy and delicious! We wish we lived closer cuz we want to come back often!!"}
{"text":"This place gas a great atmosphere. The staff are very attentive and friendly. Excellent panang curry dish. Very fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Really great food with good prices.  For the lunch special, you get free soup and an egg roll with your choice of entree.  Great service is a constant.  The decor is especially impressive, with intricate wood carvings."}
{"text":"Stopped by half an hour before closing time by myself (not a big group or anything). Was turned away because supposedly the cook has left already."}
{"text":"I love the thai house, my wife and I discovered this restraunt when we first moved to charlotte.  They have excellent food and excellent service, can't ask for more than that.  Favorite dishes are red curry chicken, Rama of sunset with fried chicken, pad thai and they have an amazing coconut mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"If you are a Thai food lover, you probably have better then this place. I love pad thai and I don't like theirs. Its not as flavor as it should be. Everything else is just okay, but not so great and kind of pricey for the quality of the food.

Service is also just okay. All in all I have yet to find a good Thai restaurant in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal with my son tonight. Super authentic.  Our server, Shin, totally took care of us. There was a big group about to order and she made sure our check got in the kitchen quickly. She also recommended the Thai style pad Thai over the sweet Americanized version. My son, who can be quite picky, loved it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I was looking for an excellent Thai restaurant in Charlotte and I have found it. The food is delicious and cooked traditionally. We had the spring rolls, Pad Khing, Pad Thai, and Green Curry, all with tofu. Yummy!  I've eaten a lot of Thai food and even cook it sometimes. Thai House gets it right. The service it top notch. They are friendly, polite, and tentative. I really feel like they value their customers. It is decorated beautifully with lots of ornate wood work, they have good taste.  Our family will definitely be back and we will bring out of town guests here as well. Bravo Thai House!"}
{"text":"We were excited seeing lunch special menu. We ordered pad thai with shrimp and musamun curry chicken. The portion for pad thai was good and it was okay. The portion for the curry was small. Taste wise, not impressed at all. The meal came with soup and egg roll. Things inside the soup were hardly identifiable, and it tasted overly sweet (for what we believe was hot and sour soup). Overall, visit was OK."}
{"text":"Decor good. Ambience good. Thai uniforms good. But food was not so good. Had the drunken noodles. There were red pepper flakes scattered on top. The flavor was not complex. The chicken was extremely dry. There were no veggies. The noodles were too mushy and had little bite on it. I guess it's considered decent for this area but coming from NYC and having eaten in LA it did not meet my expectations for good Thai cuisine. The summer rolls were quite basic and flavorless. They really should considering revising their recipe."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portions nice size. Service was excellent as well. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"When I am in the University area and I'm craving some Asian cuisine, this is normally the place I go to. I have yet to try every dish on the menu, but everything that I have had has been delicious. The waitstaff is always very nice and the wait time for food is not long at all. I tend to go here only for dinner though since the lunch menu is smaller."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and I'm staying near the Thai House, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I did a take out order of Chicken Pad Thai.  It was just OK.  They certainly gave you alot for your money.  But I thought the noodles were very overcooked and the chicken a little dry.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was great though and everyone seemed very friendly.  I'm going to give them another try.  Reading all the positive reviews, I'm thinking it could have just been an off night for the chef."}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic tasting Thai food in the area. The staff pays attention to details and provide outstanding service consistently."}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday and it was fabulous.  The food was wonderful and the service was attentive and friendly.  I had Sweet and Sour Chicken which was Great and my friends had Pad Thai which they loved.  I will be back.  We went for lunch so the prices were not too bad but it did look like dinner might be expensive.  HOWEVER, this is one of the few places that the food is well worth the money.  Kudos to That House for one of the best meals I have had since moving to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is real Thai food! My wife is Thai and I've spent many months in Thailand and this place is legit. The decor is really nice and cozy. The food was exactly what I would expect to find in Thailand. The staff was very friendly and prompt. We will definitely be back. Most of the bad reviews are from people who ordered something like Pad Thai or fried rice... Which is an immediate indicator that these people don't know Thai food. Pad Thai is not really a popular dish in Thailand... It's about the most \"American\" dish you can order at a Thai restaurant. Ignore those reviews because those people clearly don't understand Thai food if they're ordering that."}
{"text":"We found this place from another yelp review and let me just say I am not disappointed. This place had great food many choices for every kind of eater. The service was great, the food was excellent, and the restaurants appearance was just so clean and welcoming. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone passing by."}
{"text":"Thai house was good but not the best thai place I have had. I had the red curry chicken medium and it didn't seem to be spicy enough for being medium. Also it was pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff delicious food great prices. Cozy atmosphere. One of my favorites in clt."}
{"text":"I've never had Thai food that blew me away-until now. 
I looked up reviews on Yelp after my coworkers recommended it and they raved! So I got the Kai Khua and it was on POINT. Everyone was super polite, the place is beautiful and our orders were exact. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants I really liked in the University area.  Service was good.  They were very attentive, but it was slow.  Very nice decor.

Vegetarian friendly like all Thai places.  I wish they had their menu online so I could remember the name of what I had.  I am always excited when I see a vegetarian item on a Thai menu that I haven't seen before, so that's what I got.  Not sure what it was called, but it was grilled eggplant with basil and veggies. I pretty much stopped ordering eggplant at restaurants unless it was deep-fried, because every time I got eggplant grilled, baked, etc., even at white tablecloth places, it was not done and not very good.  But I wanted to see what the Thai take on eggplant was, and it was delicious!!!  Perfectly grilled, and great by itself, but excellent with the basil veggies.  I would still be hesitant about ordering it some place else, but would definitely have it again here.

The main reason I'm not giving this place full stars is that it was kind of pricey.  I mean pricey in general for Thai, but considering that it is the only Thai place in the university area, really pricey.  This kind of upset me, as most college students aren't exactly rolling in the dough yet.

Still, very good.  Recommended for a date or with family."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We really enjoyed the red and green curry dishes along with the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I don't like this place as it is not clean. They don't have any healthy foods in the menu. They have only all fried foods."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with a friend... I had the Pad Thai(Thai style) Wednesday lunch special.  YUM YUM... and the spinach & chicken pot stickers were yum also.  Definite spot to visit when you are in the University area and in the mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"Having a meal out in a restaurant is not easy when someone has a food allergy. One of our PAK members recently said \"Alex and Nan totally get it and can easily accommodate on many dishes. They also know their product and can let you know what is not safe\""}
{"text":"Really bad food.  Twice I went ask for Thai hot but it was blend no test.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Came on my own as I was traveling alone for work.  Quick service on a Monday night, very tasty!  Asked for hot which was a smidge shy of perfect.  Maybe next time I'll ask for the extra hot!  Looking forward to my next trip to the area."}
{"text":"The only good thing right here is the taste of the food is good. That's it.

There are several bad things you need to pay attention to:

1. Be attention to your bill. They may charge your disinfectant smell ice water as a coke.

2. Be attention to whether they have served you all the food you ordered. For example, they didn't  serve me the soup in the combo until I asked a waiter to do it.

3. Be attention if you are a uncc student and you want to get a uncc discount. This place is the only one that asks all the guests to provide the uncc id to get a discount. So you should be attention that if you want to get the discount, remember to ask all your friends to bring the uncc id with them.

Overall, if you can't live without curry, you have to come here because they have the best curry in the area. However, if you can live without curry, my suggestion is to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Worse customer service I have ever received from any Thai restaurant. My take out order was completely wrong and they seemed uninterested in helping me because of my attire! If you crave Thai food, try someplace else."}
{"text":"LOVEEE the food here. So far I have had the Basil Rice and the Pad Thai. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"I really like Thai food and I really like this restaurant. Lunch is a great value since you automatically get soup and spring roll with your order. I love the Pad See Ew and the curry dishes. Nice decor and speedy service."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for a decent plate of thai food, service is good and the food never disappoints. Great place for spicy food lovers."}
{"text":"My server never forgets my family and I. Always makes us feel welcomed, and the service is superb."}
{"text":"We loved the food. It was spicy but not hot. They can adjust the heat level up to 4 or 5. The service was great!  The food came out quickly and  hot. If we lived here we would go often.  Dinner for two was $38.00 with tax."}
{"text":"This has been a staple of the University area for a long time. They have all of the standard Thai fair, and everything I've ordered over the years has been delicious. Lunch and dinner both start with a small bowl of a wonderfull light soup, not salty or overpowering in any way, almost delicate in taste. If you feel like it and it is available order the mango desert, it's truly something to savor, sweet without being sickening and light, but isn't the whole point of Thai cuisine to be light and tasty. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is becaust the mango dessert is not always available ... booo"}
{"text":"My family and I come here often.  The food is ALWAYS good and the service is great.  It really is one of my most favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"it's a good restaurant that you can come once every week or two. Red Curry is great ! But service in the restaurant is not really good."}
{"text":"I'm from California and haven't had any good Thai food since I've been. Every place I've to didn't have that \"Thai taste\". That's until I came here. I was so happy  to have some actual  Thai fried rice and not the fake kind. It's so flavorful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A real go to place. Food is consistently good.  Never had a bad meal here.  We have been many, many times.  Pad Thai, King & I, Rama of Sunset, Eggplant dish are some of our favorites.  Chicken and seafoods are always cooked perfectly, tender, juicy, flavorful.  Noodles are just right, jasmine rice always perfect.  Service never fails to be good.  Servers are pleasant, and ready to answer questions about the dishes.  Food comes out quickly, piping hot.  Presentations are beautiful.  We have taken many friends here with us, and everyone has raved about the food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Wednesday night at 7 pm.  In a strip mall but great atmosphere.  Food was excellent and had their seafood special with a squid salad.  Service was pretty good but lacking a knife... Which came later..so it's a 4-5"}
{"text":"Love Thai House! Super friendly service with delicious food. Recommend going for lunch over dinner as you get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Food was good. You can taste the difference with the various herbs used in the food. Great service and a nice price point for lunch.  The parking lot can be crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte so far. Whenever I crave anything Thai I come here and get my fix. Very fast service and good food. Doesn't really get better for the service and price!"}
{"text":"Let's start by bottom lining it:  it's good food, authentic Thai but nothing \"exceptional\" and as other reviewers have noted, it's expensive for Thai.

The woodwork is beautiful.  I disagree with the reviewer who though the decor was cheesy.  I've spent plenty of time in Thailand and the carved woodwork is very authentic.

The service was quirky.  Everyone was very kind, smiling and eager to please... but not really around that much.  It wasn't really slow exactly; it was just a little \"odd\" somehow.  Again, very sweet staff, just a little scarce.

The food:  I had my old stand-by Red Curry Chicken and it was good.  I've taken to ordering my food at That restaurants I don't know as \"mild\" and then asking for the Fish Sauce with Chili's to spice it up.  Their fish sauce chili was fresh and authentic.  The curry was very good.  Chicken was tender and not overcooked, as can too often be the case.

I also had the \"Tod Mon\" appetizer which was actually VERY good.  Tod Mon (actually Tod Mon Pla) is a \"fish cake\" which if you haven't tried them before might not sound that good.  They are very nice. Served with a sweet-spicy cucumber and crushed peanut dipping sauce, they were really good, and their sauce was unique, having larger chunks of cucumber than I usually see. (If you go somewhere and see Tod Mon Goong; that's the same thing with shrimp instead of fish and that is really delicious.)

As I said about Monsoon Thai, I felt somehow disappointed in general.  I just don't like spending north of $20 bucks for a Thai appetizer and entree.  My favorite Thai places are usually small, \"mom & pop\" type places, rather inexpensive with awesome food.  So while the food was definitely good, and I would order both items again, it just irks me that they charge so much here. I'm NOT saying that \"$20 bucks is expensive;just that it seems expensive for Thai food compared to what I'm used to.)

Having just relocated from Nashville where I had several really awesome places with excellent food and very inexpensive prices, I don't like, as other reviewers have commented, paying these prices.

Go.  You won't be disappointed but you'll pay a little more than (I think) you should

PS- My yardstick is a little street vendor at the head of Khao San Road in Bangkok.  I also cook my own Thai which has caused my Thai friends to suggest I open my own restaurant.  I can tell ya - that AIN'T gonna happen.   I just mention it to say, I've had the real deal; made the real deal  and that's what I compare to anything I have at a restaurant here.

I'm still looking for a Thai place \"to die for\" here in Charlotte.  You can be sure I'll post it when I (hopefully) find it."}
{"text":"I really love Thai food and was looking forward to eating here as I have heard really good things about it.  I left unsatisfied though with the food.   
The service was really good.  I was quickly seated, the servers were really nice, I received my food quickly, and my water was always full.   
I wasn't happy with the flavor and taste of the food.   I got the traditional Pad Thai and it had way too much sauce on it.  There was no egg that came with it and the flavor was way too sweet.   The noodles were good fine.  I found the flavor to be just so-so.  I ordered a 3.5 on the spicy level and that was perfect for me....had some kick, but my mouth was not burning.   I likely won't be returning to eat there again."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Proportion could be a little more for the price.  Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love thai house, but today was a disappointment. 
I came to eat right before lunch hour, so it wasn't busy. But it took forever for my food.... a couple came in 25 mins after I did, and they got their food before me.... and I ordered the same thing they did!!! 
Another thing was that one of the workers was taking up used plates and utensils. I placed my fork on top of someone else's used fork and plate and the lady & a guy told me to take back my fork cause I would need it for my meal...( the fork touched someone else's used fork and plate...) they didn't offer to get me another fork or anything, they told me to keep it and use it for my meal.....that is just unsanitary.....
I lost my appetite right after, so once my food came out, I asked for a Togo box and left..."}
{"text":"The Thai House is the first place I ever ate Thai food, ( back when they had a location on Sharon Amity, I think it is called Inka Pollo now , so you're best bet is to hit up the Thai House at the University, same owners, same great menu.) and needless to say it was great.  I am a big fan of the Pad See Ewe; the big chunks of beef, seasoned with thick noodles, and the perfect balance of broccoli and  scrambled egg, make this one of my favorite meals. The taste, the mouth feel all combine to create a very enjoyable eating experience, not to mention the copious servings.  The Pad Thai with shrimp is very good also.  Thai House's lunch specials are really hard to beat, and whether you are dining in or taking out the service here is quick and courteous.  The restaurant is clean, with high ceilings and beautiful Thai wood carvings on the wall and as part of the central cashier station in the middle of the restaurant.  Great tasting Thai food, affordable prices, pleasant relaxing, Asian ambiance, Thai House is a winner."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai restaurant in the University area if not in all of Charlotte! I get the pad Thai here with pork and very spicy. The food isn't cheap but the portions are large and service is quick! If you like Thai food this is your place!"}
{"text":"Team dinner scheduled at Thai University.  This must be a popular spot for team events because we saw a lot of big tables & patrons looking ,Ike they were there to celebrate a long workday

Dishes ranged from Pad Thai to Green Curry to curried fish & most loved their dishes.  I am a spicy girl & was the only person who had asked for my dish to be spicy but it came out non spicy.....just a bunch of red pepper flakes

So for about 10 winners but my dish the only disappointment have to think this place is A-OK.  I would seek elsewhere if looking for Thai again but was advised this is a fav coworker group spot.....so going with the majority vote"}
{"text":"I looked in Chakalaka (charlotte) for different Thai places in the surrounding area trying to see if I could find better Thai places. Let me help you out, there ain't none! The menu is cheaper for lunches, most places in Charlotte will have lunch specials, the atmosphere is cool, very cultural. It's a very nice place for a date. They also have TVs set up, although I'm not sure that they actually show any special events, like a fight or a specific game. The food is why you want to come here. Try the padkee mao, pad Thai of coarse, any of the noodle dishes you can't go wrong! Curry is very decent. I came here almost once a month and maybe once was the service mediocre. Service is great but when you get annoying first timers they really screw up the service timing, especially when you get big groups, they are 99% time clueless. I seen it. Anyways save yourself some trouble you want good Thai food in Charlotte, this is the place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Charlotte. Fresh ingredients, super flavorful, and just so damn good. Me and my lady visited a week or so ago but I'm just now getting around to the review and man if you haven't been here yet you are missing out! First, our waiter was very nice and accommodating and checked on us periodically throughout our meal and never let our waters run low (excellent if you order a spicy dish). The overall ambience of the place is laid back with your standard booths, tables, and bar seats. Traditional Thai art adorned the walls and near the bar area and the lights were dim but not too dark. Now to the good stuff, the food. That's what you read Yelp reviews for anyway right? For starters my lady and I split the som tum famous Thai salad. It features shredded green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and lettuce, topped with a ground peanut hot and sour mix as a dressing. Let me tell you folks with a hefty appetite, split this dish. It's a huge salad and for only $7.95 it's a great deal. Next the main dish. I ordered the red curry chicken with brown rice and I was more than satisfied. The flavor was supreme and the chicken was a great compliment to the basil, bamboo shoots, green peas, bell peppers and coconut milk. If anything I would want and even more spicy/coconut flavor. So much food remained I even ordered a to go container of brown rice and had leftover Thai for lunch the next day. If you ever find yourself in the university area I suggest you give them a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place for Thai food in Charlotte. While I think the food is pretty good, I pretty much order the same thing every time I come: Pad kee mow (thai style) and Som tom (papaya salad). I have had these at other Thai restaurants around Charlotte and out of state and nothing comes close to those here. The service is always fantastic! They make you feel so welcome and are always friendly and accommodating. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for 7+ years and the staff is quick and friendly, what i can say lunch time is better, dinner hour is a little pricey to my taste but maybe im used to going for lunch all the time. Food choices: try the Red Curry and Chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"Solid place to stop for lunch if you're jonesing for some Thai food. I love the inside-it's very dim and intimate with asian artifacts and plants. Service was kinda meh, I had to flag one of the 13 servers down just to get a glass of water. Then, I ordered the lunch special pad thai which comes with soup if you're dining in and the soup never came out. However, they redeemed themself with the pad thai. Even though it was lunch, it was clearly enough for two people so I took a few bites and then boxed up the rest to go. 

Two meals for $7? Works for me!"}
{"text":"Very good! Tempura was very good. They bring a soup out initially that is very tasty!

The Pad Thai is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Staff was very attentive and polite. I had the yellow curry (chicken), cucumber salad, and thai iced tea. I will be back to enjoy some pad thai soon!"}
{"text":"The staff gets 5 stars. The food gets 4. I have friends who are regulars here and rave about it. Fried tofu appetizer was really nice.  Spring rolls (not fried)... not so good. I had pad thai that was decent. My husband had the pad talay (a seafood dish) that he enjoyed in the restaurant but couldn't finish the leftovers. I think he's not used to those spices- they didn't set well with him. Service is excellent! The staff is just so friendly and has a sense of humor."}
{"text":"I've had three different experiences at the Thai House.  My first was our office holiday luncheon.  We were seated way in the back corner of the restaurant.  The food was so-so and the service was the same, I think because we had such a large group.  

The second time was a two-person lunch meeting.  The service was much better, the experience better, and I got a different impression of the Thai House (especially sitting more in the highly decorated center of the room).  

Based on the 2nd experience, I went there for dinner one evening with a friend of mine.  The food was a lot more pricier at night, the food average, and the service slow (when the restaurant wasn't even busy) but rushed to get you out of there once you were finished, if that makes any sense. 

So after three experiences (one good, two bad), I've had to determine that I can find better Thai places around town.  I will give them credit for their decor inside, though.  They're in a strip mall, but they've managed to give it that Thai feel as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"The food was good but they seemed to be in a rush to get us out the door. Also failed to ask if we wanted dessert before bringing the check."}
{"text":"I ended up eating here twice in the last month alone, and both times the Sweet and Sour Chicken was amazing. I'd recommend this place to anyone. :-)"}
{"text":"If you see the red comments that state \"closes in....\" Go ahead and subtract 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR from that time, because the snobby staff behind the counter will already be counting their tips and cashing out. I simply asked \"can I take away an order please?\" And got a reply of \"we are closed now.\" While watching several other customers eat. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've gone to Thai House multiple times for lunch. Service has always been quick and I have never had a bad meal. I've never had a GREAT meal either. I do want to try it for dinner to see how it is different, since I have only experienced the lunch menu.

Pad thai and pad khing are good. The curries are ok but i was expecting more spice. I will chalk that up to me not asking for in more spicy.

Usually, I ask for medium spicy. This has ranged from mild to hot so you're mileage WILL vary I think.

If you want to err on the cautious side you can always order you're dish mild and add in the different spicy condiments that they offer."}
{"text":"So this is my third time here. I like to come here when I visit my friend that lives in Charlotte. I ordered fried chicken spring rolls and I could barely taste any chicken and all I saw was vegetables. Should have just ordered the sprig rolls instead. The Curry is always good and flavorful and their combination fried rice are amazing. The staff are polite and very attentive. If I go back, I will make sure to take photos."}
{"text":"Our favorite pad Thai in charlotte. We always get the shrimp pad Thai and it's always consistently good. The service is quick and they are always nice and welcoming. One of my favorite places in charlotte! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I havn't given this place 5 stars before.  Until recently it was one of the few if not the only place in University area to get a decent meal.  That said, it certainly isn't perfect.

Still great food, still awkward service.  Parking seems to have gotten worse over the years. Most recenlty we had some serious communication problems with our server. She even stole my food before I was done.  I like my leftovers!

I'll be back though....."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Charlotte!

My absolute favorite thing here is their Tom Yung Koong soup.  If you have never had it before, it's a spicy lemon grass based broth with shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It also has hot chili oil in it, and I think white pepper.  It starts out spicy, but by the time you're at the bottom of the bowl it's downright hot!  But, it's DELICIOUS, so if you like spicy and flavorful food you've got to try it.

I've only had a couple of other dishes here and the standout was crispy duck.  Their presentation is really nice, as well as the food being tasty and the decor really let's you know you're in a Thai restaurant.  The service has always been good the times I've been.

The prices are about middle of the road, in my book.  I would not say they're cheap, , but the quality of the food is really high, so I don't mind paying a bit more for a great meal.  People go here in jeans and t-shirts, but it is a really nicely decorated place with good atmosphere, so I wouldn't rule it out if you're looking for someplace for a nice dinner outing."}
{"text":"Thai house was ok. I liked seeing how much the people  took effort in presentation of the establishment as well as the food. We loved our oyster appetizer. 

I felt my main dish, the Pud Sey Ew, was average. It just didn't have that quality that I've become accustomed to eating in south Charlotte. Samantha didn't like her main dish really at all. 

The best part of the evening was spending time with my baby enjoying a quiet evening listing to the light Thai music and the wine... that wine was awesome"}
{"text":"Go here all the time, though sometimes meals are a little slow to get to the table, meals are always excellent. My guy always has yum beef really spicy. I go for the Thai roasted chicken which is phenomenal. Have to figure out how to make that one at home."}
{"text":"Some have knocked the service here but on our visit the staff bent over backwards for us. They were attentive but not overbearing.

The food was good. We had the tom sum (papaya salad) and it was plentiful and tasty. Not as spicy as I have had at other places, but flavorful. The panang duck was tasty as well - nice thing about duck is it is fattier than chicken so can take some overcooking, and I think mine was a bit over. It was complimented by plentiful broccoli, carrots, and snow peas. The sauce had a good level of heat for me - which is to say, spicy but not too spicy. I asked for 2 on their 4 star heat scale.

The prices are a bit higher than I find in Winston-Salem, but the restaurant is between the Carolina Medical Center and UNCC so I would expect to pay more and the portions are generous.

I would definitely go back if I find myself in the area again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The portions are big. Lunchtime is always affordable and satisfying. The restaurant itself is so beautiful. The staff is super attentive and eager to please. My favorite dish is the green curry with pork. I'm always tempted to get it every time I go, but I want to try everything. The Kai khua also gets an honorable mention from me. I'm always on my way back here"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but the waitstaff was sleeping in a booth with their shoes kicked off. No one woke up so rather than disturb their sleep, we left."}
{"text":"The food here is always great and the service is wonderful as well! They take good care of you and are very kind. I'm a big fan of their curries. Very good flavor and I love that the vegetarian options includes tofu in it. The fried tofu appetizer is delicious as well. They have vegetarian and vegan options (the vegetarian curries)."}
{"text":"I loved the food at the Thai House!  I ordered the pad thai with medium spice and it was delicious.  I like my food spicy hot and medium spice at most places is still not quite enough but medium at the Thai House really has some kick!  My original intentions were to eat half of my plate and take the rest home but it was so good I couldn't stop eating.  By time I was finished there wasn't enough left over to mess with taking home.

The decorations were almost a little cheesy and the waiters were wearing funny baggy pants uniforms.  The service was decent until we reached the end of our meal and had to wait for what seemed like 15 minutes or more to get our bill.  I think our original waiter left and our new waiter wasn't sure what to do with our table, but he eventually figured it out.  Fortunately we had good company and didn't mind the long wait for our bill.  I will definitely be back for the pad thai!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai Food in Charlotte. I have been coming here for 10 years and not once have I been disappointed! The service is exceptional! 

You can't beat the lunch specials! Seriously amazing food!"}
{"text":"Authentic Pad Thai!  The jasmine sweet tea is great!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"1. Appetizer was so so. 
2. It took forever to get our food. 
3. Waitress did not check on us at all. 
4. Their food used to be much better a few years ago. 

Disappointed. Nasty."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had in the US. Great Duck specials on Monday.. Best Yellow Curry Fried Rice.."}
{"text":"I haven't had a meal at Thai House that wasn't good, but I constantly run into the same problem.  Order my food \"Thai Hot. As spicy as you'll make it\" and i end up with, \" Kinda spicy, but not so much that i wouldn't give it to a kid.\" I know I dont look like I can take it, but don't mess with mama's spicy food. She doesn't take kindly. Also, the potstickers are oddly grainy.

That being said, the soup is great and i love the flavor on the Pad Kee Mao & Kra Prow. Thai House is a great standby and if I'm up that way it's a good contender, but rarely will I pass up closer, spicier Thai places to head there."}
{"text":"The best in Charlotte. Consistency is key, and this place executes every time. Been coming here for years, and plan on coming here for years to come. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Just recently tried Thai food for the first time and I am hooked!! The Chicken Pad Thai with a medium spice is out of this world  workers here are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. If you're in the area you have to stop by."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is super friendly and work fast during the lunch and dinner rush. Food is amazing. The satay is my favorite appetizer and it's much better than the one at Thai Taste. They always give you a mountain of food, especially when you get take out. If you love Thai food, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Service was poor: we asked for a bowl to cool down the soup. They said we have to buy another soup to get the bowl! My drinks were wrong (2nd time!). We ordered basil fried rice- food was acceptable. I was not expecting a fine dining anyway. Place is okay for a take-out or a quick bite. If you want to enjoy a good dining experience, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my fave Thai place, but it has recently let me down a little. Like always, I crave Thai food and I always always always come here. I am in a very committed relationship with this place because the food is divine. I called for takeout the other night and called 10+ times and no one picked up. It was a normal day and it had to be open. I'm still going to give it 5 stars though, because I have been coming here for years and have yet to find a Thai place on a higher level than here. The duck is key, the coconut soup is key, and the Pad Thai will always be key. Their Thai tea is the best, no argument there. If you like fish, get the fish in the chili sauce. Prices always range, but it's worth it. The shrimp wrapped in rice paper and chicken skewers are delicious appetizers also! The Yum Neur is a delicious steak salad and I highly recommend. Overall delicious! Service can be slow but it's worth it for good food."}
{"text":"Try the pineapple curry duck and fried spring rolls, they are delicious! Beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere. This is the best Thai food around."}
{"text":"So sad.had dinner at the Thai house tonight.this use to be a very good restaurant. Food was terrible.Thom kha soup was super sweet..tasted like sugar water. Had the Kang musaman.greasy and lots of peanuts.this use to be one of their best.dont know what has happened.service was not  what it use to be. Will be going to MAI THAI II at concord mills from now on.! !!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience at the Thai house with my fellow yelpers...everyone loved their dish (and the variety on the menu was huge).  The 'mild' spice had a lot of kick to it and I'd definitely recommend that if you want some zing to your dish, but don't want to leave with your mouth on fire.  The wait staff at first was very attentive and their dress was pretty awesome, some crazy colors for sure!  As the dinner wore on, I think our waiter forgot our table existed, another waiter, after almost 30 min realized we had never received our check and promptly brought it to us - I was beginning to think a free meal was in the making!  Great company, great atmosphere, and great food...a solid 4 star rating from me."}
{"text":"First time dinner there last night valentines day. Nice surprise. Great service, food, and the place was clean. Next stop the Gastonia location which is closer."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've ever had (so far) and, believe me, I'm on a hunt. The atmosphere was beautiful, the servers were friendly and attentive. Too bad I live thousands of miles away. The yellow curry was pretty tasty, too."}
{"text":"My first time and I will never go back. Save your money and stomach and go somewhere else.   She charged me $14 plus instead of $11 - so since it was my first time I thought I read the menu wrong and paid without questioning it. we
I ordered chicken dish with brown rice. When I got home I found some kind of ground red meat in a dishwater sauce with hardly any flavored a tiny tiny container of white rice. So, since I was starving, I ate as much of it as I could tolerate.  Should have thrown it away as my stomach kept me up all night after eating it.  Terrible food, worse service and overpriced."}
{"text":"We ordered fried potstickers (spinach and ground chicken filling), stir fried soft rice noodles with beef, thai tangy and salty salad with beef (cant remember the name but it was #23 on their menu), shrimp green curry, and pineapple fried rice. Everything was delicious. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We having been dining/ Ordering takeouts from this place for more 7 years and I haven't reviewed this place :( 
This is one among those places which are consistent, maintains the same taste and quality.
Our regular orders are Duck Curry,Chicken Fried Rice, chicken Pad Thai, Basil fired rice, Pad Kraprow. All these are delicious and the portions are reasonably big and are served with spring roll. They serve complimentary soup if you are dining in for lunch.
The dining in experience was never that good."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Thai place in Charlotte!!! My family and I love Asian food and eat here all the time (and have for years)! Beautifully decorated with great service and outstanding, authentic Thai food! Their Pad Thai is phenomenal, and I love the Panang curry! Also don't forget to get some delicious Thai tea and mango sticky rice dessert! :)"}
{"text":"This hands down the best Thai food outside of Thailand that I have ever had. Always excellent service and the staff always treats us like family. If you like Thai food do yourself a favor and go eat there for your next meal"}
{"text":"Very good pad Thai and fresh spring rolls ! Anthemic Thai cuisine here ! The waiter was hilarious and very attentive and kind. Had a great experience here, more so than other Thai places I've been ! 

I'll def be back to this place when I visit charlotte again !"}
{"text":"Got bugs in my food-tom kha.
I would not recommend coming here
We requested no peanuts due to not allergy.
They still out it on the food.
Service is very slow."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-5
Service-3
Food-3
Strikeouts-0/3

First Thai place is NC, and the furnishing is very surprising for a corner of a strip mall.  The prices definitely cater to the area due to being located near university. Customer service was pretty good up to the point where we get the bill and that took a while since we were a large group of 7 and wanted separate bills. Some other tables went up to pay which took precedent over ours. Didn't really bother me though since we weren't in a hurry.

The food on the other hand was not too shabby!! Got a Thai iced tea, assorted shrimp and veggie tempura and seafood pad Thai. The Thai iced tea was a tad too sweet, and I have a sweet tooth. The tempura variety was definitely on the spot. Delicious, Didn't taste like the Japanese variety, and had lots of flavour. The pad Thai I got was mild, which was exactly what I ordered. It also had tons of different seafood. Got like 4-5 full sized scallops, which was very surprising. Overall food was good, no complaints, but no wow factor.

Definitely a place to come and support if you're a local looking for a change of food. They also have a variety of spicy ness levels!"}
{"text":"When I walked into Thai House, I found it darker and much busier than expected for a Wednesday lunch. Nonetheless, I was seated immediately to wait for a friend.  The servers that helped me didn't speak much English but they were very friendly and attentive.  

The lunch menu was short and simple. Very cheap and all looked scrumptious.  

I had the dish with sweet and sour sauce + cashews and it was deliciousssss. I also had it \"spicy\" but I guess their spicy isn't really. 

Not too sure if I'd come for dinner since it is considerably more expensive but Thai House is a really good option for anyone looking for a casual lunch"}
{"text":"I love coming to eat here. Good atmosphere, good food, friendly and professional staff. All lunch specials comes with a cup of  soup which is delicious! The Pad Thai and Basil fried rice is a must. Definitely one of the best Asian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, what a place. I was back to visit Dubai lounge in the middle of the week and wanted to grab some food. With quite a few options in the plaza I saw a very small but nicely decorated Thai place and I just lost it. I've been looking for a good Thai place ever since I moved here and so far I've been disappointed with the Thai Basils of the city. Tucked inside a nice plaza near university, Thai House is a really nice family owned place that packs a ton of culture and flavor into their venue and food. 

Food & Alcohol: 
Started off with the Singha beer and proceeded to order the Yellow Curry, my favorite Thai dish. The sauce was just perfect and the potatoes and onions were cooked to perfection. It went well with the rice and I literally cleaned the bowl. I ordered with the pork which was alright, I felt it needed some seasoning but overall it was a great meal. My friends ordered the Pad Thai and some carnivore paradise of a meal with a ton of beef, garlic, and onions which were both delicious.

Venue:
Very very very nice venue. It doesn't have a distinct smell you may find in some Asian influence restaurants, it's extremely clean, the décor is lively, and is spacious. They have a nice little bar in the back of the room which must be for looks because it doesn't seem like anyone would want to be there. Overall a nice atmosphere with plenty of customers.

Service:
Quick and friendly service. You can tell they take great pride and care of their establishment as it is family owned. Couldn't be happier.

Overall: Will be back again as it trumps any Thai place I've tried so far in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Thai House, everything I've gotten was delicious! The staff is also more than willing to adjust the spiciness of an entree, or adjust a meal for vegetarians. My favorites (so far) have been the Pad Se Ew and yellow curry. Their springrolls (I ask for vegetarian ones although they normally come with chicken) are excellent."}
{"text":"Out in Charlotte for work and I spent a good bit of money the night before at Capital Grille (which was a total waste at the charlotte location!), so I came here looking for even decent Thai on a lower budget. Thai House at University hit the nail on those expectations. 

Above average Thai for a good price. Thai food lovers have a pretty great option here near the University.

Food: I had the Pad Kee Mow beef (like Drunken Noodles) and it was terrific."}
{"text":"Really good food. Great atmosphere.  Really good service.  Will be back.  Had the yellow curry at spice level 4.5 and it was perfect. Having leftovers for lunch.  Still tastes great."}
{"text":"The absolute best food experience in a long time. Our waiter was so attentive, gracious and funny. He just added to the great experience on top of the amazing meal....a whole, fried red snapper with a sweet & spicy sauce and fresh veggies. I could have eaten 2 more. 

I will be back and will tell everyone to give them a visit."}
{"text":"Great little spot for lunch. Very fresh food and the service was attentive and friendly. I ordered the lunch pad see ew with shrimp ($10.95) and a Thai tea. They ask you how spicy you would like the dish on a scale of 0-5. I ordered it at a 4, which wasn't really spicy at all. Next time I'll go for the full 5! The Thai tea was good but a little too sweet for my taste. I will definitely return when I'm craving Thai for lunch."}
{"text":"Best place for Thai food in Charlotte and nearby area ? Yes !! 
Ordered pad Thai and Panang curry and both the dishes were well prepared."}
{"text":"The ambiance at this place is pretty cool. When I went, it wasn't too busy so the noise level want to high. They had a interesting menu and the food was very good. However this restaurant lacks good customer service. The server are not subtly rude and aren't very helpful. One particularly, when we asked her if she could help us after delivering it appetizers frankly just said No and walked away. I would give it to her that maybe she overwhelmed but as I stated earlier the restaurant was not busy at all. There was no utensils on the table and it took literally 5 minutes to get my servers attention to that fact. Overall my visit was tarnished by the experience but I would go again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I have a deep passionate love affair with their chicken pad Thai. I tried their fried tofu appetizer for the first time & it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Mmmm soo good I go all the time to get the pineapple fried rice and it's great. The decor is very beautiful and elegant and the service is always great"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and the quality of the food has been excellent every time.  The fresh rolls and pad kee mao are delicious.  I ordered the pad kee mao 5 on spice and they did not skimp on the heat."}
{"text":"Walked in and since I was alone, i always like to sit at the bar. Well there was no bar only a place to order to go food. The lady at the counter asked was I placing a to go order and I told her no that I wanted to sit here and eat as to not take up a table. Well wouldn't you know what I said got me ignored, no water or anything. She just kept answering the phone taking every order via phone but mine as I sat in front of her. She disappeared into the back and was MISSING IN ACTION.  I ended up taking a table and next thing I know a lovely waitress shows up.

She asked for my drink order and since I waited so long at the counter I went ahead and placed my order. I order Tom Kha and Squid Tempura and both were off the charts amazing. The food alone is the reason why I have them the rating that I did. I will be back but will not go to the counter unless I am placing a to go order."}
{"text":"These guys are the best! I've had Thai food all over the world and no where can match this place!"}
{"text":"I love love love Thai food. This place is awesome. The restaurant is nicely decorated. You have a choice of sitting inside or outside and it is located on the boardwalk in the University area. We went during prom season so the area was packed. The food was hot and awesome!!!! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"My wife really likes this place, I thought it was very generic tasting, no kick at all."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from here a bunch of times, always the Pad Thai and with either chicken or shrimp.  I don't like spicy food because I don't have a tolerance for it, so I always get the Pad Thai with no spice.  I like it.  Sometimes I will be sitting at my desk at work and get a craving and will just pick up and leave to run down the street to Thai House and its always ready w/in 5-10 minutes from when I call.  When you walk in the door the employees are always friendly, and when I leave they all thank me and wish me well.  What's not to like!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices and impeccable service. Everyone works together to ensure you're being taken care of - water was never empty, I never wondered when my food was coming, etc. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! This was my first time earing here (I think) and I loved it. I got the yellow curry with bell pepper instead of potato. It does not seem like a lot of food but it does go far. I order takeout and can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow once everything has set in the seasonings overnight. This place is located near Walgreens. Great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai in Charlotte by far! They use the greatest amount and variety of vegetables, a flavorful and robust sauce, and a good amount of peanuts and bean sprouts to garnish. I've found some other places to be quite bland and one note, the Pad Thai here is anything but, despite how spicy you request it.

The quality is also excellent whether dine-in or carry out. I finally went in for lunch and for $8 had a small bowl of soup, a spring roll and a large portion on Pad Thai. My dish was vegetarian and delicious with some large pieces of tofu. The chicken and shrimp options are also good here. 

It's been a while since I've had any of there other dishes but I've been nothing but impressed!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. I had a Tom Yum and the Thai Salad with Peanut sauce.
I have had many Thai Salads at other restaurants which prominently feature fried cubes of tofu. These tofu bits were so miniscule (about 1 cm square) it was like when you are a kid desperately hunting for those little Lucky Charms in your cereal! They kindly brought me some additional tofu. They were also super accommodating with the Tom Yum. I asked for it vegetarian, hold the mushrooms and add rice noodles. I really appreciated how flexible they were. The coconut broth was decent but nothing to write home about. 
I would eat here in again when I am in town but would love to find something even more delicious. 
Service was good in some respects, the servers were kind and friendly but they way they laid my plates down was like someone passing a baton in a relay race. They would whizz by and just drop a bowl of something on my table without a word or without pausing to check if I needed something. I had to really wait for  a few people passing by before I was able get there attention to get that additional tofu. They seemed very preoccupied and busy although the restaurant was less than half full."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of my friend's sister that lived in Charlotte. Great recommendation! I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.  We went on--I think--a Wednesday which they have a lunch special for pad thai. I ended up getting the chicken pad thai special and it was delicious! You have to mix the entire plate including pepper and sugar in order to get the full taste! They also gave us a chicken soup appetizer which was also pretty good. The waitresses and waiters were nice, but we were being waited on by like 3 different people ..? I didn't mind it much though, just confusing. The pricing wasn't too bad either. For really good thai food, it was pretty cheap! Oh and if you can't find parking right in front of the restaurant, there's a whole big parking deck behind and on top where you can take the stairs or elevator."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the University area! I may be biased since I basically grew up my entire life going to this restaurant, but the food and service is impeccable. The restaurant is designed and decorated as if we were in a Thai restaurant in Thailand, which makes the mood and ambiance so relaxing and much more enjoyable.

Anything on the menu is great, but the pad-see-ew and fried rice (both with chicken) are two of my favorite dishes here. You won't be disappointed with either one! Also get their deep fried egg rolls as an appetizer - so good! Try the Thai iced tea as well - best drink to have there!

Staff are always on point with their service and will provide an exceptional experience. Try it out - you'll want to go back all the time!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai spot! Great service and great food! Anytime in Charlotte I make sure to find time to eat here."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for work and wanted to try some of the options of a larger city (than were I currently live at least).  I went here with a co-worked and had an amazing good meal.  We based our decision off other Yelp reviewers and lie normal - the yelpers were on to a good thing.  I believe this restaurant serves very authentic Thai food and many people coming and going throughout the night seemed like regulars as the staff knew them, which is always a good thing. 

Overall it's great food, nice atmospher, and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I love thai food but I'm not a big fan of the flavors from this restaurant. The pad thai tasted very different from any pad thai I had before, and I always try the pad thai at any thai restaurant. The panang curry was very soupy, again a very different flavor and kind of bland. The service is great but unfortunately the food not so good in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. The chicken smelt like it was cooked in old oil. I've heard from other people to not eat here.. definitely won't again."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and I love this place. You should try the fried rice with chicken or tofu, the pad thai is one of the best that I have eaten, the green and red curries are delicious. Most of the food in this restaurant is really good and good value for the price! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for dinner and ordered the Indian Yellow Curry fried rice, we also ordered Pad Thai, Yellow Curry and Chicken Fried rice, everything was delicious. I also had the Thai Tea and it was delicious. Overall one star off for the peanut sauce it was cold and not as sweet as it should be, IMO."}
{"text":"Horrible service, unhygienic environment, and oily food.  They have roaches that climb out of nowhere and when you scream, they try to act like they don't understand the word \"roach\"!!  Like, really?  When a person is freaking out, that is not the time to pretend you don't understand English.  Such a nasty place.  They actually had to rebuild the a portion of the restaurant because an employee set the roach bomb(s) off incorrectly and a fire started."}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago for the first time for dinner in a party of 4 adults and 2 kids and was seated immediately.

The decor was beautiful. The dark wood and sculptures were very pretty. Only concern were the dust collecting on the light fixtures and rods & pipes above us. And also, when our food came, it wasn't too pleasant to see the DIY network come on the TV above us of ppl cleaning bathrooms.

It didn't take too long for our waitress to get us our drinks but she never offered a booster or high chair for our kids, she hasn't even offered drinks to them and never gave them water or silverware either.

The food took awhile to get to us, but good food doesn't come fast. If I wanted fast food, I'd go to a drive-thru right? Our food came out in very different times and my husband's duck panang came last while everyone was close to being halfway done with their food. The food was delicious though. The best Thai food I've had since moving to the carolinas. Food concerns were the spice levels. I ordered the pad lee mow and my husband had the duck panang, both in mild, both very delicious but my husband's curry was very spicy, while mine had no spice at all. Also, our waters were not refilled until after we were done with our food. We weren't offered a box for our leftovers either.

I'll definitely come back but next time I'm in town, I'll just order take out."}
{"text":"I ordered pad see eew. It was good and extremely hot/fresh. Maybe future visits to try some curry..."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Thai House! My first time was a few months ago, it was my very first time trying Thai food ever. I stumbled across this little cute restaurant by looking for a restaurant close to ikea. I'm glad I decided to try something new that day. Since then I've tried multiple Thai restaurants & NONE have compared to this Amazing little authentic restaurant. The staff is friendly and polite. The restaurant has dimmed lighting, very relaxed. 

I recommend trying the Thai ice tea and the Thai ice coffee!! BEST EVER!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot!It was so good I went back again in the same week.I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai the first time and Shrimp Green Curry the second.Can I just say amazing!?The seasoning is perfected.It is so good I really can't find the words to describe it (shocking!) I like the setting too.Not too loud and nice decor.I was able to take some work in the second time to get done.If you are ever in the area,try it out!You may find a new favorite spot like me."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope. Potstickers were freezer burned and must have been warmed up in the microwave. The meat crumbled like  powder. The Chicken pad Thai was floating in what tasted like duck sauce. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Yellow fried chicken rice....this is just so delicious..only downside is its bit oily but the taste over rules all other things"}
{"text":"Our fave go-to Thai place. My bf loves their pork fried rice. Good menu - pretty good padthai. It's actually the best in Charlotte, but I have high expectations. Their green curry is good too, but sometimes has too much fish sauce in it..."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Thai House customer since they had their first location on Sharon Amity. I'm a vegetarian and they have a wonderful selection of food for vegetarians. I usually get the deep-fried veggie spring rolls, which are the best that I've ever tasted. I have tried to find other spring rolls that are equivalent or better but after hundreds of spring rolls tried, I still have yet to find any. The vegetable tempura is also a favorite. As far as main courses go, I usually get the vegetarian Rad Nar. Its a mix of thick chewy (but not in a bad way) wide rice noodles, veggies and tofu in a brown sauce. Again, I've never found anything comparable. Especially if you drizzle some of the brown sauce over some white rice. DELICIOUS. Their Thai iced tea is also pretty good- sweet, creamy and delicious. This is one of several places in Charlotte that I would be devastated over if they were to close completely. I couldn't imagine a world without my spring rolls and Rad Nar."}
{"text":"I guess you could call us \"regulars\" here. I have been eating here for ten years now and have never been disappointed. The food is excellent, the service is wonderful and friendly. You are always seated promptly, greeted with big Tai smiles from a waitstaff wearing traditional Tai garb. Try the squid salad. To the reviewer who complained about no free WiFi here, I say \"Great! I love that this is a place to enjoy your food experience, NOT spending time on your laptop or smart phone.\"  If you want to eat and do your work online,  then go to a place like Panera, that encourages that kind of thing. If you are interested in a great Tai dining experience, then come here!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but glad I stopped in. I ordered the yellow curry chicken to go. They offered me a seat at the small bar while I waited. Also gave me some ice water and the complimentary soup -- which usually isn't offered with to-go orders. 

The spring roll is very small - about three bites - but has decent flavor to start the meal off. The curry was fantastic. I asked for medium and there was a good heat in the dish -- probably more than I wanted, but delicious nonetheless.  A good amount of chicken, potatoes and sauce -- maybe too many onions for my taste. I was hoping for some leftovers, but I ate it all. A great lunch under $10."}
{"text":"Seriously so yum!!! I love this location so much more than the one at Tower Place. They are friendly and they asked \"How spicy 1-5\" like usual Thai places do. I loved the Pad Thai. It was fresh and full of spicy flavors! I was super pleased. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai!!  Whenever I am in town I like to go visit Thai House for some amazing food.  The staff here is great, always going out of their way to make the experience perfect.  Ask them to bring the spices tray to the table, mix the chili sauce in with the dish and wham you have something awesome.  I can truly say, that I wish I could find a Thai restaurant this good back home."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for YEARSS. So much that even the workers recognized us lol! The service here is so so friendly, I don't understand why some of the reviewers say they're rude because I don't think we ever encounter that now! Tip, order a bunch of stuff then share it with your friends/family because each plate comes with aloot. Thai tea- hands down the best Thai tea I've had! The dishes we normally get are the Whole Fried red snapper, in chile sauce. Omg it's so good, worth the extra $$ I promise! ORDER THE BASIL FRIED RICE, You will not be disappointed my friend!! My family absolutely loves their Shrimp Tom Yum soup in the hot pot, it's good but it's honestly a little too spicy for me lol! So if your a lover for spicy food, I defffinalty recommend that. I really love coming here, atmosphere is nice & the place is super clean too and I don't think we ever had to wait for a table- hurrah! (;"}
{"text":"Food is really good I ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and the fried spring rolls. However...1) The hostess was rude and literally looked at me and my family and walked around the restaurant doing nothing for 5 minutes before coming to seat us. And 2) for parties of 5 or more they charge 18% gratuity. There were 5 of us including my mother, myself, a 16 year old, an 8 year old, and a 2 year old. They count children/babies as adults when charging for gratuity which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. How I'm the world does a 2 year old count as an adult. I just feel like it was a complete rip off and an extra $10 to our bill for no reason."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. The food was above average, but the wait staff was very helpful and polite. I thought their outfits looked pretty funny. The waiter said it is the original outfit that waiters used to wear in Thailand over 100 years ago. Pricing was fair with ample parking"}
{"text":"Very Thai. Friendly staff and great food.  Considering the price I was tempted to give it five stars.  I also think it's funny that when I order Pad Thai they ask me if I want it the Thai way or the American way. (I'm Asian)."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this so I went for lunch yesterday. I was immediately seated. I sat there for 5 minutes without a menu. When I asked for one the man (seemed like he didn't speak or understand English) finally got me one. 15 minutes later....still no water or any type of attention from the staff. I even asked whom my waitress was (even though I knew). I ended up leaving with no water and no food ordered.  When I led the waitress says ' thanks coming in'. REALLY LaDy. Customer Service is horrific."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand 7 times, lived there for 2 years and have the good fortune of eating at some wonderful Thai restaurants in San Francisco.  This place is wonderful.  Friendly service, excellent food (minus the Tom Yung Goong, a bit bland).  Try the Som Tum.  Compared to the other places I found in the  area, this place rocks.  Thank you Thai House!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate her a few weeks ago. It was my first time being there.Their Thai tea was same as any I've tried but their Thai ice coffee was very good since its difficult to find it in other restaurants. Crispy tofu was also same as any. Their spring roll was pretty good but I have tried better ones. I ordered their chicken and it tasted dried as if its been sitting out for a while. Lets just say, it probably wasn't fresh out the grill.  Overall, the environment is excellent with nice traditional Thai culture/artwork. Plates and napkin was set up ahead and one good thing was they will always give out utensil for each order/entree. This restaurant would have received a 4 star if the chicken wasn't dried."}
{"text":"Always great service! Favorite go to dishes are the pad Thai and padseeawee. Family style eating is probably best to take advantage of the different dishes and vibrant Thai foods! Their papaya salad is very very spicy!! Make sure you can take the heat!"}
{"text":"Gotta judge a thai place by it's pad Thai.. It's really good here. A bit spendy but good food. Their green curry and satay are both good"}
{"text":"Thai house in university is my go-to restaurant. The ambiance of the place is very warm and welcoming & the servers are ALWAYS so nice! (A big plus in my book) my husband & I come here almost every week and no matter what time of day it is or if they're super busy or super slow you will always be treated the same. I love these people & the food! They're more than amazing & they always remember our orders"}
{"text":"Excellent thai food.  Staff are also great.  I lived for several years in Bangkok and this brought me back there.  Will be back to eat there again!"}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for us, and we usually have an enjoyable visit.

A few of my favorites include the \"knock out rolls\" (fresh spring rolls) and the chicken red curry.  

My favorite soup for a warm up is the Pho Chicken.  So good!  My husband enjoys the Pad Thai.

This is an authentic restaurant and the employees are very friendly, though there is sometimes a language barrier."}
{"text":"Every encounter I have had here, whether dine-in/take-out, has always been pleasant. The food is excellent. Dining-in is a great experience as this place is very tranquil and has beautiful decor. I love the food. It's always delicious and they aren't stingy with it!"}
{"text":"Som Tum salad. Yum. 

It is the very best thing I've ever eaten in my whole, entire life. It's spicy. It's fruity. It's crunchy and salty and sweet and amazing. 

I've eaten it so many times lately that the waiters know I'm the Som Tum salad girl. 

I am also a fan of the mango sticky rice. 

I love Thai, but I think this is my favorite Thai restaurant in the whole world."}
{"text":"Shredded chicken and basil is amazing! L1! Service is extremely fast and food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"For the area, this is pretty good Thai food. 

I've been here on and off for many years and can always expect the same level of service and food. 

Green curry is good. Be careful on the spice level. The Thai tea is also pretty good. 

Also have tried the duck curry. That was ok... Think I will go back to my regular order...

Will be back of wanting Thai in this area..."}
{"text":"Beef Pad See Ew is my fave here! Pad Thai is good. Pad Woon Sen is good too! Service is consistent."}
{"text":"It's no doubt the best Thai place when it comes to food. The place is decent, looks like a combination of an authentic Thai place and a diner. Service is good nothing extraordinary.

We have so far had food at Basil, Hibiscus and this one. We would rate this one undoubtedly the best. 

We had the fried rice, pineapple curry and some spring roles for lunch. Each one of them had so much flavor and perfect taste.

Will definitely come back for some more yummy good."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their Tofu pad Thai (with egg) spicy level 3, the tom kha soup, and the Thai house salad. 

I have brought my very picky mother here and even she is a fan 

I can't say I've ever been disappointed after a trip here."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food, excellent service and very friendly wait staff! I love the yellow curry and the chicken satay is always very good!"}
{"text":"Service: 3.5 - We were seated quickly. It wasn't clear who our server actually was. Multiple people asked us the same questions which made for a bit of a confusing time and made it difficult to carry on long conversations. Moderate level of refill speed. Food came out quickly. 

Taste: 4.2 - Food was DELICIOUS. The only criticism we had was that the spicy pad Thai wasn't actually that spicy (that is, however, subjective). 

Atmosphere: 4 - Nice but there wasn't a lot of privacy."}
{"text":"Thai House is the only place I will get Pad Thai in Charlotte!  I wish I was more sophisticated about Thai food because I would have more to say about the rest of the menu.  I was so thrilled when Thai House said they were opening a location at the EpiCentre - ug that was supposed to be a year ago and havent heard a peep about it since.  Sad Face!!!!  if it was closer I would abandon my staple eats and branch out to try more of the menu.  This location however has gorgeous interior and the wait staff is so courteous I am thanking them every time I see them.  Thai House please open uptown too!!!  I will be your Number One Customer!!!  :-D"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, good service, and they even wear traditional ethnic \"a-THAI-er\"!"}
{"text":"Of course the food is great you can say nothing less about Thai food here. I will say the prices do tend run a bit hi so try to go for lunch special they're very good with takeout \"prepared-fast but be sure to check your order\" had if few mishaps hear."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food.  Not the best i have ever had but decent that i return once a month (more or less).    Good value for the price - i found the Pad Thai to be good but nothing to write home about.  The curries are a better bet and if you like Thai food - check this place out."}
{"text":"Pretty good pad thai! Came on a Tuesday night and it was easy to find a seat."}
{"text":"Went to the Thai House tonight and ended up walking out.   We have been going here for a long time and the food has hit an all time low.  

We both ordered Pad Thai and it tasted like they used Bar B Que sauce in it.  It wasn't even close to the Thai food that we have enjoyed over the years.  I hate to say this but don't think that we will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ok so I left the University Area of Charlotte a month ago and I still cannot find decent Thai food in WS, but I digress!!

I love this place! I've gotten almost everything on the menu and it is flavorful and mouth wateringly good.  I hate when Thai food is just spicy and your mouth is just filled with hot instead of the flavor.  Thai House really gives you flavor and spice. Don't get me wrong, I love my food spicy but I want flavor too dang it!!!  I normally get the Chicken Pad Thai (7 stars because it's extra extra spicy) and extra bean sprouts.  (I get them for free because I used to go A LOT but I think they are only $1 extra normally...it's worth it!)  When I want to switch it up, I will get the Tom Kha soup and an order of deep fried spring rolls...SOOOOOO GOOOD! 

As for price, I would go for lunch because it's actually pretty cheap like $7.95 or something like that and you get a whole bunch of food. (soup, deep fried spring roll and entree) My Pad Thai is normally $10.95 during dinner time but they give you A LOT, so I justify it by eating it for two meals.  

As for the service, you can't get any better.  I ordered my food to go and then went to Maggie Moo's to get yummies and they delivered my food to me while I was at Maggie Moo's!  So NICE!! :) 

4 1/2 stars! :)  

I miss you Thai House! :)"}
{"text":"LOVE Thai House. Best Pad Thai and Pad Kraw Praw. The restaurant is decorated in traditional Thai décor and the staff is extremely friendly. Always a pleasant experience when we are here!"}
{"text":"This place will definitely satisfy your Thai craving but it was mediocre. The pad thai definitely tasted like ketchup but it was still tasty. We also got duck panang. That was delish. The duck was not fatty and had good flavor. I would recommend this place if you are in the area and craving some decent Thai food!"}
{"text":"One of my now favor Thai restaurants in Charlotte. The shrimp is very fresh and very large in size. Food is always made fresh to order. You for sure get all your money worth."}
{"text":"Good place to eat, not much to complain about here. Good Thai food very close to Chinese food just a different spin/twist."}
{"text":"Service was VERY slow, but the food was tasty; however, this visitor sealed our decision never to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Visit Charlotte on business every two months and have to hit Thai house. Pad Thai noodles are outstanding
.   Can't recommend anything else because I get the same thing every time."}
{"text":"Some of the best thai food in the area. Good service too! I got the Pad see ewe which comes with a spring roll and a cup of soup. Really good price for all that you get! Recommend trying this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a Thai lover but this place hit the mark for me.  I enjoyed my Pad Kadapow?  I forget how to spell it.  To start the lunch, they serve a nice soup and then followed up with my entree and it was piping hot tempature wise.  I chose chicken as my protein and to be honest I was a little surprised it came out as ground chicken and not little tenders as I expected.  Maybe that's just the style of the dish, again, I'm not a Thai lover so my knowledge of the dishes is very limited.

The interior is actually very nice in here with nice wood carvings and a bit better than a lot of the other Thai resturants I've visted.  The staff were super efficient and quick to the table for our water, food and checks.  I would certainly make another visit sometime."}
{"text":"I just went back here after a long \"break\" -- it had probably been at least two years.  Happy to report that the Duck Panang is as delicious as it always has been.  I'm one of those people that goes to a place for a food.  If I want Duck Panang, I go to Thai House, even though they have other things that are good too.  Maybe that's a mistake, but that's how I roll.  Anyway, it's very cute when the waiters bring your Duck Panang to the table inside a little clay duck dish, and quack at you as they deliver it.  This is a good, solid Thai option in the University area."}
{"text":"I used to come often because I liked the food. It was conveniently located and was the most decent Thai food in Charlotte. But I came in today for lunch with my husband and we were standing at the front waiting to be greeted. Three different staff looked at us and kept walking. I can understand them not being able to seat us if they were busy, but to not even acknowledge our existence is just bad business practice. I will not be back. They just lost a customer."}
{"text":"I like to come her on Sundays after church. If we get there early enough we would t have to wait. I like their red curry with pineapple and hubby likes the house fried rice. Their summer rolls with shrimp are fresh and a good size."}
{"text":"My wife and I started coming here about 8 years ago when we lived close. The service and food were great then and still is. Our favorite part now is that the same staff still works here and even though we only get the chance to come in once or twice a year they still remember us and what we like. If you want good Thai food, nice atmosphere, and very friendly staff come here."}
{"text":"I have been to the Thai House multiple times and it never disappoints! Pad Thai is always a favorite and the Coconut Curry is amazing!  The atmosphere is nice as well.  Can't beat this place for the price!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I come here every so often with friends and family. The place is super clean and is perfect for any type of occasion. Their Thai tea and Thai coffee is to die for. Food quality is consistent and so far everything that I've tried was great. Definitely check it out whether it be for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Staff is pretty nice, they are friendly and some remember me. Their food is not consistent though, sometimes it is perfect and sometimes it is too salty. That is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is more relaxing to come and enjoy dinner than at lunch, because it can be very loud and kind of hectic in there. I love their pineapple fried rice though!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit! Really busy during lunch time. I got the pad Thai and during lunch time it comes with soup and an eggroll. The sauce is a little sweeter than what I'm used to but still great flavor and exactly what I would expect and a pad Thai."}
{"text":"Food is definitely a plus. Interior just keeps you spellbound. The two out of the 3 most important factors for a restaurant(Ambience, food and service) deserves some appreciation.

The Tom yum soup is good not great. Fried tofu dish brings out an interesting texture to the tofu. It does taste good as well. These guys need to take It easy on peanuts. They are little too over bearing when it comes to their peanuts. The pad Thai had crunch in every bite. 

The tofu mastaman curry is definitely something I would order the next time I drop by here. Basil fried rice is better off being called as just fried rice.

The staff courtesy seems blatantly artificial. We were ignored to be seated for about 10 minutes. We were party of 5 and there is no way they would miss seeing us. 

Bottom line: Good food. Tastefully done decor. Staff need a reality check."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a high rating. Perhaps some of their food is good but what I and the rest of my party ordered was dry and just covered in a layer of chilli/curry powder. 

Wouldn't go back ever again."}
{"text":"Very consistent with service and the food!
Always great and full of flavor!
Typical Thai menu, but the best in the University and Concord area, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Met an old friend for lunch and we both ordered from the special lunch menu. I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai (sp?) spicy. It was SO good! The sweet and sour soup was just ok. Service was excellent, prompt and friendly. Interior was nicely decorated and clean. Need to return with my hubby and the kids."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Over price and small portions."}
{"text":"Soooo... the gaggle reunited again for a Thai experience...  It did not fail. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly... check their pants out when you go... and YOU'RE WELCOME!  Can you say a mash up between a genie and MC Hammer!  They're awesome!  My dinner was fantastic!  I'm not going to lie...  Any dish can be made veggie friendly and that's exactly what I did with the eggplant something or nother! (Can't remember the name)  Not an single gaggle-member was dissatisfied with their meals.  I can tell by the empty plates!  Plenty of food for decent prices.  Definitely will be going back!  Get the medium if you want a little bit of a kick and if you venture for spicier... Good luck! :)"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile so I decided to stop in with some coworkers for lunch. I love the lunch time soup and the food was great just as I remember, and just as I also remember the service could be better, but overall it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Thai House is really a Thai house once you walk inside. It's neatly decorated with Thai ornaments with wood panellings and carvings and a traditional Thai music is piped in. Fried spring rolls for appetizer tasted good but the sweet and sour sauce that came with it was too sweet. We always get Pad Thai everytime we are in a Thai restaurant. That has become one of my basis to initially gauge what has yet to come. And it tasted alright although it was on the border of being too sweet. The green curry was a delight! Light creamy sauce and a bit spicy. You should try it. We also had the King and I, shrimp in a sweet and salty sauce with brocolli, red and green onions. It was good but not my favorite. So far, this is my favorite of all Thai restaurants we've ever been. Will come back to sample more dishes."}
{"text":"Spontaneously chose Thai House for a group luncheon today - and what a fantastic moment of spontaneity it was! First and foremost, we had 7 people in our party, and given that we didn't plan ahead, we caked 10 minutes in advance to warn the staff. When we showed up, the serving staff was super friendly and showed us to our table immediately. 

Soup and a spring roll come with all lunch entrees, and the soup was served to everyone at our table before we even ordered. The excellent service continued throughout our entire dining experience; nobody's drinks went unfilled, and the restaurant was pretty crowded. 

I had the Pad Kapraw with chicken and it was delicious. The serving sizes are huge, so plan to come hungry and/or take home leftovers (always a plus in my book). Already looking forward to our next trip here!"}
{"text":"The Tom yum soup is the best I've ever had. The curry is also delicious and I love the Thai tea"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST THAI around-go! If I could give it 100 stars I would. I first came here from my love of the Thai House in Pineville, so when I found there was one closer to me after I moved I was ecstatic! I've been going here now for the past 12 years and they are consistently delicious every time! From the open of the door to the close of the door, your experience here will be fantastic! The staff is super friendly and attentive. Each dish I've tried has been artistically prepared and tasted fantastic! The servings are large and definitely worth the cost-which is totally reasonable in the first place. When they speak of their ambiance and Thai artwork, they're not kidding-the woodwork will astound you and I'm jealous it's not in my own house! As a plus, they have a little patio you can sit outside on during nice weather-I used to bring my dog up there quite a bit and they never complained and always brought a water bowl for her. I can't speak more highly of them, they are truly a favorite restaurant of mine and when I move in the future, I will be making a point to drive out of my way to go here. Even now, there are closer Thai restaurants to us than them, but I refuse to eat any other Thai than theirs, b/c it just won't compare! Just be careful to know the difference between American-spicy and Thai-spicy (which they'll warn you anyways)!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was very good - I ordered the pad woon sen with chicken - but I'm knocking off a star for service and a star for price.

Spent a lot of time in Thai Town in LA and I've been to Thailand, so I know how amazing Thai hospitality can be and how inexpensive the food is. At Thai House, the host was friendly, but the bartender who I ordered a beer and my to-go order from was kinda surly. Food was great and plentiful, but my order of glass noodles and a Singha set me back $18.

Not worth going back to."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but the food is a bit too sweet and it doesn't have that authentic Thai taste to it. The red curry chicken was a bit too thick And it doesn't have much favour. like they use too much of cornstarch into it way too thick. The price is a bit pricey to be in university location and maybe is because they are only thai place near by. I know the ingredients doesn't cost that much to make. The papaya salad is way sweet!!. And I did asked to make it more on the sour and more of the thai style but is still sweet. No it doesn't taste like what you would get in NYC or thailand. This place just don't do it for me."}
{"text":"The food is great but smiling waiter told me they do not have minced garlic.  What kind of a restaurant does not have minced garlic?  Of course they do cook with garlic.  Had to go to the grocery store and buy my own garlic and lime juice to bring in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice little place tucked away in this shopping center.  Could get easily lost in the mix between the sports bars and other restaurants that are in the same complex.

The interior is nicely decorated - I really felt transported away from Charlotte.  I couldn't tell you if it was authentic or not, but it felt nicely done.

I had the Kang Masaman Curry which was delicious.  At medium heat, it gave just enough numbing to the lips that it was enjoyable and not painful.  My friends also split an order of fried pot stickers which were really good.

Overall, had a good first experience here.  Wish I had found out about this place sooner - The service could use some ramping up (they weren't really busy, but it seemed like our waitress took a while to come check on us and for refills)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day with my wife.  Never had Thai food before, ordered the Pad Thai (get it Thai style) it was amazing.  The service was great and very friendly.  The prices were reasonable and the lunch menu was a great value.  The menu is extensive and there are a ton of different options.  I think we will start coming here more often."}
{"text":"So good!!! I had their Tom yum and their pad Thai and both were phenomenal. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai Food. This is not the best Thai- but the place is excellent. The service is incredible. The food is yummy. The atmosphere is lovely (especially considering that it is in a strip mall). The servings are big- enough for leftovers.

I still have not found a Thai restaurant in Charlotte that I absolutely LOVE. I'm still searching."}
{"text":"08/20/11

Still enjoying the carved woodwork.  Was still full from BBQ lunch, so I only ordered the fried tofu salad, while sisters and BIL split a couple of delicious-looking entrees.  I really enjoyed my salad-- the peanut salad dressing was almost addicting!

Prompt and courteous service, w/out the snobbery we've encountered in other recent jaunts.  Maybe we'll go back for a proper meal before we leave for home..."}
{"text":"Overpriced for probably the worst Thai food I've ever had. I normally am not that mean when leaving reviews, but we had the potsticker app and it was awful and really dry, didn't even taste like pot stickers, I had the pad Thai which is the tradition dish that almost every American goes after, it was far too sweet, like too much that I couldn't finish it, the sauce was a sticky sweet sauce that just didn't taste right, lacked veggies and flavor due to the overwhelming sweetness! Gross! We ordered green tea (hot) and got some super flowery tea that tasted like chemicals....I would never recommend this place! I was surprised too because of the good reviews! Bummer"}
{"text":"My go-to for Thai food. They've always been consistent every time I get food there.  I typically always get their chicken pad thai, and or sometimes their red curry.  I have yet to find a pad thai that is better than theirs. 

From my understanding, there are two styles that can be made.  I've had both, but I was never sure which was which because they don't usually ask you.  One dish would be redder in color, and the other more brownish.  I would assume the brownish color is due to the tamarind, and that this style would be more authentic.  Regardless, I love the 'authentic' version. I don't like the redder version because it has a ketchup-y taste to it.  I do not know if the 'authentic' version I'm referring to is the Thai or Signature version, so you should ask before ordering.  

Note: You should dine in for this experience because being able to eat your food as fresh as can be, is always the way to go.  :)

Their golden shrimp is delicious but pricey. Their tom yum soup can be really spicy, but delicious nonetheless. They have stir-fry dishes that you can't go wrong with because they're delicious too.  

Honestly, everything that I've tried was all delicious. Lettuce wraps, larb, mango with sticky rice (though they never really have sticky rice on hand), etc.. They just know how to make really good food!

Their Thai tea quenches your thirst, so it's always nice to drink that on a hot summer day.  

We come in so often that they recognize us. The waiters are super friendly.  Just treat them with respect, and they'll do the same.  Understand that they work from morning 'till night, everyday on repeat, so cut them some slack.  


TL;DR: This place is legit, why go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here after a day at Carowinds. Admittedly, the place is nicer than we were dressed for, but they didn't look down on us for our windblown faces. :)

We had the vegetarian spring rolls, fried, and I *do not* recommend them unless you want something that tastes like \"fried\" and nothing else. I didn't take off a star for this because they do have a steamed option and it's my fault I didn't order that one. Good sauce.

I had the Vegetarian Red Curry. Lovely presentation, loaded with veggies (tofu optional), and amazing flavor. I will say that it was very spicy, and I ordered it straight off the menu. \"Normal\" here is spicy. Be warned.

Our service was friendly, but slow. We all received our entrees about five minutes apart, which made for some awkward waiting.

Nice place - would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We love Thai House at University.

We've done dinner and lunch here. Lunch prices are more reasonable of course but portion sizes are good for both meals.

I cannot eat peanuts but there is lots on this menu that works for me.  I've had shrimp, chicken and vegetarian meals here. I love the hot jasmine tea. 

The staff here is very gracious, as I have found all Thai people I've known. They are efficient without being in the way regarding refills, clearing dishes, etc. We seem to get the same waiter for 75% of our visits.

The food is filling though everything I've ordered has seemed light.

The booths are comfy. I've sat at a table once. I don't like tables, here or any where.

Soothing decor, cool waitstaff uniforms.

All around, an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Food is good here.  However you will wait 30 minutes minimum if you order carry out when you get there.   It wasn't until I asked for a refund at 30 minutes that they offered me some soup.

Also check your order because they gave me the wrong order and I had to drive back.  It would be another 5 to 10 to fix my order.  That's when I just asked for a refund, got it and left."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were in town for the weekend and we tried Thai House on a whim, even though the reviews were so-so.  We went for lunch at around 1:30 on a Saturday and were immediately seated.

Our booth was roomy, and the decor was a little more festive than other Thai places I've been to. Our service was good - the waiter was very nice and kept my glass filled, so no complaints here.

We each ordered lunch specials, which come with a spring roll and soup. The soup didn't do much for me - I assumed (which is my fault) that it would be a creamy tom kha-type soup, but what we got instead was vegetables in a clear broth. The soup wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't great. I could take it or leave it. The spring roll was good, though. Crispy, not too greasy, meatless filling.

I can't speak for what my companions had, but I ordered the Pad Krapraw with chicken and it was pretty tasty. I'd give it 3.5 stars. At Thai restaurants I haven't been to before, I always get medium spice instead of hot just in case it's a place that is generous with the chili peppers, and I'm glad I did here because the medium was quite hot. Not, like, blisters on the insides of my cheek hot or anything, but it wasn't a medium. I'm okay with that though, since I like my food on the kicky side. The rest of the dish was perfectly spiced too - you could tell the basil and onions were there, but they didn't overwhelm the dish. 

This was the third day in a row I'd had Thai food (I was on a kick, okay?), and even on top of that, this place was still good. So overall, four stars for me. I'd go again the next time I came to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Thai House University is located in a fairly large shopping center, with many other businesses. It is right in the corner next to the dry cleaners. We were greeted right as we walked in and seated very quickly. I don't eat Thai often, so I was indecisive and confused when looking over the large menu. Alas, I found the tom yum soup to order, and added a large bowl of rice for $3. We also ordered the fried squid appetizer, pad Thai, and barbecue duck. The food was delicious, but came out in a very weird order. They all came out at different times, and my soup entree came out before the appetizer did. If I could critique something, it would be the order the food comes out: appetizer first, then everyone's meal at the same time, so one person isn't eating before or waiting for the other dishes. Price wise, I think most dishes are around $13 and up, and they do have lunch specials!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a little Thai in the area, then this is certainly a good option. The actual entrance can be a small challenge, since they're on the bottom floor - but keep at it and you can find it without too much trouble.

On the inside, it's like entering another world, which is like taking a nice break from the outside. Definitely worthwhile. At lunch, they have some menu options that come out insanely fast - like you get done ordering and they are at your table. Not sure if they do the same for dinner/off the specials list, but man, that is crazy quick.

The spice isn't as hot as some other places, but you can adjust it, or once you're used to their level, just go up as needed.

One downside is that parking lot. I have no idea why Walgreens needs so many spaces, but that can make it a challenge to find a place to pull in, and that can be frustrating at lunch when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"They know me because that's how often I come to eat here. Very good food and personable service. Pad Thai or Duck curry are my go-to. 

Patron since 2006, and will continue to recommend."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for dinner several times in the past. The food in general was okay, some dishes were better than the rest. Couple of times we ordered for take out, and in both times they managed to mess up. But no big deal. The service was up and down, but in general flat.
Few days back we took our friends to this place for lunch. We ordered few lunch special items. On one dish our friend asked for just a bit more beansprout, guess what, a waitress guy declined the request by stating that they already put extra. He offered small side of sprout, and it'd cost $3. 
One other dish, the noodle was burnt, and he told that how it cooked. We quickly finished with the other decent dishes we could eat and left. And guess what, we won't come back, ever again."}
{"text":"I have been going to Thai House for many many years and throughout the years it seems they may have changed owners or Cooks every time I ask 4 my order it gets different each time I used to love getting takeout but now I look for new Thai restaurant this one does not taste like authentic anymore"}
{"text":"Thai house experience is always a disaster and a disappointment, they have okay food but their service is terrible. I've been there twice, I fail to even meet any waitress or even get a water within the first 10 minutes after I talked to 3 different waitress and the manager. There were only 6 tables of people in the store at that time, and there are 5 waiters and waitresses in the dinning area."}
{"text":"I've had Thai House in my Yelp bookmarks for a long, long time. You see, I love Thai food and I've heard really wonderful things about this spot. Finally when I had a meeting in University I jumped at the chance to grab some lunch here. 

The Good: The service was incredible fast (scary fast), efficient and friendly. Water glasses were kept full and I felt welcomed at all times. The restaurant, albeit a bit dark, was quite clean and definitely crowded for the lunch rush (always a good sign). Prices were affordable and spot on for the Thai fare offered. 

The Meh: My Pad See Ew was just ok. It had a nice spice to it (I asked for spice level three) but it was lacking in noodles. And it's a noodle dish. Maybe I just got the runt of the pad see ew litter, but there was twice as much chicken as noodles. Taste wise it was fine but nothing to really write home about. 

As for the gratis sweet & sour soup that comes at the beginning of the meal - frankly I'm never a fan of that soup in general, so it's not so fair to judge it here. 

Overall it was a fine meal, but I'm not rushing back to Thai House. If I find myself hankering for pad thai or curry while rolling around University, I'd definitely give it another go."}
{"text":"BEST meal of my entire Life! Hands down. Service was very fast and courteous. Food was orgasmic. I would eat here every day, for every meal, if I could. Ambiance was also very Lovely. I will definitely be coming back... a lot. My new favorite place, for sure."}
{"text":"An average Thai place. Food is decent, but the service is not. With many empty tables and no one in likenimnfromt of me I had to wait for about 7 minutes to get seated. They bring the dish before they bring soup. The dish had a piece of plastic in is (see the pic). Will not come again."}
{"text":"Yellow curry fried rice with beef was the best fried rice I've ever had. Maybe because I was starving, but damn it was on point ! Great smiley polite service."}
{"text":"My friend just returned from a two week stay In Thailand. After seeing the food posts from her travels, the first place for lunch that came to mind when she returned was Thai House. 
We used to work in Fort Mill, SC and frequented the location in Pineville and was always satisfied. 
What we didn't know is how different the food is at this location. It was NOT good. 
Upon being seated, you're automatically served a small bowl of rice soup and veggies. The broth was a tad salty but overall, It was good for a cold rainy day. We both ordered pad se ewe which is stir fried rice noodles. What came out looked and smelled delicious but was not what we're accustomed to from the Pineville location. Pad se ewe should be thick glutinous rice noodles with some sweetness. The dish served to us was thin rice paper-like noodles that was way too salty and no sweetness at all. I had tofu with my dish. The tofu should be freshly fried separately prior to being added to the stir fry so It maintains a somewhat crunchy exterior. The tofu in my dish was soft and soggy. No crispiness to speak of. It seemed like the noodles absorbed all of the flavor while the rest of the stir fry was bland. I ate my meal while listening to my friend talk about her travel experience to Thailand but after the meal, she made the same comments about her dish that I was thinking about mine. I'm not sure why the taste is so different from the other location but It was bad enough that we will not be returning."}
{"text":"How have I not discovered this gem yet? Highly recommend visiting for lunch!

Within my one hour lunch break, I was able to drive to Thai House, get lost, be seated, be served, and drive back. Service was excellent, complete with complimentary soup. 

I ordered the lunch Pad-See-Ewe special and it was seriously delicious. I asked for medium heat and they NAILED IT. Thick, scrumptious noodles with crispy broccoli and shrimp - YUM. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is own of my favorite Go To Thai Place in the area. I usually go during lunch time. The food has been consistently good for several visits. Out of many dishes I loved Pad Thai, different curries (Red, Green, Yellow). Pad Krapraw with basil fried rice which I enjoy. I would like you to try once if you are visiting the area."}
{"text":"Food was super delicious, but is the taste worth a burning sphincter? I have the muscle control of an 80 year old right now because I've had the runs for the past 4 hours. My girlfriend got it too, I had to hear her poop for the first time. Never have I ever fought anyone for a bathroom so badly. #FoodPoisoning"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Charlotte.  I have been going here for 9 years and It's always good.  Try the Pad Thai (Thai style) and the Som Tom (green papaya salad).  I also like the Rad Nar with seafood and the Yellow curry and the penang curry.  You can order spice level 1-4 so they will make it your spice level.  The servers are some of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met.  I consider them family.  Beautiful souls.  Also the sweet iced tea is great.  They use Jasmine tea and it's perfect.  This place is pure love."}
{"text":"I don't eat Thai food a lot so I can't tell whether it's authentic or not, but the food is really good. Really miss dry noodles a lot and PAD THAI is just soo good! Also miss spicy food and can't believe 3 is almost too much for me! Okay will still try 3 next time caz the hot feeling in your mouth is sooo wonderful. Very Thai style environment and nice staff as a whole. The only inconvenience is you need to go to the counter to check out"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Just flew in to CLT and this was the first stop. Great service and very friendly staff. Food came out very fast."}
{"text":"Thai cuisine is without a doubt one of my favorite types of restaurants to visit. In most cases the dishes are prepared with spices that are unique to the owner's personal recipes. I believe that spicy Thai dishes are far more healthy for you too. 

I was recently in Charlotte, North Carolina and paid a visit to Thai House (University) for dinner. As other reviewers have pointed out, the decor is exceptionally ornate with teak wood carvings and a wait staff dressed in colorful and traditional costumes. Being a resident of South Florida has given me an opportunity to sample many Thai restaurants. I think that the weather must be similar to Bangkok, because each year more and more Thai restaurants seem to open up. Regardless, I was eager to try Thai House. I began with an ice cold Sing-Ha beer and a small bowl of chicken rice soup. The soup was served steaming hot and had a generous amount of chicken that was flavored nicely with celery and cilantro. Yes...cilantro! Not just for making salsa anymore! In other Thai restaurants, I have had this soup with basil or mint, and those are good too. The high temperature allowed the flavors to blend and create a very delightful and flavor rich soup. I was favorably impressed. Next, came my entree, chicken with mixed vegetables & cashews that was served with white jasmine rice. I ordered the dish 4-stars hot expecting that would be an adequate amount of spiciness. Wrong. The dish was in fact spiced with various bell and hot peppers, but no where near the heat index commonly found in other Thai restaurants that I have become accustomed to. Too bad. The reason might be that the locals simply do not prefer more traditional levels of Thai spice, and I understand that. Higher levels of spiciness come from a gradual and acquired level of exploration and comfort. Although it is very possible to overdo it, when you do find your \"heat threshold\" it is hard to accept less for some reason. 

My entree was fresh and and presented with cleverly cut carrots in the shape of flower petals. Besides the entree not having much of a spice-kick, the cashews were over cooked, and were too soft. Still, a generous portion by any standard. I usually order dessert, but this night I did not. 

The bottom line is I liked Thai House enough to recommend it. After only one visit my review is based on a single entree and soup. In other words, my report deserves more visits than I could provide, but at least it seems like a good choice based on my limited experience and overall impression. 

One last thing to consider. Thai House is kind of expensive for restaurants of the shopping center variety. True, I don't pay their rent, and Thai restaurants are not as common as other choices in Charlotte, so it is kind of a novelty. Give it a try, and judge for yourself. It's also a good ambiance for couples and families."}
{"text":"Their food is good but not the best... but compared to all the other thai options in this area- this might be the best one...
They have nice lunch specials which includes a spring roll, soup, rice and a curry of your choice.
Loved their pad thai, fried rice and red curry."}
{"text":"Today was the second time I have visited Thai House and it was from a friends recommendation.  Turns out I had eaten there before on a previous trip to Charlotte and enjoyed it then as well.

The soup served with lunch was very good chicken stock based soup with noodles and small bits of chicken and was a very pleasant surprise.  The Green Curry which was the Thursday lunch special also had a nice deep flavor.  I ordered medium spicy and was hoping for a bit more of a burn but suspect that if I ate there regularly I'd be rewarded.

I'd say a good solid reliable Thai place."}
{"text":"Love my Thai House. The staff is always friendly and the food is very good. I enjoy having the chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and the Namprigpaow (usually get chicken). I'm not an expert at Thai food however this place is pretty good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Looking through yelp reviews and pictures I decided I would give this place a try. The basil fried rice is what really caught my attention.

I placed my order over the phone to go for Basil Fried rice and Fresh Summer rolls with tofu. It was about a 30 minute wait all together and 30 minutes before closing on a Thursday there was still a pretty good crowd of people. The staff  was  pleasent.

My food was tasty. I enjoyed my basil fried rice with chicken. I did not use the spicy sauce that came with it and it still had a little kick to it. The summer rolls were also good and bigger than other restaurants I have been to. 

I would suggest if you like soy sauce ask for extra if you have a to go order they only give you 1 pack."}
{"text":"I have been to this Thai House location on several occasions. The food is exquisite, taking no shortcuts to prepare sensational and authentic thai dishes. The food is phenomenal because I can taste each ingredient in the dishes and they blend together for a taste-frenzy experience that is out of this world. You've got to try it!
The prices were acceptable for dinner, but not cheap.

I would recommend for anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I previously gave this business 5 stars because the food was consistently good. The last time I went, there was clearly an issue with whoever was in charge of takeout. I had to explain to the woman on the phone that I wanted my Pad See-Ewe with only tofu, noodles, broccoli, and egg (none of the other 500 random vegetables they decide to add for the vegetarian version of this dish). This has never been a problem before, but I had to explain it 4-5 times on the phone because she didn't understand what I was saying. When I showed up to get my food, the cashier walked into the kitchen with my credit card and disappeared for 5 minutes, then took another 5 minutes to swipe my card and give me my receipt because she was too busy helping somebody who never got his food. When I got home, I opened my takeout box and my order was incorrect. I hope they can fix this by the next time I order."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favorite places to go in the area.

First thing, The decor in this place is amazing.  There is a gazebo looking top on the bar made out of wood that has a lot of detailed carvings.  There is other wood carvings around the place but the one over the bar is the most impressive.  The atmosphere at Thai House is very relaxed and quiet.

Sometimes you can find a coupon on restaurants.com.  There is a $50 minimum that does not include alcohol.  The last time I used a coupon, I went with only my girlfriend and we ended up getting a lot of food to cover it.  I really enjoyed that because I got to try a lot of different food.  

Spring rolls are good but I would like to see some fresh cold spring rolls.  The potstickers are good.  They are different.  They are wrapped in wonton skins.  I was really impressed with the Thai House Salad.  Very light and refreshing.  

If your new to Thai food I recommend the Masaman Beef, a great choice here.  If you want something a little different the roasted duck is very good with a solid presentation.  

If you want something light you can get the noodle soup (Pho).  I am not sure if this traditional Vietnamese dish is also a Thai dish but it is good, especially if your stomach is a little upset.

Like I said earlier very calm relaxing place to eat.  Sometimes the service is not as good when they are busy.  Weekdays are good.  The staff is very friendly.  When my duck was brought out the waiter was quietly quacking.  

By the way, there is no liquor, only beer and wine."}
{"text":"The BEST Tom Yum Soup ever!! This place has the authentic Thai food in Charlotte. I highly recommend it. My favorite place. Whenever I have sore throat or a cold, get the Tom Yum Soup."}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT the best Thai food in the Charlotte area despite what all the reviews say.  I ordered Pad Thai because it's always the first dish I try when eating at a new Thai spot and the best way to judge if they are authentic or not.  It was drenched, absolutely drenched, in sauce.  I totally agree with another reviewer who said there is BBQ sauce in it because that is all you can taste.  You cannot decipher the different flavors or textures due to the overwhelming flavor and amount of sauce in the dish.  The spring roll and soup were just ok.  The decor is the best part of Thai house sadly.  It's entirely too dark in there.  I was greeted and sat promptly, however, I felt extremely rushed to place my order as two separate waitresses asked me for my order after just settling into my booth.  If I go back, I will order something else for lunch.  I highly recommend trying Mai Thai II near Concord Mills instead of Thai House.  Thai Emerald in Huntersville or Thai Chef in Kannapolis are also better options."}
{"text":"This is a good standby Thai alternative. It's not the best, nor is it the worst. The staff is very good, the food was fine...and I like the woodwork, cheesey or not! If I am near UNCC and craving Thai...this is where I go!"}
{"text":"Authenticity at its finest. My favorite is the Pad Kra Pow aka Thai Basil Chicken. I love the additional juice and actual cooked basil in this dish which makes it unforgettable. Their spring rolls are nothing shy of amazing and they explode with flavor while maintaining their crispness. When I have a day off in the city this is my go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"Would Defined suggest going for lunch as the specials are on fleek! Definitely get the shrimp tempura--while fried carrots may sounds like walking cholesterol it taste like heaven. Didn't give this five stars because when I went the lunch wait was extremely long but I think that's because our server forgot about us."}
{"text":"I've been to this Thai House location on several occasions. The food is consistently good and reasonably priced. The service staff was friendly every time, not professionally trained but they were nice and that counts! The atmosphere inside is pleasant and clean. I gave them 5 stars for the fresh food quality and for the price."}
{"text":"I had takeout from here, visiting for a few days. Their Panang Curry was amazing. The Tom Kha was not very wonderful. The restaurant was super tidy and in a nice shopping center. I would definitely return for the Panang Curry!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai. Delicious and authentic taste. Huge portions so the price seemed fair. Had the egg plant krawpraw and enjoyed it very much. Service was good. Friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Everything was good and spicy.  I got the Tom Yum soup and the shrimp was big and fresh.  The broth was very flavorful.  I also got the curry with peanuts which was delicious. They were out of peanut sauce which was a little depressing though."}
{"text":"Great first experience here. Food came out extremely fast and was good quality. I got a brunch special (weekends 12-3pm) of Chicken Pad See-Ew which came with soup and a spring roll. The soup had veggies and rice in a clear broth and was simple but perfect to tide me over until my entree arrived. I also got a Thai iced tea which was a bit sweet but overall filled my craving. Service was polite but not super friendly. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Decor is gorgeous, very dark, lots of carved wood and imported artifacts. Service is demure and attentive and very, very quick. Prices are pretty high by my standards but not so much by CLT's - a dollar or two more a dinner entree than, say, Monsoon or Viet-Thai.

But let's be honest, Kids, this is white-i-fied Thai.

As in - sweeeeeet to an extreme and no 5 on the heat scale. Or even a 4. They kinda hit 3 when we got our curry \"Thai hot\" and, well, ya.

Pepper plate at every table was a nice touch - most of the time you need to request it. Presentation was lovely - our papaya salad came out on a cross between a cake stand and a hot pot, neeeet (note to veggies - it swims in fish sauce, so make your choice). But if you're me, and obsessive about curry, it's gotta be stellar to earn the stars. And while TH's has a great variety of vegetable matter it lacks a deepness of flavor and that all important punch of heat it needs to transcend.  

Still, not a bad spot for a casual dinner or even a date. Just don't come expecting a perfect, traditional plate of curry (which I did, and was). And stay away from the noodles unless you like things dessert-sweet."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Good prices. My father and I went here for dinner right when I got down to the area. Service was also on par. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Expensive and unhygienic. I found some hair in my food. Sorry to say that!

Not coming here again for sure."}
{"text":"San Francisco has no shortage of amazing Thai Food and we used to live literally down the street from a great place. Needless to say, when we moved to NC, it was a priority to find a good Thai restaurant. We tried a few places close to Davidson but the food was barely edible.

We stumbled upon Thai House after our DMV appointment and were pleasantly surprised by the food. We regularly order the Chicken Satay, Pad See Ew, and alternate between the Red, Green, and Yellow Curry. We also really enjoy the Sticky Rice w/ Mango desert. This is the best Thai food we've had in NC so far and our \"go-to\" place. I'm not sure why this place is rated relatively low, but if anybody knows of better Thai food, please let me know!"}
{"text":"Thai house is solid Thai food in a slightly inconvenient location.

Pros:

-Good Thai food.  Try the green curry, pad kee mow, pad thai, thai iced tea/thai iced coffee
-Fast service and polite staff
-Ambiance is superb. Most other asian restaurants in the area have no thematic decor/ambient lighting/music
-Wait staff have interesting traditional uniforms
-Outstanding Groupon/restaurants.com deals


Cons:

-Parking is a pain in that town center.
-Certain servers have thick accents.
-Speed is inconsistent.  Sometimes entrees come out before appetizers.
-Easy to rack up a big bill here.  Bills are comparable to Basil in uptown... but this area is University."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The atmosphere is extremely peaceful and authentic. The food is wonderful and the service is adequate. I've visited twice now and enjoyed it immensely both times. I'm so excited that I love this place as I'm pretty picky about food in general and I'm very pleased with everything I've eaten here so far. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"After coming here for over a year I realized it is an absolute staple in my diet. I come at least once a week for lunch. 

Lunch specials include an egg roll and soup with the dish you select. I've had quite a few dishes and now I get pad See ewe everytime. It is delish!  

Ive been to thai taste, basil, and a couple other restaurants that offer thai food and this is my fav. 

The university location is across the street from the hospital, behind the walgreens. Walking in the artwork is beautiful and all wood. Some tvs, lots of art,  a small bar, plenty of bamboo plants, and an extremely friendly wait staff makes the place very comfortable and casual while keeping it classy. 

Be forewarned though, like other Asian restaurants they do shut down for two hours between 2 and 4. The staff eats at this time and if your here during those times you may have to ask for help to pay your check. Still always worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good... really good.  But,  the service leaves something (MUCH) to be desired.  Have you ever had a waitress physically run away from you? When you ask her a question say, figure it out? Or when you ask, \"may i ask you a question?\" Reply, \"no!\" (As she's walking away.)  If not, come to this place and ask for the girl with the pink hair.... you will be disappointed.... very disappointed.  
 they have other sites, which may be better places to go. Or (if you have a desire to eat at this site) if you see her coming your way, just ask be seated in a different section. Trust me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  On my most recent trip, I actually ended up ordering the same dish, which was the wide noodle.

They have pretty decent sized servings, and also dish out a little soup.  I believe the soup varies as the first time I thought mine was creamy.  The second time mine had celery in it, which is pretty much one of two vegetables I really dislike.  I dug mine out, but finally gave up as the broth was pretty overwhelming with the celery taste.  (This is just me)..

I had a thai ice tea as well, which also was pretty good.

The service was always decent, the waiters/waitresses aren't very talkative, and they get a little busy at times.  (The place is usually pretty packed).

I can't comment about the other dishes, but I doubt I'll switch over from what I like.  I am betting next time I'm out there I will go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"I've been to Thai House a couple of times. The food is pretty good. However, a few times the staff made me feel rushed. Otherwise, it's a decent place for food. I particularly enjoy eating the pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"Ok, I usually have to try the pad Thai to officially evaluate a place but I got the Tom Yum soup and yellow curry and it was the best I've ever eaten. I have moved around a bit and am new to the area. I don't have to go anywhere else, this is my new spot!"}
{"text":"I appreciate great customer service! If the server, cook etc. makes a mistake with my order, I expect for it to be corrected properly. I should not have to compromise as the consumer. My experience today was that I ordered the Green Curry Shrimp and asked if the eggplant could be substituted with Zucchini  and I also asked for an extra side of rice. The eggplant was not substituted with the Zucchini and I didn't get the extra side of rice to eat with my entrée. I mentioned to the server and she said she would steam some Zucchini and remove the rice from my bill. The issue was that my dish was cooked in a sauce, therefore I asked if the Zucchini be cooked in the sauce as it would have been if the order was correct and I would have been satisfied. She could not fulfill that request. I mentioned to the owner which is the older lady that takes the money and she said I had to take it up with the server. My coworkers enjoy this restaurant and my food is usually good but I'm not sure if I will re-visit."}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday for \"brunch\" - it was really great!  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, not what I expected in a strip mall. The service was friendly and fast - having a pitcher of diet coke on my table was a happy surprise.

My husband ordered chicken Pad Thai and I ordered the Namprigpaow - tofu stir-fried with veggies. I ordered \"very spicy\" but I couldn't taste much hot. The pepper sauce on the table was a very good addition, but would have been better cooked into the sauce. That said, the veggies were cooked beautifully.

The spring roll was WONDERFUL - hot, fresh, crispy - the filling was tasty and fresh. I could have eaten several of those!

Altogether, I really enjoyed the Thai House and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Spent a bit of time at this restaurant enjoying both the food and the atmosphere. I loved the authentic servers dresswear. I'm not very original in my Thai food choices but because I tend to order Pad Thai most always I can say this was one if the best. I did expand my culinary endeavors a bit with my choice of drink which was delicious!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very deceiving about the menu options. The thai ice tea was unbearably sweet but she said it's \"slightly sweet\". It felt like drinking sugar milk, unexpected from a Thai restaurant. Would not recommend this restaurant for the price. Portion sizes are tiny and the tempura appetizer had no seasoning. Just head to the nearest China buffet for the same food but half the price."}
{"text":"This place is generally good for their food and ambience. Decent pricing of meals too. Sometimes, the food gets a little on the tangy side, but most of the times, the quality is decent. Its a must place for Thai food lovers .."}
{"text":"I come here with my boyfriend once in a while. The papaya salad and pad thai is a YES. When it's cold outside I like to order this thick rice noodle soup with broccoli. It is YUMMY. The only thing I would complain about is how in consistence the food can be. Sometimes the portion is less than it usually is. Also, its often that the padthai is soaked in sauce or there's no sauce. Once it looked like soup... lol


The staff is always friendly. Except this one lady that never smiles and quite rude. But either than that when you order something with duck the waiter would make duck noises! haha 

Get a bigger place... cus it gets SO PACKED. That's a sign that they serve good food!"}
{"text":"pretty good food. Soft crab is good and the bbq duck is good too. Just would like to have more dessert options. Service nice too."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte! Dine in or carry out the staff is very courteous and friendly. They know my wife and I and what we order. Prices are great and fast service."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and always get takeout. When made correctly the Pad Thai is excellent, but I find the cooks cut corners when they are very busy and do not make the food consistently well. They forget to add things like peanuts or the egg or sometimes the noodle consistency will be too mushy and overcooked. Again, when they take their time and do it correctly, it's great."}
{"text":"Solid.. good food, good service. I've had better thai, but for Charlotte, it's very good."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the long hours shopping at IKEA.. but we decided to stop here for dinner. My wife and I both enjoyed our plates. Don't recall what they are called to be exact.. but eggplant dish was on point. It wasn't a mushy or hard.. perfectly cooked and seasoned/sauced.
Only thing is, i wish it was tad bit spicier.. but I'll take it.

The wait staff was nice and friendly. We got white rice and wanted brown and they changed it without any argument. 

The restaurant decor was interesting. None of Thai restaurant I had was like that. Not saying if it's better or worse but different environment."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Pad Talay for dinner. It's an exceptionally good seafood Thai dish that will not disappoint and most couples could probably share together, particularly if you order appetizers. I've tried various lunch dishes as well, all of which were very good."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times with colleagues and didn't have issues.  This last time the service was horrible and people were rude.

I asked for an extra bowl and was told I had to order more food. For two people we had already ordered an appetizer, a soup, and two entrees. Poor service. 

Food came out the wrong spice level. It was so spicy I could barely enjoy my good and I eat spicy food all the time."}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice now and this last visit has me sold on this place. I got their Pad Thai the first time which was fine but today I got one of their special curries and I was super impressed. We also tried the fried spring rolls today and they were good and we were impressed by the portion size for the price. It is nice inside and the food comes out quickly. If you have never been in this crazy strip mall be prepared for being confused on how to get in the parking lot the first time! If you shoot for getting into the Walgreens area that will help."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here with whomever I come with. The entire staff where their traditional clothing as well, the decor is nice and the ambience is calming/relaxing. Every dish that I've had here has been amazing. 

Tonight I ordered the Gulf of Siam which has sautéed  with roasted chili paste, carrot, green onion, bell pepper, ginger, broccoli, and basil leaves. You can choose the meat to either be shrimp, squid, mussels, or seafood combination. Also I had the iced tea which is infused with jasmine. 

The only con that I would say about Thai House is that they're understaffed in my opinion. It's always crowded, which also shows their food is great but I need them to possibly gain a few more waiters/waitresses.

Other than that if you're in the University Area come check this place out."}
{"text":"My lunch of choice when I'm in the University area!  If I had to describe this place in one word: Efficient.  They get you sat, souped, watered, and ordered in a matter of minutes.  The food is quick, hot, and always right.  They get my spice level right every time too.  

If you have one of their coupons, be sure you tell them before you order.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge during the lunch rush.  They do offer call ahead pick up from the bar area as well.  The daily soup and a roll come with lunch orders.  Having visited several of their locations, this one is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

We had a much better experience with take out last night. I called in around 9:30 for some spicy chicken kee mow. They said it would be ready in 10 mins. We got there around 9:55p (10p closing time) for pick up. 

All the servers and cooks had stopped working at this time to have a meal of their own. They were sitting down feasting before closing time, not the best business approach. They were clearly not happy about my bf and me walking in as they thought we were here for a sit down meal. The attitude changed when I told them I was here for pick up. 

I paid about $11-12 for a generously portioned pad kee mow. The portion and flavor was much better than what we experienced during our last sit down visit. Not sure how that works, but I will be ordering take out at the last minute from now on."}
{"text":"We Always have a wonderful experience  dining in. The staff is super friendly and always greet us with a smile."}
{"text":"We love this place! My husband used to work right next door and would have lunch there at least once a week. The staff are so friendly and they always remember us when we go in! I haven't tried anything I don't like, and they always know exactly what I mean when I say I like my food \"Thai Spicy\". We moved further away, but still make an effort to drive out to university and have dinner at this location because we love it so much. Kai Khua is a must try if you like noodle dishes. Their lunch specials and spring rolls are great too!"}
{"text":"This place is the best- the staff is so friendly and the chicken pad thai lunch special is a  delicious deal."}
{"text":"I have high expectations for Thai because I'm from NY and this didn't do it for me. Food wasn't bad, but didn't taste that fresh, and I only had chicken pad Thai because I had to test the staple item."}
{"text":"Service is great, fast and friendly. Decor is nice also. 

The food, eh is something left to be desired. I judge my Thai restaurants based on three simple dishes; Pad Thai, yellow (or masaman) curry and pad see ew. These dishes are the staple at every Thai restaurant and if they can't get these dishes right, its highly likely others wont be good. The yellow curry was thick and a little on the bland side. The Pad See Ew, was way too soy sauce tasting. It was all wrong. The pad thai I havent tried, but a friend said it wasn't great. But I can't speak about that. 

I haven't tried too many Thai restaurants in Clt, but I hear there are some good ones. I have only had Monsoon, this place and Siam Garden. Siam Garden has been the best. It is in south Charlotte off the 485. They are always consistent and tasty. Their prad prik king is delicious."}
{"text":"After a very pleasant meal at Thai House, I thought it was only fair to update my review. Back in 2012, I wasn't familiar with Thai food and I'm still not, but after eating at a few more places and visiting Thai House again, I think they're pretty good and worth a much better review. 

Still super friendly and quick, but this time my waitress made several recommendations and pointed me in the correct direction. The rice dishes are really good along with the traditional favorites and curry."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Charlotte!

I have been coming to this restaurant since 2008 and I absolutely adore it. I've tried most (close to all) the Thai restaurants in Charlotte and this one always comes out on top. The staff is wonderful, always very welcoming and provide wonderful service. The lunch special can't be beat! Large portions, a spring roll, and soup for under $10!
I've tried quite a variety of items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. 

If you're in the mood for good Thai food then this place is a must!"}
{"text":"This place is often in our rotation for lunch. Placing orders over the phone are fairly easy and pick-up can be fast and painless or slow and painful. Depends on the day and how busy they are I guess. I will say one time when I was waiting a long time, they brought me a bowl of soup but I didn't really eat it because it was quite bland.

The pad thai is good. I wouldn't say it is the best in Charlotte but definitely worth eating again. They give you a big serving and you get your money's worth for sure. My only gripe is no matter how spicy I ask for it is never spicy. I often ask for \"thai spicy\" and don't get extra spice. I would love if they would put extra dried pepper on the side but it is struggle getting that. But other than that they are very accommodating. A coworker asked for extra sauce and boy did they lay it on her and while I was like what is that, she was very happy with the amount of extra sauce.

The veggie eggrolls included in the lunch specials are actually not so bad. And their curry is quite flavorful. But I would probably pass on the pad see ewe as it was not to my liking - mostly blah and not so delicious."}
{"text":"I will have to say the food wasn't the issue, although it wasn't that great to begin with and the price is a little much, the issue was with the service. We were a table of 6 and seated right in front of the cashier, so I'm sure they were aware we were there. However, we didn't get any service until repeated attempts to gain one of the multiple servers attention. Once we finally got service the server was extremely rude and rushing us to order. One person was not ready so he said \"never mind, I'll come back later\" and I was not happy. I told him there were other people ready to order. He saw I had a Restaurant.com coupon and he immediately grabs the Brunch menus out of our hands and says \"Coupon is only for dinner.\" I said, \"the coupon does not say that, but that is fine, we will not use it.\" He still continues to try to get us to order off the dinner menu when I say excuse me, no. He finally gives us back the brunch menu and tries to again walk away when I said please stop, we are ready to order. He asks if everyone wants water, which I instantly reply \"no\" and he takes those orders. Once one person is done with a number on the brunch item he walks away, even though they aren't done ordering. I have to tell him to stop and slow down several times during the order process. After we are done ordering he asks for the drink orders again and I was just upset at that point. My Mom ordered hot water and when they brought the drinks out, they put them on the edge of the table and said \"pass it down\". No hot water. I asked three different people and we received the water after we receive the brunch, which they again, left on the edge of the table for us to pass down to each other. After our brunch is served, they serve our appetizers.

With that type of service, if they actually let me use my coupon, I still would never come back."}
{"text":"Service is superb! Entire wait staff is very attentive and efficient. Food presentation is nice. You have to specify brown rice if you want it because they seem to push the white rice, especially on take-out. 

Green chicken curry was very tasty... Sauce a bit thin, but still good. Namprigpaow was excellent. I will definitely return."}
