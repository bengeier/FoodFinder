{"text":"Went in for lunch and took about 10mins to get my food. It was worth the wait, I got the shrimp lovers sushi burrito and it was amazing!!! The sound of the name \"Sushi Burrito\" was sort of repulsing but I was quite surprised of how good it was! Will return every time I'm in the area for a quick easy lunch."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this. Got a build your own sushi burrito. Great selection of ingredients, all very fresh. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Different approach to sushi. Fast and as you like it. Also inexpensive. A definite alternative to your standard sushi place."}
{"text":"Staff was okay.... food portions are very annoying helpful tip if you are going to charge the hell out of your customers give them good portions and stop being petty and charging for extra yum yum sauce at least fill the cups up!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love! So fresh, so easy, so tasty, so fast. I hope this place sticks around for a long time. The menu is simple, but the tuna is so wonderful. I want a sushi burrito every day."}
{"text":"Delicious, but gave me terrible food poisoning the first time I went. Staff was great! I love sushi and I love burritos so I was really looking good forward to trying this place, I wish the outcome had been better. I may try again and update my review at a later date. It is a risk I am willing to take for food as delicious as this was."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and chose the Roll Your Owb.  Ingredients were fresh and delicious.  Moderately spicy having chosen wasabi mayo and spicy tuna.  I plan on coming again to try out more!  Woke up completely craving a sushi burrito...Get a location on the Westside!!! :)"}
{"text":"I has the sushi burrito and my fiance had the chicken hibachi.   The sushi burrito was actually quiet tasty; however, it was rather small for the price. The fish and vegetables all seemed very fresh and of high quality which likely explains the price point.   The chicken hibachi left me wanting more. It resembled the type of Japanese food you could get in a mall cafeteria.  Nothing particularly special about it    All in all, I would go back for the sushi burrito on occasion, but I wasn't blown away by any means."}
{"text":"Sushi burrito is great. The hibachi food lacked everything. The flavor for the hibachi is bland and lacking. I highly don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place heading to another restaurant. Stopped when we saw the reviews. Great fresh sushi wraps and quick service. Kimchi was on point. Great find for some lucky out of towners."}
{"text":"The place, as mentioned before, has a subway feel. The staff was nice, but did not seem knowledgeable about the 'fusion' bit when I asked. The end product was an attempt to fuse Mexican with Sushi. It just doesn't work for me. Not only was the cost fairly high for what was, essentially, lots of filler and very little sushi, but the mix just wasn't to my taste. If the cost is not an issue and you want a fusion of these two cuisines then this might be the place for you. Personally I would prefer either of these separately."}
{"text":"I would give these mfs 0 stars if I could!  there was a piece of chewed up gum in my food and they refused to give me my money back!!!! turrible turrible tuuuuurrible"}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S!  EAT HERE! My first thought when passing by and catching a glimpse of the sign was, \"did that sign really say sushi burrito?\" I love burritos and I love sushi.  BUT WAIT!  This is North East Ohio.  I had to have misread the sign that probably actually said, \"Another Sandwich Shop.\"  Because if it's not a pizza shop or a sandwich shop, you're not in Ohio anymore.  Nope!  It did say sushi burrito.  So my second thought was, they must be making fish burritos.  Nope!  They're actually making burrito size sushi rolls. I went in and ordered a sushi burrito and hibachi chicken.  The menu for burritos is kind of set up like a Chipotle menu where you can pick your ingredients step by step. I ordered from the specialty menu.  Not as big as a Chipotle burrito and not too different from a typical sushi roll, but bigger and with a few unexpected ingredients like corn and poke lettuce.  I liked it. The chicken reminded me of a good teriyaki plate- very generous portion, (I'm a fat guy and I couldn't finish it,) with vegetables, I'd guess a pound of chicken, and good, flavorful short grain Japanese rice- not instant rice. For $6.75.  We'll worth it.   The staff is very nice- a young guy sat out at the tables greeting guests and seemed genuinely interested in customer experience. This is good food folks!  Don't be shy.  Go Eat it."}
{"text":"Wow!   Don't be fooled by the rough exterior.   They offer sushi burritos that are fabulous!   The Wasabi Tuna is my favorite so far.   You can also build your own burriotos with lots of options.   Don't care for sushi?   They also offer hibachi meals that look yummy.   I will definitely try one after I've tried all the Sushi \"Burritos\".  Extras are available too... Chicken,  noodles,  rice,  etc.   Don't judge them by their website either.   It's horrible.   I brought home a menu so I can order ahead.   Staff has been very personable and friendly both times I went in to order to go.   The sushi case is right there and you can watch the Chef's build your yummy burrito.   Love it!!!"}
{"text":"We were just passing through and decided to stop here. So glad we did! It was delicious and reasonably priced. I made my own sushi burrito and my husband had the Wasabi Tuna. He said it was very spicy, so watch out!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is brand-new it just opened. the food is extremely fresh Restaurant quality sushi but at an easy and convenient walk-in and walk out Subway sandwich style ordering. They call it a sushi burrito because it's like a jumbo roll that they cut in half. It looks like a big rolled burrito. You can add just about anything there are up charges and if you want Wasabi or Ginger it's extra. I usually get it on the side.  You can choose to eat in the small dining area or to go... everything is made to order nothing is pre-made so it's always fresh. The prices are extremely reasonable my burrito was $6.50 a typical jumbo roll that size at the restaurant in the mall would run me 10 to $14 the only difference is it comes in 2 pieces instead of sliced Sushi roll pieces. I will be visiting here on a regular basis I love it!! the restaurant is on the corner easy to pull in and pull out if your headed west on Mentor Avenue if you are headed east on Mentor Avenue your best bet is to turn around so that you're on the same side of the road and pull in.   Its is too hard to turn left into the parking lot when coming from the West. Coupon good till 11/30"}
{"text":"Did the roll your own option with spicy tuna. So good! If you like sushi this is one of the best options in the area for fresh and customizable quick meals. Service was friendly and fast"}
{"text":"New Asian Fusion Restaurant. They feature something called a Sushi Burrito. A Sushi Burrito is a massive roll that is cut in half and served like a wrap. For those who don't want a roll there are hibachi options"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch recently. The area is lacking a GOOD hibachi place and I thought this would remedy that. I got the chicken and beef hibachi with noodles along with the rice and vegetables. The fried rice was delicious and perfectly cooked. The noodles were a bit oily, but otherwise very good. The chicken, however, had an odd texture. It was kind of rubbery, but at least the flavor was good. The beef was awful. Tasteless and very rubbery, it didn't taste like fresh beef AT ALL. No flavor to it whatsoever. It tasted like imitation beef or something. Very weird. Next time I go, I'll be sure to avoid the beef and maybe give the chicken another chance or try out the sushi burritos. But I'm worried those ingredients won't be fresh based on the fact that the beef wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a cornered the location. Really good quality of ingredients. Got salmon and eel. Both very good. Even rice is good not like other Chinese fast food places. Definitely Worth the price."}
{"text":"I drove 50 miles for this sushu for my birthday and tbey had the most incredible sushi burritos and appetizers! It tastes so delicious and fresh. Its totally worth the drive to get this sushi! I was full and and satisfied for hour and still wanted more! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First sushi burrito ever, and I am forever in love.  The skinny sumo burrito was tremendously delicious, as was the tofu/veggie and rice bowl. Seriously, so so good. That yum yum sauce.... good Lord.   Highly recommend creating your own sushi burrito also, so many ingredient and sauce combinations you can choose from.   We just thoroughly enjoyed the taste and quality of the food, we weren't expecting much upon pulling up in the parking lot but we're so glad we didn't judge the book by its cover.  Also, it's super vegan/vegetarian friendly, with many options to chose from."}
{"text":"I don't like sushi, but I've stopped here a few times for the take out hibachi.  I've tried both the beef and chicken....chicken is pretty tasty but the beef could use some work.  Typical hibachi fare at much lower prices.  Wish they had some more options for veggies and sauces, but you get what you pay for.  Loyalty program as well."}
{"text":"Simple but good. A great alternative to traditional sushi, if you are in a hurry. I used the 20% off grand opening coupon   I suggest the additional $2 in the make your own burrito for the extra fish. I had soypaper with white rice, tuna, salmon, cream cheese, avocado and crunch. Dipped the burrito in soy and then eel sauce. One totally fills you up, it's quite large. I would definitely go back. But probably get a similar burrito, there are not a ton of choices. Very plain, non fancy decor in the restaurant. Good value."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in and try this new place...sounded interesting, so I did last night. Unfortunately, the \"super size me\" mentality of American fast food culture fails miserably here.  A relatively large, somewhat difficult to eat burrito size roll of sushi turned out to be a bad idea. I have no doubt the ingredients are fresh, but trying to create a  Mexican-Japanese style doesn't work. Burritos tend to be messy and we expect that. Sushi rolls are more delicate and we consume them in more bite size pieces.  Some people may like this place, but it's not for me."}
{"text":"So happy to have one of these in Mentor! Great sushi and friendly staff. Definitely recommend it to anyone who love sushi. There hibachi menu is great as well!"}
{"text":"At first I was a little unsure about concept of sushi burritos but after a long day of shopping  I finally decided to try it. And I was not disappointed!  The sushi was fresh. They have a lot  of variety to choose from . I normally get the salmon classic which is always good.  The staff is polite and willing to give suggestions.  The service is super fast it took less than 10 minutes for my order to be prepared. I go all the time now when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Hibachi for the price of take out? SOLD. I've had the hibachi chicken and shrimp, however I have not tried the sushi burritos, I'm not quite sold on the idea of those. The hibachi comes with fried rice and veggies, AND (best part) yum yum sauce. The portions are quite large, I can usually get two meals out of it. The only downfall is when you order take out at the counter it takes 10-15 minutes, but that's expected when they're cooking it fresh, so I typically order online and pick up and it's ready by the time I drive there. Kudos to whoever came up with this idea. Hibachi is one of my favorites and it's great that I don't have to pay $20+ a plate at an actual restaurant to get it."}
{"text":"New spot in town, had to check it out, curious about the name until I walked in and saw what the sushi chef was making. The \"burrito\" is a futomaki \"rice on the inside\" with all the fillings on the inside and the Nori or soy paper option is the shell. I order a specialty roll the Wasabi tuna and while I was waiting decided to order another one that I built myself. You could also get a poke version without the Nori and in a bowl over a salad $6.75  Everything was fresh and delicious and it was quick. Prices range from $6.75 to about $10 depending on what you'd like in your roll. Didn't try any hibachi but it looked great too. I will definitely be back, very friendly staff, and the place was spotless. Great quick healthy option, a little messy but the flavors more then made up for it. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Y'all have a true gem here! We dribbled upon this accidentally on a drive. We have searched both the Dallas,TX & Austin,TX areas for sushi burritos and nothing! Not only was this affordable, but very tasty."}
{"text":"We love the sushi burritos! I was weirded out by the concept at first, but you get a lot for your money and it is definitely tasty. I wasn't as impressed by the hibachi but we will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Not your typical sushi... wait ain't all sushi we've come to know is actually \"non-authentic sushi\". So come one with it with that new new. Basically it's a sushi roll with out cutting into individual bit size circles. Thus you eat it like a burrito. Hey it's good and leaves you feeling like you made a heather choice."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try a sushi burrito ever since i saw one of my friends eating one in LA. So then when I visited LA I had to have it and we follow their sushi burrito food truck all over but for some reason we kept missing them. I was so upset.   But finally a sushi burrito place in Cleveland! Well I guess it's considered Kirtland/Mentor area. We tried the wasabi tuna burrito but because I don't like wasabi I got it without the wasabi mayo. The burrito has corn, carrot,lotus chop, cucumber, avocado, lettuce, and red onion. The corn and onion gave it a feel of a Mexican burrito but it really worked with the raw tuna. The only thing I would have added to my burrito because I didn't have the wasabi mayo would be spicy mayo or eel sauce. I look forward to trying the other special burritos on their list as well as their poke bowls. Although I have raved about the sushi burritos this place also does hibachi which I have yet to try so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"DONT LET THE OUTSIDE/LOCATION THROW YOU OFF! This is good quality sushi served as one large burrito at a decent price. Nothing weird because it has the name burrito. I'm a huge sushi lover so it makes me pretty picky but I can't get over that it's yummy and you create your own for like $6. (Side note: I can eat 2-3 rolls of sushi which is costly but one burrito fills me up)  On the store/design side... it could use a little renovation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch. The sushi is always good and the staff is always friendly. I love their stamp cards where you get a free burrito after so many orders. Their sides are a good size portion and really cheap, as well."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy! We both had rolls--you can make your own too. Ingredients tasted fresh, service was friendly and atmosphere was clean. For 2 rolls and 2 drinks it was $19. But for those complaining about price, if you like sushi, you'll know that it's not usually cheap--especially when it's good. And for $6.75 for the create your own you get a HECK OF A LOT more than you would going to any other sushi place. This will be a favorite place now for us! Try the \"fusion\" pop--tastes like a combo of vanilla, Dr Pepper, and root beer."}
{"text":"Ordering is kind of weird like going to Subway but the end result is fantastic had the classic salmon and it was delicious.  A little difficulty eating sushi in that big piece,  next time I'll ask him to cut it smaller.  I recommend everyone try it!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, large varieties to chose from. Awesome sushi burritos and hibachi. Highly recommended.  Sushi rolls are available upon request."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good. I got the chicken and beef hibachi. There's a sweet brown sauce under the veggies (zucchini, carrots, onion, and shrooms), and a creamy sauce comes on the side. I also like the location which is close to me :)"}
{"text":"The hibachi is excellent and very reasonably priced. Never had a bad meal. Prompt and courteous service."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and made right in front of you. The Fire & Ice burrito was phenomenal! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place! This is a new restaurant in mentor. Food sounds good and to be honest, it doesn't taste bad. Attitude from the girl standing behind the counter to these guys making food is on different level. I am Chinese and I can understand what they were saying while I was ordering take out. They were talking trash about all the customers in the restaurant. I mean every single one of them. What kind of people are they? I don't think I have ever come across something this insensitive from any sort of business. It's funny that they did not think I am Chinese. Please do youselves a favor and don't go to this restaurant. They definitely need to change their attitude towards their customers. Keep in mind that they are the one paying you. They are not there to be make fun of by you. How would you feel if someone say the same thing that you are saying about you? I just don't want to write it here because they are not appropriate. Man.. wow..."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few months ago and I find myself coming weekly multiple times with a 30 min drive from Middlefield that's how good the food is."}
