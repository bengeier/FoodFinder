{"text":"Open two days. Couldn't be happier. Best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. Summer rolls are top notch, and the owner is a gracious host!"}
{"text":"I've been to so many Thai restaurants and this one just bummed me out. I wanted it to be good because it's close by. I was eating my drunken noodles (which tasted much like pad thai) and tasted something that was musty! To the trash. $13.50 for a small plate of noodles...Or I can pay a whole $2 less for the half order. What's the point of a $2 spread anyway?  To top it off, a woman stood around while I waited for someone to take my order. I give it 6 months tops."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because they did open up 15mins early and the fried rice was OK.  The reason they did NOT get a better rating is because of the price/serving size ratio is ridiculous.   I paid 11.24(after tax) and this is what I got(see pic).  Won't go back which is a shame since it's so close to work etc."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Such a gem. The food was awesome, portions were large, and service was fantastic. Best fresh spring rolls in Pittsburgh! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but portion sizes are way too small for the price. I paid almost $11 and was quite offended by the less than one cup serving."}
{"text":"Newly opened in Bakery Square. The food was great, plentiful and fast. The menu has a nice variety to it. We went for lunch and it made it to the \"at least a couple of times a month\" lunch list. The only thing missing was artificial sweeteners for the iced tea, but, if that's the least glitch they ever have..."}
{"text":"Oh Asiatique - we were so hopeful that there would be a good thai restaurant opening up at Bakery Sq, but alas. The food is worse than grocery store thai - limp grey noodles, sorry old vegetables. Only the green beans seemed fresh - they were in everything so they must have been on sale. The lemongrass soup was OK. The papaya salad was not terrible. Noodles and curry however, take a pass. We wanted to be regulars but instead this was our one and only time in."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and enjoy their cooking. There are many vegetarian options. Their curries and magic tofu are good. The service is friendly. Their noodle dishes like pad see ew are a bit too sauced/ flavored for me; I prefer Thai cottage, personally. Everyone has a different preference: for me, other popular Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh have saltier/ too much sauce in their dishes (eg noodlehead)."}
{"text":"Ok I ordered green curry and it wasn't good. That is all.  Basically the portion was too small, the green curry that I ordered was filled with green peppers, it felt like it was green pepper curry and not green curry.  A lot of things taste like chicken in food... but here the chicken didn't taste like chicken. It tasted mostly what best describes and old nothing.  The good thing is that my food was not bad, aside from those above which leaves it to only he rice and the curry juice itself, which were fine and hence the 2 stars. Staff and service were pretty good too.  I felt pretty bad for my Freind who ordered some kind of noodle soup which literally tasted like mm old nothing as well. Definitely not coming back here. :/"}
{"text":"I had Pad See Ew with chicken (my standard order for the first time at a new thai place, helps me compare).  Table also ordered some avocado spring rolls.  The others at my table were all vegetarian and ordered Chiang Mai curry, and a veggies/basil sauce dish, forget what it was called on the menu.  My veggie companions don't like tofu, and it was a 2 minute conversation with our waitress before she understood that we wanted the orders made vegetarian, but without tofu.  She also left our table without a word in the middle of a small pause in us giving our order.  She went to the cashiers stand to put in what we'd placed so far, and then went to the kitchen area.  It was 5 minutes before she returned to take the rest of our order.  None of us were asked how spicy we would like our dishes, and they were universally bland.  Not a single speck of chili on my See Ew noodles.  I asked for hot sauce and was given Sriracha, while while delicious, doesn't really set the tongue on fire.    No reason to go here over the multitude of other Thai restaurants within a 5-10 minute drive.  The place was relatively full on a Friday night, I have to believe it's just people trying it out for the first time..."}
{"text":"The lunch portion was way too small with tiny diced tofus. I couldnt believe how little noodle the dish had when it came out. The drunken noodle was just salty and not tasty. I wouldnt recommend paying $9-10 for this. The walnut street has multiple restaurants that offer more delicious and fresh lunch with cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least a dozen times and the food is steadily going downhill. Ordered a curry that did not contain the veggies listed on the menu. The vegetables that were included were hard, and the curry sauce had hardly any flavor. This latest meal was probably the worst Thai food that I have ever had at a restaurant in any city."}
{"text":"The smell of disinfectant permeates and clobbers any taste. Bland, forgettable and overpriced...read the owners bio on the website. Clearly she fancies herself the Queen of Siam...a visit to any good family Thai or Vietnamese place in Seattle or Calif. would suggest otherwise. Truly makes Nicky's seem stellar (it isnt); pittsburghers clearly deserve better but need to recognize it and demand it.  Perhaps this why the place is nearly totally empty at any given lunchtime when it should be full of hungry white and blue collar workers. A must to avoid"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile now, and finally did this week. Wow! Really good food. I've been here twice this week for lunch, and each meal (Spicy Pumpkin & Chicken curry, and the Spicy Red Curry) were very tasty.   If you like extra spicy food, ask for Thai Hot. It's definitely spicy.   This place is very clean inside and the staff is friendly. Definitely worth a visit if you want good Thai food."}
{"text":"Its great food. Pad thai, thai samosa, soups...great!"}
{"text":"Fresh and wonderful Thai food prepared with quality ingredients and a judicious use of seasonings, sugars, and oils, resulting in a meal that tastes great but also leaves you feeling good too.   The beef is well cared for and not chewy.  The brown rice is well prepared.  The food's temperature somehow remained hot during the whole meal."}
{"text":"Tried this new Thai restaurant for dinner takeout once and it is so-so. We ordered red curry with chicken and pad Thai with veges and tofu. Both dishes were better than the rubbish that comes out of other supposedly Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh (except for the excellent Nicky's Thai). So that's a plus. However, being better than severely mediocre (or worse) places nearby isn't a good compliment.   Worth a try? Yes. Worth going out of your way? Probably not.  One thing I noticed was that the menu was relatively short and was missing some Thai mainstays like stirfry dishes. Hopefully that will come in due course. And hopefully the owner, who is from Thailand, will see an opportunity here to not only provide \"healthy\" Thai but to also introduce more authentic dishes that one would expect to eat if visiting Thailand."}
{"text":"This is crap, absolute crap. No flavor, no spice, and soggy spring rolls. I would never eat here again and will tell my friends to avoid it at all costs.  If I was allowed to give it 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Food is succulent ....and so fresh...my kids and I have a difficult time ordering locally now.. Fresh...fresh...ingredients and the lady who owns it is a gem!!!!! My food is made to taste EVERY TIME... I could eat here every single day.... The soup, I would love to have an endless supply of.   It's been about two weeks and I miss the place!!! Plus, the wait staff is so pleasant...and when we try something new, they are always willing to explain... PS... The owner buys all if her ingredients from local farmers markets and uses only organic spices, as well as ingredients ....as available..!!! That impressed me...  Listen to me....and try this restaurant...you will be happy and feel healthier after eating here often...x Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh surprisingly has a lot of great Thai places so I have to be harsh in my reviews of them since there are so many options.  I came here and got some spicy drunken noodles for takeout.  They did not ask me for a spice level, which is unusual.  The food ended up being blander than other places.  It was also pretty expensive at $12 for a lunch portion."}
{"text":"Excellent. Authentic Thai. Fresh. Large Portions. Best in Pittsburgh.   Note: Food is not very spicy."}
{"text":"This place served watered down Tom ka soup, the tofu was basically slime. Even the Tom yum was bad. Don't waste your money here there are way better options for Thai not far away."}
{"text":"Tom Yam Kung soup with noodle was good. But other thing we ordered, summer shrimp rolls and Pat Thai was no good. Pat Thai was not taste like Pat Thai. I will go back only for noodle soups, which I did not find any other Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Mediocre food, extra slow service, rude server, excessively expensive. $12 for a small tofu padthai that took 40min to arrive. And it was COLD when we got it. How was that even possible? This place is mind-bendingly bad. Don't waste your time or money.   Ps I'm from Thailand and have pretty low standard for thai food in the US. But so far thai food in pgh has been decent, except this place. Exceptionally shitty."}
{"text":"A note about this area, rather than the restaurant itself: The parking in this little strip area is TERRIBLE. Be prepared to look around in the parking garage for a bit.  My friend and I got here a little after 1, slightly before the lunch rush began. We were greeted by the hostess, who was very friendly, and seated quickly; she and the server, Timmy, offered us suggestions since we had never been here before. We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, a pot of Jasmine hot tea, the Tom Kha Noodle Soup with shrimp, Spicy Basil Fried Rice with chicken, Green Curry with vegetables, and Spicy Pumpkin Curry with beef. We shared everything, and dishes and utensils for sharing were provided; the food came in \"courses\"; the drinks and soup were very prompt, and the main dishes came while we were eating our soup.  Both of us were very impressed with the quality of the food, for the most part, and my friend is VERY choosy about her Thai. The iced tea was fairly good, and the brewed tea was unremarkable, as was the fried rice--the soup and curries were where this place really shone. I especially appreciated the nicely cooked pumpkin. And the lean, tender beef that seems to be so hard to get right in restaurants. They're good at gentle, flavorful spice that doesn't hurt to eat.  Service was quick and friendly, the decor was nice but unremarkable, the place wasn't too busy, and the price was pretty good: the whole meal cost a bit over $48 with lunch prices. Some of the only Thai food my friend has actually enjoyed in years. We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. I've been wanting to try this place for a while. There weren't a lot of people there which made it better to get our food quicker. The atmosphere was quiet but not bad. The place looked clean, too. I ordered the Lemon Grass soup as an appetizer with chicken and coconut milk (you have a choice of vegetable, chicken, or shrimp and with or without coconut milk). It was really good! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would've liked a big portion of it, to be honest. My main meal was the spicy basil tofu and it was good. I've had better spicy basil, but I enjoyed the veggies the most that came in the meal. It just wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked and they skimped on the Thai basil. I really enjoyed my soup better than my main course.   My friend got one of the main course soups and I tried the broth and that was tasty. I would go back for one of their noodle soups, for sure, I think that's probably what they make best.    ***I wanted to update my review to also say that no other Thai place I've been to makes better Tom Kha soup than here!"}
{"text":"One morning, I was hanging out getting coffee in bakery square and I noticed this gem in the corner of the complex! I love Thai, so I absolutely jumped for joy. Because I was so excited to try it, I waited until it opened and ordered some takeout.   Their menu is a decent size, so of course I was contemplating ordering something different than what I normally do. I usually go with Pad Thai, or pineapple fried rice. If It ain't broke, don't fix it. I knew I couldn't go wrong with my usuals. I chose to go with the pineapple fried rice this time around. I also got some Thai egg rolls on the side.   The food was ready in about 20 minutes. It was so fresh and good. The spring rolls were nice and crispy yet, juicy and soft. The pineapple fried rice had the perfect mix of sweet and salty that I like. The only thing that I didn't like is the fact that the pineapple fried rice comes with shrimp. I hate shrimp. But I simply pushed them to the side, and continued to eat my rice because it was so good. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This place just opened today, had the roast duck summer rolls, vegetable drunken noodles and the seafood dish that has a photo on the menu - seafood lak sa noodles. Everything was amazing. Come here."}
{"text":"Great for take out. Sometimes the spice amount in the food varies depending on Chef.  4 stars - solid place to go eat for good value."}
{"text":"Again...an excellent choice. Good variety. Very flavorful. I made a few substitutions on my green curry and they had no problem with the exchange. Shrimp pad Thai was true to form. Lots of flavors. Avocado spring roll was yummy!!!  Big perk...BYOB. ANOTHER perk...Thai Iced Tea And yet another perk...free, plentiful parking"}
{"text":"I am Thai and was raised with Thai food, and I am overall not a picky eater. I've eaten at at least 80 Thai restaurants in my life, in different cities and countries, including in Thailand. This place was highly disappointing - disappointing enough to motivate me to get on Yelp and write a review after working a shift from 6am to 6pm. The $13.50 drunken noodle tasted super bland despite being ordered at 10/10 spiciness. They didn't even use the proper flat noodle for a drunken noodle dish. The noodle's texture felt like the ones you get from instant noodle packs. It also tasted like your average, bland fast food Chinese Chow Mei/Fun. There was no taste. They also give small proportion considering their price. There was a musty odor at the entrance of the restaurant when I went to pick up my order too. The interior design of the store was pleasant though. However, it did feel like they were overcompensating with their excessive Thai symbols in the restaurant - map of Thailand, picture of Thai king (found in almost every Thai person's house), Thai background music, and a bunch of other Thai antiques. It made me feel as if they were compensating for not really being Thai. LING Robinson is also not a Thai name and judging by the drunken noodle, I doubt that this place is Thai owned. It's common to have other nationalities capitalize off of Thai's notoriety in food and that's fine as long as the food at least resemble Thai food. On the wall of the restaurant, it said that she's made multiple appearances on TV and \"has fans approaching her at random health food markets asking her for tips.\" What a joke! Instant noodles taste better than her recipe and cost 50x less. They are abusing customers who aren't aware of how Thai food is supposed to taste."}
{"text":"The service is very good. I ordered the beef basil - the taste is great but a little bit expensive (I mean the portion size is smaller compared to other Thai restaurants)."}
{"text":"Just okay food, we are lucky to have such great choices for Thai close by, but the cooking here is not quite as good.  The service is excellent and the food arrives quickly.   The dining room is pleasant, and the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, well lit, and relatively spacious. Service was very good, with the staff friendly and helpful. The meals were your traditional Thai fare, from noodles to curries to soups. Price is comparable to other places in the city. The food was very good, with the portions a bit larger than I would expect from a Thai restaurant.   The only knock against this place is the parking situation. Bakery Square is notorious for lack of parking. This isn't a knock against the restaurant, but something to consider.   Would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting Thai food."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Friday with a friend. I went with the chicken pad thai, with spice on the side, as that's usually my go-to when I'm checking out a new thai place. I loved the pad thai! I ate ALL of it... which never happens, and proves how delish it was. The spice on the side was a nice touch, because I could control how spicy I wanted each bite to be. Customer service here was great as well! Will def. return!"}
{"text":"Living where I do, I always enjoy when business open up nearby. So I was quite excited when I saw this little thai place open in Bakery Square.  I came here for lunch after the gym to keep my metabolism up and it started well. The place is cute, decked out in minimalistic Thai decor and some ambiance music. I was seated swiftly and supplied with water.  I ordered the Sun-Penang Curry to kick up my spice level a little which came quickly and looked quite pretty. I had mine with Chicken. However that is about all that can be said about it. The spice level was adequate for my white girl taste buds, however I am disappointed to say the chicken was overcooked and hard and so, of all things, was the rice. Hard rice is not a pleasant surprise.  The chicken within the curry was a little flavorless, the saving grace was the well done broccoli, however it was seconds from being overdone as well. The portion was a good lunch size, however the price would have expected much more on the plate. For the service I have nothing to complain about.  All together, very disappointing and will not return. Even with my love/hate relationship with Social, you are much better off wandering across the parking lot for it."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Lemongrass soup perfect for the winter. Had the king chicken which was tasty. Good atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"First, I should mention that I am a Thai food fanatic. I've tried many Thai restaurants in different cities and I've tried 6 different ones in Pittsburgh so far. I was going to order dinner from my current favorite Thai restaurant in the area but decided to try Asiatique in the hopes of finding another great food place. Sadly, this has to be the most inauthentic Thai food I have ever had.   I got food to-go from here so I can't comment on their service but their food was not what I expected at all. The restaurant itself looks nice inside but ultimately if you're in the food business, the food matters most. The drunken noodles had egg noodles (not the flat rice noodles that are used in this dish) and bean sprouts (???? I've never heard of bean sprouts in drunken noodles). There were also no tomatoes and the spices used in the dish tasted like the McCormick spices you can buy at any grocery store.   It may not seem like a huge difference, but overall the dish tasted no different than an order of chicken with noodles from my neighborhood chinese fast-food.  With that being said, it wasn't absolutely terrible if you enjoy that specific taste but I couldn't give more than 1 star because they charged $12.50 for Chinese food that I can buy for 5 bucks.   If you're planning on going here with friends or on a date, keep in mind that this food isn't really Thai food and you may be disappointed with the taste, especially considering the price. I guess the only positive thing I can comment on is that the place is pretty so your instagram/Fb pictures will look nice.   P.S. If this is your first time ever trying Thai food, please try another place first. I know if I had a bad first experience with it, I probably wouldn't have a favorite cuisine today. A good way to tell if the food will taste like authentic Thai food is if either the owner or the cook is Thai.   Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Best bubble smoothie tea. They have so many options! Yum and the noodle soups are delicious and gluten free!"}
{"text":"I love Thia food. I try to try a new dish each time I go to a Thai place. I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Service is fast, prices are very affordable. Pad Thai chicken and duck summer roll are great. Chilli peppers doesn't make pain in stomach"}
{"text":"Pretty average (at least the drunken noodles were). Not bad, but lots of better Thai options in the area."}
{"text":"Would I go back?  Sure.  Would I go out of my way?  Probably not.  We stopped here for lunch while in the area.   Here's the scoop...  The décor is fine - not spectacular, but better than average for the type of restaurant.  My only complaint was that walking in the front door, it smelled a little of bleach and mop water...not very appetizing.      The menu had a bunch of options.  We tried the King Chicken and the Lemongrass Beef.   The server didn't ask at all about spice levels and I forgot, so we got what we got.  My mom's chicken was way too spicy for her and my beef was sort of bland.  We switched dishes and were both happier.  Both meats were overcooked, but the sauces were enjoyable (again, once we switched dishes).     The service was so so.  Not horrible, but nothing to write home about.   We had to wait kind of a while for the check given that it was a weekday lunch.   It wasn't crowded even though everything around it looked to be."}
{"text":"We love this beautiful place tucked in a corner of Bakery Square. Even our 12 and 8 year old loved what they ordered: Pad Thai and Fresh Rolls w/ shrimp. The fresh rolls with tofu were also excellent. They were made with avocado which was a nice touch. Our main dishes were Tofu in a ginger sauce and a rice noodle dish with bok choy, garlic, egg and tofu. The staff was warm and accommodating to our dietary needs. And everything is fresh, non GMO and made to order. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience from start to finish.  Authentic Thai food, highly recommend. Egg Rolls were fantastic!  Salad scrumptious, curry beef yummy!  Fried rice...fish out both excellent!  Asiatique was clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"It's right across from where we live, so it's a nice place to go to easily. The wait staff are always very gentle and we love the duck noodle soup from here. I've also had their thai ice tea and pad see yew."}
{"text":"I got the Chiang Mai Curry with chicken, to go. It tasted okay but was a bit bland. That is all."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  But what I love about this place is the customer service.  The chef is a very nice lady.  I asked if they can use olive or coconut oil instead of canola/vegetable oil and she was more than happy to do it for me.  She even added a free sample of the spring rolls and yucca desert just so I can try it."}
{"text":"I come here once a week. I love it. the panag chicken is supreme and the pumkin curry is soo good. the spice levels are true and I never get more spice then I request. the employees are very kind and remember me.  I am so glad they opened in bakery square, because its close to my work, and they are fast and fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  It was average to me.  I am not a Thai expert but have had probably 8 different places Thai food (in several cities).  I would rank this one number 6 or 7 probably.  I didn't taste any of those unique Thai flavors in the food.  The BYOB dine in experience looked cool.  We like 2 minutes away, I hope that it gets better over time.  It is in an awesome location so it will likely remain the same quality of food (with continued increase in price) given the growth occurring in Bakery Square."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night on a whim because we were hungry in the vicinity of Bakery Square and the wait at Social was insane. Ultimately, I'm glad that I did! It's extremely clean and modern and I found the two clocks (one for Pittsburgh and one for Thailand) amusing because Thailand is exactly 12 hours ahead of our Eastern time zone. The service was decent, though the one waiter seemed a bit overwhelmed, the food was fresh and bright.  We ordered the avocado summer rolls, the drunken noodles, and the thai basil fried rice. All dishes were quite good, the fried rice was not as spicy as expected, but it's probably better than being too spice. Definitely better than some of the Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. As far as price goes, I paid a little more than I would've liked to, but it's Bakery Square and the rent for the restaurants are considerably higher than the run down places elsewhere in Shadyside/East Liberty.   The smoothie menu looked great, so I will have to visit when it isn't ten degrees outside. Also, it's BYOB."}
{"text":"We eat here weekly and really enjoy this place, which in many ways (former staff opened this place) is a reincarnation of the former Green Mango in Regent Square. The quality is consistent and the staff are always so welcoming.  The Tom Kha soup, pineapple fried rice, spicy lemongrass salad, Thai summer rolls, and drunken noodles are favorites. I suspect if it weren't so clean and attractive inside, there would be fewer complaints about authenticity- people tend to assume a dive is more \"real\" ;)  if you want something to be extra spicy, order it \"Thai hot\" and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent piece of Thai in Pittsburgh! Decor and space are very welcoming and clean. Food is authentic. Which is hard to find these days with all these fusions places around. Immediate attention and water on your table when you sit. We started with the veggie spring role. All i can say is WOW! The pairing sauce was so good i kept it to use with my dinner. Then I ordered the thai iced tea with pumpkin chicken. LOVED IT! Shared the Pad Thai! MONEY! Wife had ordered the tofu red curry. Curry sauce FANTASTIC! Would have enjoyed more if they fried the tofu. Im sure they couldve if requested. Overall, this is a great lil restaurant in a cool plaza that deserves to be checked out.  Note: BYOB...and they don't charge a corking fee!!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with good service. We had a curry dish, pad Thai, and coconut soup. It wasn't the best Thai I've ever had, and it wasn't the worst. It's a good restaurant and it's a good option if you are shopping nearby or staying at the hotel on-site and looking for a walkable meal.  I just upped my rating from 3 stars to 4, because the mango sticky rice is worth an extra full star."}
{"text":"It's was OK.  Pricey for what I ordered. Green curry was meh. Better options 5 minutes away"}
{"text":"Thai food that was authentic and generous portions. I am recently back from Thailand & the fresh ingredients brought me back to my trip. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food in the convenient area of Bakery Square! You might have to park in the garage, depending on the time of the day, but the garage parking is free for 3 hours! It is just a one minute walk away.   As for the food, I found it pretty good! Decor left me wanting more, I didn't feel like our group had a lot of privacy, but still, can't fault them for that too much - since that is mostly a preference thing!  Anyway, solid 4/5. It was fine. Not my favorite, but pretty good!"}
{"text":"the food was just tasteless! we ordered Red curry fried rice and thai style fried rice and we had to add so much soy sauce and sriracha to bring some taste to it."}
{"text":"We noticed Asiatique Thai Bistro while in Bakery Square and thought we'd give it a try since we really like good Thai food.  The food was mediocre, the portions were small, and the prices were high. I'd be happy to forgive one of the three, but it's hard to like a place that fails on all of these. My Pad Thai, which I was requested to be spicy, was fairly bland, and the vegetables were tough. The flavor just wasn't right. I also tried the Pad Se Ew and Thai Fried Rice, which were similar. The ambiance was non-existent (hopefully, they'll eventually add some music or something). The people working were nice and fairly attentive, but that couldn't make up for the flavor, portions or prices.  Bottomline is that if you want Thai food, go to any of the places in nearby Squirrel Hill. If you're in Bakery Square and just want something to eat, go to Social where you can get some reasonable food and a beer for the same price as an entree at Asiatique."}
{"text":"Take-out only: Ordered take-out from here tonight. I had the pad thai with shrimp and my friend had the green curry with chicken. It was ok. There were actually peanut halves (vs chopped) in the pad thai which made the Pad Thai have a stronger peanut flavor. However, there were quite a few of just the shrimp tails in the pad thai in addition to actual pieces of shrimp. The green curry was good but didn't seem like the flavors were fully developed.   Not a bad thai place at all, and they are good with their quantities for the money but not one of my favorite places. But, I am glad I tried it.   I will say the inside looked like a very nice place to kick back and have a nice dinner if I was dining in inside of ordering take-out."}
{"text":"Very good.  Lunch portions are small but the yellow curry was tasteful and authentic.  Nice heat."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. The combination of spice, coconut milk and fresh vegetables come together beautifully and the result is a medley of tastes that dance in the mouth. We had the avocado summer role, spicy basil fried rice, spicy vegetable curry, spicy red curry and coconut mango ice cream. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the spicy red curry though all the dishes were fabulous. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I went to this place with some friends as we live really close by. When we arrived we were seated right away and presented with menus.  As I tend to be a little sensitive with spicy food, I asked the waitress about various dishes and their spiciness level and ended up ordering the pad thai with shrimp, which was quite tasty and had plenty of shrimp although it still had the tails .  My husband being the spice lover got the pumpkin curry with chicken, which came with some brown rice and per reports was really good.   We also ordered the spring rolls for the table and those were nice a crispy and were served with a tasty sweet sauce.  As we were finishing our dishes the owner came to our table to ensure that every one in our party was pleased, which was pretty nice. The wait staff was also very helpful in order to help me find a dish that I would like due to my lack of spice tolerance.  Overall I enjoyed the experience and would return. Oh and BTW this place is BYOB.. so bonus for that!!"}
{"text":"We grabbed to-go food here while prepping for a family wedding, and we weren't disappointed!  Small little place, but the food was excellent.  If you're staying at the Springhill Suites in Bakery Square, you can duck in easily to this spot for really good food.  One downside: on the weekends, they only serve dinner-size portions, even at lunchtime.  That meant we had to pay a premium even for lunch, and nobody finished their entire meal. If you're traveling, that means wasted food.   So I'd say it was a 4-star meal, but lost a star for me because I had to pay more even though the menu said there was a lunch-size portion available."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, the food is good, prices are average, and portions are filling. I've only ordered carry out but the decor is nice enough and I've never seen it really crowded. My daughter likes the Shrimp Pad Thai, and so far, I've had Panang Chicken and Red Curry Chicken. We have no complaints. The spice is adequate, probably a level 5 out of 10 but if you want more spice just say so and they will accommodate (I usually get 8). The employees are always friendly and food is ready quickly (10-15 min). Easy to park and convenient location."}
{"text":"The décor is nice and tasteful, not too over the top. Food was excellent. Portions are huge. The spring rolls could have been a meal all by themselves. Noodle dishes were great even though we took most of it home. Bubble tea was also just amazing. One of the only places where you can get it frozen like a shake. This place is our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Shame on me for giving this place the benefit of doubt despite reading the reviews before coming here. Everyone's right: the flavors not authentic and the portion size is pitiful for the price. I love Thai food and this place is terrible, even for Pittsburgh standards (I live in DC and have even been to Thailand). This is worse than your cheap, Americanized Chinese takeout.   I got the Chang mai noodles, but there were less than 10 pieces of broken noodles in a swampy mess of tomato-paste broth and vegetables. I usually don't complain about portions because I'm a petite girl, but this was ridiculous. I requested more noodles, which they did provide.  I really wish this place could be my go-to Thai place because of the location, but there are just way too many better Thai places here for my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all. I had the spicy green curry and I love that they give you the option to have it with rice or noodles! I had to try it with the noodles and it was a good spice level if you like spicy but not overpowering. I would come back. It's also conveniently in bakery square to park."}
{"text":"Decent choice for a quick bite if you're craving Thai in the Bakery Square area.  Asiatique has a good selection of Thai classics such as Pad Thai and Tom Kha, as well as Curry dishes. I tried the Curry Laksa with rice noodles and tofu. The broth was flavorful and what I'd expect; onions and lettuce were nicely arranged in the bowl.   My shrimp spring rolls came deep-fried which wasn't clearly marked on the menu, but okay. Also, the place doesn't serve alcohol, it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. We had the spicy red curry and the fried rice with beef. Both were delicious."}
