{"text":"Very good fish and chips, and we appreciated a lot the vegetarian Poutine!"}
{"text":"Quirky atmosphere; sit on stools at a horseshoe hardwood bar. Fish is inlight crispy batter. Shrimps in a different crusted batter. REAL potatoes fries with skin on. The Thai sauce was a favorite. Tasty homemade coleslaw; not creamy (thankfully). Charming service. Great value."}
{"text":"Just went for fish & chips tonight. After tryout the one on St-Viateur, we had to try this place. Honestly, we are quite disappointed. The batter on the fish & chips was way too oily for us, we had trouble keeping it down. However, the cole slaw, sauce, poutine and fries are great. The waiter was super chill. Even though the place was crowded, he kept a smile and always made sure we were ok."}
{"text":"Read about this place on Midnight Poutine and decided to give it a try. The best fish and chips I have had in a long time. Breading was perfect without being greasy. The fish just fell apart as soon as you touched it with a fork. This is a cozy little place that reminded me a lot of Le Gros Jambon.   Prices are extremely reasonable. I got a huge helping of fish and fries for $12.00. It's a long metro ride followed by a longish walk for us to get there and I was starving when I walked in the door. I left full and happy.   Even though the place is tiny, they could really use more than one server when they are full. We waited for a while to get drinks and to get the check and my wife's poutine arrived cold.  The food more than made up for any small problems with the the service though. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Service and food are excellent! No fluff, just straight up, great quality. Every plate that was being served looked and smelled great.  I will most definitely be returning to sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Small trendy, and fun place for great fish and chips.  Poutine was outstanding, (and meat free).  Batter is flavorful, light and flaky.  Fish was moist, tender and flaky.  Some drought beers.  Great friendly service.  Great hole in the wall place for some great fish and chips in a casual but upbeat environment."}
{"text":"Great calamari and fresh cut fries. Food selection amazing and cheap prices.  Friendly staff.  Must try when in Montreal"}
{"text":"We order from Comptoir 21 regularly and would eat-in more except with young kids the all-counter seating is tricky, and there is no high chair, nor any regular chair to attach a portable high chair to.  I wish this were different since I would probably eat here every other week otherwise.  I always order the fish and chips and find the large portion super generous - feeds myself and my three-year old easily.  I do wish the coleslaw portion was a bit more generous - seriously, cabbage is cheap, why be skimpy?!?!?!  But the fish is fantastic with just the right done-ness and the batter golden perfect.  Love the chunky fries which remind me of east-coast style.  I usually stick with the paprika sauce which has a little kick, I've tried the curry as well but it's not as delish.    For those who complain about the price - fish is not cheap especially if it has to be imported inland cheap and kept fresh.  The price is worth it for the freshest non-fishy fish in town!"}
{"text":"Ma place favorite pour une Poutine classique ! Belle ambiance chaleureuse et bonne bouffe !  A great place for comfort food with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Had the calamari with curry sauce to go. Big portion. Flaky and crispy without being greasy. Sauce was great. Cute decor. Go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Like the chicken and the egg, I don't know which came first; the name or the counter? Regardless, sitting next to strangers - a plateau hipster on the left and a suited-up businessman on the right - elbowing each other while chowing down on some old time Quebec inspired English grub adds to the charm of Comptoir 21. The U-shaped counter lends its Montreal casse-croute, greasy-spoon feeling to the place. Honest and simple food at a price you cannot beat, this is the type of place that if you're lucky, you might come out of there forgetting the difference between, chips, crisps and fries."}
{"text":"Great fish, fries, and poutine. They make several different tartar sauces and dips which are fun to try. Everything is fresh, prices are cheap, and they serve Guinness. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"I was born and raised the Maritimes (I moved to Montreal about 8 years ago). I must say that this place is, hands-down, the best fish n' chips joint in the city. I havent had any like thiis in years !  They also have this homemade tartare sauce with curry in it. Delicious !  The place itself looks very nice and the staff-members  were all very friendly. This place really too me back to the Maritimes :)"}
{"text":"I came here twice and both times I ordered the fish and chips. One piece of fish with chips is enough for me. The fish was well cooked and the sauce was also good. Overall the price was cheap for such a dish. One piece of fish with chips costs the same as a McDonald's combo."}
{"text":"Fresh, nicely cooked fish.  The accompanying salad was fresh and dressed well.  Fish came with an array of homemade dressings such as tartar and roasted red pepper. Good prices.  Prompt service. Boréal beer on tap."}
{"text":"Soo gooodddd.  The fish! OMG! flaky inside, super thin and crispy batter on the outside. You can choose what sauce you want (I just got tartar), but I tried the jalapeno and that was just the right amount of spicy to go well with the oily fish (come on, it's deep-fried, of course it's oily, let's not deny facts here). If you want the classic taste, go with the tartar, but I'm pretty sure the other options are very good as well, judging from the taste of the jalapeno one.  I had the 'fish avec salade' for $12.95. The salad was beyond my expectations. Dressing was very subtle, and it was refreshing. It was a pretty big salad too.  Saw a lot of people eating the chowder, and it looked really good. Will try that next time!  Gotta say though, their fries (the 'chips') are soft and bland...I tried it, and I was glad I had ordered the salad instead, and I don't even like salad that much...The fish is so so gooood, but the chips portion of it...not special at all..  I really liked the environment. Super casual, and just comforting."}
{"text":"so fresh so good so nice so everything! we ended up there by absolute chance as we were walking street after street and just the outside charmed us. Very cosy place and the fish n chips is absolutely divine, we also had a beef burger that was quiet good , homemade fries, perfect!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite that is fresh and doesnt hurt the wallet too much.  Of course the fish & chips is excellent but these days I'm having the comptoir 21 burger which has a piece of fried fish in the bun, really good.  And you cant beat the 6$ calamary advertised as an appetizer but is more than enough to fill you up at lunchtime.  All in all, just a great place!"}
{"text":"Just had a most wonderful dinner and a few beers. This place is just great. The fish and fries are amazing  as well as the service. Excellent place to go for some good old style  British  fish and chips.  Cool design and good prices, Love the over the counter style dinning. Will try to be a good Catholic and will have fish on every Friday. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"I usually stumble in here on Thursday nights after having had a few drinks at the Waverly (a pub that is just next door). I drag myself and a few friends looking for a late night bite and it turns out, this place is always delish.   They have a great selection of fried fish delights. My favourite tends to be the classic fish and chips with a side of fries. The fish is always so fresh and melts in your mouth. The batter is not too thick and is flaky and yummy.   The small potion of fish satisfies my appetite, but don't be scared to try the bigger portion, as one bite will leave you wanting more of this good fried stuff.   Their sauces are also very tasty and the selection is good. Paprika, tartare, cari, yum.   Some of my friends do the poutine-fish and chips combo, but I've never been that wild. Although the poutine does look and smell good (dark gravy and home fries: the good stuff).   Other items to try are the burgers and also the tempura shrimp.   This place is quite small, but very cozy, so look through the window beforehand to see if there is room. The main seating area is a U-shape low-bar with stools, which I always find quite comfy and fun.   I definitely recommend this place for either a late night snack or casual grub-catching with friends."}
{"text":"Le service est rapide mais malheureusement nous n'avons pas aimés les hamburgers, pour ma part j'ai pris le burger de poisson et la personne qui m'accompagnait le Végéburger. La serveuse s'est permise de mettre notre hamburger \"all dressed\" sans nous le demander et l'extra oignons frits est en fait des oignons caramélisés. On se reprendras pour les fish une prochaine fois!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé au Comptoir 21 avec mon ancien patron, qui m'en avait promis pour mon argent. Il avait oublié de souligner que j'en aurais aussi pour mon bide. Mais comme je ne boude pas mon plaisir, je me suis offert un \"Fish & Chips petite portion\" avec poutine (!) Disons que j'étais ravi d'avoir pris la petite portion. Mon ex-boss, qui  a toujours fait un peu son frais en prétendant manger santé, s'est contenté du \"Burger Poisson\". Un vraie salade verte à côté de ma louche de lipides. Mon voisin de comptoir, qui a inspiré mon choix, me regarde d'un air complice: \"un repas d'hiver!\" me lance-t-il un pouce en l'air. Comment lui donner tort?  On annonce de la neige et de la slush? Allez donc affronter les éléments au Comptoir 21. Vous aurez une traction qui fera \"le poids\" sur la route pour le retour à la maison ;-)"}
{"text":"Overpriced for fish and chips.  The portion was small and the batter flat and oily.  I like fish and chips to be light and fluffy but these were not. Fries seemed to have made several visits to the fryer.  I tried the Jalapeno dipping sauce, which was so salty that I couldn't even taste any pepper.  The salad is pretty much just mesclun from the supermarket shoved on a plate.   Nothing terrible, but for $14.50+tax this should be a cut above cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Excellent arrêt pour un fish & chip délicieux."}
{"text":"Their clam chowder is the best! The staff is a little bit rude but who cares. Their poutine with vegetarian sauce is amazing, it tastes like a normal poutine but the sauce is light and not too salty. The fries are crispy and they put loooots of cheese!"}
{"text":"\"we are incapable of appreciating our joy by comparing it with our sorrow.\"  i woke up at the usual 'thank you employment insurance' time of 5pm, checked and rechecked my fridge several times, each time fully expecting something new to appear, couldn't make anything from half an old tomato and half a stick of butter, so i sauntered a block to the euro-deli batory for a combo breakfast/lunch/dinner.  'ferme'.    with a mid-evening nap just around the corner, i knew i needed to find a place no longer than a stone's throw away, so  i threw a few stones in every direction. friperie. nay. olimpico. nay.  st. viateur bagel, save for dessert. some guy's house, sorry.   comptoir 21.  okay!   worst experience, food wise, in this fair city thus far. i ordered a crispy fish burger/sandwich w/fries, and all i can thank are my years of being a bad cook for preparing both my digestive and immune system.  the batter was soggy, fish was undercooked and consequently more rubbery than flaky on the inside, the tartar sauce and accompanying tomato/lettuce did little to mitigate the feature attraction, the bun's a standard white bun that's nothing to write home about (sorry mom). french fries would have been good (they look/taste  hand cut)  if they weren't over salted, something i can add but can't take away. i also got a lot of those little bits of fries that tend to pack oil/not have much potato inside.  maybe an off day for the cooks,  if the fish was left longer in the fryer it may have had a chance, it could have been a contender, a somebody, but it was such a flavorless sandwich it's hard to tell. i dare jesus to feed one person with that piece of fish let alone 5,000, that would be a true miracle.   the only saving grace was the price, which came in at $8.50, pretty darn good for the area.   looking back, i think i should have just went with that butter on tomato sandwich."}
{"text":"Fish and chiiiipsssss are the best. Don't try anything else than that. And no fries, they're not that good anyway."}
{"text":"The Best fish and chip in town! Love the one at willington street! Waiter was so nice and funny too!"}
{"text":"Toujours un service excellent! Tout le monde est souriant et sympatique. Et que dire de la bouffe. Le fish & chips est un des meilleurs en ville et le végé burger est fabuleux. J'y retourne et retourne, car c'est de loin un de mes restaurant préféré.    Always great service! Everyone is smiling and friendly. And what about the food. The fish & chips is one of the best in town and the veggie burger is fabulous. I go back again and again, because it's by far one of my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious battered cod.  Perfect home made tartare.  Love the herb sauce too.   they give you a spray bottle of vinegar if you wish.   Not sure what else to say.  They have Boreale Blonde and Boreale Rousse. And wine. And a good selelction of drinks.   They also make salads and non-fried things for the health-conscious  Cannot recommend enough"}
{"text":"Nice decor and great service . The vegetarian poutine was pretty good , I was surprised . They even have a veggie burger . Reasonable prices , wonderful fresh food and close to the Metro, perfect for visitors like myself .  I would recommend this place as a great place to get a fish and chips and have a beer while you are there ."}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty thick fish and chips. The crispy fish burger very good.  Great prices, great friendly service. Very popular in the neighbourhood as one of the emerging new local foodie joints."}
{"text":"I had a great expérience there The food was excellent like the service  A bit expensive but worth the penny"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips. Hands down. Very good home made clam chowder. Excellent prizes and service"}
{"text":"Comptoir 21 was a random find for me and a good one. I was looking for a quick light dinner before a show but wasn't interested in sandwiches or pizza slices. Instead, I had delicious fish and chips that rivaled anything I've had in my very seafoody hometown of Boston. Fish was perfectly breaded and fried for my taste and the hand cut (?) fries were great. Nice laid-back atmosphere with friendly staff providing prompt service. Comfortable space and very reasonably priced. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great fish n chips. Price and value is very good. Sit at the counter, order and eat. Simple as that."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Wasn't busy when I was there but there were a few couples scattered around the u-shaped counter. Unique set up. Perfect for a quick bite.   Service was fantastic. Our waitress was so friendly and caring. (Not the fake tip-hungry caring... The genuinely kind-person caring). Even other staff who weren't serving us were friendly and chatty with us. Making customers feel welcomed and appreciated is a rarity these days so when you find a place that does make you feel valued, you want to return again and again. After we paid, our waitress, after giving us our change, thanked us with a big smile, then walked away without scooping up her tip. She waited til we left before taking it. A very polite gesture which we both noticed and found endearing.   The food. I'm rating it 4/5 cause there's only one type of fish and my friend said while it was good, the texture isn't as ideal for fish and chips as some other types. It falls apart instead of retaining its shape and the breading falls off. Not a big deal for me at all. We still inhaled our fish with the tasty tartar sauce.  His chowder could have been a bit warmer but he still enjoyed.   Poutine. Vegetarian, they say. Huge bonus! And I don't know if it was the cruelty-free aspect that made me love it so much, but it was one of, if not the best poutine I've ever had. I would return just for that. Even those poutine-specialty places aren't as good.   All in all a solid choice for a quick, casual meal at a place you kinda wish you could hug."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert cet endroit par hasard. Je commande souvent des fish & chip dans les restaurants. J'y suis donc entrée. Premièrement le décor m'a beaucoup plu. La personne qui m'a servie était tout sourire, aidante et rapide. En moins de deux ma commande était prête, dans des boîtes (super) et franchement pour le prix j'étais conquise. Le poisson était succulent, la pâte croustillante,  la sauce tartare goûteuse. Les frites , Les calmars étaient très bons aussi.  Cet endroit est dans ma liste de favoris. En plus ils font la livraison."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fish n chips anywhere. The ambience is great and the service is amazing. I've eaten here many times and the consistency is great. You can always count on a great meal. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and thought it was tasty. Lived in the UK for some time so could be bias but when one is a tourist every little good experience counts. Will return on my next visit."}
{"text":"A cool concept becomes fab with clever execution and and a great price/quality ratio.  How can you not be happy swirling in your counter stool, munching fantastically fresh fish encased in hot crunchy crust and paired with a tall, cool beer? I got the fried balls, which were tasty, but I wondered if this was a method for getting rid of old ingredients. Also, not a great value when compared with the fish n chips (3 giant pieces of fish vs 4 golf ball sized balls).   If you want to really cheap out, get the fish sandie for $4.95.  Cheers~"}
{"text":"Hands down best fish and chips I've ever had! And you absolutely must order the claim chowder. Shrimp tempura is really good too. The ambience and our waiter were great and made it a perfect night out. We sat on the patio during the summer so the pink streamers that lined the street made for a great view. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Wonderful fish and chips, though only one choice of fish, it was melt in your mouth. The shrimps are expensive for a serving of 5 shrimps, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Terracita tranquila y agradable para cenar.  Las raciones de fish and chips son muy generosas y la calidad del producto acorde con el precio. No soy un experto en este plato, pero quedé muy satisfecho del producto.  El trato del personal fue muy amable, atento y cercano. Sirve de ayuda cuando estas lejos de casa."}
{"text":"Great value. The food is fresh, portions generous, casual service is good and most importantly the food tastes great.  I went last Thursday for fish & chips, YUM! Liked the brownie cheese cake square to be had for $2.50 - what can you get for $2.50 for dessert? Small but enough as I had the large portion of fish.  Saturday, I introduced my mom, she had the poutine, I the all-beef dog, fries & calamari. We left satisfied & with half my fries & calamari to eat later.  We'll definitely be back.  The only thing I didn't like is that they don't take any credit card(s), but that's part of how they can keep their prices down.  FYI there is a delivery fee of $3.55."}
{"text":"Excellent to discover all great little dishes. Any kind, all unique. A place for happy hours of a nice dinner with friends. A lot of ambiance. Wine is perfectly proposed. I do not have a sweet tooth, but dessert are excellent.  I would go back to try appetizers again and again!"}
{"text":"I notice mainly good reviews for the place and the rumours has it that this is the best place for fish n chips in Montreal. Unfortunately my only experience of it today was not flattering at all. The fish missed seasoning completely. Without the sauces it was completely tasteless. The same goes for the infamous burger that everyone told me to take. Tasteless again. Other than that the waitress was excellent and the environment as well."}
{"text":"Très bonne cantine de luxe avec délicieux, fish n chips. Tout est bon et pas cher dutout"}
{"text":"Best shrimp tempura! Anything on their menu is good really. Good service also. Great place if you crave the fish and chips or just a burger. Yum"}
{"text":"Le burger poisson ! Un délice ! Pas de poisson pané, seulement un filet bien assaisonné et totalement décadent !!  Sinon, fish and chips de différentes grosseurs, servi avec frite et salade. Un poisson qui se défait dans la bouche et qui n'est clairement pas un ptit paquet congelé. Au contraire, c'est un des meilleurs que j'ai mangé.   A essayer avec une bonne bière, sur la terrasse !"}
{"text":"On y va pour les boules de poissons, leur poutine, la salade avec la vinaigrette incroyablement bonne, le long choix de sauce pour accompagner le poisson frit, ou encore pour s'asseoir autour du comptoir, comme c'était le cas autrefois. Manger pour moins de 15$ ça fait une excellente adresse de petits budgets ou de repas de semaine. Une seule option de vin, ce serait bien d'en avoir un peu plus. Sinon, prenez pour emporter, il y a un parc au bout de la rue st-dominique, 5 min à pied."}
{"text":"Le comptoir 21, je l'aime pour plein de raisons. La première raison, c'est parce que c'est rapide et c'est bon. La deuxième, c'est à quelques centimètres de chez moi. Mon plat préféré la salade avec le poisson grillé et le hot dog tout garni et le hamburger...bon en fait j'aime tout. Même la musique est toujours super cool!! Pour manger sur le pouce, il n'y a rien de mieux!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here. Got a veggie salad with fish and a burger with poutine - our first foray with the Quebec French fries of lore. Well seasoned, the salad dressing was fresh and the fries gravy not too saltly. Everything was delicious, good people watching and a close walk to where we were staying. The server was very nice and friendly! A good choice for a Tuesday evening out."}
{"text":"Grande déception après la lecture des commentaires d'autres yelpeurs et les belles photos appétissantes.  Les morceaux de poisson étaient légèrement crus, les calmars étaient entourés d'une panure pas du tout croustillante et en les croquant, certains étaient impossible à avaler car il y avait encore une fine couche élastique limite indestructible (oui, oui)... Il ne faut pas nommer la sauce tartare \"tartare\" car elle n'a aucun rapport avec la sauce tartare basique. La bière blonde n'avait pas un bon goût de bonne bière blonde.  J'y suis allée avec plein d'enthousiasme et j'en suis sortie avec le mal de ventre.   La serveuse était très gentille par contre."}
{"text":"Came here with lot of expectations, was debating between going here or Brit and Chips. Small place, cool interior and friendly staff.  Their menu is simple, you can order one/two fish fillets and then add fries/poutine. You can also choose your sauce. I took the double fillet with poutine which comes to around $15 all together. I took the spicy tartar sauce. I loved the taste of the first fish fillet and the poutine too but I feel I ordered more than I should have and the second fillet felt much too oily in my system. I did not feel to great by the end of the meal and had to rush to the bathroom right away. Did not have a good experience but unsure how much of it was the food itself. However, I don't think I will be coming back for the fish and chips.  But it goes without saying, had one of the best fried calamaris at this place. Super fresh and zesty. Loved every bite of it.   Would like to warn against the cilantro (?) sauce, can't remember exactly but one of the sauce is made out of some herb, doesn't go that great with the fish. Loved the spicy tartar!"}
{"text":"After being in love with Brit & Chips it's hard not to compare other fish and chips spots to them. Comptoir 21 has great service and a friendly atmosphere. Their portions are filling. I had one piece of fish with some fries and coleslaw and that was enough for me. But even with all the good things I still left craving the good ol Brit & Chips. It's close to our apartment but I rather walk a little bit more to get to the other fish & chips spot.   Tip: try the Thai tartar sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. It's one of my fave spots in the city. I love coming here on snowy days for a beer and sitting at the U-shaped bar."}
{"text":"With fish & chips it's mostly about the fish, and this spot does it really, really well. The batter is crispy, light and golden, and the fish is very flaky and fresh. The mayo options are nice - I had the paprika, which had a nice kick to it. They give you lots of options, from fish on its own, or with salad or poutine as well as with fries. A large portion (3 pieces of fish) with poutine would keep you sated for a week. This is just what a fish & chips spot should be."}
{"text":"I had a really bad dish there. Fish and chips with fries and salad. The fries tasted stale, if that's even possible. The salad was lousy. The Fish was overdone and greasy. Maybe the current chef (August 2017) is just not so good?"}
{"text":"The best vegetarian burgers and poutine in Montreal. And I've tried many. Great value , service and atmosphere. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have been there twice & the good food & good service is consistent. I usually go there for the fish & chips but change the chips for a poutine... So good but I can`t indulge like this too often lol"}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise! Disons-le, de l'extérieur, le restaurant n'a l'air de rien. Par contre, en y entrant on trouve une ambiance chaleureuse et des employés plus que gentils!   Je m'attendais à ne trouver que quelques choix sur le menu, mais j'ai eu de la difficulté à choisir. La très sympathique employée à la caisse ma suggéré le classique Fish N' Chip et ne j'ai pas été déçue. La panure n'était pas trop lourde et le poisson, miam! On voyait (et goûtait!) qu'il était vraiment frais. Les frites étaient également délicieuses. Vous pourrez choisir la sauce qui accompagne votre poisson : la classique tartare, la piquante au jalapeno, la thaï et j'en passe. Ayant un petit appétit, j'ai pris la petite portion, mais ouff! La petite portion était une assez grosse portion pour moi, je n'ai pas réussi à tout avaler, même si c'était hyper bon. J'en ai donc eu beaucoup pour mon argent. Parlant d'argent, les prix sont plus qu'abordables compte tenu de la qualité de la nourriture et du service. Mon amie a quant à elle choisi les croquettes de morue avec la salade et son plat était tout aussi bon.  J'y retournerai assurément pour essayer autre chose!"}
{"text":"Un troisième Comptoir 21? Wow. Un troisième Comptoir 21 à quelques pas de chez moi? TROP GÉNIAL.  J'étais tellement heureuse d'apprendre la venue du Comptoir 21 à Verdun que je m'y suis rendue dès qu'il a ouvert ses portes... et je suis toujours aussi comblée! Ambiance chaleureuse, personnel amical, excellente nourriture, tout y est. J'ai un faible pour leurs croquettes de morue : elles sont délicieuses et accompagnées d'une salade simple, mais légère qui fait quelque peu oublier la panure, hihi.  Les portions sont énormes (on peut prendre le reste pour apporter!) et les prix très raisonnables.   Il ne vous reste plus qu'à aller prendre place au comptoir et à déguster!"}
{"text":"First of all, props to the setup here, which is basically a long U-shaped counter (there are also other places to sit when there's overflow, but the experience probably isn't the same), where you are aided by a lovely server. We went with the classic fish and chips, but had ours with the paprika sauce (there's a selection of about 5 or 6 sauces), which was quite tasty, creamy with a hint of horseradish. The quality of the fish itself was superb, flaky and meaty, held together with a nice perfectly browned batter. The basket comes with a solid batch of frites, a lemon wedge, and a tiny vinegary cabbage salad (which was just okay for me). We skipped the option to make our fries into poutine, but we might try that next time. They also have sandwiches (burgers, a veggie burger, a steak sandwich, and a hot dog) which look promising. Overall it was a nice experience with some quality food. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a quick burger or fish and chips! Excellent look too! Just like an old diner. Miss these places! The service was nice friendly as well, so that's always a plus! Brought my girlfriend here and she seemed to like it, so good for a little date."}
{"text":"This place was way too real to be \"hipster\". Great service and a comfortable ambiance. The star was the fish. Nicely prepared and creamy smooth. And the herb sauce was excellent. An excellent place to get fish and chips."}
{"text":"I still come to this spot several years later and insist that instead of having the fish and chips (which are still great!), try their vegan poutine. It may sound weird, but it's really really good! Also their all dressed hot dogs go well with it.  The people at this particular Comptoir are really nice too. They're always so friendly even during the Ubisoft lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"If I had to write my review based on my first experience here, I would be giving them 1 star; But, the bad review would have been my fault and oh so very wrong!  My first time trying this place was when I sent my hubby out to bring home some Fish n' Chips. This is not the best way to experience Comptoir 21! Take out becomes very greasy and not enjoyable.  Thank goodness for my Fish n' Chip loving Mum. She wanted to give it a shot and because of her I completely changed my mind on this place.   First of all, the staff is quite nice and the service is fast. There is always something fun coming from the speakers, and the environment is relaxed and fun.  The fish is battered a la minute, and is cooked to sweet perfection! The home fries, and interestingly flavoured dipping sauces add to the tastiness; I prefer their Tartar sauce. The coleslaw is whatever, but because everything else is so perfect, you can let that slide. Everyone seated with me, thoroughly enjoyed their food; No matter what they ordered (fish, homemade veggie burger, calamari). I suggest that you try the fish before any of the other option, you will not be disappointed; Just take the time to sit and eat it there!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur Fish & Chips en ville, définitivement.  J'ai aussi piqué quelques cuillères à la personne qui m'accompagnait. Sa chaudrée de palourdes était délicieuse!  Bon service, j'y retourne"}
{"text":"(Version française ensuite) Great fish & chips at a low price. The fish and batter are delicate in flavor; the spices are to be found in the homemade sauce that they put on the side. I took the tartar one - the classical pairing for that dish - and it was excellent.  The ambiance is great, restaurant looks great, just like the terrace. Service was solid, albeit a bit slow; then again, when food is that cheap and the restaurant offers take out, all on a tuesday night, it was more than reasonable.  Only thing that fell a bit flat were the fries. You have to salt them yourselves, and without being great, they aren't bad either. You can always have the salad on the side, with or without the fries as well, which is good.  All this being said, I strongly recommend you check it out.  ----------------------------------------------------   Très bon fish & chips à un très bon prix. Le poisson lui-même et sa panure ont un goût délicat, on retrouve plus d'épices dans la sauce servie séparément. J'ai pris la sauce tartare - qui accompagne normalement les fish & chips - et elle était excellente.  L'ambiance et le décor sont réussis, tant à l'intérieur du restaurant que sur la terrace. Le service était simple et efficace, bien qu'un peu lent. Ceci étant dit, quand la nourriture est à aussi bon prix, qu'ils offrent également pour emporter et qu'il s'agit d'un mardi, il faut s'attendre à ça, et c'est très raisonnable.  Seul bémol: les frites. Il faut les saler soi-même (peut-être est-ce une bonne chose pour certains) et sans être mauvaises, elles ne sont pas géniales non plus. On peut toutefois les accompagner ou encore les substituer pour une salade, qui est bonne.  Pour toutes ces raisons, je recommande fortemment l'endroit."}
{"text":"Great clam chowder. Thick and tons of ingredients. Half a turn of pepper is plenty.   Pretty good fish and chips. Tender fish and thin batter.   Good poutine. A bit too salty, cheese curds not the freshest, fries a bit overcooked."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best fish and chip places I have ever been too. The fish is always fresh and Crispy,  the clam chowder is amazing and the fried calamari are addictive. Staff is super frendly too."}
{"text":"Been to the one on Wellington street in verdun, first time I eaten in the mile end district. Great fish, fried to perfection and not super greesy. Fries are super crispy and ambiance is great."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were great. Superb service. Got the croquettes as an appetizer to share with my group. The croquettes were so good! Fries were really good too. The fish comes with a choice of sauce. I tried the jalapeño and the herb sauces and loved them both.   I don't know that I would get the fish again if I were to return because the croquettes were SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Alright alright alright. Comptoir 21 is a great option if you're feeling like some good ol' classic fish and chips. So this little restaurant is tucked in to a \"hipster-esque\" part of town, and it fits the aesthetic nicely.   The interior is small, but the bench seating is really unique. We sat ourselves down, and we waited about 12 minutes before the server came to take our order.  My girlfriend and I ordered their 2 piece fish and chips and a large poutine. Their fish and chips are delicious; crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. It comes with a small side of coleslaw and a sauce of your choice. We got their tartare sauce, and it was a great pair. Next time, I'll be sure to try their jalapeno sauce!  The fries in the poutine were thick cut and well-seasoned. The gravy is vegetarian, and although it tastes slightly different from beef gravy, it was decent!   I wish the service was a little faster, but I will definitely return if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find in the mist of amazing food in the montreal strip. We found it hidden kinda off the strip with all the food and shops. It is a small joint with stool chairs and kind and friendly staff. They take Canadian cash so no American money. They were super helpful to find us an ATM near by. The menu is small and easy to go through which I personally like. We ordered the poutine with fried fish cod. They also let us choose the sauses and the dish was delicious and great portion size. I loved the cod it was fried perfectly not too much batter and plenty of fish. The poutine was tasty. The price was decent about 15 dollars and 20ish dollars in total with tax and tip included. The decor is a bit strange but I like the feel of it. It is nice that it has a local feel with the decor. I would love to come back soon."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Funny thing is that it's a fish & chips place but the fish and chips was the worse thing we ate. Their calm chowder is excellent and so is their fried calamari but I would not take the fish again. Beware that they do not take credit card and that it's a hipster place so if you don't like hipsters don't go there"}
{"text":"Location: St. Viateur, in very close proximity to my beloved Olimpico. HELLO - what more can a girl ask for? Not a whole lot. The closest subway is probably Laurier (20-minute walk from there) and street parking is available, however you probably won't find a spot.   The place: 21 is on the small size, but they make great use of their space , with a horseshoe-shaped counter that reminds of me an old-school diner. The wait staff can basically see everyone and chit chat to their hearts' content while patrons who are feeling super sociable can start random conversations about the virtues of tartar sauce with whomever they wish. Now that I think of it, the place reminds me of a seaside shack, and thus, is cozy and warm. Also, not a hipster in site (at least not when I went).   The goods: I ordered the basic fish & chips with fries (don't tell my trainer). I forgot to ask what kind of fish they use (looked like Halibut) but whatever it was, it was nice and flaky when I cut into it, perfectly white, moist and not at all fishy. Surprisingly, the batter was super crispy and not oily/greasy at all. I mean, I didn't see one drop of crap dripping from it at all. I may have inhaled my fish but no one really knows. The tartar sauce, which I believe to be homemade, was great. Light and refreshing. Tasty. A hint of citrus or something. The fries were a little crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside, and again, no oil or grease in sight. Yumm-O.  Service: Super fantastically amazing. I didn't catch the name of our waitress, but she's got to be THE friendliest waitress in the entire Mile End, next to the boys over at Olimpico. She was warm, chatty, and always had a smile on her face. She basically treated everyone like they were an old friends popping in for a visit. Love this girl.   Price point: Reasonable for the portion and quality.   21 is on par with my favourite chip shop (Brit & Chips) and I'll definitely be coming back. Especially if there are no hipsters."}
{"text":"I noticed they have added child's portions to their menu, with one piece of fish. Quality is consistently good."}
{"text":"When I first came to this location they pretty much through a paper menu at us and walked to the back so we decided that it was time for us to leave. However this time around I walked in and was greeted by a friendly brunette who came to bring me water right away as I was waiting for the boyfriend.  We were craving fish and chips ( DUH )  But instead we got a the trying plate which consisted of calamari, one piece of fish, 2 tempura shrimp and 2 fish croquette. They make their own mayos so when you order that you get all 6 of them. My favs were the curry and thai. We decided to get 2 hot dogs which are all beef not like la belle pro not knocking them or anything but you can taste it after your first bite. Only thing I would have to say is that they need to add more coleslaw and onions because it's a bit slim on toppings. The bun was great.  The poutine was okay for $4.25 it's vegetarian sauce but the fries were a bit burnt so it wasn't the best but I'm glad I tried it.  Tips for the resto: cut the fish smaller as the pieces are way to big. Don't charge 50 cents for a lemon slice ( cmon ) And keep playing all the old school dirty 90's rap. Because some of the songs I haven't heard in a while and it was fun!   I will be back tho."}
{"text":"Good clam chowder, could be a bit more hot but the battered fish was very good. Super fresh big flakes and most important NOT overcooked. Very memorable."}
{"text":"Nous y allons le midi car proche de la job. Seulement 18 places assises alors arrivez tôt si vous voulez manger sur place. L'endroit est beau, le décor très mignon. La bouffe est excellente, la morue croustillante, seule ou en burger, est exquise. La chaudrée de palourdes aussi, ainsi que les calamars frits. Nous avons juste eu des petits problèmes au niveau du service, nos commandes étaient toutes mélangées et la dame (serveuse ou propriétaire?) avait l'air un peu stressée (et nous envoyait un peu promener..) par rapport à cette situation.. Bref, à part ça, c'est top, à essayer!!"}
{"text":"Cozy (about 21 spots), good value, fish & chips/burger spot that's really popular with the locals.    On Sunday, if you're more than 2 people after 7pm you'll be waiting for some spots to turn over, although that's pretty quick in this counter-style diner.  The small fish and chips @ 9.95 was plenty for a \"euro-size\" stomach.  Fish is very tender and moist.  Batter is thin, dark and crisp.  House-made tartar sauce is great.  Chips feel a bit homestyle (not sure if they're double fried), but are good. Tiny side slaw-like salad is nicely tart, but balanced with a hint of sweetness  Crispy or grilled fish burger @ $5 seems like a steal.  Half/full pints of blond/red @ $3.50/5.50. Guinness in full pints only, at $5.50.  Service is friendly and condiments are well stocked and available at hand.  I can see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Delish! Fried fish and seafood is the specialty here.   I had a good experience at Comptoir 21 in Verdun with my family.  A terrace (patio) set up outside on to the street with a sun tarp. Walking in and a huge circular bar to the left with bar stools set up ready to serve. There were no tables outside, nor booth seats available so we all sat at the bar. Two toddlers included and a high chair for the Third toddler.  The service was a little slow to get our orders because there were two employees to work the entire restaurant. I saw customers get up from the booths to pay their bill at the bar. The employees had to deal with the change and completed checks before tending to us.  We ordered Fish and chips for the kids which comes one piece of fish and fries for 6$ Fried Calamari, A regular 2 Fish and Chips which is two portions of fish, fries, malt vinegar Coleslaw and Tartar sauce.  My father ordered a steak sandwich which is his regular order here it comes with sauteed peppers, he added a side salad, and my sister ordered the Vegetarian Burger which has some Indian spices in it.  The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered, great news because we were hungry!  Fried calamari had all rings of tender squid pieces came out with lemon wedges and.a green tartar sauce.This calamari is really yummy soft, not chewy at all, so good tastes like butter popcorn.  My two pieced Fish and Chips had a delicious tartar sauce with it too. This sauce is green and wasn't sure on the flavor but its Parsley! So Tasty! Parsley Aioli to dip the Fish and even fries in!  The deep golden beer battered light crust was perfection. The fish was light and flaky too, there was no excess oil I recommend this fried fish! Best part is they offer Malt vinegar in a spray bottle, and white vinegar in the spray bottle as well, so smart and fun! The fries were golden brown dark color but tasted like nothing! The Yelp reviews were dead on, these fries need improving, and seasoning.  There are two other locations of Comptoir 21 in Montreal proving they know what they're doing. I would come back and order the Calamari again and try the fried shrimp ."}
{"text":"First meal in Montreal! Just arrived from LA, this place was sooooo good!! Or of the best fish and chips I've had. And great service. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips, fresh salad, nice sauces, just a small counter service place, but great food and cold beer! I'm always looking for a good fish and chips place--this one is one of the best. Really flaky cod. Kids loved it, too."}
{"text":"my. gosh. Best, best, BEST fish and chips in the city. Their fish and chips are crispy on the outside, however when you plug your fork in it or take a bite, the fish texture inside is still soft and it falls apart. But when it falls apart it is not a bad thing I don't think because I think it means they fry it so well that it's not dried out or anything. It still retains that softness of like steamed fish or something. I really enjoyed this place and love their poutine! What I would like to try next is their clam chowder. Comptoir 21 is truly a fish and chips heaven because I've always had overly greasy and dry fish and chips. This one? Super amazing. If you are into this kind of food, really visit! I 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Always quick service. The fried calamari is light and not greasy at all, perfect with the herb sauce; the fish and chips is of great quality. The tempura shrimp is so so though, the coating is too thick, not the Japanese style. I'll definitely keep coming back for the calamari and all their sauces."}
{"text":"Je vais souvent dans ce petit resto dans le village, c'est toujours agréable de pouvoir bien mane et prendre une bière pour moins de 20$ ! On peut aussi ajouter une Mayo assaisonnée toujours excellentes ! C'est mon avis"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this restaurant. I've tried and liked almost everything on their menu. They somehow manage to make excellent fish and chips, excellent hamburgers, hot dogs, and Poutine (with vegetarian gravy!).   Service is always great and I love the counter seating.   If you're ever in the neighbourhood, check this place out for lunch!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what great poutine is supposed to taste like until I tried Comptoir 21. Super soft curds and really nice gravy (not too rich, not too salty - pretty perfect). In addition, we tried the fish and chips, which were the best we have ever had (and my husband used to travel quite a bit to London). Thin and crispy outside, along with a malt vinegar spray bottle (for even coating! brilliant!), and very flaky inside. Great cole slaw (?) side. Just amazing."}
{"text":"Was absolutely impressed with how amazing the gold and crispy fish n chips were. It's a nice diner place to go with friendly service and very fair price!!!!"}
{"text":"Très bon fish & chips. Le poisson est tendre à souhait, sans être sec. Délicieux. J'ai essayé la sauce aux herbes, et honnêtement, il est préférable de rester avec la sauce tartare. La déco de casse-croute est géniale même la serveuse est dans le ton avec son attitude hyper frendly et sa voix légèrement roque.  Belle terrasse sur Ste-Catherine pendant la belle saison.  Bon à savoir, ils ont une poutine \"végé\". Parce que oui, c'est difficile à trouver une poutine avec une sauce sans bouillon de poulet."}
{"text":"Excellent place if you are walking down Wellington and feel like fish and chips with beer. We went on a bike ride on the first beautiful day of the year and ended up visiting a friend in Verdun. We already know the other Comptoir 21 locations at the Latine Quarter and the Mile-End - but I like this one best. We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.  We went to pay inside and discovered they only accept debit and cash :( but overall this is a good place to have a good time!"}
{"text":"We went there last night, wanting to enjoy some fish'n chips. We really appreciated the atmosphere set by the counter, which was great. We had the fried squids which were light and not too greasy, the paprika sauce with them was delicious too. The clam chowder was a bit thick but really good nevertheless. We then had the 21 Burger (with fried fish), I found the fish really too greasy and lacking in taste, and the shrimp tempuras which we found a tad too oily as well. The food was good, though all this fried and oil and grease did leave a weight on our stomachs but then it is North America I suppose. I have lived in London and eaten fish'n chips there and never had such a weight afterwards... All in all, for the food served, the price is right and the staff quite friendly, next time I might try something less greasy though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fish & chips I have ever had. Light and crispy. After trying four of the sauces in two visits I recommend the paprika. Charming atmosphere and speedy service."}
{"text":"La serveuse est aux petits soins. La Poutine est bonne. Je recommande le fish and chips ! Le poisson est frais et bon.  Très bon rapport qualité prix pour une adresse parfaitement située."}
{"text":"Fan finie de fish & chips, je vous assure que ceux du Comptoir 21 rivalisent ceux servis à Londres dans un papier journal. Chair translucide et divine!"}
{"text":"Great little resto on Wellington. You can tell that it's fresh cod and not frozen. The fish is so light and flaky that every time you poke with your fork it breaks in two. It's best to scoop with your fork rather than poking. Comes in 2 sizes. Small comes with 2 pieces of fish and large comes with 3 pieces. I chose the jalapeño sauce instead of the tartare sauce. It was not spicy at all and didn't add anything to the fish. If choose a different one next time. I had the salad as a side and it was delicious.  Friend had the poutine and said it was good. Even the coleslaw was great. Definitely worth going. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch grub. Do not miss the fish and chips or the clam chowder. The white fish melts in your mouth, the batter is light and crunchy, and is only made better with the tartar sauce. The clam chowder isn't overly thick; it contains whole clam parts and is wonderfully spiced.   There is a two tap kegerator right on the patio. The food is fresh and comes fast, the staff is delightful and efficient. The prices are very reasonable. Lunch for two with beer under $30 CAD (about $24 USD at today's conversion rate). Cash or credit is fine. We were here around lunch time on a Friday, got a seat on the patio no problem, and weren't rushed by the staff to finish or vacate. Plenty of seating inside as well if the weather or crowd isn't favorable. Otherwise, I recommend sitting outside and watching the people walk up and down St Catherine."}
{"text":"Great location in the Gay Village for fish and chips. The one piece fried fish with fries is plenty if you want to leave room for dessert for later. While yes all the food is fried, it wasn't very greasy as many fish and chips tend to be. Both the fish and fries were pretty good. The staff was helpful as the menu was all in French and they were attentive throughout our stay."}
{"text":"The grilled fish burger was a delight that I look forward to consuming over, and over and over. And it was $5 + tx! I really liked the semi-communal seating arrangement also which boded for a really chilled, positive vibe. This place is cool, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"[Update 28-Nov-2016 : I noticed today that this location is no longer open. Very sad news. ].  I went for the clam chowder and was informed that they were out. But then I tried the cod's balls.  Loved 'em!   I never would have tried them if they hadn't been out of chowder.  So glad the ran out of chowder that day!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, egalitarian seating, EVERYONE sits at the counters, which look like recycled bowling alleys, cosy atmosphere, prompt, courteous service. They'll grill your fish instead of deep frying if you ask. Fries the real thing... not the prefab crap one normally gets  at fast food joints. I have to admit though, I didn't find my fishburger to be all that awesome, but then again, I'm still getting over a cold, so perhaps that explains it. Will try their chowder next time."}
{"text":"Same menu,prices,set-up... everyone sits at the counters. This branch,though, appears to have less seating than the one located in Mile End. Service prompt and courteous as always."}
{"text":"Already before ordering I was impressed by the menu, $5 hamburgers, $5 fish sandwich (grilled or fried) and 10 for a standard fish + chips meal?  This place looked very reasonable!   The real star here is the fish. Big pieces of crispy breading, no oil or grease running off of them and a delicious intoxicatingly good smell. It tasted as good as it looked. The batter had a satisfyingly sweet and buttery crunch while the fish fell apart in my mouth. This was better than any other fish and chips I'd ever had. Not only was it less oily and less greasy, they also don't salt the fish or the fries before serving. I'm one of those weird people who enjoys having things unsalted and adding my own salt afterwards. The fries would have been ruined with a heavy salting hand. They too were crispy and golden brown with that slight hint of sweetness we've all come to know and love in Quebecois and Belgian fries.  With the meal you can have the standard homemade tartare sauce, a thai sauce, curry, paprika, etc... I ordered the Herb sauce while my fiancee got the Thai. To be honest, mine was a bit of a letdown. The thai sauce was much more flavourful. I couldn't quite place the spice in there, was it galangal, thai curry?  I had to try the homemade tartar sauce. It was quite good, homemade mayonnaise, with what I think was a home-pickled relish. It could have used a little more lemon juice.   I can't wait to go back and to try their Clam Chowder, Calmari, Grilled fish sandwiches and all the other maritime bounty they have to offer."}
{"text":"I really like this little place in the Village. It's a long narrow space. You can sit at the counter or sit outside during the summer. Service is pleasant and efficient. The menu is simple: burgers or fish with fries/poutine and/or salad. Also a thick and tasty clam chowder. One of those places you can recommend where everything is good."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I ordered take out and have not yet eaten in the restaurant.   That said, my experience was not appetizing at all. The fish was beyond oily (see picture) and was quite smelly (fresh fish should not have a \"fishy\" scent). There was clearly no seasoning on the fish, nor in the batter, as it was entirely bland. The fries were also unseasoned... Always salt fries when they come out of the fryer - that's basic technique. Overall, a highly disappointing meal.   I'd say I'd give this place another try, but my colleagues say they've eaten in the restaurant and had the very same experience. I blame them for not warning me ahead of time. Folks, this is my warning to all of you!!!   P.S.: check out the picture of the new menu."}
{"text":"Excellent fish n' chips!! The fish is fresh : light and flaky, falls apart when you dive your fork in, not chewy at all. The batter is thin and super crispy. The fries are crispy too and well seasoned. Everything is still burning hot when they serve it to you. I'd love to try the other items next time I go there."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for burgers, fries, poutine, and apparently the fish&chips are pretty good as well. The service is really above par as the servers are friendly and go out of their way to make sure that you're satisfied. I've eaten here at least 10 times and I've never been disappointed. The rustic beach side resort decor is also nice!"}
{"text":"I just received the worst service from this restaurant. I made an order online for 2 pieces of cod fillet and a side salad. It arrived with only 1 piece. I called the restaurant, who refused to send the delivery company back. Instead they said they would take my name down and give me a deal next time. I'm sorry but this isn't right. They made an error, they should be the ones contacting the company to fix the current problem: I paid for food, I should have that food or at least a refund. No, they're asking me to spend MORE money at their restaurant and get a deal with it. That does not fix the current problem. Do not order from this restaurant if you expect to receive good service. You will not find it here. VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered some take-out at Comptoir and I have no regrets! It came in about 35 mins.  Their fish is pretty good albeit a little too salty for my taste but very tender and crispy on the outside. I also found their poutine and clam chowder to be DELECTABLE (even more so than the fish, ironic hahaha)."}
{"text":"Sometimes when you run out of food in the refrigerator and you feel too lazy to go to the grocery store and lug everything back to your place, good, cheap eats are the way to go. Since I haven't eaten fish and chips in what feels like ages, I decided to check this place out!  After taking a seat on the patio because of the perfect weather that day, I proceeded to read the menu (which is very simple and straightforward) and went along with the two-piece combo with fries and salad. I was definitely not disappointed in the quality of my meal after savoring each of its components.  The salad was fresh, crisp, and had an amazing dressing to go along with it, which says a lot since I tend to avoid salad because I normally hate dressing and it tastes bland without it. The fish pieces were nicely coated in a flavorful batter that complemented the meat nicely, although I wish that it was slightly crispier and would hold its shape better than it did. The chips were just that - thick, greasy, and of course, a guilty pleasure as it normally would be.  Overall, the amount of food that you get for the price makes it definitely worth coming here, and the picturesque views of Saint Cats and the pink balls above will go along with your experience in a pleasing manner. I guess I will try Brit & Chips in the near future for a good comparison?"}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this place because she knows I love fish! The last time I had a fish and chip it was in a renowned place in London so I had high standards ! This place is really cute! It's called comptoir 21 because you are literally sitting at a counter! I love the vibe! Very laid back! I had one piece of the fish and chip! I wasn't crazy about the batter , perhaps too greasy for my taste but it was still good! I enjoyed the fries and their tartar sauce! The service was good and fast! My friends had the comptoir 21 salad and the poutine! They both enjoyed their plate! I'll be back to taste more of the menu. The price tag is also very good! I recommend this place if Ure in a rush and you want some good fish and chip."}
{"text":"Toujours très satisfaisant d'aller aux différentes succursales du Comptoir 21. Le poisson est toujours frais, les plats sont chauds et servis rapidement, les employé.e.s ont l'air content.e.s d'être là et le décor est vraiment sympathique. C'est très abordable, aussi.  C'est bien le seul moment où je mange du poisson, quand je m'y pointe, c'est donc dire que je suis difficile.  Soulignons l'excellente idée de baisser les prix en fonction de la température extérieure. Plus il fait froid, plus les prix sont bas. Faut croire qu'ils ont choisi leur année, il fait genre 15 degrés présentement.  Les Omega 3, BRING IT ON."}
{"text":"Best fihnchips I've had in Montréal. 1 or 2 piece plate very lightly coated and fried with a super crisp exterior and moist melt in your mouth interior with fries or salad and fires. IMO skip the salad which is a mix of shredded carrot, leaf lettuce, diced tomatoes drenched in a tasteless dressing. We tried the breaded shrimp which was a winner. Quick and friendly service with a cold beer, what more do you want? Well done, we will return."}
{"text":"Pas besoin de prendre l'avion pour se rendre à Londres pour apprécier un authentique Fish & Chips. Au cur du Village, vous trouverez ce comptoir où le F&C se révèle en toute authenticité.   N'y allez pas pour le décor ou pour l'ambiance. Ici pas d'artifice pour se donner des airs branchés. Tout les efforts sont consacrés à bien remplir l'assiette de produits de première qualité."}
{"text":"Idk if I've just never had actually good fish n chips before but this place totally blew me out of the water. Delicious flakey and moist, simply the best fish I've ever had. The fries were decent but not nearly as good as the fish. If you're in Montreal and from out of town, this is a must try :)"}
{"text":"Great place. The all-dressed Burger 21 and the fish and chips are the best things on the menu. Amazing atmosphere. The only hiccup was the beer. There was no neck at all. The bartender said she was sorry and that it was her specialty. Everything else was amazing. One of the best diners I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I came for lunch around 1:30 on a Wednesday and the little place was wide open. I ordered the small portion of fish and the poutine. The poutine was a bit of a disappointment. Not that it was bad, but I've had better. I do have to say the portion was quite generous. The fish, however, was excellent. So perfectly cooked - crisp and brown on the outside and moist on the inside. The homemade tartar sauce was delicious as well. Skip the poutine and get a large portion of fish with plain fries. That's what I'm doing next time..."}
{"text":"What a great find! We walked up on this little gem and we are so glad we did! Like we are planning to go back another day during our visit. Fish & chips (these are REAL home cut fries.....like the ones you cut up at home, not frozen from a bag) spot with calamari, croquettes and poutine! Servers were very personable and answered all of our questions....even the ones that had nothing to do with the food or restaurant lol Get the combination plate.....it has a little bit of everything! FYI - the paprika sauce is spicier than the jalapeño sauce. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Bear in mind, Montreal is close to no ocean so though we are on an island fresh seafood can be hard to find. When fish and chips is fresh and perfect it's probably in my top 5 favourite foods, and when it's anything less than perfect it kinda breaks my heart because it just doesn't bring those same memories back. Le Comptoir 21 today was perfect - the fish was so light and fresh and buttery and not at all fishy I couldn't believe it; according to the owner it comes up from Boston (which explains it's bold Maritime-y American attitude =). The batter was perfect, especially squirted with the bottles of malt and regular vinegar provided, and dipped in the homemade tartar. I had a pint of local blonde beer from the tap, but saw they also had bottles of that lovely and inexpensive C'est La Vie wine from the Pays D'Oc. The fries were perfect and my date said his steak sandwich was above average: the panini was warm and light and full of peppers, mushrooms and onions and gooood with the hot sauce.   We also really dug the communal seating at the counter wrapped around the smiling franglais waitress who seemed happy working in 360, dealing out the little baskets lined with blue and white check wax paper full up with breaded shrimp, calamari, burgers and darkly golden fries. You could almost almost hear the ocean and on this fall day in Canada we were just loving it."}
{"text":"Le premier fish & chips de ma vie, et pas le dernier puisque j'y suis retournée la semaine suivante !  C'est dire à quel point c'était délicieux. Le poisson était vraiment très fondant, les sauces qui accompagnaient très bonnes.  Le prix est top, l'endroit est chaleureux, le service aussi. Assis au comptoir, on se sent comme à la maison. A tester les yeux fermés (pour mieux déguster !!)"}
{"text":"Great, flaky fish and chips, great fries, good beer. Poutine sauce was ok, service a little slow (despite it not being too busy), but overall a really good little place."}
{"text":"L'endroit n'est pas très grand mais ca reste très sympa. J'aime beaucoup l'idée du comptoir central.   Coté nourriture j'ai envie de dire que c'est simple car le choix est limité mais ne pensez pas que simple signifie que ce n'est pas bon au contraire. Les gouts sont très sympa. J'ai pris un Fish&chips car c'est la spécialité et il était tres bon et en bonne quantité. Les frites maisons sont parfaites. En plus de tout cela le personnel est tres sympa et souriant."}
{"text":"I only had the poutine, but wow! it's incredible. While visiting Montreal, I wasn't sure how much vegetarian poutine I'd be able to find, but Comptoir 21's is all you need. I could have eaten this every day while I was in town."}
{"text":"Comptoir 21 was a very pleasant surprise as I've seen it on Yelp but today walking by it we knew we had to try it!    A cute little Fish & Chips shop so hipster in Mille End it fits the eclectic mood of the neighbourhood quite well!  You tend to feel like you are in a old school diner with the communal sitting around the bar with round bar stools.  A clear view of the kitchen is a wonderful way to bring openness and charm to this place.  The decor of the distressed wood floors and open design feels quite communal yet not too intrusive!    The menu is simple yet efficient as there is a good selection for landlubbers (burgers) as well (if fish and seafood are not quite your style)!  I went with the fish (cod) and poutine and my wife went with just a poutine.  The fish was so fresh and crispy...big fish flakes.  I'd rate it up there as one of the best in Montreal I've tried, especially for the price!  The poutine was quite yummy also as the gravy was not too salty and just the perfect amount of \"gooeyness\"!  Fries were hand cut and not too salty!  A few other patrons had kids there and everyone looked quite satisfied after finishing their meal!    We definitely want to come back and experience Comptoir 21 again!"}
{"text":"Really good hipster fish and chips place. I've eaten at the other location in the Plateau and both are prepared in similar decor.  We came here before a night out and concert at the Olympia theatre. Having the fortunate opportunity to travel lots to Maritime Canada I eat quite a bit of fish and chips there! If you eat fish n chipper in Moncton, Halifax, St John's or places in between it's usually super fresh and amazing! Seriously it's hard to get any better! I would only say in the UK could it taste better!     So here at C21 I'd proclaim the batter is up to snuff but I question if it's fresh and not frozen de-thawed fish? I asked the guy serving us and he said it was Cod. Forgot to ask if it was fresh or frozen? It was probably fresh as I'd think weird for a restaurant to use frozen fish but you never know!  It tended to flake apart a bit so this is why I question if it was frozen. None the less it was scrumptious and a very healthy serving. My meal was the large version which came with three pieces. I had it of course with poutine. The poutine was prepared in a thick brown sauce with good amount of cheese. You have a choice between lots of different spiked mayo's. I had it with the Paprika which was nice and spicy. We ate dinner with a green salad that was fresh had a great brownish dressing and was great to share with the wifey. She had a glass of white wine and I had a Boreale blonde beer pint. All good in that department.   I've not eaten Fish and Chips at many places in a Montreal this sure is a strong option. It's reasonably priced ($57.65 w tax n tip included) for the two of us with salad and drinks.   Worth a comeback again even if the fish was a bit flaky!"}
{"text":"We had lost hope of finding anything good on St Catherine. This was a happy find.  Everything tasted great. The large was damn large. Everything came fast. and Nathalie was lovely and gave us some great recos for stuff to see the next day.   Thanks for the grub!"}
{"text":"I love the love for a semi-tourist. As a former resident of England and now current part-time resident of Montreal, I found the best of both worlds at Comptoir 21. Fish, Chips, Poutine, Salads, Beer, OH MY!   Not disappointed. Not a cloth napkin joint, but you'll be very satisfied. Drink a ton of water and plan a nice long walk after your meal. You'll be satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Less hipster than old school. Good food, large portions and good value. It's not a large menu but the food is great and it has a laid-back vibe. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Comptoir 21 after walking by at least a dozen times. The boyfriend and I ventured out on a rainy Thursday night since none of us felt like cooking. Our initial plan was to get take-out and eat at home.   I don't know if it was the decor or the fact that it wasn't a busy night but the second we walked in we looked at each other and decided to eat at their counter.   My man was dying to try and rate their fish 'n' chips since he's a self proclaimed aficionado.  We both ordered the big plate(3 pieces). I'm a lady with a hearty appetite and it was way too big for me. I had a whole piece of fish left and some fries.   The fish: very crispy batter, extremely fresh and moist. They only have cod which is a bit of a downer.   The chips: out of this world!!! The poutine also looked amazing.   The homemade dipping sauce: I'm a purist and went with tartar. It wasn't bad but nothing special. I'll probably try something with more of a kick next time.  The vinegar: I must admit I was pretty impressed with the spritzer system. Although it dispenses flavour uniformly, you have to go at it quite a bit if you want to taste the vinegar.   The service: amicable and attentive, nothing bad to say.   The price: very affordable!  Overall I didn't give this place 5 stars because they only have one fish and they charge extra for a second dipping sauce($1) and extra lemon wedges($0.50). The portions are big and 1 lemon wedge + a tiny cup of sauce just ain't enough. I think I still prefer Brit & Chips but that might be due to the Flake Cadbury...not sure. For now, their business card,which a magnet, is on my fridge tempting me to go back whenever I don't feel like being the ideal housewife in the kitchen! :)"}
{"text":"Est--ce que je vous ai déjà mentionner mon amour pour le poisson? J'adore le poisson! Et je ne manque aucune occasion pour en manger.   Hier, comme j'étais à Verdun, je suis entrée et j'ai été charmée par la place: un grand comptoir style snack bar des années 50' avec des tabourets et des petits paniers pour la bouffe. Super sympa, la touche vintage!   La spécialité est le fish & chips, servi avec frites ou salade et un choix de sauce pour l'accompagnement. Il y a aussi de la bière, dont la fameuse Guiness, pour un vrai repas british et un choix de boissons non--alcoolisées. Le poisson est bien cuit dans une succulente panure, les frites sont croustillantes et délicieuses avec un soupçon de de vinaigre de malt et la portion (1 filet) était amplement suffisante pour mon appétit. J'aime ça quand je peux choisir des petits portions au resto, comme ici!   En plus, les employés sont gentils et le service était assez rapide, compte tenu que c'était un jeudi soir. Si j'y retourne? À l'abordage, moussaillons!"}
{"text":"La première fois était super ! Le staff était vraiment super gentil , souriant, et la cuisine ouverte nous laisse voir tous les employés et les délicieux fish n chips . L'ambiance qui règne dans le restaurant est super, et les gens ont beaucoup de plaisir . La 2e fois nous a un peu déçu. En effet, le propriétaire était présent, et son attitude envers ses employés était vraiment désagréable. Nous étions vraiment mal pour eux . Petit point négatif : ils n'acceptent pas les cartes de crédits. Dans tous les cas, un endroit sympa à visuter pour un lunch ou un souper délicieux et sans chichi !"}
{"text":"Took the half fish portion with tartar sauce. Sauce was kinda tasteless but the fish was pretty fresh.  Also took an entrée of fried calamari with this sauce - pretty big portion for $5.95.  I like the long go around wood counter."}
{"text":"The Decor is pretty average. The food was filling to say the least. The fish was pretty nice. The fries were average in a good way. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I've always been reluctant to try fish and chips in Montreal as I felt no one could really do anything close to what you find in England... low and behold.. Comptoir 21 does a damned good job.  Have to say, the family and I really enjoyed our visit and our food. The fish is super fresh and that is key with fish.  If you are in the neighborhood, I highly recommend you stop and judge for yourself.   Haven't tried Brit & Chips yet, but when I do, the bar will be set pretty high after my Comptoir 21 experience."}
{"text":"What is there to say? They make great fish and chips with a very tasty tartare sauce and killer slaw. There should have been more of that slaw, my only gripe. Service was cordial, friendly and attentive. The place has a unique décor that tells you you'll be eating fish in some capacity. At 9pm in Verdun that palace was over 50% capacity. Families, old couples, young adults. Well definitely take the family there in the future. Nothing fishy going on, just good business. Loved it."}
{"text":"There are multiple locations for Comptoir 21 all over Montreal. Their fish and chips is delicious and the sauces are incredibly unique and flavourful. The fish is fresh and tender, while the batter remains crisp and not too greasy. The interior is very old school and gets quite busy at lunchtime. Definitely one of the best places for fish and chips in the city. :)"}
{"text":"Fun little place with the best fish and chips I've had in a long time. We originally came here when we saw the vegetarian poutine, which was excellent.   The space is inviting - long counters and stools with exposed brick walls, vintage photos, and clever sea life art made from recycled materials. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The food was spot on - the perfect place to grab lunch. The fish was fried expertly and came with a yummy tartar sauce that was full of fresh herbs. This was the first poutine we've had where the fries were still pretty crispy, so the contrast in texture was exactly what we needed. We ordered salad to balance it all out, and it wasn't bad either. Would love to go here again next time in Montréal."}
{"text":"Short and simple :  One of the best fish and chips I had. No more. No less.   Tartare sauce (home made) was good, fries and fish were perfectly cooked. And we had more than enough food for two people for the 14$95 option.   I will definitely go back for more"}
{"text":"All is good in this restaurant. The interior is so cool, the food is tasty, the staff is very nice. The burger is simply amazing and fish and chips too. It's a very nice option for a meal during the weekdays"}
{"text":"Voici LA place dans le Mile-End pour déguster un excellent fish & chip. Le Comptoir 21 est un endroit charmant où les clients peuvent vivre une expérience digne des petits restos de quartier montréalais.   À chacune de mes visites ici, le poisson était d'une fraicheur exemplaire. La panure est légère et croustillante. Les portions sont très raisonnables pour le prix. On peut choisir son assiette selon deux types de format (régulier ou grand) et d'accompagnement (frittes ou salade).   L'ensemble du menu tourne autour du concept fruits de mer. Outre le fish & chip, vous trouvez des burgers de poisson, du calmar fris et une excellente chaudronnée de palourde type Maine (elle est vraiment bonne !). Il y a aussi de la poutine au menu pour ceux qui sont moins du type poisson.  Vous l'aurez deviné, lorsqu'on mange un fish & chip au Comptoir 21, les britanniques peuvent aller se rhabiller.  Je recommande."}
{"text":"Vous trouverez ici la même excellente qualité de Fish & Chip que chez sa consoeur du quartier Mile-End. Morues bien fraiche. Frites croustillantes à souhait. Belle variété de sauces tartrates pour accompagner votre poisson. Rien à redire. Le resto ici est plus grand et permet donc d'accueillir plus de clients. Le service est rapide et courtois. J'adore! Pas étonnant que la chaine fasse des petites."}
{"text":"Love this place. This small sized operation offers a full set of menu which surprised me. The narrow sized restaurant has a open kitchen. Nether the smell nor the heat would bother you, which is nice. The long table standing along the wall and the deco gives you a delusion of being in the 80's.  We try salad with one piece fish and fires with one piece. It you choose two piece in a meal, a little discount applied. Upside of two one-piece meals is you got two sauces to choose. I love their home made sauces.  The calamari is very good. A big portion. However, I tasted a little baking soda in the batter coating, not too true about that. That's why it loses one star. We also had a beer, which went very well with the food.  The clam chowder is amazing. Even though it was different with the one I had in Quincy market, Boston. I think this one got more ingredient and some more herb inside.  They have a terrace. Sitting there and having a beer with some fried seafood reminds me of my old relaxing undergrad life back in China."}
{"text":"Si vous êtes en manque de fish and chips , vous êtes a la bonne place ! Ce petit restaurant propose plusieurs choix de fishand chips. Qui est vraiment bon. Le poisson était frais et tendre, et la panure bien croustillante. Les portions sont généreuses. Mention spéciale a la soupe de palourdes qui est bonne aussi. Je recommande pour un dîner dans la semaine."}
{"text":"Fish fry doesn't get much better than this. The crust is thin, delicate, crispy, with hardly a hint of oil. Yum! The fries and poutine are terrific, too, and my group loved the vinegar mister that didn't soggify the fries.   The woman working the counter was friendly to locals and out-of-towners alike, and I wish I could pick the whole place up and transport it home with me!"}
{"text":"We tried Le Comptoir 21 today for a late lunch. I had great expectations but unfortunately it fell a little flat. The service is cool and friendly. The set up is minimalistic but cute, and the clam chowder was perfect. However, the fish itself was very greasy and felt bland. Since fish and chips are their specialty, that was a bit of a disapointement.The serving is HUGE you can definitely go for the small portion. I will say the sauce tartare and the french fries were great. Maybe we'll be back in a few weeks to see if we had only hit a bad day."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this location, I was pretty smitten - at least with the quality and crispness of the main attraction 'the fish' in the fish n chips. This time not so much, the fish was undercooked.  I'll say that on that level I would have given a 2 rating. However, several redeeming factors ensued or precluded the fish incident.   For starters their clam chowder isn't to bad at all. In fact it's about a 4 on it's own...OK good start - and those cute Oyster crackers (they have to count for at least a half star).  The fries and tartar sauce were up to 'relative par', I especially like the crispy bits and pieces at the bottom of the basket, and the sauce flavourful enough to eat on its own.    Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the open - this trip the fish was well undercooked, glassy and somewhat clear - you know the look.   Our server did have it changed (mentioning to the cooks to cook it more in the future - not just my order), however, the new order came back less cooked than I'd like, yet enough to eat and not bring up the previous layers of food already eaten. I was very surprised, though I guess even fish n chips can go a bit south from time to time. Perhaps, a third try???  Note: The large order of fish (3 pieces) is enough to feed several mouths and fairly priced - if folks want to share."}
{"text":"Beau, bon, pas cher. Vraiment habiter proche je serais dangereusement addict. Vraiment excellent prix, service rapide et bière vraiment pas cher aussi.  Très bon fish and chip, j'ai pris la portion petite avec frite et bière. 19$ avec tip. Moins de 20$ pour une portion petite que j'ai partagé tellement ce n'était pas petit du tout . J'ai choisi la sauce Cari et je ne suis pas un fan de sauce mais c'était tout simplement délicieux. Morale de l'histoire, dès que je retourne dans le coin, je vais arrêté là."}
{"text":"What a satisfying lunch! Had the chowder and Burger 21, and it was everything I could have hoped for. Slowly meandering back to the office now with a full belly and a smile on my face.   Great restaurant. Great atmosphere. Great staff. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I stopped in because I was looking for a light dinner before a show at the Olympia and I was not disappointed!  I wasn't very hungry so I opted for one piece of fish with frites. The fish was a decent size and was so delicious I wished I had gotten a second piece. The tartar sauce was different from what I have had in the past, with a strong dill flavor, but was very good. The fish came with a huge portion of frites that I couldn't even begin to put a dent in. I asked for mayonnaise to accompany them and really enjoyed their version.   The best part of this experience was that it was the first place where I really felt welcomed in Montreal and where I wasn't obviously treated differently because I was a tourist. This place is a great option for a meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Really recommend it. Great ambiance, good service, might be a bit small but pack great food. You have to try the fish and chips, if go there to get a burger the first time you should be slapped.  Also good for deliveries if you live not to far. Was as delicious."}
{"text":"I read about the fab poutine at this place on a food blog.  Not so.  Admittedly nice fries, but tasteless gravy and cold, lumpy cheese curds. This poutine could have benefited heaps from an effortless toss under the broiler, coaxing things into a tasty melt.  The curds were cold and lifeless, not squeaky and moist like they should be.  Not to mention the flavorless gravy.    Sure it's a chain and their gravy is artificial, but Smoke's offers better value and better flavor.  I truly wish it weren't so.  I wanted to love this place and left hungry and unhappy."}
{"text":"This little hippie place is DELISH!! Friendly waitress with a smile,quick service and great tasting fish! The beer is def a added bonus. Must try!  P.S. This place blows away Brits & Chips by a mile!!"}
{"text":"Très sympa pour manger un fish and chips avec des amis ou autres ! Endroit sympathique et abordable ."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday evening and got a seat immediately. Decor is cool, older diner style but very pleasant. The menu is simple and reasonably priced with burgers and fish & chips as the main focus. I had fish & chips, it was above average, not the best in the world but very good. The fish wasn't oily, hard to do for deep fried. The fries are excellent. They have a limited beer menu which was a nice surprise. There is a big take out business in case you want to just grab something and go home to eat.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Verdun just got a little bit better.  Comptoir 21 recently opened its third location on Verdun's increasingly trendy, but still underneath the radar screen, Wellington Avenue. Sitting on the corner of 4th Avenue across the street from a vintage/retro shop, British Fish & Chips has found  a new place to hang its hat.  Painted a light blue, sticking to the sea-based theme,  this Comptoir probably has the longest retro, chrome dining bar I've seen in a while. You cannot go wrong with the Fish and Chip, but if that's not your thing, you're not out of luck either. With burgers, salads, fried calamari, poutine, hot dogs and clam chowder, this is a wonderful place to either come by for a meal when you're not in the mood to cook or pick up and take away, which is going to be fun during the summer months since Verdun's bucolic riverside is literally a block away.  Really friendly service, the place already has the hum of a great neighborhood eatery. Come check it out the next time you're in this bend in the river!"}
{"text":"The fish n chips is among the best available in Montreal. They offer sandwiches, poutine and they are all excellent. Don't hesitate to go if you're feeling like fish n chips"}
{"text":"it seems a small place from outside, but when you come it, it's spacious with a good vide, maybe because it has the U-shaped counter, i like its decoration. I ordered the take-out for classic fish and chips. It turned out better than expected, The batter is flaky, and the meat is fresh and tender. it's superb, I regretted to order only one piece of fish but not two. BTW, it came with a tiny vinegary cabbage salad which is to my taste also. Anyway I can't wait to come back again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"randomly picked this small cute restaurant near my airbnb. Lovely patido seats and sunshine"}
{"text":"This place has this cool vibe attached to it, you go in you feel like you are on one of those beach fish n' chips places...well you know what you are (minus the beach). The place is design in a fun way with one long snake like table so you just sit and join the fun, you immediately feel the \"your part of the group now\" vibe even if you are there alone. The place is based on fish n chips but they also have a very nice vege-burger (you wouldnt expect that) and a vege-poutine (not always easy to find in Montreal) and the prices are reasonable under 10$ for a main+fries/salad meal around 6$ for a pint. cool place with cool vibe and nice food. Not a place for dates but a place for fun-food with a friend or with your kid"}
{"text":"No no no. If you're from anywhere that has decent fish and chips this place will not fulfill your craving. If you have never had good fish and chips maybe this tastes good? I dont know. It mostly made me sad."}
{"text":"Il n'y a pas une grande panoplie de restos à fish n' chips à Montréal, alors quand l'envie d'un bon poisson avec une belle panure et des frites vous prends, le Comptoir 21 devient un incontournable!  Ils ont une super bonne variété d'option même si le focus est vraiment mis sur le fish n'chip. On peut aussi y manger des burgers en version carnivore, poisson ou végétarien. La poutine est aussi végétarienne mais ç y goûter la sauce, vous ne pourriez pas le deviner au goût seulement. Elle est boooooonne!  Et le poisson, bien que quand même un peu gras à cause de la friture, est simplement cuit à perfection. Il se défait seul tout en restant bien juteux. Et pour les sauces, mes préférées sont la thaï et la paprika. Toutefois, parce qu'on avait de la manière à décider, la serveuse a été tellement gentille et nous a offert de toutes les essayé (avec nos calmars en entrée) avant de faire notre choix finale pour le repas principal et elles étaient toutes très bonnes.  L'endroit est tout petit et le décor vraiment cool. Tout le monde s'assoit à un long comptoir en forme de \" U \" et c'est quand même propice à la jasette avec des inconnus. On s'y sent bien en petit groupe ou même seul vu la disposition des sièges le long du comptoir. En fait, je ne les ai pas compté, mais si j'avais à prendre une chance, je dirais qu'il y a probablement 21 sièges au comptoir! Quelqu'un le saurait pour sûr?"}
{"text":"I come here for the delicious clam chowder and for being sassy with the counter staff. Comptoir 21 is a solid place and on a cold day, it just feels so nice to walk in, see the ever familiar staff and tuck into some yummy fish, perfectly cooked chips and some decently priced pints of Boreal. No credit cards accepted here, so cash and debit only, kids!"}
{"text":"From outside, the place looks rather small and sketchy, but once inside, it's bright, it's spacious, and it feels somewhat friendly.   Now for the food: I had a large portion of cod (only type of fish they serve) with a homemade tartar sauce and a poutine.  NOTICE: THE FISH DIDNT COME IN NEWSPAPER D: but back to food:  The cod was nicely cooked but it lacked seasoning. A bit more salt would help bring out the flavor of the fish.  The batter was crispy as it should be, but not very light (it was not puffy) which means it absorbed a lot of oil and tasted a whole lot like oil.   The tartar was very green for some reason, and it didn't taste lemony like most. It was flavorsome however, but I prefer a lemony sauce with my fish.   My friend took the paprika mayonnaise. That was... just mayonnaise with paprika mixed in. And if you cook, you know that paprika adds color, not flavor.  The poutine was... very average. Relatively thick fries (not the crispy type of fries) topped with cold (yes some of the cheese were still cold!!) cheese curd and a generic gravy.    All in all, I rate Comptoir 21 a 4/5 because it's probably one of the only decent chippers in Montreal. But the food itself is just a bit above average.   And lastly: MY FISH N CHIPS DIDNT COME IN NEWSPAPER!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of cod (it was remarkably hard to determine what kind of fish they had from their website/online) but the preparation and the fries were very good. Malt vinegar in a spray bottle is a brilliant idea."}
{"text":"My favorite fish and chips place in Rhode Island closed down, so when I saw this place during my most recent trip to Montreal, I pounced. The place is counter service (as the name suggests) and cute. I wouldn't come with a group bigger than 4. The prices were fair, the food was OK, and portions were generous.   The fish and chips was good but not what I had in mind when I thought New England-style fish and chips (and I assume that's what they go for because they have chowdah on the menu). The fish was tender but the batter wasn't as light as I would expect from beer battered (I am not sure theirs is). Fries were good, that's standard. Slaw was oil and vinegar, not creamy, but very tasty. The tartar sauce... that's where it all broke down for me. I am big on tartar -- every bite of fish and chips I eat needs to have tartar. Whomever came up with this recipe, I am sad to say, has never had real tartar. This looks like some greenish, herby mayo sauce and it lacks the acidity of real tartar. Also no hint whatsoever of relish/pickles in the sauce. Not a bad sauce, but definitely very far from tartar.   We also tried the calamari, which was a great deal for $6. They were good, but I didn't keep going for more the way I normally do. These were dredged in flour before being fried but the crust flaked off very easily; it didn't stick.  What made our experience less pleasant was that they don't take credit cards, only Canadian debit cards. American debit is run the same as credit, so your cards won't be good here. There are no banks around and the 2 nearest bodegas had broken ATMs. So I ran 6 blocks to another bodega to take out cash and then ran 6 blocks back to pay. The waitress was very nice and apologetic, but if you have this problem often like it seemed they do, then let us know before we order so we can figure something out.  OK if you're in the area and have cash, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"After several different friend highly recommending Comptoir 21 (@Comptoir21Fish), we just had to drop by and it end up being the first stop of our 3 day Montreal trip.  The menu is pretty simple with mainly Fish &amp; Chips (duh) selection and includes other things like hotdog and burger for the non-fish eater.  Love the U-shaped bar table where the waitress can bring everything from kitchen to table. The space was rather small and you may need to wait a bit for a seat but the turnaround is pretty quick.  Homemade Clam Chowder $5.95 ~ We started with their New England style chowder and it was rich, creamy and super thick.  You can choose form Fish only, Fish&amp;Chips, Fish&amp;Poutine and Fish&amp;Salad and comes in half size, small size and full size.  Large Fish &amp; Poutine $15.95 ~ This was the full size version which comes with 3 big piece of fish. It was light and fluffy in a crispy battered perfection plus love how the fish was piping hot when you cut into it. ~ It also came with a choice of sauces and we choose the original tartar sauce and that was the only thing I didn't like about the whole dish. ~ The tartar sauce was a tad bland with not enough \"sour/tart\" in it and wish they was bigger bits of pickles in it. ~ The poutine was surprisingly good with the traditional thick gravy and cheese curds.  Large Fish &amp; Salad $15.95 ~ Side of salad is a much healthier option and a welcoming refreshing to the deep fried fish.  Love the spray bottle of vinegar, no soggy fries from heavy hand or \"pour-too-much-accident\" here  Verdict: ~ Love it, would definitely come back when in Montreal in the future. ~ Very well price yummy deep fried cod fish with the perfect poutine on the side"}
{"text":"After experiencing fish & chips here for the first time, my resolve was just get through the meal and never try it again. For me it was just horrible. The fish batter as just too much and the fish tasted as if it was not washed with lime or vinegar before being cooked, so I could hard keep it down.   I don't know others seem to like it... (after all it has 4.5 stars here) but I won't come back here."}
{"text":"Following my experience last week at Brit and Chips (see previous blog entry), I decided to continue along the fish and chips path by visiting Comptoir 21 in Mile End. I stopped by on a early Friday evening to see what I have been missing.  Comptoir 21 is a nice small diner-like space that can sit probably about 20 people. They also have a takeout counter should you choose to enjoy their food at home. Compared to Brit and Chips, their options are more straight forward but no less delicious.  To start, I had their clam chowder. A nice hearty portion with loads of seafood and potatoes, the chowder avoided the classic sin of being too rich due to overuse of cream. Despite the warm weather outside, this chowder was a perfect starter to my meal.  Next up was the reason I came in: the fish and chips. At Comptoir 21, there are no options regarding the fish or the batter used. You've got one choice and it is a damn good one. The fish is nice and flaky while retaining its moistness despite the frying. The batter is thin but very crisp and sticks nicely to the fish. The options you do have is regarding whether you want fries, poutine or salad as well as your choice of sauce. I kept it traditional because to me, how you pull off simple fries and a base tartar sauce tells me how good of a fish and chips place you can be. The fries were nice and thick with a good crunch. Personally, I felt they needed a bit of seasoning before serving but it is minor complaints given how good they were. The Tartar sauce, on the other hand, was spot-on. Perfect rich and creamy compliment to the crispy fish. Very well done.  Comptoir 21 was a wonderful discovery in a area of town that I need to explore more thoroughly given my discoveries there so far (BU, The Sparrow, Lawrence). If someone were to ask me which I would pick between Comptoir 21 &amp; Brit and Chips, I'm not sure I can really pick one over the other right now. Both are amazing options to go try and discover. If you're looking for a place for a quick bite in Mile End, give Comptoir 21 a moment of your time. It certainly won't end up being your last time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The white fish has been masterfully fried so that the delicateness of the pure flesh had preserved its integrity, but had been fried to the deepest burnt sienna. Shards of skin that attempted to escape are left attached. This poutine put all the poutines we had in Quebec to shame. It's both a travesty and fortuitous that this was my introduction to poutine. Importantly, Comptoir 21 layers the three ingredients: a little of the raw umber, soft on the inside and crisp on the outside fries, a little of the moist cheese curds, a little of the gravy. Repeat.  While your fork digs down into this incredibly authentic and homemade tasting gravy, passed the curds, passed the fries...they've all been gathered into one forkful...strands of melting cheese curds on deck. I later learned how incredibly appealing and necessary the melting quality of the curds were, as I kept meeting Styrofoam curds throughout the region.  The staff is full of super cute boys who like boys. The decor is full on rescued-refurbished-hipster with long wooden tables, bar stools and an ancient looking ceiling. Also, their malt vinegar comes in a tiny spray bottle so that your fish is misted, rather than soaked. They have a cheeseburger and a fish burger for $5. Plus, a portion of poutine is $5...ok, $5,50."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend because the place we were initially planning on going to was closed and he had a F&C craving. This place had good reviews, so we went!   A lot of people order take out and it's a lot after than dining in.   Once you enter, you have to seat yourself. There's only a long bar like table and everyone's sitting next to each other (in individual tables). There were also no place to hang up your coat other than a couple of hooks near the door, so you can either keep your coat on or leave it by the door.   The waitress took a very long time to acknowledge not only us, but the rest of the customers. She'd come over, give a group their water, leave for 5-6min and come back and move on to the next group. It took a solid 15min before I even got my water! Note: it wasn't very busy.   We got 2 pieces of fish and a small poutine and it was enough to satisfy both of us. The fish was very good, but so oily that I couldn't even finish my piece. It was my first time eating fish and chips, so I'm not sure how it compares to other places. The poutine was okay. It didn't taste like a classic poutine. I think their gravy is different, but still good. The fries were kind of soggy and tasteless. There was a fair amount of cheese though.   I didn't have the clam chowder, but it smelled very good!   When I wanted to pay, I also had to wait 10min or so before the waitress noticed me.   All in all, the food was okay, but the staff really ruined the experience for me. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in the middle of a Montreal day! Affordable, delicious, and simple. Nice staff and decor. Unique find."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy environment. I ordered a cheese burger and poutine. The taste was alright even mediocre I might add but the cheese was still cold and the patty somewhat pink. Overall the service was good, the food was average but a disappointment given how much I paid $16.80."}
{"text":"Yummy fish!  Great spot on the street - wonderful place to watch the humans parade in La Village.  2 piece fish was perfect to share and the shrimp is nicely breaded and of generous portion size.  Homemade tartare is delicious!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place , terrasse available in summer, price is ok for fresh crunchy fish but small portions. Its an old fashion atmosphere in a tiny place vintage decoration."}
{"text":"Oh man, this is an exciting little gem in the Mile End.  So far I've only been twice.  So far.  The first time I went I had a lovely plate of fish and chips with and a nice little glass of red wine.  The batter was flaky, soft, golden, and absolutely delicious.  The fries were perfectly simple and divine.  As far as a simple and classic fish and chip meal goes, I can't imagine a way to ameliorate this fine little dish.  Today, feeling peckish and lazy, I dropped in again to sample the steak sandwich with a nice little pint of Boreal blonde.  Ô summer.  The steak was thinly sliced and served on a nice little bit of baguette with roasted marinated peppers and some kind of amazing sauce.  While tucking into this tasty sandwich I came up with the word \"bouchegasme\" in the frenzy of my masticating madness just in case the waitress asked me how the meal is.  Thankfully she didn't.  So all in all, I love this place.  It's the bee's knees.  If you have a hankering for a delicious little cheap-ish eat and don't want to wander too far away from Olimpico, I definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Très bonne adresse, le fish&chips est très bon, la Poutine est aussi très bonne. Seul bémol: les frites mériteraient à être plus croustillantes. Serveuse hyper efficace et à l'écoute"}
{"text":"Awesome! Everything is great - salad, poutine, fish and chips, veggie burger. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"A regular lunch spot for me. In the summer it is a quick-in quick-out spot. In the winter, you could expect a bit of a wait during the lunch rush.   Grab a spot at the counter and order a basket of fish and chips. Great vegetarian poutine as well with hand cut fries. Salads are a great complement to the fish and chips, but lettuce pieces are always huuuuge, making it a bit clumsy to eat at times.   Love that the fish always comes out piping hot, sauce is delicious.  Would not recommend for big groups (4 would be a max). Counter does not make for easy talking."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really relaxed (with only bar seating) and you can tell they care about one thing only: the food. The fried fish has a light and perfectly crunchy batter.  I only tried the Thai sauce but it was great with a little hint of heat.    The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the malt vinegar.  I like it strong, but even after heavily spraying the fish I could barely taste it :("}
{"text":"Hé mais quel joli intérieur mignon et disposé de manière originale, tous autour d'un comptoir, on entoure la serveuse qui s'occupe bien de tout le monde et on fait donc face aux autres convives.   C'est un restaurant de fish and chips et c'est donc vers le fish que je me suis tournée mais j'ai fait l'impasse sur les frites, remplacée par une petite salade composée. Le poisson était délicieux, très bien cuit avec une panure bien gourmande sans être trop huileuse. J'ai beaucoup aimé la présentation également, dans des petits paniers avec papier en damier bleu et blanc."}
