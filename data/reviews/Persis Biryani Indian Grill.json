{"text":"I went there for buffet twice. Moving from NYC hub of Indian restaurant, I am ought to be biased. I certainly have had better food. It gets crowded on weekend, wait time could be overwhelming. 

Food was okay there were plenty of dishes to try, Chicken tikka was good. The appetizer is average. Tandoori chicken was okay could have been better. The goat curry was not something I would recommend some one. Vegetarian dishes were better than the non vegetarian dishes. 

I was actually surprised to see it so crowded."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to Persis 4-5 times.  Based on my first few experiences, after it first opened, I would not have rated it this high.  Although the food was great, the service was poor and our server had a very difficult time understanding our order.  Also each dish took far to long to be served.  

Since then, they have certainly figured it out.  Our service has been excellent the past couple times we've gone.  Joseph is extremely friendly and more than happy to explain menu items and spice levels.  The manager came around to ask us how we were doing and the food came out much quicker.  So from a service standpoint, Persis is doing it right.

As for the food, it has always been outstanding.  Of the appetizers, I've tried the samosas, garlic chicken, fried jalapenos, and button mushrooms.  For entree, there are to many to name, but my favorite is the Chana Masala.  Also, they do not have Dal Makhani on the menu; however Joseph had it specially made for us.  

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if it were available.  I highly recommend it and I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We can find new biryanis here:

Chicken 65 + biryani rice = boneless biryani
Lamb curry + biryani rice= lamb biryani, 

Buffet specials is always with out biryani. Once upon a time food is good . But now just it is a money making restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here after moving back to Charlotte. Absolutely loved it. Everything we ordered was so awesome. Biriyani is a must have here. I so wish that this place is near our home!"}
{"text":"The tikka massala is on point but the Butter Chicken is where it's at!  I have tried several Indian food establishments in Charlotte and this is by far the best both for the lunch buffet and the evening service which feature large portions and informative service.  Dang now I've gone and made myself hungry :-)"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte by far! Recommended to us by an Indian friend & all Indians eating there so you know it will be the real deal! Wait staff is very friendly & nice & they love to give suggestions on what to order. Our server , Joseph, did not steer us wrong . If you have ever eaten at the Indian Garden in Chicago, Persis is just as good, if not better. And it's a lot closer!!"}
{"text":"Imagine you have to wait for food for more than an hour after being seated. I dont go the place again if service is poor (I never have high expectation from any Indian restaurants for service but this was extreme on low side)

Food here was better compared to other similar restaurants in the area. 
I tried some of their veg dishes like Kadai paneer, malai kofta and biryani are good."}
{"text":"There was good time last year but new folks messed up all. Late services , order mix ups, bad conduct all are best practices now a days... Don't waste time and money."}
{"text":"Woohoo!! I had been longing to have good, authentic biryani and Voila!! I tried their Vegetarian Biryani, Paneer 65 and Dal Tadka today. It really reminded me of the Hyderabadi Biryani that I ate in Hyderabad years ago. Everything was delicious and  items were priced ok. They also delivered the food with a $2 delivery charge which isnt too bad..though I stay so close that I might just pick it up myself next time. Overall, great food and a good addition to the gourmet dining in Ballantyne, Charlotte. Hoping they keep the standards."}
{"text":"Most pathetic Indian food I have ever had in US. We went there on a Thursday night with unlimited kabobs, horrible undercooked kabobs and very bad indiochinese food. I would never ever visit this place again. And to top it all the service is very bad."}
{"text":"quality of food can at times vary; majority of times, its been good to ok; spiciness can be adjusted and can be brought up to the \"real indian spicy\" level! lunch buffet is ok; ambience could have been better."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Their Tikka Marsala is my favorite in town. I have ordered to go many times but only eaten in once. The service for both was very good. You cant beat the price and portion size. Entrees are several dollars less than others in the area.

I have some complaints.
I can not eat enough in one sitting to make it worthwhile for me to do a buffet. I like to take mine home and will eat my leftovers. They do not allow you to order off the menu during buffet.
You also can not order to go during buffet which has forced me to go to Blue Taj on these occasions.
I also wish the did not shut down between lunch and dinner shifts. I don't eat lunch til late when they've already closed."}
{"text":"The best in Charlotte...paneer chilly highly recommend. Malai kofta and veg biryani were very tasty.. Most of the veg options have turned out to be quite tasty.. 
The buffet is also good.. Very good service.."}
{"text":"I have eaten their buffet lunch seven times now. Great food and great selection. They change it up so it isn't the same menu each time. The only reason I would give them a 4/5 is some times the food gets a little old toward the end of the buffet. Haven't tried their dinner yet."}
{"text":"Biriyani is real good. Goat is awesome. Medium is a bit spicy on biriyani. Kebabs are good. Naan is ok, curries are ok. Ambience is below the mark and service can be better."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine.  I have not tried the buffet yet, however the food off the menu was great.  We started with samosas for appetizers.  I had the chicken tika masala and it was delicious.   The naan bread was buttery and very tasty.  I plan to go back and give the buffet a try."}
{"text":"Our first time at Persis Indian Grill was a very nice experience.  Our server Joseph was extremely helpful with choices.  He will tell you his name really is Joseph and not a made up name.  The food was very yummy, we will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food!! This place serves delicious authentic Indian. One servers name is Joseph and he told us how his wife and young daughter are in India and he is working to get the money to get them to the U.S. Anyway this place Is really good!"}
{"text":"Quality and taste is degraded. Its no more like before. Never ever order Andhra chicken curry from their menu, that's the worst thing you would have ever had."}
{"text":"Don't even think of eating here. Worst quality Indian food. It's basically a to-go place but doesn't do any justice for what you pay. I've had more than two people say the same. I've ended up having gastric problems all three times I've eaten here. Avoid to save yourself health and money."}
{"text":"Just had the Veg Biryani....it was stale , had to throw the entire thing.

The veg combo option looked better, maybe should have taken that."}
{"text":"I like all about the persis, ..authentic Hyderabad biryani, south Indian food and Nice buffet.

All-in-all one must visit.."}
{"text":"Loved the courteous service. food  was amazing. Felt the real taste of Biryani. 
Had ordered gobi Manchurian and vegetable dum Biryani. Enjoyed both the dishes."}
{"text":"I was out on a date and the young lady I was with said she was craving Indian food so we decided to stop in and check this place out. I couldn't be happier that we found this gem. The food was fantastic; some of the most flavorful food I've ever eaten. On top of the mouth watering deliciousness of their menu selections, the service was top notch! I'll definitely be visiting them when I'm in that area again."}
{"text":"Good service .. buffet food is NO Salt and NO spicy.  I would skip the buffet and try the dinner. Ensure you tell them Indian Spicy or else you would get with NO salt"}
{"text":"Love this place! Incredibly nice staff, amazing food, felt very comforts and have never been disappointed. When they ask you how hot they are not kidding! Love to say hot and actually enjoy the fact it will be hot, so if you don't like it too spicy, don't even ask for a 3. Slow service but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch on a Sunday and they had a buffet going on. The ambience was pretty standard with full wall mirrors on one side, that give you a feeling of depth and size. The place was reasonably crowded and I noticed several folks walk in even as we were having our lunch. The food itself was fairly substandard....the only highlight being the gobi manchurian (which was right on spot) and the yellow dal that was on the buffet. The pani puri seemed totally off (something was totally amiss here); the vegetable biriyani barely hit the mark; the mushroom curry was only namesake - one had to fish for a piece of mushroom in a sea of soya nuggets; the mango lassi that was served on the table wasn't upto it; and then I kept some hopes for the mango mousse that was on the dessert section - only to be let down. The mango mousse turned out to be a much thicker and sweeter version of the mango lassi. Cannot say anything about the non-vegetarian dishes on the buffet, but the veg section was a let down."}
{"text":"Had an urge for some good Indian food - called this place for a takeout - the manager took the time to explain the menu and also made a couple of suggestions - I ended up ordering goat byriani and spinach with cheese -both dishes were amazing. Byriani was fresh and smelled amazing my two kids immediately demanded to try some - goat meat was tender and perfectly cooked. Spinach and cheese was outstanding - perfect consistency and great flavor along with a hint of cumin in it. Overall great restaurant - if you dine In ask for Joseph - great waiter and take out is also convenient"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte on business and found this place by happenstance.  I had an absolutely fantastic dinner.  For all you naysayers of the lunch buffet you are missing out.   Dinner was of excellent quality and explosive flavors having tried chicken Chettinad and lamb Maharaja.  The rosemary naan was addictive.       

I do not claim to be an expert on Indian food but based on the fact the dining room was full of what appeared to be patrons of Indian descent I thought that was a good sign.  We saw many delicious dishes pass our table and asked the other diners what they ordered.  Everyone was friendly and cordial and now I know what I will be ordering next time I come dine here.

Food arrived timely and steaming hot, our waiter continuously checked on us, refilled  beverages, took additional orders, and was very attentive.  

For those critics that put emphasis on decor and ice in their water I think you are misguided and missing the dining experience.   Should you ever venture out of your comfortable neighborhood and travel the world you will be disappointed because its not about the furniture or the ice cubes."}
{"text":"Awesome flavor, but guys u can't have all the chicken curries in the buffet with mainly bones and and no real meat."}
{"text":"Inconsistent and over priced. Sometimes food is ok and sometimes bad. Seems like the chef is changing often. Food is over spiced and there is way too much salt in the food. Eaten at much better indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Charlotte. Stopped in for dinner and had a terrific experience.

Nice atmosphere, great menu, terrific service at very reasonable price.

We had onion pakoda appetizer, chicken tikka and navrathan korma entrees.
Food prepared perfectly and was simply delicious.

Service attentive but not over bearing.

Prices very reasonable. Good beer and wine selection

All in all, a great experience and will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"Persis  in ballantyne no consistency everytime food tastes different and all hygiene lovers they store food containers in restrroms. Service is below par but I could live with that if food quality is better which is not at all. If its your you will get good food or else it would suck. I would try something else if I want good food for sure."}
{"text":"We had noticed this place several times driving by, and we had read all of the positive reviews, so last night we finally decided to give it a try.

All we can say, is \"wow!\". They make a nice atmosphere, and the service is very friendly and attentive. Our server made some very good suggestions about what to order.

The food was simply amazing.  Very fresh, very nice spice, and so wonderfully seasoned. Very flavorful and great texture. We had the paneer tikka, idly, hakka noodles, daal tad aka, navrathan korma, and three different kinds of bread: butter naan, roti, and onion kulcha. All of it perfect - the best I have ever tried outside of India itself.

We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Never go here for dinner. My family went here for dinner and it took them 45 minutes to bring our food while the people around us who came much later were instantly served. The staff quality was bad too. The waiter  dropped my food and spilled my water on me and all I got  was a sarcastic sounding sorry. The food was alright but Passage to India closeby is much better in terms of customer service and quality.I will never eat at Persis again."}
{"text":"I had a buffet lunch here on a weekend and it was really good.Being a non vegetarian ,i had all the options from mutton curry to chicken biryani etc.
The gulab jamuns were exceptional ,liked them a lot .
Wha i did not like there was the pan which was sold at the counter ,somehow it was a little bitter in taste."}
{"text":"Just had a FABULOUS Indian feast!
The lunch buffet is nothing short of delicious! Known for their biryani dish
The veggie and chicken served is spiced perfectly with just the right amount of kick. The tiki masala is rich and creamy and the curry dishes are delicious!
Highly recommend for those who love Indian food! Yummy
Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant and as it is my favorite food at this present time, l have tried all Indian restaurants in Charlotte and surrounding areas. We have around 5-6 Indian restaurants in the university area where l live. To me this is the best. Right now l have 6 restaurants close to me and 4 of them are on my street!! Lucky me!!! I always eat the buffet because l love trying all the interesting dishes. Many Indians eat here too!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the goat curry.My wife had the chicken tikka masala and she loved it.Ohh my mama,excellent food !Plus the chai( tea) that was superb . I'm from East Africa and that was close to home .Why fly home when I can dine here.
I almost went to the kitchen to clap for the chef and pop his collar..
Only thing I didn't like which is not a big deal, I wish our waiter greeted us.But she was good overall, thereafter. After all we went to eat and they fed us well."}
{"text":"This place really disappointed me today.. i love there food and specially went to have der biryani..ordered the food at 9:30.. in few mins they say rice is over..then i madeup my mind to noodles..what pissed me off was they didt even had noodles..we jus left the place without have any food..by this time we were left with very few options outside..not happy at all"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian cuisine we've had in the Charlotte area. The Daal Bukhara is rich and satisfying with lovely heat. The Aloo Gobhi, also vegetarian, had subtle flavors and a great balance of heat and texture. We had a very helpful and attentive server, Nick, as was the rest of the staff. Highly recommend! Please join us in keeping this northland gem busy!"}
{"text":"looking for a place to go on Monday night when our normal place was closed we found this gem.  the staff is very attentive and made some wonderful recommendations.  they even catered to us due to some food allergies, going so far to check in the kitchen and even bring out some ingredients to verify that they would meet our needs.  then there was the food! some of the best Indian food we've had in the Charlotte area.  we are already planning another trip with friends.  The best Indian restaurant in the university area."}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani or bone biryani?
Biryani rice mixed with white rice along with couple of chicken bones for $10.71 . Avoid. Attaching a photo as well"}
{"text":"Some dishes like paneer kadai and dal fry are so bad and these are too regular dishes.  Seriously they need a good chef !"}
{"text":"Really good!  Introduced to Indian food in Austin and I've been looking for a good place in Charlotte for a while. This is it!"}
{"text":"In the top 3 BEST Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever had! Very robust and rich flavor. Check out this place, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Best value! Chicken biryani and chicken tikka masala with naan and a drink all for less than what I pay for one dish at other Indian restaurants. Food was delicious and better than many of the Indian restaurants around town. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"taste rivals my favorite place Passage to India (University). Persis is a little more expensive BUT you do get more food for the money so it is definitely worth it.

Buffet is a little overpriced compared to most places. it is very good tho but a buffet for 30+ dollars is kind of ridiculous and won't go back for this."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Loved the Cauliflower appetizer! Definitely becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it's the worst Indian restaurant I've ever tasted. Greesy food and the goat biryani was bone & fat biryani. The side orders were not good either. Definitely do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food we've had in the US.  Authentic Indian food,  it's not Americanized. This is the real deal and delicious! Wish we lived in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"As it goes for Indian fare this is frankly one of the best I've had. This more than rivals the amazing Indian food I had in London; a gastronomic hotspot of Indian cuisine.  The flavors and spices are quite fantastic and satisfying. The okra and eggplant are so yummy! Best comfort food ever. Don't forget the Naan."}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly staff. We are coming here for last 2 years and every time has great dining experience. Best Indian food in town."}
{"text":"Finally a Biriyani place for Charlotte ! 
We had Chilli Chicken and Chicken Biriyani, both were mind blowing ! This is easily the best biriyani you can get in Charlotte ! Biriyani portion was huge, well worth the $12 ish price.

The ambience is mundane, nothing special but does the job.Service staff are friendly but slow.  We got our food 25 minutes after we placed the order. But all these peeves vanish once you get the food ! Absolutely delicious !

Since they opened up recently on July 7th, they only have limited menu titled \"Grand-Opening Menu\". But that includes most of the famous/routine items. 

Will I go back again ? Hell Yeah !

NOTE: Their spice levels range from 1-6. The starters were pretty spicy with level 4 for me (I'm an Indian who can tolerate a decent amount of spice) . The biriyani was prefect with level 4 spice though !

UPDATE: 7/9/2013

After multiple visits, I have noticed that food tastes better in a la carte when compared to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Beware of this place! My boyfriend and I had the intention of only ordering one dish for the both of us to share. When I asked for a recommendation the guy instantly said that he was going to get us one curry chicken dish and one spinach dish. We didn't even have time to look it over! He went straight to the back. Then he came back with a shrimp appetizer that we didn't even ask for and a beer that was the most expensive one on the menu, which we didn't ask for either. After we ate our food our bill came up to be $61!!! We realized that he ordered the most expensive dishes on the menu!!! The server didn't speak English very well so we couldn't explain anything to him but after he ran our card our receipt went up to $77!! He gave himself a tip!! My boyfriend and I were so angry, but their was nothing we could do. The food was amazing but I will never be returning to this location again. We got completely ripped off."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food in the area my wife and I have eaten at numerous Indian restaurants around the country and Persis is definitely worth the price of admission. The other restaurants In the area are ok but Persis is definitely better overall and the service and ambience are very friendly and welcoming. We had the buffet today and it was phenomenal there was plenty to choose from and everything tastes delicious and are authentic. Try it out you will be pleased you did."}
{"text":"So you want some good food huh?  Your in Charlotte at lunchtime and wondering where the best place you could fill your belly and enjoy the heck out of your food.  Well look no further than here.  The lunchtime buffet is worth every penny and then some.  The food is authentic (well as authentic as a person that travels a bunch and actually has some comparison to base this on can be).  From the goat curry, to the chi tea (handmade, not from a box). Everything is wonderful.  If they have it on the day you are here the egg curry or the mushroom curry will make you go weak in the knees.  So get up, get out and get there!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. It was a little too spicy for some in my party but that is the chance you take with Indian food. I loved it and you can bet I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best casual Indian restraunt that I have found in the North Charlotte area.  Since I introduced my boyfriend to the incredible south Asian fare that is Indian a few years ago, we have become regulars at the lunch buffets in our area.  Persi's instantly became a hit from the first time we tried it in early December, soon after they opened.

The presentation of the food is absolutely gorgeous, with raw onions and fresh lime as an accompaniment choice and at least six different sauces to choose from - the cilantro sauce is my favorite, pureed to perfection and extremely fresh.  The Butter Chicken is a hit with everyone who I have taken there, but my favorite entree is the Paneer Saagwala.  The taste is exquisite with the homemade cream based sauce and tons of spinach throughout.  I cannot get enough of it, especially when they have it featured in the lunch buffet.  

The Naan is baked to perfection as well.  Slightly crunchy on the bottom where it sat on a stone but fluffy and dense on the top - its the best tool to soak up the rest of the rich sauces from the entrees or use it as a spoon to scoop up your meal.  

The grand finale for me is always the dessert.  With the lunch buffet, there is a different option daily.  The mango pudding is a delicious way to end, with a mouse-like consistency and a creamy taste that isn't overwhelmingly sweet.  The Shahi Tukra, a very rare treat to find, is absolutely to die for.  Bread soaked in regular and condensed milk with almonds and cardamom.. I don't eat bread very often, but this is definitely a time that I will splurge.

Prepare to go home fully stuffed and comforted after your meal.  The servers are always very attentive and the owner remembers us when we come in, making me feel welcome.  There's no better way to spend lunch - or if you are like my boyfriend and I who eat breakfast at 11:30, no better way to start your day."}
{"text":"Joseph was great! Very welcoming and the food is amazing. Great atmosphere!! I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but I'd prefer it to be a bit more spicy. The reason for the 1 star review is because they charge a mandatory gratuity when you have 5 or more people.  The wait staff will fail to mention this until the check comes. I've never seen a restaurant charge a mandatory tip for as little as 5 people.... especially at buffet where you do most of the work yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Top notch Indian cuisine in a very comfortable and hospitable environment.  Staff was very friendly and quick to make suggestions that appeared both on and off the menu.  I have dined in many different Indian restaurants in different cities and countries, and this place is among the best."}
{"text":"I took the best tips from those written and we also had Bhim the Mgr validate them. Food was great. We had Shrimp Biryani, Gobi 65, Chicken Kohrma and Kingfishers. Heat:3 Spicy enough to perspire but not too hot for us non-Indians. Overall: fantastic!"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting Persis Indian Grill in Ballantyne can be summarized in three phases: delicious food, excellent service and a friendly family atmosphere. Our server, Murugan, even brought our daughter a complimentary mango drink since she was the only one unable to order alcohol. We started off with the Gobi Manchurian appetizer (super tasty) and also ordered Lamb Chops Tandoori, Eggplant Chettinadu and Tikka Masala to share around the table. It was so tasty that two days later we are still eating the leftovers!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! We called in and placed an order for takeout. When we went to pick the order the guys shamelessly told us that they are OUT. How do you accept an order and then be out??? Very unprofessional staff. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant until I got there. The service was not great at all, the waiter was trying to being a smart ass. The food quality is alright. There samosa chatt and gobi Manchurian is great but when it comes to the main meal it was whole different story. The paneer tikka masla barely had taste and there naans seemed frozen."}
{"text":"The take away can be slow but the food is excellent non the less. Best Indian restaurant in north Charlotte"}
{"text":"This was my first Indian cuisine meal.   The food was full of flavor and a great variety on the buffet at lunch.   Will go back!"}
{"text":"Worst experience in food quality and taste!!
Ordered many items. .none tasted good and non tasted like the actual dish name suggests.."}
{"text":"O my dear god, where should I start, the service was disaster , food quality zero, dinning experience zero, the staff does not have anyyyyyyyyy knowledge, one star is a lot for that place, never ever again."}
{"text":"First of all they should really improve in their service . We ordered chicken lolly pop and tomato bisque. Lolly pop came around 15 minutes but that's ok since the taste was good and worth the wait. After so many enquires with the waiter we got the tomato bisque after 30 minutes which was not at all acceptable. When we asked why it is taking so long ? The waiter replied it's take time . Ufff... We didn't order the main course we left unhappy that day. But I have tasted 555 chicken before and it's pretty good . Don't bother to order vegetarian appetizers . Seriously, they don't know to make it . Briyani is good but you can get better briyanis in and around Charlotte. Hope they improve their service."}
{"text":"Food is Authentic!! I am so excited to finally have reasonable and delicious indian food in Charlotte. This place reminds of the kind of food I had in NY."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet for Indian, one of the better choices since they have variety in dishes and not the more traditional sides that you would normally see at other buffets. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the price point. The going rate on a buffet has been 6.99-9.99 on weekends. This restaurants has a rate hike on Friday and another for Saturday and Sunday. The problem is they have not posted their prices anywhere. So knowing that Indian restaurants have different prices on the weekend I went on Monday and again on Friday (yes, its that delicious) to be caught off guard with the changes in price. To plan for a great customer experience, please post your buffet fee in your restaurant. This is the second time I have encountered this with the local Indian restaurants in this area.
Pros-great food, good service
Cons-I can't see how they justify hiking the price on Fridays with virtually no difference in the offering. I know its just a buck but still I am not sure its a 9.99 buffet to begin with."}
{"text":"My wife and a friend visited for the first time last night for dinner. Service was quick, courteous, and helpful as we asked about dishes that were not spicy, to those that were highly so (wife vs husband!). Had apps and three entrees. All agreed all were excellent (especially butter chicken and meshi [?] chicken, both non-spicy). Atmosphere is pretty basic, but restaurant is clean and obviously popular with the local Indian crowd - always a good sign!  I felt the menu offered many items not typically seen in Indian restaurants, which was nice. Lots of vegetarian dishes also. Highly recommended; we'll be back soon. (PS - they have lunch buffet every day, which we haven't tried, but do feel the price is quite high, compared to other Indian lunch buffets around the city)."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and drove about 40 miles to check out their biryani. It was pretty good and the veggie appetizers were pretty good as well. The service could have been a lot better, but the food more than made up for it. Went back a second time for their weekend lunch buffet and it was not worth the 40 min drive and 30 min wait. They barely had any appetizers and just biryani (veg and chicken). Definitely worth a try for the dinner ala carte but weekend lunch buffet was not worth it. Service hasn't changed much since my last visit either hence the 3 star instead of 4.

Updated:

Revisited a couple of times for dinner and the chicken biryani and paneer tikka(tandoor paneer something like that) are worth every visit. Could be upgraded to 4 star, but I will wait till they improve the service. Do stay away from the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Being from India, we eat Indian food several times a week both at home and outside the house.  Persi's has a great reputation and they didnt let down on our visit. Good food for a lunch buffet overall.  The selection is not big but it was all pretty good.  My favorite was the chicken tikka masala with white rice.  The chicken biryani was also good but it was a bit on the spicy side.  Intense flavors are good but the heat was a bit overbearing.  The desserts lacked as they only had gulab jumun and fresh fruit.  It was good but I was left wanting something more."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian option in South Charlotte in its price range. Frequent this place quite often - the food is clearly the highlight. Everything else is passable. Do try out the Bhindi-do-pyaza (Okra cooked with Onions), the Mushroom Pepper Salt and the garlic naan. 

The best time to go is for Dinner. Lunchtime is usually packed for the buffet - which I found wasn't really worth the price or the hype. The A la carte is way better!"}
{"text":"The Applebee's of Indian food.  It's nothing special...but...it's not horrible.  It just is.

I've only been here for lunch and while I do get that they have to prepare for the buffet style eating of the lunch crowd, I'm still going to judge the food for what it was...\"Buffet food.\"

The naan was nothing special and I can typically tell if I'm going to like an Indian place based on the naan alone.  What I love:  Pillowy, soft, chewy naan.  What I received: flat bread.

The rest of the food:

The chicken tikka masala (which I've been told isn't really an Indian dish...but who cares...it tastes good) was what I expected to be in a buffet tray.  It was okay...but I'm not exactly directing people here to get it.

The Aloo Gobi type dish however, was pretty tasty.  Great job Persis!

The rest of the dishes were good.  I would prefer trying this place again without the buffet style eating.

I love Indian food and Persis is convenient to get to from my office.  I'll come back and give an update."}
{"text":"Worst biryani ever ..ordered for a chicken biryani and got biryani rice mixed with chicken manchuria, no proper meat ..probably if  they think they can fool customers this way they should be ashamed for earning money out of this ."}
{"text":"Biryani was tasteless  there was no salt at all very greecey . Meat was not cooked u have to improve ur quality"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant  twice after reading the reviews but all of them
Are total lies  .. Once for lunch buffet and once for dinner .. Neither of them satisfied me . Buffet has very limited items and is just avg.. Dinner is the worst one I have in USA. I ordered a chicken 555 and a chicken boneless byani..  Chicken 555, I did not even touch a second piece after tasting. First one .. And have no words to say about byani.."}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent in flavor. The naan bread had dry shaker garlic on it (YUCK) the dish I got did in no way tasted the same as the last time. The water carafe was dirty too. The service is severely lacking. I waited 45 minutes for a refill on my soda and never got one! It took 1 1/2 hours to eat dinner. I think they were doing a event along with takeout and dine in customers, they just could not handle it! Food was going to the wrong tables and other people were visibly pissed off. I'm not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and authentic! I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants over the years and Persis is by far the best indian food I've ever had. Some of my favorites are the chili paneer, samosas, garlic naan (soooo yummy!), chicken Tikka masala, and their beer is cold and perfect. We just left there tonight with our tummies full and I am already looking forward to the next visit!!"}
{"text":"It was really salty food and waiting time was more than 45 minutes?. There was no customer service at all.  No water service, and they didn't bother to ask how was the food. It wasn't pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Rude staff!!! Checked in to give a party order,.. Got a rude reply.. Will never be back nor will recommend my friends.."}
{"text":"Great restaurant at Ballantyne ... Great food ... Reasonable price... If you go there ask for Mohan . Great and welcoming waiter.. I really enjoyed food and service.."}
{"text":"The food is really good, the head server is rude and the service is slow"}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Persis but unfortunately was unable to try the food.  I was seated quickly but that was the end of human contact.  After waiting almost 15 minutes I left and went over to Blue Taj which is always excellent.  It was a Monday night and not really very busy.  I think there was just one waiter who also seemed to be handling all of the take out orders.  I plan to go back and try it again since the food has been rated so well.  I hope things are better next time."}
{"text":"Very tasty tandoori chicken and biryani rice.  The hot tea was refreshing.  Good prices for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time over the weekend. On Fri/Sat/Sun, the buffet was the only option. The food on the buffet was not very good. The Chicken Tikka Masala had no flavor, while the Chicken Biryani had plenty of flavor, it just wasn't a flavor that I liked. They had Mango Lassi drinks in glasses by the buffet, but the drink was warm, which is never good in a Mango Lassi. The 87.5 sanitation rating also threw me off.

The restaurant is in a nice spot. I was actually hoping for a more casual style Indian restaurant, since this seems to be a chain, but it's a traditional sit down restaurant. Bim (sp?), formerly of Blue Taj, was running the restaurant the day I visited.

I don't know if the dishes would suffer so much individually if ordered off the menu. I have noticed that the Chicken Tikka Masala on a buffet always seems worse than a fresh version of the dish. I just know that I was not impressed at all by the quality of what was on the buffet. I hope they do well, but I will probably not return for the buffet, and I'll definitely wait for that sanitation score to go up before I return again."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken tandoori and the chicken tikka masala. Butter naan of course. The service was excellent, Joseph was a star waiter, and overall an excellent dining experience. Good portions, good prices."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in Charlotte.   I've tried locations that are in South Charlotte and Uptown.   Persis is my go to location now."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet.   Nice variety good flavor and fresh.  The staff is very polite too.  We enjoy our lunches here."}
{"text":"This Joseph who served food for us is cool .. We ordered rasa malai , but they ran out of it and he served us fresh gulab jamun  .. It was complimentary .. It was yummy !!"}
{"text":"We have now been two times and both times, the food and service were fantastic. Naan is fresh, flavors in the food are also fresh and delicious and Joseph does a great job of recommending some items that he thinks we will enjoy. He has been spot on. 

Butter chicken, samosas, chicken tikka, methi chicken, goat dishes and the appetizer sampler are all excellent and we look forward to trying the rest!

The atmosphere is cozy and it is the type of place where you do not feel rushed. Thursdays have great deals including half priced bottles of wine and discounted dinners. Have not tried the buffet, but will be regulars for a la carte dining. Glad to have found Persis!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service and worst food .. try some other Indian restaurants. 

If there was a zero rating, I would have given that"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was poor.  We waited for our order to be taken.  We ordered a glass of wine and it was forgotten.  Nobody checked to see how we e are doing.  We waited a long time for our check.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is actually incredible.  I haven't explored Indian food much in Charlotte, but this tops everything I've had in Greenville, where I've lived the past four years.  That's a huge complement because I like the Indian food in Greenville.  Great lunch buffet and service.   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Uh oh, this one is on the struggle bus.  I didn't check Yelp, but rather, just stumbled upon it while looking around downtown Charlotte for a quick lunch.   I walked in and a man behind the counter gave me a spooky stare, which persisted the entire time I was looking at the menu/dishes (not sure what that was about).  I asked him if he had any vegetarian options (couldn't really tell from the menu), to which he replied: \"you should try goat\".  Nope, but how about the vegetarian biryani?  He said, oh yes, we have.   I got it and it was funky monkey, sort of like rice-a-roni with some poorly fried veggie things hidden in the luke warm center.  I was ridiculously hungry so I still ate about half of it; maybe I should have gone with the goat?"}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. The buffet was missing at least 2-3 things at any given time. We found a used lollipop at our table when we sat down. The food is lacking and there's a weird aftertaste to everything. The sambar was good though. 

The tandoori chicken was gone for 20 minutes and they kept saying they'd bring it out in 10 minutes. We ended up forgoing it in the end. 

Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at the Ballantyne Persis. When they opened one in the university area, we were super excited. The initial few weeks were met with over flowing crowds and exceptional food and we were frequent visitors. Over the course of few months, the quality of food came down and their service deteriorated to abysmal levels. The crowds dried down too understandably. A few weeks ago on a Wednesday we dropped in at 9.10 PM (They close at 9.30 weekdays) and were very hungry. Even though several tables were empty, we were asked to wait. We waited for about 15 mins without being seated. After calling out for attention, one of the waiters informed us that they cannot seat us since they are about to close and can only serve take-out from a limited menu. I walked out in a fit of rage vowing to never go back there. This place deserved only 1 star for their customer service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service could have been better. Didn't receive menus until after sitting down for 15 minutes. Second appetizer didn't come until after we were mid way through our main course. Having said all that, food was great enough to earn 4 stars overall. Biryani was especially good. Even Paneer Saag and Karhai paneer were perfectly cooked and spiced. We did ask for everything mild though.

Would definitely recommend this to others. Great new find!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we went for dinner with friends and ordered chicken chettinad, goat biryani, chicken lollypop and dosa everything lacked flavor. 
Chicken lollypops were not seasoned at all but coated with cornflour (red edible color) and fried. All I could taste was the stale oil.
The biryani felt overdose of red chilli powder, meat was tough , overcooked. 
The curry was not authentic . 
Dosa was still okay. (Only thing we could eat. )"}
{"text":"A group of us from work had lunch here today for the first time.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.  Because it was lunch it was buffet style (I hear dinner is sit down affair so I may be back to try that).  The plates reminded me of camping, they are all tin/silver , even the cups and small dishes.  I tried just about everything and all was excellent, my favorites was the butter cheese (paneer) and also the fried cauliflower.  I was too scared to try the goat though.

The main reasons I knocked a star off was because the selection was a little bit light, both Aroma and Tulips (the two other places we frequent in the area have larger selections).  Also, the Naan was burnt but that could have just been that batch.

I will most certainly be back for another visit."}
{"text":"After visiting Persis Biryani in the south side...the best thing that happened for me as a foodie.....is to come to Persis Biryani on the north side.  It is the best Indian buffet I have ever had.  And yes.....I have been too too many to count.  Whether with a party of 1 or party or party of many...we are always greeted and welcomed to the restaurant by Ashwin or one of the great staff.  Timing is essential for weekend or weekday lunch.  Get there at the right time and you can get right into the buffet.  Everything is always presented so well.  From the sauces to the fruits to the biryanis....the rusam....the sambhar....the naan...the masala....the curries....everything is simply so so so good!  You have to be careful though....the food is so great...you can lose count of the number of plates you have eaten!!!  You have to save room for gulab jaman or rice pudding or the halwa!!!   All deserts to round off a perfect filling lunch buffet.  I look forward to my weekly visits either from home on the weekend...or from downtown Charlotte during the week.  Persis Biryani North has become the number one restaurant for our event celebrations....from birthdays...to showers!!!!!!   Looking forward to next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"I was sitting here at work and kept hearing so many great things about Persis.  And finally got an opportunity to go with family and good friend.  The buffet was very good. Loved the pani puri and fruit custard.   Persis is known for great biryani.  They lived up to reputation.  Looking forward to return visit."}
{"text":"One of my top favorite Indian restaurants is now open within a few steps of the office at Gateway Village.  Providing some of the best biryani available in downtown.  No more ordering and waiting on the delivery van.  Stopped in today and had tea and observed the great offerings we have come to expect from Persis,  The restaurant offers great seating.  Great open area for walking through the ordering line.  Since it is not a full self service buffet I am providing the best rating,  Looking forward to the next team lunch outing this week at Persis,"}
{"text":"I like this place but totally dissappointed the last time I ordered a biryani to-go.
I asked for spicy and they just mixed up raw green chilli paste in the biryani. It was a larger order and had to throw away most of it.

Dear Persis.. Spicy means more masala not adding raw chillies or its paste to the Biryani."}
{"text":"Never had Indian food before so for my first time  I was definitely blown away. This review is primarily on the lunch buffet and man was it filling. Lots of variety of veggie and meat options, tons of spice and complex flavors. Luckily I had my lady with me and she is a wizard when it comes to food knowledge and suggestions cause otherwise I would have grabbed whatever and hoped for the best. 

The service here is great. They are quick to seat you and get you fed. The man at the counter is super nice and is very appreciative of your business.

The buffet has so many options and is always fresh. I've been three times now since my first experience and every time the chicken is tender and flavorful, the garlic naan is great, and the dishes are warm and constantly refilled throughout the day. Appetizers, salad, plenty of entrees, and even a dessert option. One Saturday a few weeks ago we visited for the dinner buffet and man they had some killer cantaloupe juice. Yum city! This is my new favorite restaurant if I'm ever in the university are and I'm thankful for my overwhelming great experience I've had here. I'm a huge fan of Indian food now, especially the tasty variety Persis has to offer. This is a must visit place!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and been here a few times before. 1st time was great and i kept returning to capture that great taste again. This time not so much. Arrived at 11:30am for the buffet lunch to find the chili crispy chicken was cold and mushy. The other chicken dishes were only luke warm.  

I immediately let the owner know. He quickly removed the very full pan of chicken. He returned 5 minutes later with another pan with just a little bit in there. I assumed he just wanted to get some fresh fried chilli chicken out asap. No! Same chicken!


I go to pay at the register and question him about it and I told him not is only morally,  ethically  and inconsiderate of his customers, but I believe it's a health code violation. He said it's fine to reheat because it was cooked once already! I can't believe this is how this guy runs his restaurant.

Be prepared to eat reheated food if you come here. Absolutely disgusting! I truly believe because my first visit was so good and all other visits mediocre that they have been recycling this food for the next day or so. 

I will never eat here again!  The 5 star below mine is an employee who works there! Now this guy is posting bogus reviews."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly, this is one of the best Indian Restaurants in Charlotte. The lunch buffet has been consistently good. The chicken tikka masala is really tasty, especially when drenched over the plain basmati rice. Every time that I have been back, there seems to be at least one Chef Specialty dish. On my last visit is was a Himalayan Spiced Fried Chicken. Little tasty chunks of chicken that really satisfied. The Sambar (indian soup) was really tasty as well. Pleasant staff that can sometimes be inattentive when the restaurant is very busy. But I've only been during busy buffet hours. The Bollywood TV shows that are generally on can be a little loud at times.
If you like Indian food, this is definitely worth trying. Great food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"One of the worst. I know Charlotte lacks good quality and standard Indian restaurants but still there are few better than this. Agree with another review about server being pushy. Worst malai kofta ever tried. Only thing that was better was gobi manchurian. Service is poor. Bland food."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, absolutely lousy service.  Best I've had in Charlotte, and most dishes are on par with the Indian food that I grew up eating in Central NJ.  Don't go during lunch - that's when most Indian places have their bland, americanized options out.  Their Indian dishes (especially when ordered Medium to Hot) are authentic.

That being said, the service has been horrendous every time I've been there.  This last time, we were seated by the hostess fairly quickly, and within 2 minutes the waiter came over asking if we were ready.  We said no, so he came back about 5 minutes later.  We went with a Biryani (Chicken 65 Biryani), and the waiter's recommendation for a special when we said we wanted goat.  Ordered Naan, but the waiter was extremely pushy trying to upsell other breads, as well.  Once ordered, it took just over 30 minutes to get the food out - 2 dishes & naan.  And since we ordered around 7PM, the place was practically empty (but filled up around 8PM) so we should have only been behind 2 other tables of 2.  The food was dropped off by another waiter - the naan was cold, but nobody came by to check on us during the entire meal.  Trying to flag someone down at the end for the bill and a to-go box took a few minutes, and after requesting the bill, the waiter forgot about us.  Had to wait another 5 minutes to flag down another waiter (who acted shocked that we flagged him down when he wasn't working our table) to ask him for the bill and to-go box we had already asked for.

Extremely similar service to previous experiences - slow to get food out, no check-ins from waiters (can't order more naan if we wanted!), slow to get the bill, slow once we gave them the credit card.

On a lesser-reviewed note, they've recently had lousy health inspection scores - their 10/6 inspection was an 83, and 10/20 was an 86.  You'd think that after an abysmal score, they'd rebound a bit more (in July they scored a 94.5).  I'm trying to get my stomach ready for traveling to India, though, so I looked at this as a twisted positive...

Overall, great food, but there is no sense of urgency or customer service among most of the staff, perhaps with the hostess as the exception.  Maybe I'll order take-out in the future to get the food without having to deal with the lackadaisical attitude of the staff & lots of unnecessary waiting."}
{"text":"Unethical place. Ordered shrimp biriyani for take out and they mixed chicken with it and my wife doesn't eat chicken. And they have mixed it before also. When I called them about it they acted innocent. Cheats. Out of 3 times, they screwed up the spice level two times. Being honest is the first rule to run a restaurant, and these people are not"}
{"text":"I've had a few disappointments recently at Persis, but overall the food is still my favorite Indian in the University area. 

if you are looking for something spicy, try the Gobi 65 appetizer. It's harsh and spicy but amazing! Unfortunately, the last time the Gobi was not crispy even though we ordered it extra extra crispy. When brought to the server's attention, he argued at first until we asked him to take it back to the kitchen. He returned shortly thereafter only to tell us that the kitchen said it was perfectly done. Since I've been to Persis and ordered this exact dish many times and it's always been crispy, I'm going to overlook it. But it was not a pleasant experience and made me reluctant to go back for a while. To be fair, the waiter later told us that the main chef was off that night, so I assume the Gobi got tossed in the sauce and left to get soggy for a few minutes. Timing is key on this dish. 

We've also recently tried the Chicken Tikka appetizer, and it was great.  It's served on a cast iron skillet with cabbage, onions and extra sauce in the bottom so no bite is without flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Love this place.  My girlfriend didn't tell me about this place for the longest time!!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem!! Food is fresh and delicious!!! They're not afraid to get things spicy. Service could be better. I go at least once a week though!"}
{"text":"The chicken Tikka masala is a little too runny. The waiters do not ask you for your drink and you have to ask them. They do give you water. The tandoori chicken is okay too."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here through Door Dash twice. The food was very high quality. We got the Chicken Tikki Masala, Shrimp Vindaloo, Garlic Naan and an appetizer. The food was spicy but we LOVE spicy food! The food was also hot when it arrived. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just back from their lunch buffet and it was the worst I have ever had at Persis. The food was cold and did not look appealing at all. The taste was not very impressive either. No much variety to experiment.

Usually a fan of their biryani, I did not like it much today. The 'Meethe ka Tukra' was horrible.

Hope it was just one of those bad days and they pull up their socks soon."}
{"text":"We have been to Persis several times and have never been disappointed. The wait staff is very helpful and attentive, particularly Joseph. Our favorite is Methi Chicken, borders on being addictive! Our last visit included the Tandoori Lamb appetizer, marinated in yogurt and spices, so tasty and tender, arrives at your table on a sizzling platter with grilled onions, peppers....YUM!! Also tried the Hayward 5000 beer, mild flavor, very good. They are also very helpful concerning menu selections regarding wheat allergy. Looking forward to our next meal at Persis!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here a lot and the food was amazing. Sometime within the last year they changed their chef and the food has significantly gone down hill! At one point their waiter was making food! Their food is inconsistently terrible-- sometimes it is really greasy, sometimes unbearably salty, and sometimes it is just not at all what you ordered! You never know what you are going to get, but it is never good. After giving this restaurant a second, third, and fourth chance to redeem themselves, we stopped coming all together. We will never go back! Poor move on Persis' part for firing their top-notch chef last year. If you want good Indian food, try Passage to India on University City Blvd instead. The only positive thing I can say about Persis is that we enjoyed their Indian music videos that played on their TV."}
{"text":"Service needs to improve. Food is generally good, however. If you can look past the hit-or-miss service, then you'll like this place. Otherwise, you're gambling for a good experience :)"}
{"text":"Just back from their busy saturday lunch buffet.
Food was exceptional ! 

From appetizers to curries to deserts, everything was on point, neatly refilled and hot and spicy.
We were quickly seated and offered drinks and the used plates were removed time to time from the table.

Though it was quite busy and noisy , it didnt stop us from enjoying the food because it was that good.

I couldnt stop admiring how delicious DUM KA LAMB was, i had to refill the curry 2-3 times. Every non veg item was perfection.

You could tell i am writing this review from the food coma this place gave me."}
{"text":"Good buffet. Pleasant customer service.  Was crowded which is a good sign. I would definitely add this to my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place sooo much. I've been trying to try as many Indian restaurants in Charlotte as possible but I feel none ever surpass Persis Biryani Grill in quality. Everything is always incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly. My all-time favorite meal wherever I go is goat curry, but I always feel Persis does it best (don't tell my uncle who's won awards for his recipe)."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for byriani so we decided to give this place a shot. When we got there we realized we had been there several years ago and was not impressed
As long as we were there we decided to give them another shot
We ordered , staring off with vegetable pakora. \" sorry we don't have that \" really??
They ran out of veggies at 6:15 on a Saturday night
We the placed our order for chicken byriani and lamb saag
Both pretty tasty
Because it was pretty chilly there we asked for hot tea
Sorry , no hot tea. Chex us too busy
Wait service slow
Gotta find another place"}
{"text":"We went to Persis for the first time last night and the food was amazing. I had the Navrathan Korma and would 100% get it again. My husband was also really pleased with his dish. We have only eaten Indian previously at higher end restaurants--Blue Taj and Copper and we both thought the food was just as good at Persis as the more upscale spots."}
{"text":"Updated:

Buffet is only good when staff is organized and not flustered with how busy it may get or what food needs to be replaced. A lot of times I've found myself waiting for food and very little is brought out to replace what is out. Sometimes the staff doesn't notice right away when something is gone so be sure to help them out and let them know. I recommend the chicken tikka masala with white rice and naan bread. They have a good variety.

Dinner time is a better experience since you get more one on one interaction. Larger groups are treated even better and may receive a complimentary dish as an appetizer. Same if you are a regular. They pay attention and take note of what you like. If you have someone struggling to take the heat they may also bring out a complimentary drink to help. It is a very nice and tasty place."}
{"text":"Just tried again....food has AGAIN gotten worse.  What is worse than a place with bad food is one where the food consistently changes!!! Today the tamarind was greenish, bland and didn't have the same flavor every tamarind i have ever had has.  

Naan wasn't out for most of my 30 minutes there either ...this is an indian buffett...it wasnt even busy, where the hell is the naan?!?!!?!?"}
{"text":"We finally caught up with Denise and Chad the other night for socializing outside of a Yelp event. :-)  After stopping into to Duckworth's for a bevvy, we went to Persis for dinner. (Good call Chad!!) I must admit, I was a little unsure of how we would like it because the reviews on Yelp were a bit mixed.  However, I was impressed with our overall experience.  Even though the restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived, we were seated immediately.  

Our service started out a little slow because our waiter was brand-new and did not know the menu.  We had questions, and he had to go get the manager (or owner) to help us.  I did not catch the name of the  manager/owner but he was so helpful and patient with our questions.  He also told us detailed information about some of the dishes and explained some of the differences about the various regional cooking styles & history about how some of the dishes were developed. 

Everyone was hungry, so we decided to start with a couple of appetizers. We also ordered off the menu for our entrees - which was good because I am not a big fan of buffets. 

Samosa - Crispy pastry turnover, filled with potatoes, peas, spices and herbs Served with chutney-  5 stars.  This was one of the most delicious samosas I have eaten.  The inside was flavorful and the crispy pastry was perfectly cooked.  

Gobi 65 - Cauliflower marinated in Corn flour batter & spices, deep fried and tossed with yogurt and spices - 5 stars. Wow, I would have never ordered this if it had not been for the recommendation of the manager/owner.   But it was really delicious!

Naan -  4.5 stars.  The naan was very fresh and tasty. 

Chicken Tikka Masala - Cubes of chicken roasted in a tandoor clay oven cooked with mildly spiced tomato gravy and served with basmati rice -  3.5 stars.  While the dish was flavorful, it was not the very best Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever eaten.  I got a 3 out of 6 on the spicy scale and thought the spiciness was just about right. 

Chicken Khorma - Pieces of chicken cooked in mildly spiced cream sauce with fresh cilantro (coriander) - 4.5 stars. 

Unfortunately, we didn't save room for dessert on this visit but they have some good selections on the menu.

I thought the prices were very reasonable ($67 for 4 entrees, 2 appetizers, 2 orders of Naan, one coke, and one glass of Prosecco)  and the quality of the food was good.  I noticed that the majority of the other patrons during our visit were Indian, which I thought was a good sign."}
{"text":"Got the non-veg plate -- includes one curry, rice, and naan. The chicken was good and plentiful (unlike some other local Indian places), but not very tender, so I think they grill it separately and just toss it in the sauce. Sauce was spicy! In a good way. Rice was fluffy. Naan was tasty but soggy. Portion size was good. Price was a wee bit too high, and selection varies by day."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in charlotte by far. The food is authentic and flavorful. The service is very attentive and helpful in explaining everything. You have got to try this place if you appreciate the flavors of India."}
{"text":"Somedays I'm just craving Indian food and I don't want the buffet. I found Persis when I was in such a mood while in South Charlotte. Yes, they offer the buffet and it seems that's their bread butter for the numerous office employees in the area. However do not ignore their menu.

After a hiccup when I arrived after they had closed after lunch, I came in already knowing what I wanted. As it was late lunch, I was starving so I started with samosas and fresh mango juice. it's such a pleasure to have fresh juice available in the middle of the day. The samosas were fresh made and light, the breading not too heavy as can happen. As my main course came a wheat roti flat bread with Daal Tadaka, a yellow lentil tempered with onion, tomato, and red chili served a generous bowl of basmati rice. I was very full and had enough left over to take home for dinner.

Service was very attentive, a little on the hovering side, but I appreciate that more than the opposite. Parking is easy in the strip mall and it a multi state chain. They are sticklers for hours, I've arrived 5 minutes late for their lunch service to find the door locked and been turned away when I arrived 10 minutes early before dinner service started but the door was open."}
{"text":"This place is amazing delicious and the staff are wonderful. Highly recommending coming in during lunch for the buffet"}
{"text":"They have now opened a takeout restaurant in Uptown Latta Arcade- Although the food isn't that bad. Its a terrible value. You get about a 1.5 cups of white rice and 1 cup of Veg/Non-Veg  combination for 8.99. I know they are paying to be in this location however, $9.00 for lunch and very little, is not worth it.  They need to re-think this."}
{"text":"I visited Persis for the first time this weekend.  I waited to go on Sunday because the Sunday Buffet is normally the biggest and the best way to get a taste of the majority of their dishes at one time...HOWEVER, this buffet totally lacked in variety. It was not even as many options as an average lunch buffet but costs a WHOPPING $13.99!!!!!

The service was good and the food was okay, but definitely not a good value at all. I doubt I will make that drive again."}
{"text":"I thought the food was lovely and I frequent indian restaurants all the time. We got paneer 65 for app, loved the crunchy outer layer. For the meal, we got the okra which was quite good but had a lot of diced onion. Also ordered the paneer markhani and it was great although it could have had a bit more paneer in it. Garlic naan scrumptious but have you ever had bad naan? Price overall was reasonable. We left fat and happy. Yum yum."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had. Just go here, eat something, and be satisfied. The heat in the lamb vindaloo is the kind that doesn't last too long, but it is very intense and flavorful. It came out of the kitchen super hot, and I learned from the last time I ate the dish that the absolute worst thing you can do when eating spicy food is burn your tongue on it while it's hot. So I took my own advice this time, took it slow, get a mild appetizer and some naan to enjoy between the bites, and had a fantastic time. The hostess offered me a cocktail special called an Indian Sunrise that had mango puree and spiced rum and some chili powder in it (I think). It was awesome. I'm so happy I live near this place!"}
{"text":"Visited today for the lunch buffet!  We have been to several of the other Indian buffets, and really enjoyed this one! Great variety of Southern and Northern Indian food, loved the lentil stew and the carrot pudding for dessert was Devine.  There was a full house, so I think it's catching on."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet on my first visit to the restaurant.  The food was excellent and diverse.  The food was very fresh, properly cooked, and never dried out or left out for too long.  The goat biryani was the best goat that I have ever had!  There were plenty of Indian customers dining at the restaurant which indicates a high degree of confidence in the food served at Persis.
The wait staff was very attentive, polite, and professional.  
The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere festive yet pleasant.
The buffet was very reasonably priced with a diverse selection of entrees.  The waitstaff recommended the Sunday buffet as being even larger than the weekly lunch buffet.
Summary: the restaurant is highly recommended, and I will be a regular customer (including bringing my coworkers and friends)."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Persis.  It's tucked away in a shopping center on the corner of Ballantyne Commons and Johnston. When it comes to Indian food, I don't have a huge repertoire of dishes under my belt, but what I've had, I've loved. 

It can get very busy on Sunday for brunch but if you can snag a table - it's well worth it - especially if you want to try a bit of everything. But just a tip - you may need to dodge several people in order to get your food and it can feel a bit chaotic with the number of people trying to fill their plates.  

My hubby and I have done dinner here mid-week and it's quite enjoyable.  The service is very attentive and the servers are willing to answer any questions you have about their dishes. And for spicy food lovers - this place is for you! I usually go with level 3 but I think I can go a bit higher next time.  Their naan is really good  - chewy and crispy at the same time - and the chicken tikka masala is awesome - I could drink the sauce!   I look forward to trying something new next time."}
{"text":"This was basically bad fast food. The sides were not proportional to the large amount of rice you receive. Pretty bland. Naan seems like its been reheated.

Had wished it would be better, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  I couldn't even get in the door of this place as people were piled up in there so that already tells you the food is legit......yep, a serious line to get in the restaurant and another line for the buffet and it's all worth it.....they serve many of the regular Indian favorites on the buffet plus mango pudding:-)  My new Indian crush......"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The butter chicken had too much garam masala in it, which seems like a common problem in many Indian restaurants in the US. The butter naan was overdone. The service was good though - the waiters were very softspoken and polite. The decor was nice. The place was full on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice, once for dinner where food and service was good.

Second time, for lunch-buffet.Limited choice when compared to other Indian restaurants in Charlotte . Food was very spicy. Tandoori Chicken was not properly cooked could feel the raw flavors of paprika.
The service was horrible.. We waited half an hour for the check.. asked the waitress thrice. Finally ended up paying at the counter. 
 
Not worth of $14."}
{"text":"Persis is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. When you think about Biriyani Persis is the first place that comes to mind. I strongly recommend this place as the no 1 choice for whomever is looking for delicious South Indian food. Not only the taste but also their service which makes you visit Persis again and again."}
{"text":"This is the greatest Indian buffet place anywhere around Charlotte.  The food is always fresh and soooooooooo delicious.  Grabbing the lunch buffet on Sunday will set the tone for the rest of your day being  awesome."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the what is holding there rating from a 5 star is the service.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala with onion naan.  I asked the Chicken tikka to be made with a spice level of 4 out of 5.  The food was really good and rich in flavor.  The Naan was soft and really warm.  I enjoy going to Persis but the service is the only thing holding them back.  All the food I have had there is really good.  An appetizer recommendation is Chilli Panner."}
{"text":"Food here is always amazing. This is the only Indian restaurant that I will come to. Korma Chicken and Methi Chicken are my favorites!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! There is always something new and the food is always on point! I come to this restaurant at least once a week because it is that good! See for your self, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Phone number does not work.  Food is not bad for the area."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice both on Thursday only for dinner.first we have ordered chicken biryani and chicken 65 they both tasted awesome.next visit we tried dosa actually Thursday night is special for dosa.biryani was good.indians will like the taste.we have ordered fresh lemon soda also but that is not good.overall both the visits was awesome.we loved the lamb dosa very much."}
{"text":"First timer at this restaurant - but like Indian food for the spice. Waiter was very helpful with the menu pointing out food that was both spicy and not so spicy. The food was excellent - look forward to my next dinner date at this restaurant with my wife."}
{"text":"Food wasn't so fresh and I found it very bland. And the waiter was so super annoying!! He kept asking me questions and tried to flirt with me. Asking me question like ' am I single ?' Why am I single?' Then he started complimenting and saying stuff like 'you're so beautiful' ' when I saw you I was like wow' 
I found it very inappropriate and very uncomfortable. Never going back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was incredibly good and I couldn't finish my entrée there was so much! The service was just as amazing as the food was! We poured the last of the water from our pitcher at our table and within 1 minute they brought a full one! We were checked on every few minutes and even the owner checked to see if everything was good a couple of times! I can't wait to go back and would do so just for the service let alone the incredible food!"}
{"text":"Best indian food I have eaten in a very long time. Came here twice in 3 days. Afternoon buffet covers it all. Must try if you are in neighborhood."}
{"text":"As good as it gets - spicy, flavorful, a huge variety.  The chicken curry was exceptional, and the lunch buffet allows you to get more of this exceptional.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I wish I would have seen the Health Score before eating!!! So the food was okay, but nothing to write home about. I could have just left it at that, however the Health Score that they had was UNACCEPTABLE for any place that deals with the public!! Below the score was the Serve Safe Diploma that showed that they passed a course on food safety. To get a 72 which is a C do you have any idea how MANY POINTS you ave to loose??? That is Dangerous to  the public!!! I can't see why they are allowed to stay open during this time. NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the best indian buffet ever. So clean, so neat, and so so good. Everything is delicious and service is fast. I have only been to the lunch buffet and have recommended it to everyone i come across.  its gets very busy on a Friday for lunch so that might be a downfall to have to actually wait in line for the yumminess."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian cuisine. Loved the biryani"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch during the work day. Their buffet has a great variety, is fresh with options for apps, entrees and dessert.

Everything was clean and well labeled.

It's a great deal at $12 for all you can eat. The wait staff was super attentive (almost too much so) but hate to knock a place for that.

Love the large selection of sauces with the small containers."}
{"text":"We discovered this gem on a rainy night looking for a restaurant.  Small, intimate and VERY Indian.

Our problem was a lack of understanding about the menu offerings.  Lots of dosas and curries and what we ordered was excellent, but we could not understand the ethnic servers.  Even when the owner came over, we never really understood the dishes.

They do offer a buffet lunch, but we have not been there for it and don't know if signage is there to explain what is being offered.

Too bad, as it was packed with Indians with my wife and I the only gringos there.  You just know it is good.

We are trying to get an Indian couple to join us for dinner there so we can get educated.

If you are looking for authentic...this is the place."}
{"text":"Yuk yum yum! Ate here for dinner with the fam one night: ordered chili paneer, samosas, shrimp appetizer, goat biryani and chicken chettinad:
-Unless you are lord Vishnu himself, do not order spice levels 5 or 6. Ive eaten some spice in my time, but the tears were really flowing on the 6. Would definitely recommend a 4 spice level as perfection.
-Items took around 20 minutes to come out, as there were a couple of tables, but everything was excellently flavored and well presented. Highly recommend the Chili paneer, which comes out steaming!
-Chicken chettinad was creamy and well spiced and the biryani was deliciously fluffy, but I would recommend getting chicken instead of goat because the goat was unusually stringy. 
-Nice ambience for an indian restaurant, they have plenty of booths and an extensive wine and drinks list. Would make a good indian restaurant for a date. 
Fantastic northern charlotte eatery!"}
{"text":"I went today for lunch buffet. Worst experience ever.  Seemed like food they were serving was old.  I actually got sick after eating there"}
{"text":"Everything is fantastic. The only problem is when there is too much crowd, the staff is not able to maintain the quality of the food. Esp on Friday and sat nights. Chicken biryani rocks! It is advisable sometimes to order for a take out .. service is slow during crowded days. 

Desserts is not a speciality out here."}
{"text":"Best Indian spot in charlotte. First off you can usually tell if it's authentic or not based on the percentage of Indian people in the restaurant and this place is always at around 95%. This isn't watered down and Americanized. Food is priced accordingly and I've never left dissatisfied."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today and I have to say we were both blown away by how hot, fresh and delicious everything was. 
That's after having been to both Tulips and Passage to India; neither one of them comes close to Persis. The restaurant is bright, open and very welcoming, with additional seating outside. 
My favorite was the chicken 65 which was  not very spicy but they have lots of spices that you can add to it and things to cool off your food too it's too spicy. The goat was perfectly cooked and the chicken curry is really spicy but not too spicy; again you can heat up or cool off your food as you wish. 
We were the only people that did not appear to be of Indian heritage in the restaurant so that tells me you're onto something. If you haven't gone you're really missing out. 
I have a new job in the area and they deliver on Tuesday Wednesdays and Thursdays so I plan on telling everybody at work about it. You owe it to yourself to try this restaurant. It costs 10.99 during the week and 11.99 on the weekend. It's well worth the price and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant at any cost!!
I just came back from Persis 30 min back and was forced to write this review because of the horrible experience we had there.
My parents are here with us from India and so we decided to have some Indian food & so visited Persis.

We ordered masala papad, 3 dosas,2 naan and a navratna curry.They completely forgot about our order and made us wait for almost more than an hour without serving anything.Remember, it is a weekday and there was hardly any crowd!

When I went and reminded them that there were folks after us who came and got their food the only explanation that was given was : \"we have a shortage of cooks today\".
We were only given masala papad which was cold and they also charged us for the papad,pathetic.No sorry, nothing for the terrible service and wasting our time!
It seems the restaurant is run by a bunch of mindless souls (do notice a guy who has a beard and a pony and is at the reception and has an American accent - extremely arrogant & worst of the lot) who have no sense of what customer service is all about !!"}
{"text":"This has worst Indian food for ever , staff and chef keep changing ,  very bad  service as well. Don't go here, This recommendation is coming by an Indian , who leaves only for good food only!"}
{"text":"The quality of this food is amazing. But this is the third time I have been there past 11:30 am and there is no food.  I waited around 15 minutes then walked to Nirvana, which I don't recommend either.  The servers are apologetic and explain that they bring the food in from their other restaurant and they run late sometimes. Yeah, but why don't you bring it in earlier if you see that you can't get it here at the agreed upon time? If you say you'll be open at 11:30 am, please be dependable. Many of us only have a small window of time to get lunch.  Makes me wonder if the owners care at all.  :("}
{"text":"Good, but not great.

I came here based on the recommendation of the King, the guy with the most check-ins here.

What they get right: variety - they have a nice variety here and they do serve biryani on the buffet which many places don't bother with.  They also had the obligatory chicken curry or butter chicken etc., the thing your non-adventurous fellow diners can eat.

I enjoyed the way you can bring your food back to the table, reminds me of a dabbas carrier.  I really like being able to put my raita in a little bowl and the edge of my plate.  They have a variety of different sizes of metal bowls/tins depending on what you want.

What was missing - tandoori, I like the tandoori chicken but I really enjoy the onions and green peppers that go with it.  Flavor - some of the items weren't up to what I had wanted.

WARNING: This place is inconsistent.  I agree with what I read in the reviews about things being a positive experience along with those having a negative experience.  I don't know why but each time I go here the experience differs widely.

My favorite Indian dishes, other than biryan, have been absent.  I love chana masala and all forms of korma.  I haven't seen rogan josh here yet.  I go here because it is close to where I live, but I am trying other places trying to find my sweet spot.

Good enough most the time but not so good that I don't yearn for something better."}
{"text":"I think I found my Friday night place to hang out. Very nice attendants and very fresh tasty food. They have a very nice cocktail menu as well with kool play of words was interesting."}
{"text":"Although I have not tried too many and so cannot exclude them, this is certainly one of my favorite Indian restaurant in the Highland Creek/ Concord Mills area. Another similar option is by WT Harris/ Tryon shopping center (likely by the same owners). Great variety of options with excellent ingredients for the money."}
{"text":"Still the worst Indian food in Charlotte.  I keep going back hoping it is back to its old glory again but it's so bad I'll wait a few years this time.  Cold bland food, horrible selection."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.   We have had dinner here half a dozen times in the past few months and every experience is consistent.  The staff is conscious of spice tolerance and will ask you your preferred heat rating from 1-5. 



The wait staff is a bit slow but I will chalk that up to them wanting us to enjoy a dining experience."}
{"text":"Since neither my friend nor I knew about Biryani, we decided to gamble on a new place and WON! BIG! ! !

We walked in a saw Bhim (former Manager of the Blue Taj) and we were confident this place would be good!  They have only been opened about one month and Chefs are still arriving, they have done almost no advertising and at 1:35 Tuesday afternoon we walk in to a more than three quarters full Restaurant!  Most of the Patrons were Indian!

We had Chicken Tikka Masala, Manchurian Chicken (an Indo-Chinese dish) Chicken Biryani, Salad and Naan Bread (Salad and Bread with Raita included with Lunch)... The Salad and Dressing were very good and the entrees were Exceptional!

Since Persis is on a corner you have perfect access to the Outdoor Alley Dinning (shared with the neighbors and Persis staff will serve you there)!  This is a cool Dinning area!

This place is plenty good and I'm confident they will only improve as they are getting ready for a \"Grand Opening\" once a few more Chefs with different Indian Region Recipes and skills arrive!

10-3-12 Fantastic Lunch Buffet!  Chicken Tikka Masala was even better than last time!  We were the only Non-Indian Customers Again!!!  They say it is very Authentic!

12-8-12 Dosa!  FANTASTIC!  Masala Dosa!  Shrimp Biryani!  Masala Chai  Cheese Kulcha!  Onion Pakoda and BUTTER CHICKEN!  Mango Kulfi for dessert!  Everything was Superb!!!  The Butter Chicken was our Favorite!!!  Bhim and the Owner both checked to see how we liked everything!  Service was Fantastic, the meal was Timed perfectly!

Butter Chicken is a \"Gateway Curry\" so you can have it!  If you do not think you like Curry, you may sing a different song after this one!"}
{"text":"The food here is five stars. Hands down. Great flavors, various Indian dishes, and nothing that will make your nose run (too badly...). This is a marathon of a buffet that is understandably priced at $14 per person because it is the best Indian food in a 60-mile radius.

Only reason I take this down to four stars is because of the service -- the Chai tea we ordered, though delicious and rich with whole milk, took about 30 minutes to prepare (they were making it fresh). 

And I understand how busy this buffet gets on a Sunday, but several of the marquee items (Chicken Marsala) simply were void of chicken - same for the Tandoori Chicken.

Other than those two points above this is a five-star meal -- affordable, authentic, and well worth a drive for this living closer to Uptown :)"}
{"text":"The staff is very polite and are eager to make your visit pleasant. My only negative is the bathrooms. Keep them maintained without using them as storage. Could be a tripping hazard. My visit was on (02 May 17) at lunch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"this place is outstanding! The staff is always nice and friendly.  I don't know what these other people are talking about poor service and food. Never had a bad experience here! The food is fresh, hot and amazingly delicious, not to mention authentic. My favorite Indian restaurant out of everywhere I've travelled."}
{"text":"My brother and I went there for lunch today and had bad experience afterwords. We both had diarrhea"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  I never see this much public in Indian restaurant on Monday.  Love the food!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Went for a full feast of a dinner with about 10 people. Service was quick. Food was brought out at an acceptable pace.

Decor is not really that inspiring or noticeable, but the servers did make for a enjoyable experience by not being so intrusive or annoying.

All of the dishes we ordered was cooked correctly and to my liking except for one. The lamb rogan josh was over cooked and was too chewy. But we pretty much ordered everything else off of the menu and everything was delicious.

I would definitely recommend this place, and I plan on going back just to try the Lamb Rogan Josh again and give it another try. If it is still not cooked correctly, I will update the review and rating."}
{"text":"Will never go back. Food was awful. I have had better Indian food from a frozen meal. Found pieces of cartilage and bone in butter chicken. The tandoori chicken had an odd texture that did not seem fresh or like chicken. Food lacked flavor. I went here instead of blue taj because I figured it was more affordable. The food was so expensive. Ordered a chai tea (which was tasty) but it took 25+ minutes to get and when I tried to get waiters attention to ask where the chai was he seemed annoyed that I was trying to get his attention. Then after finishing (leaving most of the food behind) the waiter held the iPad thing that we checked out on and watched us enter gratuity. It was unprofessional. Very unwelcoming staff. I have enjoyed plenty of Indian restaurants prior to this and it makes me afraid to try another. I don't know what we were served but we both were sick the rest of the night. The naan was light and tasty, but for $4 for one, I'll just purchase from freezer at trader joes as well as their Indian meals. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to grab dinner. Persis was recommend to me by one of my Indian co-workers, as I did not have much experience with Indian cuisine and she totally pointed me in the right direction. The Chicken Tikka Masala is delish! As are their chicken wings from the appetizers. Each time I go I ask the servers for recommendations, and every time they bring a new and exciting dish. The wait staff has always been attentive and very willing to help point me in the right direction with the food. If you want to try lots of different things I recommend the lunch buffet, it is a great way to try their food and it is very reasonable."}
{"text":"A little rushed, however the food delivered. Coming in, it was pretty empty, but I believe they had a reserved party coming in sometime during the night but I didn't see them. Anyways, we sat down and ordered our drinks. My parents as Asian parents are, ordered hot water with lemon. We got warm faucet water, which didn't really sit well. I guess tea or coffee is on the menu? I didn't check. However, let's just say the water isn't stellar/filtered. Or if it is, they need to change it.

Anyways, what did we order? We ordered the 
1. Butter Chicken - I enjoyed this dish. I know I listed this first, but I actually ordered this last because I was curious on how it tasted. If you question on what to order, this is a pretty safe order.
2. Goat Curry - I wanted to try something new. The problem with this dish was that it's a little unknown on if you're just going to get a bowl of basically bones and not much meat. That's what made us a little scared about ordering this dish. What came out was a mix of what we expected, some of it was just bones and not a lot of meat, and then some of it was full of meat. It was sort of like half and half.
3. Chicken Chettinad - Chef's special. Weird one here. I asked the waiter if it was dry or if it had sauce to it. The waiter said it was just dry rub. In my mind, I'm thinking okay just dry. What came out was it was extremely close to one of the other dishes that we order. I can't remember if it was the Goat or the Shrimp. Anyways, it did have sauce to it. 
4. Shrimp Vartha Curry - This dish wasn't bad. It had shrimp mixed with a very similar curry. Both my parents and I enjoyed it.

In the end, what did I think of Persis? Definitely a stop for our family if we're craving for some Indian food. This restaurant wouldn't have been an option if the 485 wasn't finished. Now, since that part of the city is so close now all these restaurants are not a 30-45 minute drive anymore. This place is definitely a viable place that we will be back here for an Indian meal."}
{"text":"Compared to the other restaurants in this area this is one of the best. To show comparison the overall best indian restaurant in the charlotte area is Passage to India. Persis is a very close second. It has excellent service and plenty of room. If there is even a delay in bringing the food they don't charge you for it. The food is not overpriced and the quantity it great. I would personally recommend this restaurant to anybody who enjoys Indian food or someone who wants a different but good taste."}
{"text":"I would put this place at the top of my list of favorite places to bring the family to, My kids loved the butter chicken. The place has a nice cozy vibe and the wait staff was very friendly and helpful with selections. Not only was the food top notch but the manager was very friendly."}
{"text":"Have tried their dosa buffet Tuesday nights and like the variety they offer in that buffet but the other day I ordered the chicken biryani and chicken seekh kebab and fell in love. The biryani was bursting with flavor and it is the second best I have had in delhi. The chicken seekh was delicious too and came with yummy mint chutney. Inhave found my go-to biryani spot. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"I have visited this place when i was visiting Charlotte.  I really like their chain in Atlanta! And this location didn't disappoint either.

Tried their lunch buffet which had decent amount of varieties. No stand outs in the menu, similar to most indian restaurants but the food was very good.

The service was good but my only comment is , it gets difficult to move or get food when the place is crowded. They do not have two side arrangement, that lets people serve food from either way of the buffet. So one has to stand in line for quiet a while on crowded days.

Overall a good place to have indian food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food and service. First, they opened early for us. Then, they provided incredible suggestions for what to order. Everything tasted great. I made me wish I still lived down here, so I could be a regular."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Charlotte in my opinion. Amazing naan, butter chicken, biryani, dosa's etc. They had a beet halva that I tried for dessert which was amazing. I took many friends who have never had indian food here and they were addicted!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Don't waste your time and money. We explicitly ordered the goat sukkha and asked for roti with it but it took them 20 minutes to make the roti! They have Zero regard for what the customer wants. We explicitly also told them to give us papad before the food because we were extremely hungry. The irony was that the papad was the last thing our server brought out- as if it was dessert. I had lost it by then and asked him to turn around and take that papad back to the chef. Prejudiced and flawed business operations. They favored white people take out orders and treated indian dine in clients as shit. DONT GO HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the South Charlotte area, and we love exploring Indian restaurants.  So far we have been to Blue Taj (4 stars-good, but sauces too creamy, and Bombay Grill - (2 stars, food absolutely wallowing in sauce, in fact, I can't find the food, no flavor, tiny portions, but decent naan).  Persis far exceeds the other two, both in food and service.  The ambiance has a cool vibe (didn't notice any Bollywood videos), blue and red lighting, hanging scarves to give a sense of intimacy and sophisticated music that you would find in an upscale hotel.

The appetizers.  The vegetable samosas arrived to the table hot, cooked perfectly, and quite delicious, but did not come with any sauce (not sure if those are supposed to come with sauce).  We also ordered the cauliflower fried in cornmeal.  At first taste, it was way too hot (we had ordered mild) .  With near tears streaming down our faces and drinking buckets of water to get rid of the heat, after awhile one waiter came back and fessed up that ours may have been intended for a different table and we got the medium spicy and they got the mild.  So they brought us another and it was OUTSTANDING!  We thought that was really honest, something you don't find in a restaurant every day.

The main course.  I ordered the chicken tandoori and the waiter explained it was an appetizer and suggested other main dishes.  I wasn't sure if he meant it wasn't enough food for me, but I stuck with my order because the first time at any Indian restaurant I usually order the chicken tandoori.  As it turns out, the plate was huge, and I did not finish half and I have a huge appetite.  My husband ordered chicken korma as usual, and he devoured it, yet still having leftovers for today.  The buttered naan was buttered perfectly and cooked to perfection.  

Our waiter.  A word about Joseph.  He was extremely attentive, and nearly over- explaining things on the menu, suggesting this and that.  (Perhaps this was in response to some of the earlier reviews that talked about the waitstaff not knowing the menu).   In fact it was to the point we felt he was \"over-suggesting\", aka \"up-selling\".  We have noticed this in general in Charlotte restaurants and this one is no different.  His English was a little hard to understand, but he got his point across, and hey, after all, this is an Indian restaurant.  I would rather have Joseph as a waiter, and say \"no\" to most of his numerous suggestions, than have a lack of service.  There were several waiters attending to our table and as mentioned in another review, they did not communicate whom was doing what.  But that's okay.  

It was very heartening to see most of the patrons were Indian!  That is always a good sign.  We will be back, and soon!!!  So glad this amazing restaurant is nearby."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner. This was my first time having Indian food. The restaurant itself was nice, nothing extravagant. The service was good. The waiter had a really good feel for the menu and was able to give great recommendations. Both of our entrees was really good. I'll be back to try the buffet to try some more indian food."}
{"text":"It was ok, not great. I was not impress with the biryani. The rice is also a little too mushy. However, the samosa was great with the sauce."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant! Everything we ate on the buffet and ordered of the menu was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Lots of good vegetarian options okra,
eggplant, mushrooms, yogurt cheese (paneer), and garlic naan."}
{"text":"Wait staff was rude, limited buffet options for vegetarians (if you can believe that for an Indian restaurant). On of the buffet attendants tried to push me out of the way. 

Good food does not make up for a poor experience.  Won't be coming back here soon.

."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian haunt outside of the wondrously copious choices I had in Boston. Our go-to order - me: chicken vindaloo, him: chicken tikka masala, to share: two orders of garlic naan. The vindaloo comes with several big balls of potato, and is slightly on the garlicky side, but there is nothing wrong with garlic. The chicken tikka masala is also very tasty, and comes with a few dollops of cream. You can adjust the spice level accordingly. Prices are very reasonable (avg. $15 for dinner entree). They are also not stingy with their rice.

The place gets busier on the weekends, so be ready for a wait. We had a nice chat with the manager/owner last time, and he told us this was the first Indian restaurant in Charlotte that served biryani. They cook it the \"dum\" style where they seal up the rice, seasonings, vegetables, and protein and let it cook until done. I've never tried biryani, but it's next on my list.

This location in Ballantyne is a little far for me, but we still make it out a few times a month. They also have a University location that I'm going to have to check out. If you love Indian food, you've got to give this place a shot.

Side note: Every time I've been, I've asked for chai and been refused. I guess they don't have it very often :("}
{"text":"Been here after a year, food is way better than what they used to make. Try fried idly or chicken manchurian. Samosa chat is not that well compared to other dishes."}
{"text":"This was the best Indian food I've had in ages. The Chicken Khorma was sublime. If the food wasn't a little on the pricey side, I would eat it every day! I am hoping to try the buffet soon. So far, we have done only take out because we have two small children that don't always behave in restaurants,  but the take out is delicious!  I can't wait to go back!"}

{"text":"Best Indian Restaurant in Charlotte: 

My wife is from India and I'm from the USA and because of her I've learned to not only like but love Indian food.  We've eaten at pretty much every place in Charlotte and while most of it is fine Persis is hands down the best.  To get there we have to travel a bit to get there but it is absolutely worth the time. (Persis... consider a West side restaurant:)

Over time I've learned that Indian food is rather complex and with that is easy to do wrong and hard to do right and Persis is doing everything right. 

Persis is that the restaurant has a bright, comfortable and open atmosphere with a nice sized buffet at a fair price.

The Biryani is outstanding and my favorite 'Butter Chicken' is the best I've had anywhere.  Suggest having the butter chicken on top of the Biryani...

Ok... after writing this I have no choice but to go back again today!

Bravo Persis!"}
{"text":"This review is primarily for the lunch buffet. 

Pros: Price is good, for two people it was about $20. I loved their tandoori chicken, so moist and just the right amount of spice. The chicken curry and biryani was good too. The place is also super clean and staff was so nice!

Cons: Wish they had goat curry during weekday buffet. I also wish there was a little more selection. 

Overall, I will be back again! Good value!"}
{"text":"This is my first review to Persis after management change.The food quality and service is too good now. Especially on weekends biryani is delicious and Lamb and goat biryani worth it to try."}
{"text":"Place was completely empty at 7pm, waiter was sick, even said he had a sore throat,  and it smelled very very strongly of cleaning solution. Totally overpowering. I knew when I sat down we should leave, but  my guests wanted to give it a try. The naan was very good as was the butter chicken.  We also ordered the mixed veggie khorma,  and a rice and noodle dish which none of us liked compared to other places that serve the same dishes. All in all, I wouldn't go back, even if it were just for the chicken and naan."}
{"text":"Not sure how to update the information from the restaurant but they DO NOT DELIVER. The food is decent."}
{"text":"I discovered this place while walking around. I'm not an experienced connoisseur of Indian food, but I've had it once before. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of basmati and garlic naan. Everything was delicious and I'm glad I gave the place a chance. I liked the fact that they ask you for your desired heat level when it comes to spice. I came in with Tandoori chicken on my mind but I'm glad I tried something different."}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious and the owner is very friendly. I called today and ordered the lamb vindaloo for pick up at lunch. He informed me that they only serve that for dinner, then checked in the back and said they would make it for me. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular as it's close to my work place.The weekday buffet quality faded over months and now its horrible.Weekend buffet is okay.


They need to improve the quality of their Vegetarian Biryani.

\"If i hear any complaints again,I will call the immigration department and ask them 
to verify the legal status of the workers there...\"

I am changing my rating to 1 star because of the 'WONDERFUL' hospitality received last couple of times.


Waiters must be waiters (just serving food and swiping cards!).There's one headstrong,rude dark skin toned Indian guy you 'must' avoid talking to ,
if you are looking for a pleasant dining experience.


I still stand by my previous review ' weekday buffet quality faded over months' and that's true.

Today after a very long time,it was good and that's not just me saying that(my whole team of 6 agreed to that).

Everything was good till the checkout.We were talking about the new Indian place
(Cafe Nirvana on Providence) and how good the food is and the buffet prices. 

Suddenly,this guy(the one mentioned above.i guess his name is joseph) jumped in to our conversation and started talking about how great the food is at persis and some BS about the prices and quantity of food they serve.

Who gives a damn man! We go to a restaurant to eat quality food and have a good time.You must be in a position to take the critics and improve. That was the main reason YELP was developed.

And that's how businesses work and develop.


We had a heated discussion for 5 minutes.When my turn came to pay,this guy charged me close to $13.90 something and rest of my folks $11.00(The Ballantyne corporate discount).I still have the receipts and can post them here. 

How's this fair??? Is it because of me saying that their food quality downgraded over the last couple of months and they must need to IMPROVE.....


I'm definitely not going there again and I will ask my colleagues too to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to, and I've been to dozens. The flavors are complex and very fresh.  I don't know why there are two star reviews of the service because each time we go the waitstaff is fantastic."}
{"text":"I was expecting that my craving for the good chicken biryani will be fulfilled at this place. I heard many great things about this place, especially about the biryanis. As the name of the establishment says, it has to be good because it's in their name. :-)

I was totally and utterly disappointed that night. May be they are good with biryanis. May be they are awesome with their biryanis. May be what I heard about them, before I went there it's true. But not on that night.

I went solo as always, and I sat at the table. Without going through the whole menu, I ordered chicken biryani. I can see an expression on the face of the person waiting the tables. He repeated what I said by adding one word. I asked for chicken biryani. He said, \"just\" chicken biryani?. I confirmed, yes - just chicken biryani. He recommended me to have medium spicy as I can't handle hot spicy based on the \"Indian spice Scale\". I don't want to take any chances. Most often the hot spicy is just uneatable. So I went with medium spicy.

Apparently, someone from a small group on the other table ordered chicken biryani. So I got an assurance in my mind that their chicken biryanis must good here, as someone else has also ordered chicken biryani.

I could not taste any flavor, that kick, that something which would make me call it even a decent chicken biryani. It was a disappointment. I was very hungry by 7:30pm, and by the time I got my food I was at the peak. So I ate faster than usual with the hope that I will get the good part or good feeling after few bites. I could not feel it even after working on half of the portion.

The guy from the small group who had ordered chicken biryani, called the waiter and informed him that the chicken biryani is flavorless. The fun part of going solo is, I can listen and eves-drop at other peoples conversation, sometimes without any intention as people can be loud in the public places, you know. ;-) That customer's buddy, asked him to speak with the waiter in Telugu, which he did. Waiter replied in Telugu. I understand Telugu and can speak Telugu. Why someone needs to have conversation in Telugue specifically? Interesting! The waiter took the chicken biryani plate and came back probably with the flavorful chicken biryani. I was thinking if I should inform the waiter the same about my chicken biryani which was more than half eaten by this time. 

I felt robbed that the only thing I came for and the only thing I ordered, was not anywhere close to what I wanted, what I expected, what I heard about. But I was hungry, and ate the whole biryani. 

While paying the cheque, I tried to put politely to the waiter that the chicken biryani did not feel like it. There is \"just\" that thing is missing, you know, that makes it chicken biryani. He said we make fresh and something else that I don't remember as I was absorbed in my thoughts about whether I should give this place another try next time whenever it is. He asked me if I speak Telugu. I don't know why this is a relevant question in this discussion. I said yes without thinking much as I do speak and understand Telugu.

Anyways, the bottom-line is that, it wasn't the good dinner. I could fill my belly but not my soul. I walked out of there unfulfilled. Keep in mind we Indians are all about food. 

So, will I be at this place next time?"}
{"text":"Just had the lunch buffet and it was awesome. This should be among the top places you would go for authentic Indian food in this country."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband, who is not food-adventurous, loved his dinner as did I. The app platter was wonderful even the fairly hot peppers. He had butter chicken and loved it. We got an order of okra which was delicious and the waiter suggested getting lamb with methi sauce.....yum! The wait staff was very helpful, very personable and made great suggestions.  Will definitely be back!  By the way, my husband has said \"great choice\" three times while I have been writing this!"}
{"text":"I had REALLY great  expectations from this place as my friend took me to this place saying they have the best biryani in town...I was pretty much disappointed with the Chicken 65 Biryani I had (Boneless chicken biryani)..We ordered Butter Chicken and Kadhai Paneer too, which were okay to say the least. The only good thing about the food was the Lachha Parantha..Do give it a try. For the money paid, I was not happy with the food at all."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered my food to go, but I've never been disappointed. I appreciate that they actually give you enough rice. Their naan is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Persis three or four times. As a huge lover of Indian food, I get really upset when I feel it's been done incorrectly. (You may be thinking, \"Who is he to judge?\" I've had enough Indian food to know the good from the bad). Persis doesn't make me do cartwheels but also doesn't make me want to go dashing to the nearest trash receptacle either. I usually order the chana masala or the eggplant; both are pretty good. This is a solid Indian restaurant that I'll probably continue going to.

My only gripe is the speed of service. I can definitely say the concept of a \"sense of urgency\" is all but lost here. I've ordered take-out on several occasions and its taken upwards of 30-35 minutes each time, but even then sometimes it's not ready by the time I arrive. Is this enough to deter me from returning? No. I like Persis and will continue to patronize it, but geez, please light a fire under your chefs."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Indian food!!! Marsala tea is included in the bar and they have the best raspberry Gullas I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte. The taste is very good for almost all vegetarian items. I always prefer Chilli Paneer to start with. The Veg Biriyani or Naan with Paneer Butter Masala is good for main course."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Visited here for a lunch buffet on a Saturday and overall the food quality was disappointing. Give it a miss and save your tummy a bad experience."}
{"text":"love this place the food was awesome nice and spicy. Great selection and friendly staff. well definitely go back again for the lunch  buffet"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Columbia, SC and we drive 1  1/2 hours to eat this amazing food!!!  We have only eaten there during the lunch buffet so we can't comment on \"off the menu\" or dinner (I am sure both are great).  

My husband eats everything from the buffet and LOVES all of it.  

All I do is grab 2 vadas and a big bowl of Pongal and I am set.  I am a South Indian who grew up in Houston eating Pongal every Sunday and I think the Pongal is just as good as homemade."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. Very good service and the food is wonderful. I've been here a few times and have enjoyed the experience each time. I highly recommend Persis!"}
{"text":"So really this review is a 2.5, cuz I thought the food was way good. Buuuuuuut...the service was really not my favorite. Waiter seemed nice enough, but he was very foreign when it came to customer service. Most small box asian restaurants I don't expect the service to be amazing, but I was highly appalled at how poor it was here.

*first, the waiter grabbed a high chair for my toddler and he wiggled it a ton before asking me if it was ok. Ummm, dude. If it shakes, do you think it's safe to put a kid in it? He didn't even offer to get a different one. 

*second, his accent was super thick. That wasn't really the problem, but it def made it hard to order. Mostly it was that that he was way pushy about ordering appetizers for our kids, and he gave us like 30 secs btwn figuring out how to order and asking us about drinks. It was a bit irritating. 

*once we ordered, it was mass confusion. We got a couple things ordered, but he kept interjecting suggestions (I think) or just commenting. I don't know. We originally only wanted 3 entrees, one for the kids to share and 1 each for my hubs and I. But somehow we ended up with 4 dishes, 3 rices, 2 orders of naan--even though I thought he said to us to only order 1 (which I thought was what he was bringing). It was confusing, and the waiter was unapologetic about the confusion when I said he misunderstood me or I him. He basically kept saying \"you ordered it. You ordered it.\" Errr...no dude. I didn't. I said I wanted his suggestion for a tandoori dish after I said I wanted a tandoori chicken--not that I wanted both a tandoori chicken and a 2nd dish. Lesson learned: have the guy repeat your order back.

Also, that wiggly unsafe high chair was just put back in the pile. He didn't even wipe it down after my toddler smeared goober hands all over it. Cmon!

Again, food was very good. But order it to go, cuz the service sucks. Or go with the notion that you see your ticket b4 it goes thru. Cuz what I thought was gonna be a $30 meal with our gift certificate ended up being $70!!! Dumb! We won't be back, cuz I just didn't like the stink eye I got from the waiter on the way out. Dude! We still paid for all that extra food, and you got a tip you ass."}
{"text":"We just moved to Charlotte may 26th and discovered there are 9 Indian restaurants within 5 miles of our new home. Over the next several weeks we plan to visit all 9. Saturday, Persis was the 2nd we tried with our son and his fiancé. For appetizers we had samosas and pepper fried goat. The Samosas were fried a little too much and the goat was ok but too many bones and very spicy. For the main course we had lamb curry, Navraton Korma, paneer saag and chicken tikka. The spice level was moderate except the saag was up a notch and the tikka down one. The dishes were good but the korma relied on squash and tofu as the bulk of the vegetables and was more soupy than we are used to eating. I enjoyed the saag but it too was more creamy than we are used to. While not among the best Indian restaurants we have tried over the years, Persis will deserve another visit in the future."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I used Persis Biryani Indian Grill for catering my HOA's couples dinner.  We had set the catering for 60 people.  The short version is: food was great, and people really enjoyed it.

The long version: They did some things at a 5 and two things at 2, overall a 4 rating.

What they did well, food was cooked well and just as good as if you had ordered it as a single entree.  This matters because catering larger quantities sometimes leads to quality problems.  They provided take home containers for the leftovers and didn't hurry us out and throw food away.  This was very thoughtful and much appreciated.  They were helpful and professional the entire time they were with us and during our event.  The price was very reasonable.  It is easy to spend a great deal of money and have a great experience (also possible to spend a lot and have a poor experience), it is something even better to spend less and have an equally great experience.  They labeled the dishes, not exactly but with varying degrees of specificity, this was a nice touch.

What they did poorly, they showed up late.  The restaurant is within 4 minutes of our venue.  They showed up about 15 minutes late.  The distance matters because that means they didn't leave until about 10 minutes after they should have arrived.  The guests were already there.  This is also partially my fault since I left them no tolerance window, if I had asked them to arrive with a 30 minute window then they would have been setup just in time for when the guests arrive.  Still showing up later than requested and agreed upon is a poor performance.  The spice levels, I had been very specific the level of spice I wanted in some dishes.  I wanted to have some of the chicken dishes at baby mild, like water, as a food option for people who can't tolerate spicy food.  One of the baby mild dishes came out at near medium spice level.  Some of the dishes were considerably spicier but I had specified those.  This is only a minor negative because the most popular dishes were the spicier dishes.  I also respect that using natural spices isn't the same as using a chemical in a factory, they can't predict the exact potency of each chili.  That being said some of the safe dishes cam across as a bit too spicy.

Let me repeat: the food was delicious.  Very few people had problems with the spiciness of the food, and at the end people swarmed like locusts to take the leftovers home.

The owner is very nice.  Very nice.  I like the guy, I want to be his personal friend.  All the staff were very friendly.  I can't emphasize enough how likable all the people who work here are.  It is really a great pleasure to plan and cater an event with someone who is very friendly.  Not only is he friendly, he is intelligent.  He gives great insight and recommendations.  His food estimates as to volume were spot on.  I will definitely use this catering in the future.  I think if you give this a chance you will thank me, of the many restaurants I contacted this was the most responsive one with the clearest explanations and answers.


Original review:
Some variety for a very good price.

I mainly like this place because my brother jumps at any chance to get lunch with me at this place.  The company makes it worthwhile.

They have less vegetables in the tandoori chicken than I would like (I really like the onions and peppers).

The shining star for this place is that they change up the buffet.  They keep staples like butter chicken on there as well as biryani (it is the Biryani Indian Grill), but they rotate in some very exotic items each time I visit.

I actually don't care for the biryani that much, even though it should be the signature dish.

You don't see much goat or lamb, these are items I am looking for.  Weekdays it is always chicken.  You should really head out here on the weekends and pay the extra $2 for the meats.

Addendum: the chana masala is excellent, the korma, rogan josh, and malabar are all superstars.  I would argue that in Charlotte they have the best mango lassi have ever tasted.  The flavor is potent but it isn't overly sweet.  They have a very robust flavored raita, it is my absolute favorite.  It may not be a great fit for everyone, but the last time I had it there were plenty of vegetables in it and a strong bite to it giving it a very full flavor."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for Indian food. I just had Shrimp Briyani  and Paneer makhani. The food was delicious. Also, the manager Emily and her staff are great and very hospital. I will be coming back here frequently with friends and family."}
{"text":"The owner helps make the experience great, it is a buffet after all.  The food is good, price is fair, and it's packed with Indian customers, so must be good."}
{"text":"We are looking for good Indian in the Concord area. We tried this place, which is next door to a vegetarian Indian restaurant. We had to ask to get service because they were focused on buffet. The servers were polite but dressed like warehouse workers. We had iddly, which was dry and bland; butter naan, which was salty; rice, also.m bland; butter chicken at spice level three out of six, which was pretty spicy IMO, but acceptable; and goat biryani at spice level four of six, which was so hot that my wife, who has eaten biryani all her life, couldn't tolerate it. It left her nose running. For spice level six, better call the fire department, I guess. On the positive side, the rasmalai was decent, the food was served on attractive stainless steel plates, and actually music from India was very playing. In summary, better than nothing, but not what we had hoped for."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet, which was $42 for three people. About half the patrons were Indian, which I see as a good sign. There was a good variety on the buffet. The curries were a bit spicy for my taste, but not by much. Overall, good and a nice variety."}
{"text":"To be honest, this was one of the worst dining experience I've ever had. I refuse to go to this restaurant ever again. Really cheap looking interior. Water served lukewarm with no ice even on request. 
The waiter argued with us for asking to not serve the appetizer first but to bring it out with the entrees. There were three babies crying super loud because it was around closing time and the owner  refused to find a baby sitter and brought one year olds to a restaurant. It makes me unhappy that a place that had decent food had to ruin the nuance for its customers and I wish they improve on all of these points. Besides that, the flavors were good for the food but even with only 5 tables in the entire restaurant, the food came out barely warm. I really was hoping that this place would've been a great experience but I was entirely let down and walked out 26 dollars less in my pocket for just shy of a 6 ounce portion of food"}
{"text":"I feel like as Indian food goes, Ballantyne is the best place in Charlotte to find it. I also think that Persis biriyani Indian Grill is an excellent choice for Indian cuisine whether you are an Indian 'Desi' or a local Charlottean. The only reason I give Persis a four star rating is that the food is sometimes too oily and sometimes it can take much longer than quoted for an online order. Make no mistake, I will continue to frequent this fine establishment. Overall, the food is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. The first thing I noticed was that my party was the only non south Asians, which I took to be a good sign.  Despite the place being packed, the staff was very friendly and eager to help.  Everything was very clean, and the decor was modern but classy.  I was especially a fan of the stainless steel plates and drink ware. The lunch buffet was some of the best Indian food I've had in a long time. The flavors were varied and everything was very fresh.  My personal favorite was the watermelon smoothie, which was an excellent and refreshing palate cleanser.  While the price was not the cheapest at around $13 for the buffet, the exquisite dining experience was worth it, and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"On the hunt for some Indian food away from our usual stomping grounds, we decided to hit up Persis, out Ballantyne way. Turns out it was a good choice - but only after we had a stumbling block (perhaps even a rather large stumbling block) in the form of the first waiter. The problem was he had no idea what he was serving - may not have even realized that he was working in an Indian restaurant.

Luckily the manager/owner/someone off the street rapidly walked over and began explaining the history of Indian food - at least Persis Indian food, or something that we could believe as such - and wham! the night was saved, just like that.

Would the food itself have been as good without this save? Probably. But it was made a whole lot better with it, especially such items as the cauliflower appetizer that we may never have spotted, and the personal touch that we had thereafter. Definitely made it just a wee bit better, so even though it wasn't bad before, grab this guy if you can."}
{"text":"We had been to Persis in Ballantyne before and absolutely loved it, but this was our first time trying this location. It was awesome.

Firstly, playing Bollywood songs on the TV gets me. Every time. I can't stop singing those songs and it makes me enjoy my food so much more. They also had the India-Australia cricket match playing on another TV which my boyfriend, who is learning to understand cricket, loved watching.

We ordered the chilli paneer appetizer, which was yummy. Chilli chicken tends to be spicy, so make sure to adjust your spice levels accordingly. The flavors melded well, and the paneer had absorbed the spices well. For entree we ordered the goat biryani (anyone surprised?) It was amazing, obviously. If you have never had goat before, you should definitely try it here for the first time. The biryani came with raita (chopped salad in thin yogurt) and a thick curry.

The manager / captain was very nice. He was very attentive, as were the servers, and they all kept asking if everything was good, but not in the intrusive manner. We will definitely be back soon. I'm already drooling at the thought of their biryani."}
{"text":"I am sorry I gave these guys 5 stars in my last review. These guys RUINED my wedding reception!
The fact that I loved their food so much made me sign them up to cater at our wedding reception in October. I had talked to the manager way back in April, decide the menu, talked about the pricing etc. Then in September I called them to make sure we were on track with everything and the manager I had talked to was nowhere to be seen and there was a \"temporary\" manager in his place. He had no idea about any of the things I had talked about with the previous guy, they had kept no records of it, which was very stressful. At that point, we should have found some other place, but we didn't. We went about the whole thing over again, and had to negotiate the price because his price was much higher than what we were quoted earlier (thank god I had it all in my diary). We walked out of the restaurant at least knowing that we would get good food served at the wedding. Then two days before the wedding I called to make sure everything was in place, and the manager had changed AGAIN! This new guy, Reddy, had no idea what I was talking about and told me they couldn't cater on such short notice! Having stressed out enough, I raised some voice and the owner called me and he knew what he was talking about, and I am so thankful he did.
However, at the wedding, these guys brought all the food and NO utensils to serve the food with! Also, they promised us three servers but only two were on the venue at any given time. Also, in spite of telling them to make the Veg Biryani mild, they made it spicy. I am so mad, I will never even think of eating at this, or any other location again, and will NEVER recommend their catering to anyone. 
If you want your event to go smooth, do not even think of having these guys cater. Very unprofessional and mismanaged!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for buffet. Staff is friendly. Lots of options on the buffet. Tandoori chicken and tikka masala chicken is amazing!!! So flavorful and spicy and the chicken is so tender!"}
{"text":"This food is really great.  We had the Gobi Manchuian and the Chicken Korma.  You can order your food on a spice scale of 1 to 6 and we chose 3.  It was perfect.  The Gobi Manchurian reminded me of buffalo shrimp in both taste and texture.  The restaurant was very clean and actually served the food in stainless steel plates and cups.  The service was good.  The only thing I did not like was the Lassi drink which is yogurt based.  I will definately be coming back here."}
{"text":"Spectacular buffet lunch.   I don;t always indulge in Indian food, but this place may change my opinion. While many place serve stale indian food, I think this place makes em fresh and in small batches to keep the food great.

Tandoori chicken is superb. You can tell it just came out of the tandoor.  Crispy and juicy. Lot of flavorful spices.  The biryani is awesome. Fluffy, light, super aromatic.  

Lots of servers and they keep an eye on the food at all times so they never run out. The naan is served in small batches too, to keep em from getting soggy.  

Come ready to eat cos you just can stop!!"}
{"text":"By far the best indian food AND service I have EVER had. Amazing. I think our server's name was Joseph. Freaking amazing."}
{"text":"Worst experience. They kept me waiting for 45 minutes and they were busy in preparing other orders. Atleast they didn't even tell us that our order is going to be late or would take some more time. They served the appetizer but it was also very bad. We didn't like the service and we just left from there and they did not even apologize for the bad service. 

There is no option to give 0 stars in Yelp otherwise I would have given 0 star for this."}
{"text":"Every time we have been there, the food has tasted different. Only the first time it was fresh and tasty. The last two times I ordered chicken 65 and hyderabadi goat biryani from here and each time the chicken tasted very old and had a smell to it and the biryani rice was not cook well and the goat meat had a smell too. Needless to say, I couldn't finish and everything ended up in the garbage both times. I should have learned my lesson after the first bad experience but I wanted to give them another chance since I did have good food here a year ago!"}
{"text":"The methi chicken and onion kulcha were delicious! The chicken in the chicken biryani was soft and fresh! The chicken 65 was also excellent."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at Persis. Our server, Joseph, did an excellent job of helping us choose our dishes. We had some in the group that were gluten free. This was not a problem and we ended up with a varied selection of foods. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoy the quick service and Indian fix within walking distance to work. Nothing spectacular but solid. Not much more to say about it. Works when you need it."}
{"text":"This is awesome indian food. I would eat here every day if my wife would let me. I want to be buried here when I die. The food is that good!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian Restaurant. Everything I have eaten here has been delicious! I normally order take-out, but today I decided to go in and give it a try. 

They have a lunch buffet, and I saw what was on the menu by checking out their Facebook beforehand. I think this is a great idea! 

This place was packed! And that can only mean one thing to me -the food is amazing.

The host who seated me was very friendly. After I got my food, I asked if I could have some onions. I saw someone complained about getting extra onions (and I love onions) so I tested it out. They brought me a good amount. 

My food was so delicious! I had Tindoora, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Biryani, and Naan. And to end an already great meal - They have Falooda! 

I highly recommend this place to everyone! It was $15, which I think is a great price to all the great food!"}
{"text":"We visited Persis late one evening when there was a nice briskness to the air.  We thought it'd be a perfect time to warm up with some of our favorite food!  Upon entering, we were immediately seated and handed expansive menus full of incredible looking dishes.  Being vegetarians, we often seek out Indian food and Persis doesn't disappoint in their offerings.  

A few experiences stood out that night.  Hang with me.  To start, I wasn't comfortable drinking out of the metal glasses, so I asked for glass and the waiter immediately accommodated my request without question.  Graceful and polite. 

Then, the strangeness began.  My husband had decided on biryani at spice level four. The waiter (who we later found out was the owner) tried to convince him that level four was 1. Too spicy for 'people who usually come here that aren't Indian' and 2. Asked a few times if we'd ever had biryani..that it was a very traditional dish.  Once we finally convinced him that both the dish and the spice level were adequate, he insisted upon bringing a sample of biryani so that my husband could try it before he bought it.  The funny part is, the sample was almost as large as a full order.  The spice level was perfect, the sample biryani was delicious, and the main entrée of biryani was a normal portion. They didn't take from it because we agreed to a sample.  

I ordered chana masala with no spice. I found out later they call this  'baby mild' :-). However there must've been some confusion in the kitchen, because the owner told us that there was already an order of chana masala at level four that was confused with my baby mild.  They brought out a new order of Chana masala (still spicy) that looked suspiciously like my original AND offered a complementary order of any other entrée of my choosing.  The owner strongly suggested the paneer with fenugreek leaves. It was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  

All in all, our meal was excellent with a couple of speed bumps along the way. But as they say, it isn't the mistakes but how you recover from them that matters.  We will visit again and again. Delicious food, super value, portions  - wow.  Keep up the hard work Persis!"}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaaaat!! How have I not known about this place?!?! Other cities have way better options on desi food and I've always been generally disappointed in the options in and around Charlotte but this place has won me over. We tried several dishes and all were flavorful, warm, and fresh. I didn't get the \"this just came out of a can/box/whatever\" feel from this place and I love that! The restaurant wasn't super busy around 730 on a Monday night but they did have a steady stream of customers (desi people eat late....LOL). Anyway, the servers were very attentive and quickly and efficiently brought and removed items to and from the table. Cannot wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We go to Persis Biryani once a week on average. The food is that good! I'm giving this one star tonight however. I recommend perhaps not going here on a Tuesday night. The food while delicious as usual came to us via perhaps the worst service we experienced since Persis opened in the University City area. Usually the restaurant is slammed and the table service is amazing...tonight they were slow and both the table service and friendliness of the staff earned a D minus."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was nonexistent. Our first time was on a Friday night. There were only 4 other tables being waited on in the entire restaurant. It literally took over 5 minutes for a waitress to come over after we had been seated. She simply said \"What do you want?\" No smile. No greeting. No introduction. It went down from there. She was very abrupt with our 6 yr old who only wanted to say hey. We ordered two entrees and only got one small bowl of rice. It took about 8 minutes to wave our waitress down to ask for another bowl. She was no where to be found in a restaurant that only has one big section. After several minutes we waved a different waited down to request our rice. We never saw that 2nd bowl. It took over 10 minutes and another waitress for us to finally get our check. Still took another 10 minutes before they returned with our card and receipt so we could leave. Not sure if I will ever go back but if so it will definitely be carry out."}
{"text":"I have been to several Indian lunch buffets around town and I just found my new favorite!  Food was fantastic, nice variety on the buffet and great, attentive staff.  May sound odd, but I really liked the  plate ware - variety of metal plates, bowls, ramekins, etc to use.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet - awesome way to try different indian dishes! Love the paneer saagwala!!"}
{"text":"For the first time I'm giving 5 star rating to an Indian restaurant. We drove all the way from Greenville to Charlotte to eat some good Indian food and I'm glad we been to this place where the buffet was really amazing.
Lots of items to eat from chat, appetizers, South Indian dishes, biryani and desserts. Each and every item was really delicious. I would definite suggest this place if you're in Charlotte. 
I'm going to this place again this coming weekend for sure"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet options in a clean environment with lots of natural lighting and friendly service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Persis. I frequent this place at least twice a month for the lunch buffet. The food is always delicious and the staff always makes sure my needs are accommodated. The guys who work there are consistently polite and professional which is why Persis became one of my favorite places to eat. As soon as I finish eating I start thinking about the next time I want to come back and who else I can tell about the wonderful food!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Better than other Indian food places I've tried in the area for sure. It is a typical buffet style serving, with a variety to choose from. We noticed that most of the patrons were of Indian descent, which is a good sign since they would most likely know quality Indian food over someone born in the US (just saying). Like most Indian places, there is no description of the items in the buffet (like if it contained yogurt or curry, etc), just a sign of what was there. The buffet seemed a little awkwardly laid out, with desserts in the beginning as well as the end. Tandoori chicken was a little touch and disappointing, but the chicken masala was very good by contrast. Prices are cheap. I would come back. Slightly above average, certainly not bad at all other than what I already mentioned."}
{"text":"We found Persis after my husband passed by the place on his way home from the University area.  We've been back more than a dozen times already, and are always willing to drive the distance for their delicious food.  

We've tried many of their appetizers, but our favorite is the paneer tikka.  Even if you don't like Indian cheese (or have never tried it), you MUST get this appetizer at least once.  The paneer is cut into large cubes, baked in a tandoor oven with a delicious sauce, and served with sizzling onions, peppers, and cabbage.  It takes a little longer to prepare, so order it first!

On our first visit, I was initially disappointed with the few shrimp dishes on the menu.  But when I asked if there were any other options, the server offered me shrimp korma.  I'm a huge fan of korma, and jumped at this.  He also suggested switching my husband's dish from lamb vindaloo to methi.  We'd never had methi, so he jumped at trying something new. 

Both dishes are consistently phenomenal.  Their korma sauce is not your standard creamy sauce with raisins and nuts.  This is more of a mix between a korma and a tikka masala sauce, and it's my all-time favorite variation.  The shrimp are also nicely sized and perfectly cooked.  

Their methi is similar in color to a korma (wit just a bit richer color), and it has a more complex flavor.  The lamb is always cooked perfectly.  

We love our bread, and Persis's naan, roti and paratha are marvelous.  We always order extra so we'll have some with our leftovers.  And there always are leftovers, which usually taste even better than even the first time (if you can believe it)!

The dining room and atmosphere complement the food.   They now play soft, relaxing music, which has improved our dining experience tremendously! 

Persis is our go-to spot for Indian food.  If you go, ask for the shrimp korma and lamb methi, even if they are not on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food Rating: 5
Service: 1

This place has very good food but the service is terrible. The lunch buffet is never ready when they open at 11:30. You have to sit and wait 10 to 15 minutes for them to put everything out. If you are going to open at 11:30, be ready at 11:30! If you order any drink other than water you are lucky to get it before you are finished with your meal."}
{"text":"Its not indian,its totally south indian.biriyani has curry leaves in to it.most of the dishes are not made up properly and buffet charge also higher....waste of money"}
{"text":"when we first went to persis it had a great owner nuveen, he treat the staff well paid them far wagers and the rewarded him by taking control of his business while he was in India The is still basiccal the same works just with equal percebtage"}
{"text":"Butter chicken was good. Chicken Tikka was tough (never had it like that before so disappointed).  Atmosphere very nice. Service was strange.  I had to put my hand up everytime we needed something as the server stood at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"On their better days, the food at Persis is moderate at best. It was never spectacular, nor is it inedible. You'd say 'Hmmm not bad'. But on their bad days, you'd get little surprises in your food. One time I found a strand of hair. The second time it was a Stapler pin! And 2 days ago, they really stepped up their game... I found a thumbtack/pushpin (whatever you want to call it) in their Chicken Biryani.

Every time I complained, they'd just shake their head in a fake apologetic manner and carry on. They didn't offer to replace or reimburse. They offered me a free biryani on my next visit, which I am dead sure I do not want!  Who knows what! Honestly, I am still not sure why I kept going back... my bad! 

I guess I have learnt my lesson. We are never going back there and I'll make sure my friends don't too. 

Like they say... third time's the charm!"}
{"text":"You'll be hard pressed to find better Indian Cuisine in the Queen City.  The chicken tikka is incredible.  The beer selection isn't amazing but they offer microbrews at very affordable prices ($3.50).  You know it's a good sign when the restaurant is nearly full and you're the only one who isn't from Indian decent.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I called in a take out order for lunch one weekday.  I ordered the paneer butter masala...#5 spicy and buttered naan.  

The man on the phone was a little pushy.  He asked me about three times if I was sure I wanted #5 spicy and about 4 times asked if I knew which location I had called.  Yes...I'm sure on both.

The order was ready in 15 min.  It was really spicy and really delicious.  I loved it.  The spice amount is pretty dangerous if your not used to it, so choose wisely.  The sauce was creamy and tasty.  The naan was a little more crisp than I like it, but overall satisfactory.  I will definitely try this place and location again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is some of the best Indian food I've had. I set my standards low because coming from Atlanta I didn't expect much. However, the service and food at dinner was fantastic. Our waiter was polite and helpful at recommending dishes. He checked on us regularly and we never had to wait very long. We got chicken tikka masala and another dish that I can't remember the name of (it is green and has spinach and cottage cheese). Both were delicious, especially when paired with the garlic naan bread. I'd definitely recommend this place. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here w a large group on a Friday night. The evening started off smoothly enough - our waiter was friendly and quick to bring waters for everyone. The meal took a turn for the worse at that point. The waiter disappeared for 45 mins while we waited to place our order. When he got around to us he kept ducking out while we ordered to take care of other patrons. The food took nearly another 40 mins to arrive, so do not come here if you are starving when you sit down as I was. 

The food - to preface this I have eaten Persis catered food at many an event and have usually enjoyed it. However the waiter was not clear on spice levels so you have been warned - don't order above a mild (#2) unless you want to be crying in pain during your meal! I am of south Asian descent and I ordered medium spice goat biryani. It was nearly inedible.  Not to mention they had cooked the goat in way too many cloves. Chili paneer app was delicious, as was gobi manchurian, although gobi was again quite spicy. Fellow companions enjoyed their more mildly spiced lamb vindaloo. 

Now reaching the end of this epic meal, our waiter disappeared once again and the bill took 30+ mins to arrive after two companions chased him down twice. Once we got our bills we were told the credit card machine was broken and the waiter had to hand write (!) my number down to charge me later. So yet another warning - bring cash. 

My thoughts - if you have a craving for biryani or manchurian style (Indian Chinese) food, place a takeout order. But I cannot recommend sitting down for a meal."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars
Everything Else - 0 stars

This might be the best Indian food I've had in Charlotte.  Unfortunately it was also one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.

The portions were weak The music was terrible and loud.  And our server was super awkward. He could barely speak English, hovered around creepily, and put his hands all over the silverware and plates. Literally the last guy in the world that should be a server (I've worked at a lot of restaurants). Ok, I get that you hired your relatives or whatever... but why can't your food runners at least speak English?
 
But when it comes down to it, I put a lot more stock in food than service, and I'll def be back... I'm just picking up to go."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Good variety and very tasty. The front manager was also very gracious. Definitely coming back next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I saw Persis when I was leaving the Jojang upstairs and added it to my list of places to try. My first experience was takeout chicken Tikka Masala. It is a tomato based bisque with spices, peppers, and chicken that tickle the taste buds in the most delightful way. It isn't spicy, despite its red color. I tried it again and there weren't as many peppers included. Met up with a buddy for lunch so I could try the buffet and get a taste of as many dishes as possible.

The thing about Indian food is that *to me* it is not visually appealing. You have to be willing to close your eyes and eat. They have a green bean based dish that was good, but very salty. You'll want to eat this wish white rice to tolerate the saltiness. The chicken curry was okay, but not overwhelmed with the chicken flavor. The chicken tikka masala was still great. They biryani (rice) was good and flavorful. I got the kind that was colorful. What was not good was the rice yogurt. It was bland and I expected it to be a dessert, but that was not the case. 

Because it was a buffet, service was very hands off. They will seat you and that's it. You're on your own. No one to ask questions nearby.  Nevertheless, everyone is nice and I recommend you visit Persis. Great $10 lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Very good. When for Saturday buffet and everything was hot and delicious. The only reason Persis doesn' t get 5 stars is because they started burning incense in the restaurant which they didn't need because the smell of the food was good and incense can over power everything , even your taste buds."}
{"text":"It's been downhill for the past year or so, new management or new chef, either way not worth your time or your money: far better Indian food places than this"}
{"text":"This place has the best indian food I have ever had. Very authentic and the flavors make you feel like you are in Mumbai. The only problem is the service is very slow. Don't come here if you are on a schedule. The service is polite just very slow. I had the butter chicken. It was amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Indian-- buffet or not! The naan is great, the chicken tikka masala is yummy. My boyfriend and I go here anytime we are in the area (usually about once a month). We usually get take out, but we occasionally have time for the buffet! He really likes flavorful food, so this is a winner for both of us!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Their food is authentic and delicious. I had the butter chicken and I had to order another one to go so I could keep eating it the next day. The rice was delicious and so was the naan. My only complaint was that the waiter seemed a little annoyed with us because we could not pronounce the names of the dishes and we had a hard time understanding him but that was understandable. It was a wonderful place and I will certainly be back"}
{"text":"Ah, the long missing Biryani place for Charlotte. Charlotte had its share of Indian restaurants, few as they might be - but none of them had a good biryani, a good gobi manchurian, or a good (fresh) samosa. There were places with good north indian curries (mostly because of the amount of cream they used), but they either did not have the biryani, or if they did, they made it in the most horrible way possible.

This is a brand new restaurant - its barely been 3 weeks since it has started (and I've already been there 10 times - that says something, doesn't it?), and while they are still experiencing growing pains, and having trouble dealing with the crowd that comes in, curious about the new place, the quality of the food, as well as the taste, is amazing. I can flat out say that these guys make the best gobi manchurian I've had in the US (and I've tried it at MANY places). I've already said a lot about the biryani, but let me add one more thing - it takes you back home. Its very tasty, doesn't have the raw masala we come to expect in Indian restaurants in the US, and its very well done.

The curries they have are great as well. Due to the limited menu they have currently during the opening weeks, I haven't been able to try all the varieties, but of what I've tried, all of it is super tasty, not extremely creamy, and feels good in the stomach (if you've ever had indigestion issues after eating in some of these Indian restaurants, you know what I mean). 

The staff are extremely friendly, helpful, and very eager to help. Right now, Bhim (the manager) is probably the only one who is good at what he is doing, but as I said, its a new place, and it will improve over time. The chef is also very friendly, and is always open to any input you might have.

Overall, relative to the other places around Charlotte, this easily gets 5 stars. I will probably go here again and again, until I get completely tired of the place, or a doctor tells me that it is very unhealthy to eat out every other day. :)"}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my boss. He was traveling through Charlotte for business and was staying at the Aloft which does not have an onside restaurant. After some research I came across Persis and pointed him in their direction. Mind you that I work for an extremely picky eater so my fingers were crossed that he would like this place and that the reviews were accurate. HE LOVED IT! He said it was some of the best Indian food he has had and got 4 entrees! If my boss loved it, I guarantee ANYONE who likes Indian food will too!"}
{"text":"Service was 5 stars, but food-wise, the best thing was the mango lassis and the naan. We ordered our dishes medium, and what we received was MUCH spicier than medium. I took one bite of my dish and knew I couldn't eat anymore - and I enjoy Sriracha to give some indication for how hot this was. My husband ate about half of his, because his spice tolerance is much higher than mine, but even he said it was really more of a hot than a medium. Within a few hours though, he knew there was a problem. Suffice to say something, probably the chicken, was bad. We ended up having to throw out more than half of our leftovers when we realized it. We won't be back..."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place. I go to the lunch buffet here all the time. Typically, I am not a fan of buffets, dry room temp food...bleh...but Indian food seems to hold up well on a buffet. 
   This is THE best of the best when it comes to Indian buffets. In case you haven't picked up on it yet, this review is purely on the lunch buffet since I have never ordered off of the regular menu. And who can decide anyways when faced with a full indian food menu?! Who doesn't want a veggie dish AND a meat dish...and daal and an app AND dessert .... or is it just me?? So I find myself way more decisive when going to the buffet. \"I'LL HAVE SOME OF IT ALL THANKS!\" Easy.
   So having been to my fair share of Indian buffets in my life including Aroma (which is good but the selection is quite limited) and the late great Namaste, I have found my home at Persis. I can't say enough good things...great selections of vegetarian options (usually end up being my fav thing on the buffet and great for when you get stuck having to eat with a vegetarian), the food is hot and the chicken is always tender (even though I usually go to the tail end of the buffet time), tastes great and has a nice level of spice ( I can see some items being too spicy for some but if you can't handle spice it is usually wise to steer clear of the dishes with chilis floating around in there), water is delivered instantly and the plates are cleared promptly after you are done with them, and the folks that work there are kind and very enthusiastic about you trying their country's cuisine. I am not usually much of a dessert fan, call me a savory gal if you will, but I do have a sweet spot ( see what I did there?!) for Indian desserts and Persis always has a great one or 2 or 3 on the buffet to wrap up the meal because of course you need more food in your belly after 3 rounds of the buffet!
  I only have a few constructive tips for how they could make the best even better. Fresh naan delivered to your table upon request (as they do at Aroma), throw a mutton dish on the buffet, and ALWAYS have the mushroom matar on there."}
{"text":"This is one of the popular indian restaurants in the Charlotte area. I had visited this place almost close to 15 times since I Iiked their food quality.But down the line unfortunately their service had gone pathetic. The manger and the servers started behaving rude and they never responded to our requests. After all service is equally important as the quality of the food and hopefully their management realizes this pretty soon!"}
{"text":"It is sooo good. Period! Fresh food, flavorful, and always hot.  Lamb roganjosh superb does not disappoint.  Chicken masala absolutely wonderful.  Warning if you can't handle spice then always go level 1.  I got level 2 on my masala and my mouth was on fire, but it was so good.  

We love this place, but tonight was even better."}
{"text":"Always great food here, whether it's biriyani or any other curries. Try their Goat biriyani!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Seemed like they did not want my business. The waiter didn't want to answer questions at all. Even had to wait to pay the bill. I figured they would be fast to get the money because food and service are clearly not the priority."}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic Indian cuisine and great staff. We love Indian food so have eaten at many Indian restaurants in Charlotte and this one is the best by far.  Their tandoori chicken is to die for. Can't wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"It's my second time in this reastaurent this one is best in Charlotte I enjoy the food.services people also very nice it's really very natural and authentic Indian reastaurent I liked it and I recommend to people to visit this place."}
{"text":"My husband loves Indian food. It is a cuisine he got accustomed to during his business trips to Dubai. we were very excited when we found this restaurant in the Balantyne area.
The menu looked very promising , It has a wide variety of items. we ordered, the assorted vegetable platter for appetizer and for entrée , the choice was the Shrimp Tandoori and the shrimp Biryani. Surprisingly, we got the Shrimp Tandoori ( entrée ) before the appetizer. In a way that was good because it was the only plate we enjoyed. The rest was a disaster, The appetizer was mainly a combination Jalapeno peppers and onions dipped in dough and fried.  It lacked any taste  so we barely touched any of it. 
The Shrimp Biryani is described on the menu as ( unique Shrimp Beryani cooked in dum style garden fresh vegetables with basmati rice) . Yet, when we got it , It was mainly rice topped with onions. I don't know what happened to the vegetables mentioned on the menu. On top of that, it was so spicy, we couldn't eat it. We made sure to tell the waiter when we placed the order that we like everything mild and not spicy. That is for the food. As far as the service, the waiter did is best but he seemed overwhelmed.
After all, it was a bad experience and a waste of money. We definitely will  not go back."}
{"text":"I work in the area and this is one of my favorite lunch spots. I probably eat here 2-3 times a week. The main reason I love this place is the variety in dishes they serve for their lunch buffet. Most other places I've tried they serve a limited number of dishes and chicken is the primary meat. But here, they got chicken, goat, fish, etc. And they seem to put out a couple new items a day so it doesn't get old or boring. They also do brunch buffets on Sundays too. Great place for healthy and satisfying lunch if your into Indian food."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here at the Asian Festival this year. They ran out of the vegetarian dishes I wanted, along with the rice and naan. They still tried charging me full price, I bartered and a dollar was taken off. The chana masala was good, a little bit spicier than expected, but really liked the fresh tomato and cilantro on top that I mixed throughout the dish to really accentuate the flavors. Also had some gobi, also good.

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, as the food was mediocre.. nothing significant about the food, customer service or price stood out as being significant."}
{"text":"Still very good. I just love the variety in flavors and superb quality and freshness of every dish served on the buffet. What a deal!"}
{"text":"I always order take out from this place during lunch time. The portion is great and taste is better! One lunch take out has always been enough to feed my family of four. I am very pleased. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved these guys my husband and I have tried them for both lunch and dinner.

Lunch experience: VERY BUSY! Your sometimes lucky to get a table if you arrive a bit after noon. We found one table that was right in front of the Buffett, so it was quite noisy. The food was great and appeared fresh and tasted great. I think it was considered pretty expensive for a lunch buffet however.  I remember us spending about 3ish dollars for the two of us and then two week later, it the price was reduced to 11 dollars. It was really pricy for what it was for the first experience. 

We have come back several more times and we have had a wonderful dinner there. I am a big fan of their chicken masala and butter chicken and the chicken chettinad.

The waiter had checked on us thought our meal and was always full of the water jugs that they use for drinks. It appeared that they had a fully stocked bar with a collection of beer also.

I highly recommend this place for a great dinner."}
{"text":"Great authentic South Indian food!

Last time I went I ordered Masala Dosa and Lamb Vindalu and try we're both pretty good.

Service is extremely helpful and they really make it easy for those not so familiar with the cuisine, order any of their delicious dishes"}
{"text":"A very authentic style Indian restaurant off of Mallard Creek Church road, Persis delivered high quality, delicious food at a reasonable price - a good value.  The food itself was spicier than many of the other Indian places in town, and certainly tasted a bit more authentic than their competitor's fare as well.  

The day I went, I tried several dishes including a chili, vegetarian curry of sorts (the name was all in Indian, so I'm not really sure what it was called), Chicken Tika Masala, and a Goat curry.  

The chili curry was great, set your hair on fire, delicious.  Really a star.  The Tika Masala was pretty decent as well, and actually had a bit of spice in it, which is quite different than some of the other places around town that serve the same dish.  I also really enjoyed the Goat curry, although it may be a bit more \"extreme\" than some casual Indian foodies might like seeing as how much of the goat meat came \"bone-in\" style.  I wish they didn't crisp the naan so much, but really... it was a minor imperfection in the grander scheme.  

Service was fine, but then again it was a buffet, so I'd rather not venture a critique on that.  Overall the experience was great however.  Decent food, decent location with easy access to the main road, in, out, stuffed so full you pass out at your 2pm meeting - a winner!"}
{"text":"I'm upping my opinion of this place.  Management, it would appear, has listened to the masses and (at the moment) they're trying to open this location on-time or before 11:30.  Novel concept, and I welcome the change.  I'm glad to see they are taking their customers more seriously, and I've added this spot back into my work-lunch rotation.  Nice job, now if only they could figure out the soggy naan conundrum...."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner over the weekend. We arrived close to closing time. We were greeted and seated immediately and provided bottled water. We were starving so put in our order shortly after arrival. I ordered the chicken korma and my husband order the chicken tikka masala. The waitress asked us how spicy we wanted the food and we asked for a medium level of spiciness. The waitress confirmed that it would be \"Indian medium spicy.\" We love spicy food,  so that was good to hear. 

The food arrived shortly after and wow was it good- it was great!!  The spice level was just exactly what we expected.  The flavor as on point and it was just delicious.  I couldn't finish my entire dish and so I took the left over chicken korma to go. I ate it 2 days later and it was still really good!  

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very worst briyani I never had..we ordered goat briyani to go order... Goat piece like a hard rock eating feeling... Old goat they're pushing out for those who order for to go... If you're interested to taste real Indian briyani don't go there.."}
{"text":"We are a regular at this restaurant and never been disappointed. 
The staff is good and food is excellent for the Indian palette. Joseph is the one we take advise from on specialities on the menu."}
{"text":"This was really the best India buffet lunches I have experienced.  I am not a great big fan of Indian cuisine but when I can see and read what I am about to consume, it's a lot easier.  With numerous selections, I made two trips to the buffet for lunch and I never do that!  I ate way more than I should have.  The best items were chicken and vegetable biryani, butter chicken (delicious), papad, plantains, and the fresh fruit.  Everything I had was delicious because I selected them.  My only issue was that mango pudding was not on the buffet this particular day.  Otherwise, this was a great meal and really look forward to returning.  Oh, and service was great and I ran into a former co-worker!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food place so far in  this area. I loved the buffet here it was good. all fresh curries and Puri bhaji.  they do have delivery but not for the lunch time; which was the only thing i felt was weird. rest everything was good."}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed with this experience since Aroma just blew me away a few weeks ago. 

I ordered a Goan breeze to start, was pretty good. It was like a strong piña colada. We started off with gobi manchurian and were sadly disappointed. Gobi manchurian is supposed to have this crunchy texture. It's almost like you shouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and orange chicken which was just lacking here. 

The we ordered the malai kofta and goat pepper fry. The malai kofta had 4 small, round dumplings and the sweetness of the dish overpowered the spice. On the other hand, the goat dish was so spicy it couldn't be finished. We also ordered the chicken biriyani. It had good flavors but was also lacking in heat. 

The waiters didn't check on us once nor asked the desired spice levels of our dishes. This is experience was ok but not amazing."}
{"text":"Whenever we go to Fox and Hound for poker, we like to get takeout chicken biriyani (order it spicy!) from Persis since Uptown Charlotte is an Indian food desert. We called in about 30 minutes before closing and were a little hesitant to pick up since he said it would be ready in 15 minutes. But, to our surprise everything tasted perfect. Great flavor with the earthy spices and heat with the chilies. The portion size is also reasonable. I haven't been to the buffet before, but I do love my takeout biriyani, will be back for more. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The staff is wonderful and the food is out of this world. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the buffet here. I get to try a lot of different Indian dishes. I've had the weekday buffet for $9.99 the weekend buffet for $11.99 and the special buffet on Christmas for $14.99. The special buffet has goat, lamb, fish and chicken and unlimited mango lassi. Weekday buffets have chicken, paneer and veggies and usually tea or orange drink.

Lots of Indians eat here so that's a good sign. I like this buffet more than the others I have tried."}
{"text":"I come to Greenville every year to visit grandparents. This is the first time I tried this restaurant since it first opened in 2017.

Chaat papdi, chai, naan, paneer Ki sabji was delicious. 
The prices are incredible. Cool hall.
Restaurant is clean.

I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"There wasn't a long line at this place during lunch on Monday. Overall the food is decent and edible, but the price is too high for what you are getting. Portion sizes are plenty.  The flavors are a little more on the bland side, save for the overuse of cardamom. The spice level is about a 2.5 out of 5. Those who do not like their Indian food very spicy would feel at home here. If you're in a hurry and over on the South Church side of town then this place would do. Otherwise, keep walking and visit Nirvana II where you'll get higher quality for the price.  

Chicken Tikka Masala was the best dish to my surprise. This chicken was a little on the dry side, but the sauce made up for it. 

I don't recall the name of the dal/lentil dish I had, but it used a green lentil.  This was more of a soup. It was very watery and quite bland.  Steer clear.

The vegetable biryani was also rather bland. It appears the rice was pre-cooked and then a biryani paste and vegetables mixed into the rice, leaving most of it white without flavor. Capsicum/bell pepper was used in the dish which I think is uncommon. The chicken biryani also looked this way. I was hoping for some good biryani as there really isn't any good places uptown.

The naan wasn't bad. A little soggy, but had good flavor."}
{"text":"I love Indian food!  I've dined at this place 6 times now (2x buffet, 1x take out, 3x dinner menu) and each time has been amazing.  Food has been fresh and delicious.  I can only speak for the vegetarian dishes because that's what I like, and they are comfort food.
The samosas (appetizer) are perfection!  Honestly, I can just have that as a meal and leave a happy girl.  
The Kofta dish is amazeballs ... literally!  The aloo gobi is refreshing!  Naan is soft, chewy and fresh.  
Service is warm and inviting. Complimentary thin cracker bread is served with three chutneys.  The red/onion one is my favorite.
All in all this little place is at the top of my list these days."}
{"text":"This is a great southern India restaurant!  The staff is very friendly and the service is outstanding.  Be sure to ask for Joseph.  He is most knowledgeable and will order for you if you wish.  I strongly recommend you eat here soon."}
{"text":"Came here the other day since I was really craving Indian food and was not disappointed. The butter chicken was delicious and creamy and the naan was very flavorful and the perfect texture. The rice was very flavorful and aromatic, definitely impressed. I got my food to go and the staff were all very friendly. I'll definitely have to come back as this place is only 10-15 minutes from my house. I am so glad to find a good Indian place near me! The other one I tried near University (passage to India) was just awful. I'll be back very soon to sit in and enjoy with a glass (or two!) of red wine :)"}
{"text":"We do not live in this area of Charlotte, yet had a friend date that called for sharing a meal together. We were SO EXCITED to try Persis as we realized they offered a buffet on Saturday. Everything was amazing! We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"After attending a Friday night event with friends... we used Yelp to search out something close for dinner. Indian sounded really great, and we had not tried this place yet. So glad we did! Not only was the food phenomenal, our waiter as well as the staff who came to our table to chat.. were extremely pleasant and helpful in assisting us with our likes/dislikes. This was a major plus for our experience! They do serve a buffet that at the time we came was not open. So this will be our next visit so we can try everything! Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there because of an expiring groupon...will be back bc it was just great.  We had the Chicken Vindaloo (Spicy in just the right way) and vegetable Korma and both were outstanding.  The waiters were nice and attentive and obscenely helpful with descriptions.  We also had the basket of assorted Naan and that was just perfect.  Very pretty decor with the stainless plates, cups and serving dishes.

i'm a fan"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. I'm a huuuuuge fan of Indian cuisine and I definitely got my itch scratched here. We were the first ones in for dinner service - I was a bit eager cuz I missed the lunch buffet - so we were told to sit wherever. The owner greeted us and we got water right away. The app came out pretty quickly, probably because we were the only ones there. 

The food was excellent, I wasn't disappointed by a single thing. I ordered an extra entree in case the portions were a bit small... There was no need, I didn't even finish the dhal which was what I really wanted. The aloo paratha could have used a bit more aloo for my taste but it wasn't a big deal.

For everything that we got, the bill was less than I expected, WIN! I'll definitely be back. Gotta catch the buffet next time cuz I tend to want everything on the menu."}
