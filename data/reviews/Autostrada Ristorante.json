{"text":"This was my third time at Autostrada Restaurant.  The first time was great, second not so much, so I went the third time to give it another chance because I enjoyed it so much the first time.  This time was beyond my expectations.  Kim, the manager, took care of our group of six, making recommendations as to what are the best dishes to order.  Things that she recommended that were a huge hit with our group were the lamb appetizer skewers, pizza with gorgonzola, pears and arugula, and an imported cheese appetizer with crostini.  Our main dishes were all to die for.  I had the fish in parchment paper with potatoes and black olives - delicious.  Other dishes at the table included lamb, mushroom risotto, steak and Ahi tuna.  To end this most delicious feast we had a variety of deserts and each one of them was mouth watering.  What can I say?  We all loved it so much and would not hesitate to highly recommend this trendy place to anyone looking for good Italian food."}
{"text":"Got tricked again.  Heard good things about the pizza at this place but, was pretty disappointed tonight.  Was not even a bit impressed about the pasta too.

Only 2 things i liked here, the little pieces of bread and the garlic butter that came with it.  Everything else was very disappointing.  

1 pizza 1 pasta 1 order of app = $65, came out hungry and craving for pizza pizza (yes, even pizza pizza tastes better to me than this place).

Will i come back... probably not."}
{"text":"Although there are a multitude of Italian restaurants in the area, Autostrada is definitely above the rest in providing an authentic and modernized interpretation of Italian food. 

The atmosphere is unlike anything found North of Toronto. The decor is done beautifully. 

You could definitely taste the quality of the fresh ingredients used. A definite must have is the prosciutto platter and the Torino pizza! Don't skimp on dessert either! 

Great service! The staff was knowledgeable about the food and the extensive wine list! Recommendations were extremely helpful and welcomed! 

If you are craving delicious food and an enjoyable night out, Autostrada is a must!"}
{"text":"If you get only one thing here, get the prosciutto platter! The food is excellent, the service is good, and the ristorante is very clean. The ambiance is not very intimate or romantic, more like a huge family feast at Nono's house on a Sunday. They never seem to have the wine I order off the extensive list and always bring me one that costs more."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Autostrada and it was a great experience. The restaurant is gorgeous and SO well designed! Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and the food was amazing. I will definitely return next time I'm in town and highly recommend Autostrada."}
{"text":"Terrible service, waited more than 1.5hrs for food. Food was ok though and decent portion sizes. Long wait and service was such an issue however it would prevent us from coming back again. 

Although the restaurant is designed like a Michelin tire it is not worthy of a Michelin star."}
{"text":"Kind of an odd atmosphere. 
It was very empty when we came. 
I ordered a cosmo but they could not make it my husband ordered a mudslide but they did not know what it was ! 
All in all we will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I had one of the many specials which was lamb chops and sausage. We ordered a bunch of apps for the table and really liked the grilled calamari and the Arincini. While the food was awesome the service is another story. The server seemed like he never has gone through formal training. He was friendly enough but nothing special. The menu on the website is somewhat different from the one in the restaurant. Perhaps the on line menu is out of date."}
{"text":"Delicious meal. Fresh food. Great service. Highly recommended.
We had the fish of the day, and one of us had the seafood pasta. All main courses were amazing."}
{"text":"WTF happened is the first thing my Wife said to me when she got home from Autostrada Ristorante. 

After an evening with her co-workers she told me they had a horrible experience with the Seafood Linguini. Only one person that ordered a Fish dish was happy with it.
When they told the Waiter it was over cooked he said \"you have to tell me next time you want it al dente\" WHAT ???

She went on to say he had the balls to wave his arms in the air to get them to leave at the end of their meal. Who does that? When confronted about his rude gesture he changed his tone and acted like he did nothing wrong. 
Total FAIL on his part and Autostrada. 

I've been there with my wife many times and never had a problem with the food or service. I hope this was a once off because this is not what we've experience in the past.

Btw if the owner is reading this, it was the older Italian man with a thick accent because my wife couldn't remember his name and conversely she doesn't want to remember this entire evening at all....Sept 23rd 2014"}
{"text":"I'm usually never in Vaughan unless I have a reason to be there.  I just had dinner at Autostrada and I have to say considering I'm an enthusiastic urbanite I was mildly impressed with the menu and the wine selection.  However, I'm a foodie and where's there's good food, I'm there!

Our waitstaff was attentive and provided an alternative when the bottle of wine we wanted wasn't available. He went over the specials in detail and it ranged from roasted rabbit to cod stew with potatoes to orange roughy.

I ended up having the Casareccia Pasta with rapini and sausage.  It was good although I found the sausage a little too salty for my liking. Keep on mind I hardly use salt when I cook at home.  Other dishes at our table included pan seared quail and steak with frites and salad.
 
The venue itself is very modern and circular in design. A lot of textured white walls with hits if colour and stainless steel.  The space is able to accommodate large groups and and a room in the back for private functions that can seat 25-35 people comfortably

If I'm in Vaughan I would stop in again."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place out, you must!! Amazing food, atmosphere, and service. We had a group of 12 for my Dads milestone birthday and it couldn't have been more perfect. 

Not only did they accommodate our group for a last minute booking after we had to move from another restaurant due to a bad experience, but they reserved the entire back room for us! We were over the moon. It worked well having some extra space with two younger kids who were able to have their own table to keep busy at. 

From the minute we walked in, we were wowed! Hostess was super friendly, the restaurant was beautiful (very upscale modern) and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. It wasn't too loud either which was nice. Our server Gus was incredible too! We were so well taken care of throughout the night. We never had to wait long when we needed something, he was on top of everything. Even the kids were so well looked after which us parents appreciate considering other nice establishments can sometimes treat children like a nuisance. 

You have to try the Prosciutto platter - soo good! Everyone was happy with their food - from salads and grilled calamari, to pastas and pizza -it was delicious!! Loved the Calamari and salad it came with. Still thinking about it. I also had the caramel cheesecake for dessert and it was soo tasty and very light which I liked. If you are looking for a nice place to eat or celebrate something special, this is it. You won't be disappointed!! Ask for Gus:)"}
{"text":"most exemplary
pasta was tasty
good spot for kids too
we had a big group which had a private room
we had pizza- wood oven very good"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I went for dinner with 2 friends and we all enjoyed our dishes. The service was a bit slow at time even though there wasn't many customers in the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place nonetheless."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times and my previous visits were amazing. I really enjoy the food and its all very reasonably priced.
First star for good staff
2nd star is for location and being close to home (Vaughan)
3rd star is for having a very trendy decor 
4th is for delicious food!

I've had the rabbit ragu, its very good. 
The gnocchi with pistachio sauce is absolutely delicious! I love it! 
 We also went there  for new years, I had the lobster ravioli with rose cream sauce. It was stuffed with meat and it was really yummy! I wish it were something regular on the menu, as I took leftovers home and on new years day, it was my first meal... Yes! 

So on a Friday night, we went again. We got the pizza stefania to share. It has garlic spread, prosciutto and argula on top! Really really good... Sprinkled with the hot oil... It was on point! I've tried the margarita pizza with French fries on top too, that was good too. I want to try the other pizzas especially the one with pears and walnuts. For entre I got the ricotta and kale ravioli. 
It was bland and not as good as the other dishes I've bad. Dave had the Cornish hen, and he didn't think it was anything special either. The entrees were a complete miss this time around.

I will be back again and stick to the pasta dishes that I know and enjoy. I'll try the other pizzas as well.

PS- Best to make a reservation on the weekends."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was horrendous. I will NEVER be back! I can get delicious Italian food many places in Toronto and the GTA. This will not be it."}
{"text":"Everything here was delicious. 

The pizza, the antipasto, the mains. 

We had an early reservation (5:30 PM) on a Friday and the place was very quiet, but by 7 it was mostly filled. We were a group of 10 and the service was good. 

I would return here next time I find myself in Vaughan. This is definitely One of the better places in the area."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend on Sunday, Sept 15th.  Wasn't super busy, no need for reservations.  Service was up to par and the staff was very friendly.  Striking up small talk and suggesting certain meals.  We started with the burrata and it was delicious.  Was served with olive oil drizzled all over, salt\pepper, tomatoes, and 2 crostini (could have used a couple more as it was a big piece of cheese).  My girlfriend ordered the calabrese pizza and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had a piece and was also impressed.  Could have been a touch crispier underneath for my taste but still delicious none the less.  I had the pasta special, which was penne in a wild boar ragu.  In my opinion it should have been served with a pappardelle or fettuccine but was still very good.  The boar was in a ground form and was impressive.  Not over the top, but impressive.  Overall the meal for the both of us with 2 glasses of wine and tip was a $100.  The burrata alone was $29 (which is the going rate).  You get what you pay for.  Nice portions as well.  This is my 2nd time here and first time writing a review (make sure to order prosciutto platter, had it my first time here and missed out the 2nd) .   I don't' think its over priced, as some people have mentioned.  If you want cheap and big portions, go to Deserts Plus but expect a serious downgrade in quality.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner, all the food we had was amazing. The Primavera pizza was so delicious! I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"We had early dinner on Sunday. It was good food but not outstanding delicious. The restaurant is expensive and one can find the same Italian food quality at near by Italian restaurant. The menu is not very rich. The chairs were stained and not clean. The service was not impressive at all. Over all it is not bad if you want to try something new and willing to pay 15% to 20% more."}
{"text":"I just got back from an evening out for a friends birthday at this restaurant and I, nor anyone else, was pleased despite this restaurants above average rating. Upon entering the restaurant and being brought to our reserved table by our hostess, the party realized that we were assigned the most uncomfortable seating arrangement imaginable. Not only was the reservation for five individuals and they gave us six place settings, but we were placed to sit at an oversized, circular table that definitely did not offer a cozy and intimate environment equipped for over-dinner chitchat. The tables circular shape offered for a cumbersome dining experience once the appetizers, (which sadly were the best part), were brought out as we all had to lean significantly over in order to nibble on our food. The table is just a complete eyesore from a decor perspective and that space could be utilized in a much more useful and efficient way, instead of having such a large and overwhelmingly prominent piece in the place. It's very awkward and should be something that's looked into being removed and replaced with something else.  

The waiter was also somewhat of an experience as he failed to mention that the bottles of water he kept offering to bring to our table and fill our glasses with were not free of charge, but rather $6 each... Now it is one thing to charge for water but it is another to devoid the customer the right of information... especially when they are going to have to be paying for it in the end... Especially when that end costs almost $20 for just water... I found that to be very sneaky and something done in completely ill-taste, earning this restaurant another tick in the bad books. 

However, as previously mentioned, the appetizers were the best part of the dining experience. Our party ordered the \"A4 Torino -Trieste\" pizza and the \"Fritto Misto\" to share, along with complimentary rolls that came with a little dish of hummus on the side, which, for an Italian restaurant was a nice unique touch, something quite unexpected. Thus, as we got to ordering our mains, I was excited. Glancing at the menu a couple times all seemed well and each thing looked like it could be a definite winner... But that was until my food arrived... I ordered the \"A1 Burger\" which was said to be a: 10 oz Angus burger, tomato, mixed greens, sautéed mushrooms and onions, provolone and pancetta, served with home fries, which was plated nicer than it tasted. My friend, whom ordered the same thing asked for some things to be taken off her burger, mainly the mushrooms and when her food arrived they had completely disregarded her wishes, leaving them on for her to evidently pick out. The bread of the burger was also very, very toasted to the point that when we picked up the burger to take a bite it crumbled into a multitude of flaky pieces getting everywhere, from the plate to the table to my lap to the chair... Just a mess all around. Another friend ordered the \"Gnocchi di Patate al Gorgonzola\" and was appalled, describing it as the equivalent to a cream soup, thus, she would not recommend. The other two people in the party ordered \"Casarecce con Cime di Rapa e Salsicca\" and thought it was lacklustre, claiming the pasta to have been overcooked and better if it had been more al dente, considering it was casarecce and it's best when it has a bit of bite. 

Afterward upon arriving home a majority of the party did not feel well. We all felt bloated, ill and nauseous... Which is definitely not a good sign!

To add, the menu lacked an even slight range of vegetarian options for a friend of mine who was vegetarian, and she found the wall of hanging hams and prosscuito's to be offensive. As well, the drinks menu consisted of only different types of wines, which inhibits the customer when trying to decide on their drinks. A drinks menu with a little more variety would have been golden and very much appreciated and would invite another demographic into having a drink or two over dinner. 

All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant. It is overpriced for the quality and type of food that you receive and it is not even very good Italian food. I would recommend that if you're looking for good quality Italian food done right to hit up Marcello's which is just within the same plaza across the way."}
{"text":"The reviews are mixed on this restaurant, most of the bad ones related to service complaints.  Maybe I have been lucky in the half dozen times I've been, since my experiences have always been top notch.

I would give it a 4.5 which I would usually round down, but here I believe they deserve the extra credit.

There are an abundance of Italian restaurants in the area, but this is one of the few that remind me of eating in Italy.  The menu is not the typical lasagna and veal parm.  They have dishes like pappardelle with rabbit, which I've had twice and would highly recommend.  They also have a long list of specials which I end up asking the waiter to repeat a few of to make sure I get the best.  Every time I've been, one of the specials has been a while fish, such as Spigola.  I've had it before and recommend trying it at least once.

This time I ordered two items off the list of specials.  First was the buratta.  I've been ordering this from Italian restaurants since it became all the craze a few years back.  I can safely say this was the best I've had.  Very fresh with perfect textures, slightly firm exterior with cream like centre.  We got a second order for the table and everyone wolfed it back.  I could have done a third but let's not wear it out.

Next I ordered the double pork chop.  Unique presentation on a wide wooden board.  Perfect cooked, pink in the centre not overdone like most pork.  Accompanied by Parmesan potatoes and a a mix of heirloom vegetables.  If you hear this on the list of specials, jump on it.

They take things seriously here.  There is an advanced system of storing wine in various types and temperatures of fridges, some of which is on display.  The meats are aging behind glass high up on display.  I always start up a conversation with the staff.  They are all knowledgable on the food and wine, and in some cases are from or knowledgable about Italy.

If you have had a bad experience, give it a second try."}
{"text":"Went to Autostrada after always driving by and seeing there luminescent green lights outside their eatery. It was a Saturday night, with friends and after having no success getting into  Marcello's, we gave Autostrada a try. The place was quickly getting busy and this impacted the attentiveness of our server. When approached for our orders we were told that a number of wines were unavailable as well as being told that the spaducci was also not! Why?!? It's a Saturday night! The shocker was watching our waiter ask if we were done with out hot sauce which we just dipped in and then give it to another table to use!! That's gross!
The mains we ordered were good, I had the rabbit with pasta and others ordered the lamb chops (over cooked), and the seafood pasta. Portions were good and relative to the price. My concern was the service, we were not given a wine list and had to ask, the waiter never came back to ask how our dishes were which would have allowed us to point out the well done lamb. We skipped dessert and when asked each one i our party if they would return, the overwhelming response was a No. 
While this place is nicely decorated, and the food not bad, the lack of service would direct us to go back to Marcellos instead."}
{"text":"Autostrada is a really cool concept and the food is definitely 'molto buona'! The atmosphere and interior decoration is worth a visit alone but when you taste their food you will want to go back again for sure. We ordered a half dozen oysters, which were HUGE, the biggest I've seen in a while. Then we had the lamb speducci, which was served on skewers with an aioli sauce to dip. The grilled octopus or the 'polipo scoglio' was very large & seasoned just right. Then the T-Bone steak came out and it was MASSIVE, no joke. This thing was exactly what the doctor ordered and I love the fact that they pre-cut it, otherwise it would have taken me half the night to carve the damn thing. They served it with beets (red &  yellow), carrots, kale, broccoli, tomatoes, and mixed greens...OH my Gawd this dish was Yumface McGee. I love the fact that when the waiter came out with my huge steak knife he said, \"your weapon sir\". Very fitting indeed."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately I'm giving it a rating of 3/5 because of lackluster service. As one person in our party was ordering, our waiter told them \"okay, you're done\" and moved on to take the next order. We were all extremely shocked that he'd say something so rude. He said that he asked \"how do you like your steak done\", but all 5 of us heard what he truly said. But to be fair, they seem extremely understaffed and the servers are very overworked and stressed out. On the bright side, once we voiced our concerns, our server was very attentive to us which was nice because we felt quite unwanted prior. We also have dietary restrictions to gluten in our party, and we asked that the chef please only grill the meat and please ensure the meal is gluten free, but unfortunately we felt like they did not cater to our request because we had a typical reaction that we would to gluten. Very unfortunate but the food was extremely delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Last night we had a small gathering to celebrate my brother in laws engagement!
The night was just not coming together with our plans, from cars breaking down and so on.... Basically, last
Minute, We ended up here.

The first impression was nice, the decor is very beautiful and unique. It's tall ceilings, light fixtures and decor selections really make this place stand out! The loud voices though, should have been hushed with music, but oddly there was NONE on a Saturday night! The place was a bit bright and the seating was a bit too open and close to everyone else, not my preference,

We were finally seated (in a more or less private area, which my hubby firmly requested) and had to wait for our server, and wait for our server, and then wait some more, oh yes.... And wait for our server! 
  Finally my husband found someone and asked if we can order something, anything, with anyone! It's been a long night, 5 hungry people and we were SUPPOSED to be celebrating! Not waiting and waiting! With no hi hello, please excuse me, be with you In a moment, excuse my MIA or anything!

They finally got our appetizer yes ONE to share amongs 5 ppl! (thanks to my hubby we at least had something) but wait did I mention we still had to wait for our server? We had not ordered our drinks, our wine, our own apps or even dinner!
Long story short; our server was busy serving the rest of the restaurant, which is probably Not his fault, BUT when he would appear he was rude, drained
And just not
Pleasant! at One point I said' I'm sorry, did I upset you? You seem very upset!' (More like RUDE) for example I got the steak which was supposed
To be gluten free, he says to me DONE?!? I reply excuse me, did you just say done?!?,, and I look at my husband.... The server replays, 'yeh, the steak, how do you want it done!!' UMM.... Medium, thank you....
So he gave me a free glass of wine... For being rude and my putting him on the spot, the only lady with 4 other man at the table. Ok that was nice, free wine  
    but let's get to what really sucked, more then 1hour after our arrival and being seated we ordered dinner:
I was very firm and specific withy my ALLERGY! 
I CANNOT eat gluten, my meal MUST be GLUTEN FREE!!!! (I called a head made sure it's doable, I also confirmed with 2of the servers) Although everyone's food was absolutely delicious including mine, I cannot explain how sick I was by the time the bill arrived! 
****Somewhere, Somehow my food MUST have gotten in contact with a gluten product, I was still Sick most Of today as well! 

I must say although this place is beautiful, the food is delicious and the wine is amazing and even the prices were very reasonable and attractive....

*** our server was such a miserable,
Careless human being, that not only did he nearly ruin our night with his sour attitude,
His careless order taking, by not catering to an 'allergy alert situation'. What would happen if someone with a peanut allergy ate peanuts? .........

That's why I can only give this place 3 starts and not 5. 

HIRE MORE and BETTER staff Please! And play some
Music pleaseeee!"}
{"text":"A1 Autostrada has been somewhat a mystery to me from the time they put up their small logo sign facing Rutherford road. Replacing the previous Italian restaurant, I initially thought that this corner spot was replaced by a Car Dealership or Detailer of some sort. 

That would have been very interesting as this sole building doesn't have the design to permit that, so when I went to A1 it was confirmed that it is still a restaurant however you might be lucky enough to see some rare/exotic BEAUTY nearby. I'm talking about Exotic Cars parked in the lot. :p 

The Concept and Decor is one and the same which excited me slightly more than usual. Unfortunately not having been to Italy myself, I looked up Autostrada is a highway and A1 leads from Milano to Napoli. 

The male service was excellent and knew exactly what the Kitchen had available fresh for the day and even gave us introduction to an Italian Import Cheese which we kindly declined. On a personal level, I was hoping a Formula1 chick decked out in full Ferrari skimpy outfit to compliment this environment. 

The decor is derived from this road/highway/speed/cars concept with White Tire Track designs on the wall, Black colors of the Tires, etc... The Menu is A1 inspired from food of the regions of that stretch of the highway. The speed at which the Food comes out is not exactly on the Fast-lane, but it doesn't matter when you have good companions. 

We started with a Prosciutto Appetizer($25/Large) which features 3 varieties, Jamon(Spanish), Niagara(Canadian), and Parma(Northern Italy). It came with an assortment of regular and pickled Vegetabes(Artichoke, Eggplant, Bellpepper, Figs). 

Overall it was great to experience the 3 Prosciutto and know that PARMA is the popular one amongst our table. The Vegetables were nice except that Eggplant which was almost non-edible even for me. 

ROMA Pizza($16.00) in Mid-Italy comes with Rapini and Sausage and the most memorable part I would have to say the Crust. The Dough was good but that's coming from a Pizza Novice. A-OK 

Rapini Salsicia ($15.00) is a Pasta dish I believe to be known from NAPOLI region. Comes with Rapini, Sausage, Sun-dried Cherry Tomatoes with Strozzapreti Pasta. A-OK"}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant for the first time last Friday to celebrate my best friends birthday. Aesthetically this place is spectacular, incredibly unique for this area. The food was to die for, authentic Italian dishes that you won't find done in this way may places around here. But my server, he was not great at all, I suggest they take out the 18% gratuity on parties 6+ just because of him, he was so bad that the manager had to keep coming to correct his mistakes. He at one point completely forgot another person and i were there and didn't take our orders, needless to say we were pissed.

Despite the waiter situation I highly recommend this restaurant for their food and atmosphere! 

I hade the margarita pizza (nothing like simplicity to find out if the food is good, trust me I've had some horrible margarita pizza) and the panna cotta (heaven on a plate)!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!!! Pizza was great, my daughter had the Bambino, who would have thought Pizza and Fries went together! It was very good. We will return"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, our server had the energy of a wet mop and looked as though she hated her life. The food was sub par, for an \"Italian\" restaurant in the most Italian part of the GTA, I was very disappointed when I realized I could get better pizza at Pizza Nova. The overall experience was regrettable. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I gave Autostrada another chance, this time as a date restaurant. First time I was underwhelmed by the main (the pizza) and the ham platter. The decor (I love the black tile) and the service were memorable. I was looking for a laid back but not cheap Date #2 with Paralegal. Autostrada and a movie at the Vaughan Colossus seemed a nice blend. 

I passed on the pizza and went for the gnocchi. Paralegal had the rabbit pasta. Both were quite passable. Prices are reasonable for finer dining. Service was a touch off. Great to start but we spent a long time looking for our mains and water refills. They kept wanting to take our cured meat appetizer plate. We can work on both? I dunno. The cured meat appetizer was a disappointment. The meat was dry."}
{"text":"Amazing it's like being in italy again. This is clearly a hidden gem. The server deflade the fish right in front of us. The food and service are to die for. Only down fall is the washrooms aren't 5 star more like 4."}
{"text":"I'm giving This place 3.5 stars.  The food was very good. We had the octopus and the pizza with pears and blue cheese.  This is a beautiful restaurant.  The rest rooms need updating and don't match the decor."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Vaughan Mills plaza and has a great environment. Beautifully decorated and has a great menu to choose from.

Everytime my family and I come here we always get their phenomenal assorted meat and cheese platter. Their food is great a italian cuisine, fresh and tasty.

The service is amazing here, we've been seeing the same waiter for about 4 years now. Such a wonderful place to enjoy dinner with family or celebrate in large groups!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was amazing - my only complaint was the alcohol prices.  $11 for a pint of imported beer seems needlessly excessive - definitely eat here, but drink at home."}
{"text":"Just moved to Woodbridge and decided to try this restaurant. I was surprised but it was delicious. We started with the octopus salad and the warm funghi salad. Really enjoyed the dressing on the octopus said but don't think that I would order the warm mushroom salad again, it just wasn't anything special. Then we had a pizza and a plate of pasta that the waiter suggested because we couldn't make up our minds. I can't remember the name of the pizza that we ordered but the pasta was the one with the Italian sausage, rapini and tomatoes. DELICIOUS with some peperoncini. 2 very good choices. The waiter was great we had amazing service maybe cause it was a quiet Thursday night. Will definitely have to go here again, maybe during the weekend."}
{"text":"Just had drinks there. The barmaid was very friendly to us and mean to the other waiters. She likes her power over them. Made for a fun interaction to watch. My guy friend ordered red wine so she called us girls for the rest of the night. I like that sort of humour so it was all good but a fear some others might not. 

The rest of the place looks pretty expensive and a bit snobby but I could be wrong about that."}
{"text":"Cool funky place, Kinda hidden within the plaza, unless you find it and actually try it will be one of your favourite spots.
The decor of the place is very modern but kind of rusty at the same time.

Sitting by the lounge area, you can't see their large finest cuts of meat and dried deli products which is a very cool touch.

Nice menu with some authentic, yet a little watered down version.

Make sure you try their home made burrata, that's about the BEST thing they have, and it's NOT even on the menu. Apparently, they claim that it comes directly from Italy (home made) once every week or two weeks. Whether that's true or not, the Burrata is simply amazing!

We've also tried the antipasto, calamari and the grilled octopus..all are great.

Chicken fettuccine, veal scaloppine and the NewYork steak are some of the items we had tried so far..
Great place if you're in Vaughan, or specifically at the Vaughan Mills area (rutherford/weston/400)"}
{"text":"Autostrada Ristorante is located right across from Vaughan Mills so it is convenient if you come here for dinner after a whole day of shopping or a whole day of exciting fun at Wonderland.

The interior is nicely decorated. I love the display cabinet with all those ham hanging there. There are quite a few booth seatings.. those are so comfy looking! The tables are set quite far apart so you do have a lot of privacy but I cannot even see what other tables eating though :P!

The menu is traditional Italian with Antipasto, pasta, pizza and main course. The Large Prosciutto ($25) consisted of (Parma) Italian, (Jamon)Spanish and (Niagara) Canadian prosciutto nicely presented with antipasto. I like the Parma one the best because I find it not too salty and have the melt in the mouth texture. The Jamon one is a little salty for my taste. The Niagara one is a little too piggy taste (ok ok it is real pork)

I am disappointed with the Roma pizza ($16) and the Rapini Salsicia ($15). The pizza is really burnt on the side and it is a little dry. The pasta is worse, though the pasta is the freshly made type. I do love the chewy and bite of the pasta but Rapini has this overwhelming bitter taste and it is a little dry.

The wine list here is extensive!! A whole booklet even more choices than the food menu!! There are quite a few selections of $200+ bottle of wine!! Yes I see the wine cabinet which is all the way up to the ceiling!

The services here is nice and friendly. Autostrada is a nice place to hang out with friends or have a romantic dinner with someone special! ^0^

They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us visited last night and we were all mightily impressed. It's as though the stars had aligned as the evening was damn near perfect.
We arrived for our reservations at 7:30pm and were promptly greeted at the door. We were shown to our tables and asked if we wanted water...either sparkling, flat or tap. Most places don't offer tap as they don't make money on it, but this place did. When our waiter came back with our water, we ordered a bottle of wine and the Tuttu Misto (cheese/meat/olives/tomato tray). It was a very generous portion size and deelish. Also brought our was bread with humus. The humus was fantastic.....nice bit of heat to it. Great option other than butter. One member of our group also ordered the crab cakes...two huge pieces, I don't like crab so I didn't partake in it but the other three people in our group woofed them down.
Main courses:
Person 1 - daily special of past with huge jumbo prawns with a spicy sauce. The person who ordered it couldn't finish it all. She loved it. 
Person 2 - another special - Osso Bucco. She loved it. The veal came on a bed of mashed potatoes with carrots and beets.  
Person 3 - Penne a la Vodka. Delicious (I tried it)
Person 4 (me) - Ravioli with a Rose sauce. Spinach ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta. It was excellent...sauce was fantastic. 
Server was excellent. Actually...3 worked our table in tandem. One brought out the crab cakes, another dropped by to refill wine glasses, while our waiter checked in on us to make sure all was well.

Tagliere Misto (Cheese/meat/olives) - $45

Seems a bit expensive but the food and service are worth it. Misto platter itself is worth going. 
Nice to see this place back on track...as it was floundering there for a while."}
{"text":"Came here because have no idea what to eat but was just around the corner. When we walk in, there was nobody there greeting you, gotta wait for maybe 10minutes then another 5 minutes to finally they are ready for us. Inside are pretty vacated. Then another 15minutes for another server to find our server to take our order. At this point, my date and I were super hungry. Order a calamari with greens. The calamari was just okay, a bit on the salty side, maybe it's the seafood. Then there's the seafood pasta (don't recall what it's called) it was soaked in so much olive oil... Literally every bite is oil. Pizza was just disappointing.... To top it off, order tiramisu, taste bland.  Definitely never coming back again."}
