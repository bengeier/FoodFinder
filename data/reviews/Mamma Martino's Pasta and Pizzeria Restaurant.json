{"text":"I am new to the area and have passed this place tons of times, always amazed by how busy it looks. Now I know why it is.
We arrived before 5pm and were seated immediately. By the time we left at 6:10pm, there was a line out the door.
The food was very reasonably priced for the large portions you get, and you could tell everything was freshly made. They had an ample amount of staff on duty for such a busy night, so there was always someone nearby to clear our dirty dishes or bring us refills on drinks. My only complaint is that we asked for more garlic bread before our entrees arrived, and we did not get any until our entrees were done.

Chicken parm: HUGE and covered in ooey-gooey mozzarella. The more cheese the merrier, I say.

Spaghetti: You could tell it was freshly made and the tomato sauce was clean, bright and not overly acidic. 

Caesar salad: Tossed in a homemade dressing loaded with garlic. It had a bit of a bite to it, but still delicious.

I will definitely go back here again and will be sure to bring my appetite!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Went for a date with my BF. We had half a bottle of red wine, caprese salad, two entrees, and a desert for $50. The ambiance was great. The service was ...well they are super busy..so good under circumstances. Like others have said is simple but super tasty and for a cheap date night its perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing family-run restaurant. This has always been one of my favourite places to go out for dinner. I've been going here since I was really young with my family, and we've always been friends of the owners.

The menu is basically classic Italian stuff - lots of pastas, pizzas and entrees. Things that are must-try are Mamma's Bruschetta (marinara sauce + mozarella on top of garlic bread), fried calamari appetizer, the raspberry tartufo and the spaghetti, which is made fresh & from scratch in the kitchen. My favourite dish is the veal parm with spaghetti. They also make a pretty mean caesar salad, and I've always been a fan of their shirley temple (though I may have outgrown that one). Mostly everything is amazing so pretty much anything you choose will be sure to satisfy you. One of the best parts is that it's pretty cheap and you can easily spend $20 for a huge dinner and a drink (I almost always bring leftovers home).

Gets super busy on weekends and some evenings, some nights when the line is all the way outside to the end of the building and the wait can be up to 2 hours.

They also put on a really neat xmas display that I was fascinated by as a child."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken Parm. However, meal spoiled by ants on table. Pointed out to waitress. Was still billed for meal."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy or pretentious- just good, inexpensive \"classic\" Italian (by North American standards.)

No fancy linens or menus, but that's also not why you'd go here.

They had great chicken Parmesan, and great garlic bread!

I will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I have been going here with my family for years, it is definitely an Etobicoke staple. The food here is always fresh and plentiful all while being very affordable. I usually get the alfredo and the fettuccine is always cooked perfectly. The garlic bread is so addictive and the dressing on the chef's salad is absolutely amazing. I always ask for extra when we take home any leftovers of our dinner (trust me you will always have so many leftovers) You cant go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying the food is great here. Classic Italian with a wonderfully family oriented atmosphere. The staff are all very friendly, polite and helpful. Wouldn't hesitate recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"It's great to eat at restaurant that works well and that is not a chain! The pastas are homemade and good, but above all: try the pizza, it is worth it ! The decor is typical Italian. The service is fast, friendly and unpretentious. Excellent place to eat with the whole family. The most expensive plate is $11.

Restaurant familial, c'est génial de manger dans un resto qui marche et qui n'est pas une chaine! Les pâtes sont faites maison, mais il faut surtout essayer la pizza qui est délicieuse! Le décor est typique italien. Le service est rapide, souriant et sans prétention. Excellent endroit pour souper en famille, surtout que le plat le plus cher et de 11 $."}
{"text":"The food and service was satisfactory, however, when the bill arrived the server told us \"I cannot split it up and you need to figure it out yourself\". Somehow in the chaos of paying separately, the server demamded more money than was listed on the bill and attempted to charge us for more beverages than we had ordered. It was a very costly dinner and I do not think me and my family will return."}
{"text":"One of our fav family restaurants to visit on a Friday night. 
The owners and staff are very friendly and welcoming and the food is delish! 
I recommend trying their pizzas - To die for!"}
{"text":"Mamma Martino's is a great family-run operation with tasty, traditional (if not adventurous) Italian food that's not pretentious at all. If you go, try to get seated in the eastern side of the restaurant, which has a lot more light, and some cheerful, pseudo-Tuscan decor. It's about as close as the sometimes-sleazy Queensway gets to \"rustic.\"

The pasta here is quite good, although it (especially the spaghetti) is a little heavy for my liking. Then again, I can't complain about an Italian restaurant that also makes a decent Zombie, too."}
{"text":"When I saw the long line up i thought it must be that good for people to wait outside and line up. They don't  take reservations and everyone needs to line up except if you are friends with the owner they give you a seat right away, which happened to us while we were waiting for our turn to be seated.

Food - We ordered fettuccine alfredo and lasagna - it was good, I mean how bad can fettucine alfredo  be? its just cream sauce, cheese and ham. The lasagna however, well lets just say I should've listened from other yelpers, it tasted like its from a canned sauce. Having said that, I dont understand why we have to wait for 30 minutes for the food, they obviously don't do anything special with it, they served the garlic bread after 20 minutes of being seated and another 30 minutes for the pasta. And they don't refill the drinks.

Customer Service - the servers are nice but the service is slow, i mean really slow. 

The food is cheap but I guess you pay what your money is worth."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the WORST restaurant food I have ever eaten. My wife and me visited this place on 22-July-2013. We ordered a Veal Marsala and Italian Sausage. Both came with a pasta. 

So where do I start? Any canned pasta sauce tastes better than what was served there. The Veal Marsala was basically some \"marsala sauce\" / cheap boozy wine  poured over  an over fried breaded cutlet made of some tough meat.  The Italian Sausage was basically a tasteless hot dog. It appeared as if the cook hadn't even made any attempt to make it taste decent. The complimentary bread was nothing but a cold hard roll.

\"Service\" meant your food was delivered to your table by an indifferent robotic school kid. No one asked if the food was ok or not.

The only good thing was that the prices were low so we did not end up spending much.

Consider yourself fairly warned about this place! Never again !!"}
{"text":"Mamma Martino's has been a personal favourite since the mid-eighties and I think I have tried just about everything at one time or another (except anything with calamari in it - not for me - no, no, no!!).  I introduced the office to Mamma's years ago and now it is our go-to spot for office celebrations, as well.

Everyone's taste is different.  Some friends introduced to the experience have commented that the tomato sauce is a little acidic, but i have never personally found it so.  I think they are just too used to canned sauce, myself.

Bottom line...good food, good service, and a great atmosphere - a real bang for your buck!  Pizza is wonderful, lasagna even better, and Mamma's Own bruschetta a killer!  Now about Mamma's Own - this is not a 'real' bruschetta (they have that too) but basically tomato sauce and cheese on garlic bread.  Personally, I figure if I ever decide to commit suicide, I am going to Mamma Martino's and just eat order after order of Mamma's Own until I explode - what a way to go!!"}
{"text":"We had to try this place because it looks nice and seems to be held in high esteem among the locals.

We've ordered from here 3 separate times. First, it was a veal sandwich.. probably the most tasteless I've ever had. Then, mushroom, pepperoni and green pepper pizza... which wasn't bad. 

But the last time was the clincher. We ordered rigatoni with italian sausage. The pasta was probably the worst I've tried.. just bland.. but the sausage wasn't sliced, and it was really thick... the thing looked like .... let's just say ... unappealing. I could not bring myself to eat it any more than a single bite."}
{"text":"Terrible food, check out the pictures before making the same mistake i did
Spaghetti quality is chef boyardee, meatballs dont resemble meat, and lasagna was frozen store bought quality"}
{"text":"If you've passed Mamma Martino's on the Queensway you've probably thought you have to try this place. I've only ever noticed NO Lineup at the door when they're closed, which seems to be often.  It's usually a good 20 to 40 minute wait.
Is it worth the wait? Read on.

The food is completely North American-Italian. Veal, pizza, eggplant parm, alfredo and carbonara sauces, ya da, ya da, ya da. So I guess it's Italian enough if you're a third generation Canadian-Italian. Not to say there's anything wrong with that kind of food. I can eat this stuff any time of any day.

At Mamma Martino's it's yummy and fast and super cheap. I'm pretty sure it's the super cheap that seals the deal for the hoards though. For under $10 you get homemade pasta or pizza served with a smile, always. And if you can hear your own thoughts above the din of the full house, you're probably saying, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go here regularly. Always enjoy the veal sandwich. The little french waitress is always friendly , as are all the staff. Bruno is always an attentive host. I recommend this place to anyone in the area or outside of the area who is hungry. Portions are great. Prices are fantastic. Service is wonderful."}
{"text":"I love this place.

 I have gone many times over the last few years, and would highly recommend both the pasta dishes - especially the penne, seafood  and parmigiana dishes - AND the house salad..

I find the atmosphere authentic and very cozy (  as a good Italian restaurant should be )  - a nice departure from the  the rushed, busy and artificial atmospheres characteristic  of many of the big chain restaurants.

I highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"I've been to Mamma's many many times. The food is good and the portions are large for the price.

Although...the service here is not good... Out of the 20+ times I've eaten here I've only had 1-2 good experiences with service. They are painfully slow, long wait to order, for drinks, wrong orders etc. Usually this is forgiven cause we like the food and the prices are so cheap. 

On our last visit we left extremely frustrated and probably won't return. We waited forever to be greeted and for our drinks and food. We received the wrong order, returned it and were still charged for it on our bill. We waiting so long to get our bill and to pay it honestly wasn't even worth the fight."}
{"text":"I should have trusted the low rating reviews! This place has pasta worst than chef boyardee. My veal marsala was chewy and so hard it was a workout to cut it. My fettuccine alfredo had a heavy, oily cream taste, no flavouring, no cheese, no pepper, salt, nothing! This was the first time i threw out a meal, didn't even bother taking it home. My partner's spaghetti and tomato sauce wasn't bad, and the chicken parmesan was average. 

The table has hot pepper flakes and fake parmesan, not real parmesan or pepper was offered. 

Overall, you couldn't even pay me to come back and try their pasta, maybe for their pizzas, but my first visit scared me from this location. I'm convinced people only come here cause it's affordable."}
{"text":"Good: Pizza is good. Full bar. Pasta is really inexpensive. 

Bad: Pasta is just terrible - Chef Boyardee quality for a a few bucks more. There is always a long line.

I will never understand the popularity of this place. Assume it's just families looking to fill kids with non threatening pasta on the cheap?"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight - the place was full!  We waited about 10 minutes for a table which apparently is considered a short wait. 
I would rate the food 3 stars - the extra star is for the cheapo price point of all the dishes on the menu. Sometimes restaurants with good prices means bad food, but in this case it is the opposite.  You get more for what you pay.  My sister is not a fan of the pastas, except for the lasagna. I have to say the lasagna was pretty good, especially for $9.95 - we split the lasagna and still didn't finish it.  It was MASSIVE. We also had garlic bread, calamari (lightly breaded, then deep fried - yum), and caesar salad with possibly the best homemade dressing I've ever had!  Best part, the caesar salad was $4.95.  I would come back here just for that salad dressing.
Definitely not gourmet home cooked Italian food here, but much better than the likes of East Side Marios (which is pretty gross in my opinion).
This is a great restaurant to take the family for a casual night out with more than decent food that won't break your bank :)"}
{"text":"We've been going here for the past 4 years and we've never been disappointed. Service is slow sometimes but the food never disappoints. Give it a try, I am sure you'll find something you love here."}
{"text":"Homey restaurant with good homey food. Not pretentious at all. Had the caprese salad calamari to start. My wife didn't like the calamari as she likes it crispier and battered. These where not dusted, just seasoned and deep fried. I liked them because they were different. 

My son had the Alfredo, my wife the seafood pasta, and I had the eggplant parmesan. All were delicious! My eggplant park canner with spaghetti which I barely touched as the eggplant portion was huge! Had the leftovers for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Real Italian food. Mamma passed away a few years ago but her family has the place going with her authentic recipes. Pizza is great."}
{"text":"This one of favorite places in town  both dine in and take out

To get two meals to go for under 20 bucks doesn't hurt either
Love the veal parm speggetti and meat balls
It's been a great treat to cone here for years"}
{"text":"This place was awful. Bad sauce poor service and flavourless food I would rather eat chef boyardee."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant at least twice a week for lunch when I worked in the area. A friend had mentioned that they went for dinner recently and told me the food was delicious. So here I am back to my old stomping ground 6 years later. Well nothing has changed. Same old menus which was great because the prices have not gone up. Same choices available. So making a selection was easy. We ordered fried calamari to start and they were so soft that they melted in your mouth. Next we had the panzarotto stuffed with mozzarella cheese, black olives and mushrooms but you get to select what you want inside. We were so stuffed but definitely satisfied with our meal but best of all, we didn't spend a fortune. No wonder there was a 20 minute to be seated. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've come here 4-5 times now since moving to the area. We're never disappointed and the value is undeniable. I've had the pizza, veal, fettuccine... but the best meal was definitely the seafood linguine. Nothing will ever compare to the food my Nonna used to make, but this place fills that void at a reasonable price every couple months."}
{"text":"The food is only a 3/5 but the friendly family restaurant atmosphere is a 5/5 so this place averages a 4. The prices are cheap! A veal parmesan with spaghetti for $9  Get outta town. Garlic bread for $1.50? It's so affordable. And the servers are very personable. Maybe TOO personable. I'm happy to go back with a jovial group."}
{"text":"Exceptional Italian dining on the Queensway. Great food, there's nothing on their menu that I wouldn't recommend. When you sit inside you feel immersed in an authentic Italian family dining experience. The staff are great and the bill certainly won't break the bank. Come before 6pm on a Friday or Saturday to avoid a huge line."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and the service is laughable.

We went here a few days ago for the first time after hearing great things.  We got there at 7pm and lined up, which was expected.  

Once in, we ordered our food and then proceeded to wait for over an hour. After waiting and waiting we asked to have more bread for the table.  When we finally got our food (but no bread) the waitress commented on how quickly it came out of the kitchen (if over an hour is quick RIP to those who have \"slow\" service). 

I ordered the cheese ravioli with rose sauce.  The ravioli was alright, however they put the wrong sauce on it and then just put some rose sauce on top to make it look like what I had ordered.  Mamma Martino magic.

At this point we had been there for about 2.5 hours.  We asked for separate bills and were told that she couldn't do that, but we can just \"figure it out\" ourselves.  The best part is that they kindly added the tip in for us - I love paying extra for awful service and mediocre food.  

Once we paid our bill the bread I had ordered over an hour ago arrived.  

I just don't understand.

If service is bad or slow it would be nice to acknowledge it.  A simple \"sorry for the wait\" would have made this experience a bit more bearable.  We only saw our waitress a handful of times and when we did she was running around forgetting our food and drinks.

At least the ice cream place next door was good."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service.....you need 3 hours to eat!  They are always busy, but they can't keep up.  Need to hire faster kitchen staff.  The servers should be wearing a uniform and tie their hair back  Don't think I will ever go back there"}
{"text":"Great Italian atmosphere, friendly staff and great prices.  Most pastas are under $10.  They make pasta in house and it is always fresh.  Food is a little bland (sauce is a little acidic) but overall worth the price."}
{"text":"We used to eat at this restaurant fairly regularly but after last night we won't be returning here for awhile, or ever. The food was good, not the best Italian food I've had, but it was good. Their food is fairly consistent.

But the service. Damn. The service was pretty bad. And we were served by one of the owners or managers, I think. Basically, everything we requested was given to the table in front of us. It was the strangest thing and when we brought it up to her she made excuses. We basically just wanted to let her know and ask why that was happening - it happened about five times. Even my partner, who's usually the level-headed one, was clearly upset. 

Thanks for the good times, Mamma Martino's. But seriously, thanks for the memorable birthday dinner (not in a good way)."}
{"text":"I've  been  going  to this establishment for years. The son Bruno runs the place , pleasant individual when he greets you at the door or as he is passing by your table. They have lots of staff to serve you and remove dishes from your table. Washrooms are clean,but downstairs. Food is great there! There are lineups to get in. Tables do empty at a reasonable rate. They do have a encloser for you to keep dry as your waiting to get in. At times you may see Brunos  father sitting at his table. The family pictures are about on the walls. And people you may know? Great place!"}
{"text":"After passing by countless times I decided to stop by yesterday evening. The server was very efficient and food was delivered quickly. I had the carbonara my friend had veal parmigiana both were prepared well. Prices here are the real kicker hardly any item is over $11 which is great and easy on the pocket!
I will definitely be back ! next time to try the pizza"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's a total carb fest. The pasta is very good and the calamari is one of my favs here. Its very affordable too, so if your cheap you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Not sure about the high reviews.... we were quite disappointed , the food was OK not amazing must be us lol, as the rest was full.  We had the usual pastas and was not good.  Note my spouse is Italian so he knows his pasta lol"}
{"text":"Stood in a long line to get  in.    Sadly the food was mediocre at best.     Not high quality but the price does reflect this.    Sorry I know people love it but once you've had good Italian there is no other way.    Service was poor,  slow and unprofessional.    
Unfortunately I don't recommend  this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Friendly restaurant with tasty food at a very reasonable price.   The menu focuses on homemade Italian food,  simple and very tasty."}
{"text":"I've had a long history with this place. If I recall correctly I've been visiting this place since I was about 7. A decade and a half later I still occasionally go.

it's a decent place, with low prices, on acceptable food, but don't expect any wow factor. The service has (always) been unreliable. You may have excellent service on one occasion, and yet encounter abysmal service on another visit, when it really isn't even busy. I'll break down the pros and cons of the place.

Pros: 
-Exceptionally low cost
-Reasonable quality to cost
-one or two really good items
-courteous service (mostly)
-the interior decorating isn't so bad (I like the exposed brick, and wine racks)

Cons:
-teenage kids deliver the actual food items (they usually lack manners or care)
-the last two times I've gone the guy who brought my food actually had pretty bad B.O. (but these could have just been isolated incidents)
- nothing remotely fancy
-there can be a long lineup out the door some evenings (fri-sat) up to an hour or possibly more
-servers have made a mistake on my remarkably simple/straight forward order at the rate of 1 in 3 visits. 
-Pizza is soggy and nasty unless you order it well done (in which case it's just okay)
-veal can be really stringy, so go for the chicken parm instead.

There you have it. The best item on the menu in my opinion would have to be the Penne A la Bruno. It's actually pretty good, and like everything else there, it's cheap."}
{"text":"Mamma Martino's is a welcoming pizzeria on the Queensway.

Firstly, the service here is great.
It's so great that I feel bad only giving this place two stars.
The owner is just like a nonna, she's always checking up on you making sure you have enough water and free garlic bread.

The ambiance is very casual and it's a family friendly place that is good for groups.  The menu has something for everyone for very reasonable prices.  The veal here is one of the more popular dishes.

I liked the rose sauce we got with the eggplant parmigiana and gnocchi.
However, the gnocchi was overcooked, gummy, and soggy.
The pizza was very dry and I preferred the pasta that we ordered more.
There was nothing memorable about my food here.

Keeping in mind, in the downtown core, there's no shortage of fantastic pizza places or amazing Italian restaurants.  The bar is set pretty high.  

This place is a great spot to take your family in Etobicoke, but I doubt I will venture back here."}
{"text":"First lets get the bad out of the way.  1.)  the tomato sauce is missing something.  i have had better out of the jar from the local supermarket.  2.)  Sometimes you practically have to get up from the table, go to the bar, and get your own refills.  And forget about getting that second loaf of bread.  The service lacks when you have been sitting at your table over half an hour with two empty glasses and bread crumbs in the basket.  When you ask for it, the bread will not come out to you until you are almost done with the meal.  BUT............................

This is the mos  t amazing Italian eatery I have ever been to.  I have never been dissapointed in anything ordred from the menu nor has my wife.  The place simply has nothing on the menu i wouldn't recommend.  We go there four maybe five times a month.  And never have we walked away from there dissapointed.  My preferece is the chicken or veal parmesian.  My wife loves the egg plant parm.

the pizza's are a bit pricy, but absolutely amazing.  there is a reason they are pricy but they are worth every penny.  And speaking of money, that is the bestg part.

My wife and I can walk out of there so stuffed you are almost miserable.  so full the belt buckle has to come undone.  This place feeds you, trust me.  You will NEVER come out of there feeling like you payed money only to go home to get a snack.  We always walk out with a doggy bag.  This is one of the only places I have found here where they give you so much food it is almost impossible to finish it.  I exagerate you not!

The last time we went my wife and I had a pizza for an appatizer, garlic bread, I had veal parmesian with pasta, she had chicken parmesian with salad instead of pasta.  We left with half the pizza, and some of her chickn parm.  I am a pig so I finished off all my veal.  We both drink water (not alcohol drinkers here) and no desert as we were to full to even think about it.  

All for the price of:  30.00$ with tax and excluding tip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best Place in Toronto if they can get the service fixed........."}
{"text":"Excellent unpretentious italian food
This is my favourite neighbourhood restaurant
Excellent value for money
Try the panzerottos, really good stuff!"}
{"text":"I always saw this restaurant, lit up and inviting! Especially in the summer, looked like a perfect spot for patio weather. Finally came here for date night on a whim. 

We didn't make any reservations (not sure if they even take them) and there was about a 10-15 minute wait on Saturday night around 9:30pm. Got seated in a quiet little corner of the joint which had a slightly more romantic ambiance than the rest of the restaurant. The ambiance was nice throughout the restaurant so we wouldn't have minded sitting anywhere. 

Food was just ok. Nothing to write home about but not bad enough for us to never want to visit again. My cannelloni was definitely bland for my tastebuds. My husbands eggplant parmigiana was a better choice. The portions size was good and worth the price. We decided to skip dessert. 

Would I come here again? Yes - the ambiance and the price point would make me come back here at least one more time to try another dish and allow the chef(s) to right their wrong. Would I recommend this place to a friend? Yes - it's worth at least one date night ."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of the phrase - cheap and cheerful. It's no wonder that this Queensway mainstay has been packed out the doors (and expanding to compensate) for over 30 years. But the question remains, how do they make any money charging so little for their dishes?

Speaking as an Italian-Canadian, I have the answer, it comes down to quality of ingredients. Saving on simple things like the type of Parmesan cheese you serve at the table, or the ratio of breadcrumbs to meat in the meatballs, or even the grade of ground meat you're using in the meatballs and meat sauce - it's not bad, not by a long shot, it's actually delicious still. 

The difference is knowing these things as someone who cooks many of their menu items at home regularly, you can taste the difference. The other secret to their success? Finding a price point and quality level happy medium that (according to our server) turns the restaurant over upwards of 5 times every Friday and Saturday night alone! Ya - they might save a couple of pennies here and there with an extra shake of breadcrumb but they've found the perfect recipe for delicious, affordable Italian food! As Nonna taught me - you don't change a good recipe (or she's gonna wacka-you!)

That's about as \"meh\" as I can get, because I LOVED my recent experience here. I met my Aunt for dinner here last Wednesday and after a short wait we were seated debating over the menu. We each had a salad, she the Bruno-salad which is similar to that of a Greek salad, for myself the house Caesar. The Caesar was creamier which would suggest a premixed bottle BUT it had a bunch of Garlic and a surprising hint of anchovies  (could have just been the Garlic) but either way it was delicious.

As we waited for our mains we were given basket after basket of their signature thick sliced garlic bread. I'm gonna just say it - probably the best garlic bread I've ever had - sorry mom and dad, Mamma M's got your recipe beat. Thick, crusty, perfectly toasted with a healthy smathering of garlic and butter on each slice.

For the mains, my Aunt kept with her Bruno-loving ways and ordered the Pasta-al Bruno. I can't recall what was in it, but I believe ham was involved. For myself I went old school - Spaghetti and Meatballs! As I eluded to earlier, the meatballs were not my fave part of the meal, but the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was perfect (thick, chunky, not bitter, low acidity and not overly sweet). This might not sound like a crazy feat, but pasta sauce is the most simple thing to make BUT the easiest thing to screw up. There's was perfect!!!

This is walking distance for me, so I expect to become a late night weekday regular here in the future!

Pro-tip: They don't take resos, and forget trying to get here during prime time dinner service - the line up goes around the building (even in winter). Further proof that they're doing something right!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian Food
Great food, reasonable prices, great service, clean establishment. It's a \"do not miss\" establishment!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just celebrated our 3rd year dating anniversary here and it did not disappoint.  We visit regularly and even had our pre-wedding dinner here.  She describes them as \"easy\" and goes on to say, \"anyone from any walk of life would feel at home here.\"  I personally like their high quality comfort food and very reasonable prices.  You get a good vibe from the service staff, like you're at a family dinner as an out of town guest.  We always leave satisfied and as much as we try to finish our plates, we always have enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  Mamma Martino's is truly a gem among Toronto restaurants."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Mamma Martino's a few times since it was recommended to me by a friend earlier this year. It is a popular neighborhood restaurant which is quite busy on any given night. I learnt pretty early on that the tomato sauce is rather bland and tasteless, as many of the other reviewers can attest. My go to dish is the chicken Marsala. There is a slight up charge for fettuccine and Alfredo sauce, but it's totally worth it- stay away from the tomato sauce! The service, while quite hospitable, is extremely slow. On the last 2 occasions, we waited almost 20 minutes for water and garlic bread. The server was hardly apologetic on either of these  occasions. After another long wait, my entree came with ham, although I specifically requested no ham. Servers need to be mindful of their customers needs, even when it's busy. It's the only way the restaurant will continue to remain popular!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Great food and even better prices. My friend ordered two sandwiches because for $5 each, he expected something small. Nope, one would have been enough!"}
{"text":"The service was quite slow. We went with friends on a Saturday evening, it was busy but not crazy. Our server was very nice. The food was not the greatest though. I ordered eggplant parmesan with spaghetti. It was bland with little herbs. The sauce was sour, just watery tomatoes. I have had much better Italian food. It was also very cold with the AC pumping so if you're sitting inside in the summer, bring a sweater. And if you want to split bills they don't do that so be prepared. All in all I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Poor service, very slow. Had to get up multiple times to get service. The food is good, but came to us warm.. We waited about an hour between the appetizers to the entrees. We we're no longer hungry by the time the entrees got to us"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mamma Martino's for about twenty years. The service is often less than desirable, however at a certain level that you come to expect from a family owned and usually busy place. When it's busy, I have no issue! You understand to a certain point that there is only so much that can be done. However, today may have been my last time coming here.

There were no more than 5 tables being served throughout my meal, so it was not busy at all. Not once were we checked on to see how everything was, which is a basic formality in this industry. I am not one to complain or make a scene over food, nor ask for freebies, and this was my first time complaining (very politely!) about our appetizer. The waitress didn't even ask about what went wrong or apologize and threw our bill at us, effectively letting us know she \"did us a favour\" by removing the app. Our food and drinks as well took nearly 30 minutes to get to the table which isn't normal for this place. Our apps came very fast, so we believe since we ordered the mains after we chose the apps that they forgot to punch in our order. Again, no apology. The table beside us that sat down AFTER we got our appetizers received their mains at the same time that we did. All in all it was a horrible experience today that had a domino effect on our enjoyment of the meal, and none of the staff cared.

I would not have thought that a restaurant that used to be a favourite of mine would become last on my list to go to, and be my first place I would ever send back food. Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super cheap, friendly staff and awesome food. Pretty big portions so make sure you come hungry!

My husband and I had appetizers, 2 or 3 drinks each and main courses which came to a total of maybe $80?? Probably even less if I remember correctly.

I try to go here every chance I get (or every time I'm craving pasta!) you definitely can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Often have line ups at dinner time out the door, good indication of the great food and value.

Has a friendly small business feel and attitude which is a good chance from the usual big franchises."}
{"text":"The price you pay compared to the amount of food you get is reason alone to come to Mama Martino's. It's such an affordable place to dine.
 The crowds they get are insane however and they could really stand to expand. Also, with all the traffic they get, they really ought to have uniforms or a dress code or something? I thought a child was trying to take my food away when I realized it was a busboy. What kind of busboy wears camo pants and a hoodie? This kid looked twelve and the outfit made him look very unprofessional. Even if they just made them wear black pants it would really improve the dining experience."}
{"text":"Finally opt-ed to dine in on a Saturday night. Not bad if you arrive before 6pm - we only waited about 30mins at the bar which is never crowded. After that, the wait is at least an hour, and no they don't take reservations. But ppl will stand in line for hours, you'll see :) This place is that good, if you like home style food. Presentation is not fancy, but big portions, everything under $10. I found their wine is really expensive - $29 for a litre or bottle. 

Foods to try: pasta alla bolognese, linguine al pescatore (with shrimp, lots of mussels, and other seafood) and calamari appetizer - so lightly breaded with a delicious warm sauce on the side.

I'm pretty sure their pasta is fresh, made from home. I didn't ask but it tastes like it.

On service: Fast, prompt, friendly"}
{"text":"North American Italian at it's best and I say that with all the sarcasm that I can muster. This place might be a neighbourhood institution but that does not make it any good.

The pasta sauce tastes like it came from a can, the ceasar salad dressing tastes like Kraft's with extra garlic and the pizza is pretty much comparable to anything put forth by the big chains like Pizza Pizza. It's just unoriginal and totally uninspired.

The service is good, the waitstaff is attentive and it's usually pretty busy especially on the weekends. I'm just not a fan however and prefer a restaurant with a better standard when it comes to \"Italian\" food."}
{"text":"Chicken parm is served with salad or pasta.  I always get the pasta since they make their own noodles.  Can't seem to find that anywhere.  House salad is garlic based dressing and is unlike anywhere else.  I love this place."}
{"text":"To start things off you have to fight for parking so that tells you how busy this place can get.  You have some spots in the front and back but odds are you will have to park on one of the side streets if you arrive well after opening.

Upon entry you will notice there are many old photos of patrons from the past, some are semi-celebrities, Leaf players, etc.  The line ups can get quite long.  The building is one that used to be multiple units but as you will be able to tell they ended up taking the whole thing as time went on.

It's a pretty tight place.  Seating is close together, and on a busy night the place can get pretty noisy.

The menu is pretty simple.  They have a pretty good variety of appetizers, pastas, pizza and wine to choose from.  The first thing you may notice is the menu really never changes and neither do the prices.  The prices are really reasonable considering the quantity of food that you get.  

I've always been more partial to getting a large pizza and taking home the left overs but I've had pasta, panini, etc before too.  Their salads are really quite good too.  It's busy because it's been around forever and their quality is good.  Their portions are healthy and their prices are very reasonable as well.

The service I've had problems in the past trying to get refills and somebody to come back sometimes.  The place is busy sure but you never want to feel neglected and I've felt that several times being there.  Besides that the service is friendly and it's a good all around place. 

I'm pretty sure they don't take reservations for normal sized parties because the place is so busy they really don't have to."}
{"text":"I've given this place 4 chances, event though I've never been thrilled with the food.  

I know people have been describing the decor as 'charmingly tacky,' and I completely agree with that assessment.

The first time, I ordered a pizza, which was decent but very salty.

The next time, I ordered veal parmigiana, which was decent, so I ordered it again the 3rd time.

The last time, I don't remember what my main course was, but I started with the highly recommended caesar salad.  It was delicious and I thought, \"Wow, this place CAN do something exceptionally,\" until I got to the bad tomato.  I couldn't even mention anything to the waitress, because she never asked how it was and took off too quickly as the place was packed, so she was rushed.

I have never ordered the pasta, as a neighbour of mine told me they could tell the sauce came from a can.

This all being said, even though I have never been thrilled with the place, there is a chance I will go back, since it's definitely child friendly and probably not that much more expensive than cooking dinner."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Mamma Martino's the other night with my boyfriend and his mother. He'd give them a 4, I'd give them a 3.

We went in on a Friday evening, and they were packed. I mean no parking and a line out the door and down the front of the building packed. So we waited about 25 minutes for a table, which was actually less time than I anticipated.

Inside it was LOUD. Like super loud. I would not have been able to stay there if my hard of hearing friends+family were with me. It was just too much. But they weren't there, so I stayed.

A waitress came over promptly and got drinks + appetizer orders. As often seems to be the case when things are super busy in a \"family style\" restaurant, we ran out of drinks pretty quickly and for a reasonably significant amount of time. They just had too much going on to refill the ice waters on the table in a timely manner.

The house garlic bread was decent, but I was disappointed that there as no sign of fresh garlic on it. Perhaps it was infusing the butter they brushed the bread with in the back of the house, but it wasn't visible once the bread hit the table. The tomatoes used on the Bruschetta didn't appear to be ripe. I don't like raw tomatoes, so I didn't eat it, but my boyfriend felt it could have been done better.

Between the three of us, for entrees we had... the Penne Albruno, the Rigatoni with Italian Sausage, and the Spaghetti Carbonara. (I was the Carbonara.) The other 2 diners felt their pasta was great! I ended up with spaghetti that had burnt bits (on the pasta itself) throughout, not enough bacon, and not a ton of flavor overall - unless you had a chunk of bacon in each bite, which didn't happen. So for me, it was mediocre. It was edible, I added extra salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper and got *some* flavor going on... but I was definitely expecting something more.

Perhaps if we'd come in at a slower time, things would have been less chaotic in the kitchen and the food would have shown an improvement."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. It was an unfortunate decision that will never happen again, the fact that the prices of the dishes are so low should be an indicator of the poor quality of the food here. The only good thing about this establishment is that the staff were very friendly and the environment was warm and inviting. 
    We had the calamari to start. Nothing special. For our mains we had the veal parmigiano & spaghetti and italian sausage. Where do I start...the veal was thin and very dry, the so called \"italian sausage\" was actually just boiled kielbasa sausage tossed on a plate, and the spaghetti was absolutely dispicable. Not only was it over cooked for both dishes but it was as if they popped down the street to No Frills , picked up a couple of cans of no name pasta sauce, heated them up and poured it on top of the over cooked spaghetti. No seasoning or spices at all. Bland, tasteless and very disappointing. 
We will not be coming back and frankly a little confused about why people still give this restaurant anything less than 1 star ."}
{"text":"Very slow service and when we asked about the 45 min delay in getting out food we got an answer serious attitude!!!"}
{"text":"Mama Martino's food and service is generally what you pay for which is fine. The atmosphere is cute and overall it's your average family restaurant. Most of the servers are dressed in sweats or more questionable outfits and haven't been properly trained, which again is Ok for a quick dinner. However tonight's experience was quite awful. Our appetizer came after our main course and there was no word from our server while we waited. Nothing! But what really turned us off was when she picked up my husband's napkin from the FLOOR and handed it back to him!!! It was disgusting and we ended up asking another server for a clean napkin and decided to never go back.  Thank you for the good times but please train your staff. They might still be teenagers, but your customers aren't."}
{"text":"Mamma Martino's is one of the places to go if you're looking for basic Italian food for really cheap. Everything is under $10 (except for the pizza) and for that price, you get a TON of food. My boyfriend and I usually share an appetizer and an entree and we'll still have leftovers sometimes. The atmosphere is very casual which is nice and the service is always fast and friendly.

There are a couple of downsides here.
1) If you're coming on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait for awhile as they become busy very quickly. Even if you decide to do take-out, you'll still have to wait.
2) Parking is very limited, even with street parking around the corner.
3) They're closed on Sundays, which for some reason is always the day I feel like coming here.

Overall, 3.5 out of 5 stars. The food is good but nothing amazing - you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The food was great but they're terrible when it comes to a crowd bigger then 4-5 people. Had to ask for a drink when I got there, had to tell her my order or else I wouldn't have gotten it because I got up for a moment. Our food came at random times, a group got there's and finished before my part of the table got ours. One girl didn't get her meal at all then they came around asking if anyone wanted coffee or tea so she had to ask for her dinner again."}
{"text":"The only restaurant I've ever been to that made me sick to my stomach. I had the white cream sauce over fettuccine and it tasted extremely salty and processed. Terrible!"}
{"text":"This place is your typical family style restaurant- it's great! No frills here, just your simple plain tomatoe sauce that is smothered on everything including the calamari. It's not a bad thing at all, there is just no spices or much elorborate flavours to speak about. The prices are right and the service is quick! Be prepared to to wait at least 30 mins in line Friday and Saturday nights - very much worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is one of Etobicoke's little GEM'S!  This family owned restaurant has been around for a long time serving up good Italian food just like Mama used to make. Up until a few years ago Mama used to still play a big part in the food. Sadly, she passed away and now Papa, along with Bruno and his sisters run this Etobicoke landmark. 

I highly recommend the parmigiana's - any of them, as well as the lasagna. There chef salad, along with their own homemade basil and garlic dressing is outstanding. 

Sadly I moved out of town and now only get to visit occasionally, but this is the place to go for good quality Italian food at family affordable prices. 

Get there early on the weekends as this place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Where to I begin. My god, this place has made me actually like Italian food. The tomato sauce is on point, the calamari is amazing, the pasta is fantastic, the atmosphere is humble and genuine. The service can be slow but they're honestly pretty busy, i'll wait for fresh, good food like this any day. We don't have a car, but whenever we happen to have rented a car for whatever reason, we make sure to drive here and pay a visit!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try as there is always a line up. I who hate lines stood in one thinking the food would be really good.  Wow what a mistake.  The food was absolutely disgusting and would never eat here again.  The service was terrible as well.  I was not pleased at all. Really stay away."}
{"text":"Cheap.  Great. Huge portions.    Worth the drive.  Get the classic dishes rather than the fancy ones.   Love chicken parm. Mmm"}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and thought of ordering delivery for some Finger Lickin' Good KFC. Found out later that they don't deliver during lunch time. My colleagues suggested going to Mamma Martino for Italian pasta instead. The place looks really fancy and we sat outside at the patio (there was glass rooftop so we were protected from the rain). I've ordered a Minestrone Soup and Linguini with Italian Sausage which comes with garlic bread. The soup taste delicious, and it seems they made from scratch since there's huge chunk of potatoes. The pasta was good. One sausage on top of the linguini. The pasta sauce was a bit plain. Would prefer to have a bit more flavour than just tomato sauce. Overall it was good!"}
{"text":"If your'e looking for a big meal and a reasonable price. This is it! By no stretch of the imagination should you think this is the best Italian food money can buy, but it's good and it's value especially if you have a lot of mouths to feed. You also know it's family owned and operated and that's gotta feel good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, busy place the staff are okay a little grouchy. I had their panzo and enjoyed it. Will go back sometime soon"}
{"text":"The prices are ok, the food is even less than ok and the service is terrible. 

The bread kept coming since the food wasn't.  We did have a big group, but this does not excuse the lack of service or them forgetting a meal all together.  What is it about restaurants not asking if you want another drink?  Don't they realize they can make a killing on this alone?

Anyway, no one was thrilled about the food when it finally did arrive, truly you could do a better job at home (taste and time-wise).  I guess most people who crowd into this place don't know what real Italian should taste like, and I'm not talking exquisite cuisine.  I'm of Italian heritage and Italians would scoff at the mockery Mamma Martino's makes of Italian food.

The bill already included the tip and then taxes on top.  We weren't happy since we wanted to give want we felt was deserved and it definitely wasn't what Mamma Martino's thought they did.

Don't bother, you deserve better, even following a simple recipe online would be a major improvement."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and great food that doesn't empty your wallet.

The lineups can be long and stretch around the corner, so go early.  But it is totally worth it!

I am a huge fan of the fried calamari and the Veal Parmigiana.  Its like home cooking, nothing pretentious, just good home style Italian food!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing family run Italian restaurant in Etobicoke. The food is delectable, reasonable price, and isn't too pretentious. The staff are warm and friendly. They serve generous portions of pasta and pizza. I highly recommend ordering the gnocchi. Worth going to - many times."}
{"text":"Wow....epic homemade Italian food in south Etobicoke. Always busy yet worth every wait for the bite. 
Park Lawn and Queensway,  I've heard this place has always maintained it quality for simple, hearty and flavorful home cooked Italian food. The decor is very reminiscing of Italy with the statues outside, oak wood interior decor with the small bar, light fixtures, pictures and wine racks ;)
Though there was a small line, a lot of people do take out here, and their service is very efficient and their portions are satisfying along with their prices.
In terms of food my friend and I had:

-house wine red /white glass was only $5.50. ..cheap!
-Calamari lightly fried and easy on the batter. Not over salted. Served with homemade marinara sauce which isn't overly acidic. Which I'd say was a 4.5/5
-Garlic bread,  hearty, not overdosed with garlic,  however slightly burnt edges 2.5/5
- large Pizza,  gourmet cheesy and lots of ingredients. Prosciutto and pineapple, thin crust and just a gem of enjoyment. 4/5

After it was all said and done our total bill with tax only came up to $45.. Honestly this place not only has the quality, but it's bang for buck worth it."}
{"text":"Consistent.  A big reason why they've been around for so many years (20+ at least..).
I love the chicken parm w fet alfredo.  It's a big serving for a decent price.
Staff is well trained, they hire and employ a lot of people, nice to see!
When it's busy it can be aggravating, might want to avoid PEAK periods."}
{"text":"They could use alittle less salt in there house dressing it's sometimes overpowering I will admit the food is tasty but they have two many servers for the tables to talk to one then you get another one and you have to start all over again we have to space between first your salad then your dinner because if you don't you will get everything while your still eating your first request then everything gets cold but overall it's not bad depends on order"}
{"text":"The food is cheap.
This is the repeating comment for Momma Martino's. This should always be followed with the tired and true cliche \"and you get what you pay for.\"
The free garlic bread couldn't be anymore boring. You can make it right now with the day old stale bread that you have in your pantry, and some quickly made garlic margarine. The pasta is, OK! Al Dente, cooked properly, but smothered in cheap and acidic tomato sauce. The sauce isn't authentic, it is lazy. 
The veal parm was 60% cheese, 10% breading and 20% veal. If you enjoy cheese, you will enjoy their parma.
The calamari rings looked good!
Our server was friendly, but had a knack for interrupting our tables conversation. She must have interupted us three times before one of us called her out on it.
The place seems to be popular because it is cheap. McDonalds is also cheap..."}
{"text":"Mama Martino's is a really hit or miss place, and this all lies in the service.

Mama martino's seems to be a fairly popular place, and as such it's almost always packed during the evening.  This restaurant isn't really small by any means, but it isn't huge either, and because of the sheer number of customers sometimes there are lineups going outside the restaurant and around the building.  Typical wait times could range anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour depending on how busy it is that day.

Once you actually make it into the restaurant, most of the employees are friendly and helpful with the exception of a few who don't really seem to care about their job, but the real culprit in terms of service is the fact that the wait times for food can sometimes be a lot longer than it should be because of how busy it is.

The actual food itself is pretty good, although not outstanding in any way.  The most appealing part is the fact that almost all of the dinner plates are under $12 or so, meaning you get a fairly large sized meal for a reasonably good price.  Their meat quality isn't the absolute best, but their sauces are pretty good and their penne al bruno is probably the best item on the menu.  

The interior atmosphere fitting for this type of restaurant although it would be a good idea for the owners to expand the building to accommodate more seating space.

Overall a pretty good place to visit but the wait times are sometimes unacceptable."}
{"text":"When you are hungry for some great quality food to stuff yourself with until you have to waddle home, and you don't want to break the bank, this is the spot. It's nice not having to choose homemade cooking quality over quantity."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food is delicious and super affordable. The ambiance is refreshing, we sat next to the wine racks and it was fun and cozy. I had the grilled chicken and lemon with a salad and my friend had the cannelloni.The food took little time to come to the table and was quite tasty, and our server kept checking to make sure everything was fine. Overall great experience. I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"came here for the first time this weekend and, i have to say, i'm surprised by the reviews. this place is cute and quaint - perfect for a simple sunday lunch with your hunney or friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You walk in and the atmosphere resembles walking into \"Mamma's kitchen\" with Mamma encouraging you to eat. It's a warm, inviting space that is large enough to accommodate a group of people and private parties.

I ordered an appetizer and main entrée. The appetizer was very filling in itself made from fresh ingredients. The entrée was sufficient to fill two people (and I say that as someone who was really hungry walking into the place). The tomato sauce doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that turns me off many of the sauces used in restaurants, I could eat theirs all day.

The amazing thing is the total cost. I paid less for my meal than if I had gone to the local fast food joint and got more bang for my buck. This is definitely my new favourite Italian spot and definitely worth checking out if you're in the Queensway area."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Give the home cooked feeling. Service was good. But, you go dine for the food. And unfortunately, another failure. It's not authentic!!! and just a waste of quota. Pasta is cooked well...at least! but it's all in the sauce. It's just sour sour and sour. It's almost like they didn't even try. 
 I think they just opened up a can of crushed tomatoes and pour on top of whatever plate you chose.
 There's many other \"Italian\" restaurants out there and this is not the one to go to. Especially if you're not around the area. Definitely not worth the drive.

Oh yeah! Also had a crappy house salad which looks like KFC coleslaw. No joke. And just tasteless with 2 slices of tomato wedge. 

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Overall I had a nice experience at this place. The food wasn't bad, and the price was decent. 

The garlic bread was delicious.

Unfortunately the pasta sauce tastes uncooked, and definitely not authentic Italian.

I would recommend this place for its pizza - but I wouldn't recommend anything that comes with pasta or spaghetti.  Overall, not a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's not difficult to see why Mamma Martino's has been open for business as long as they have. It's a family-friendly joint with first-class service and unbeatable prices. Is the food anything approaching gourmet? Hardly.

We showed up on a Monday night and the place was surprisingly busy. We both decided to order the Spaghetti and Meat Balls (which also includes garlic bread).

The garlic bread arrived pretty quickly after that and it's fine. It doesn't really taste as though it's ever seen real garlic, but it was fresh and hot and plentiful (and is perfect for sopping up left over sauce).

As soon as the rather enormous plate of Spaghetti and Meat Balls was set down in front of me, I remarked to my dining companion that there was virtually no way the pasta was going to be al dente. I was right. I've eaten soggier pasta before, but this was still pretty soggy.

As for the sauce, it's probably on the level of something you'd get out of a can. It just doesn't taste homemade at all, which is unfortunate (to put it mildly). The meatballs, at least, were quite good.

We ultimately got all that food for $25 (including tip!), so it's impossible to come down too hard on Mamma Martino's."}
{"text":"I say 3 stars my boyfriend says 3.5 stars. I really wanted to love this place, and so we will give them another chance and see how it goes.

This place is what it is. It's large and feels homey. The serving staff quite literally wear whatever they want and this includes shower sandals and yoga pants. You sort of get past it when you start thinking you're just visiting someone's big Italian home for dinner, but it maintains your interest for quite some time. 

The other thing is the service is agonizingly slow right from the start. We first arrived at about 8:15 on a Saturday night. There were a few people in front of us and the line behind us ended up being out the door. There was a sign to wait to be seated. We probably waited about 10 minutes without any one ever even addressing us. Once they came to the line up they asked everyone in line how many people per party and then seated us per the line up, and thanked us for waiting which was appreciated. But then the wait was long for everything from drinks to appys to refilling our drinks and then dinner. You waited and waited some more. I tried being patient but it got super frustrating. The waitress would say she would come back to refill our drinks and then didn't, then came back again to tell us she will refill them and then she finally did. Basically she would say she would do something but then go to another table and do something else and forget likely. There were three gentleman who talked as if they were regulars who were also getting frustrated so maybe it's not usually that bad, but from some of the other reviews it could be. 

The garlic bread was ok but not the best. Could be more garlicky. The bruschetta was tasty. When we finally got our meals I did really enjoy the pasta, tomato sauce and meatballs. It tasted fresh. My boyfriend had the Marsala which he enjoyed but tasted distinctly of Marsala which some cooking shows say it shouldn't. So not sure if it tasted the way it should. I thought it was a really good, hearty meal that was also at a really good price point. The meal was only about $35 and included a beer and soda.

We are going to give them another chance. I definitely want to try some more of their pasta dishes, but I do hope the service improves. I would love to make this one of my go to spots for cheap but delicious Italian."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the staff! Cheap cheap cheap. Tasty tasty tasty! Always full. People clearly love this place and so do I. My family has been coming here since Bruno ran the joint. If you want great authentic Italian at an eat out every night price than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Very good! As long as you don't mind waiting for about 25 mins for a table. Portion sizes are appropriate and salad and main course both are good."}
{"text":"This place reminds me not of Italian eateries in a large city, but rather those in a small town or suburb.  It has charmingly tacky decor, very friendly homey service and basic Southern Italian-Canadian (not really authentic Italian) food in large portions at dirt cheap prices.

Unfortunately, while the food quality was good, I found the dishes rather bland and the tomato sauce needed much more flavour.  

All in all, a good place to take some hungry children for a plate of spaghetti or to go for a quick pizza-pasta fix if in the area.   Not destination-tripworthy, however."}
{"text":"You get exactly what they seem to promise: good food without much waiting, very reasonable pricing and very friendly atmosphere. Dishes are $10-15 and the food is consistently good. 

It's not spectacular. It's not high-end. It's not exotic. But it is solid value and very tasty. I think that's what a place called \"Momma Martino\" promises."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Very affordable. Free garlic bread. Wonderful pizza. All very affordable."}
{"text":"What can you say bad about this place. This is one of those neighbourhood gems that keeps people coming back all the time. 

The lineups are long sometimes. Last night we waited an hour to get in, but where else are you gonna get a serious pasta meal for about $10. 

My go to is the veal parmigiana with spaghetti (made in house) carbonara ($10.95). This is usually more than enough to fill you up but we usually push things and add on a chef salad or some garlic bread. 

We tried the pizza for the first time last night and though it seems to be a popular choice for many, it wasn't my favourite kind. I found the dough a bit tough and hard but the pies are big!

The chef salad is one of my favs also. Have tried their Caesar and I think it's ok, but the garlic pesto dressing on the chef salad is fantastic.

If you want that red checkered table cloth Italian diner experience with solid food and great portions, definitely visit mama Martino's."}
{"text":"I think the big draw is the price! 
On our first visit, we had two pastas and the tomato sauce was really sour and the meatballs tasted a little odd, definitely more fillers than actual ground beef. The veal parm was pretty chewy but better than meatballs.
 
We noticed most people had garlic bread, calamari and pizza so will return once more to try it out!"}
{"text":"It's a quaint Italian place that looks like the decor has evolved over the decades yet retained that small town flare.  The place is always packed, has a great following and a great place to bring the family but expect a wait.  Great quality food for the money however at times lack a kick.  The tomato sauce is clean and fresh, the pasta is fresh and the pesto dressing on the salad elevates iceberg lettuce to a place I have yet to take it.   When they are on, the quality for the price is exceptional.  When they are just okay the quality matches the price."}
{"text":"Eating here brings back memories of eating at my aunts and uncles when I was young. Let's be clear - this is not \"authentic\" Italian food, this is good second generation food. Those who have grown up children of immigrants will appreciate how they capture the flavours that we grew up with, but presents it in an unpretentious, relaxed atmosphere.

I will say the staff can be a bit unorganized during busy times, but they are cheerful and attentive.

I've never had a bad plate of pasta here, and I've had the pleasure of consuming Pappa Martino's ribs tonight - braised with peppers and served with tomato sauce. Amazing.

Oh, and not ideal for those who are scared of garlic ;)"}
{"text":"price is right. line up is worth it. We go one a month.
best dish chicken parm, side bruno salad."}
{"text":"This is a local staple. 

When I first moved into the neighbourhood I would come here a lot. It was a great place for a cheap and satisfying meal.  Brought my sister and her family shortly after a few visits and they were quite impressed at what you get for not a lot of cost.  Mind you it was a number of years ago but for less than $80 with tip, we fed two kids and three adults with a couple of beers. 

Is the food something to rave about?  Nope
Is it always consistently good?  Yes
Is it casual?  You bet
Is it kid friendly?  Almost like being at home. 

Basically you get Italian home cooked family meals for a great price without a lot of pomp and circumstance. 

I usually get the grilled chicken with house salad and the grilled (lightly breaded) calamari as an appetizer. And got the same for lunch this one. My friend ordered the chicken parmesan. Both were very good. 

Most days my wife and I will split the grilled chicken and salad with the calamari and we are full. 

Service is fast and usually pretty friendly. And the ambiance is very casual. Bruno, the owner, is usually not far away and likes to keep the team happily buzzing. 

So come as you are, bring a few dollars (you don't need much) and prepare to be satisfied by a good home cooked Italian meal. 

By the way. I kept toggling between 3 and 4 stars but with some of the amazing food out there, this cannot be above a three. Add in the value and comfort and you may get a 4. Overall I think pretty fair to be 3.5 which seems to be the consensus."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 1* for a couple of many very strong reasons...

1. We were served house made Garlic bread....it had a big long black hair in the bread!! It was gross! The waitress didn't seem too upset, so I'm assuming it happens regularly. She re-ordered the bread but it didn't come to the table until the meal was fully over?!

2. The food quality was only mediocre. I ordered the house made pizza & asked for the pepperoni to be placed on to top to make it crispy. It was, but the pizza was both under-cooked (ingredients) & over-cooked (crust) at once?!

3. We ordered Tiramisu for dessert (their signature dessert) but despite the fact that it was only 6:30..they were OUT of their signature dessert!! We ordered coffee & when we asked for cream....we were brought 1 cream!! I don't get it?!?!

I want to be clear/fair on this...the waitress DID give us 2 free desserts & 1 free coffee for the hair in the garlic bread thing. 

In my opinion, this did make up for something but a hair in your food is a tough thing to get past!! 

All in all, this was NOT a good experience. I've been to this place several times before but this was not good today. Too many GOOD restaurants in which to spend my hard earned money to accept this level & service of food."}
{"text":"Good prices, good portions for Italian like Mama used to make (At least I think, as I'm not Italian).  I went to this place based on a recommendation from an Italian-Canadian colleague that enjoys eating.  The ambience is simplistic and the Christmas-display corner with the dolls are a bit spooky, the value for the food and service are excellent.  Very family friendly restaurant.  

I try to avoid this place at busy times ... get here early or on an off night... or expect to find NO convenient parking and a long line up to sit down... at which point my wife and I will pack up the kids in the car and find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the food was not very good.  I feel bad saying that, but it's true.  As someone else has already stated, the food was very much like chef boyardee.  

We ordered fried calamari, and were surprised to see skinny fried rings placed in front of us.  It was chewy and bland.  My son and I ordered rigatoni in marinara sauce.  I had meatballs with mine.  The sauce was too sweet, and I did not like the meatballs.  They tasted how dog food smells.  My husband ordered a salad with chicken breasts.  The chicken was very dry.

I'm Italian.  I grew up eating authentic Italian food.  I've eaten at many good Italian restaurants.  This is not one of them.  Again, I feel badly putting this out there, because the place was cute and the server was great, but that doesn't justify bad food.  I suggest you avoid Mamma Martino's."}
{"text":"Went here with the fan to grab a bite to eat on a Friday night. There was a bit of a crowd, but we were seated right away.

To start off the night, we had a pizza for the table. It was pretty standard, but decent enough with a good crust.

I ordered the grilled chicken with a caesar salad and marinara sauce on the side. The salad was delicious and fresh--maybe a tad bit overdressed, but very tasty.

The chicken on the other hand, was fully cooked, but one of the pieces had a weird, rubbery texture to it. When I tried to cut into it, it didn't even really separate properly. Needless to say, I did not eat that piece, which was fine because the portions sizes are pretty generous.

Overall, this place is family-run, very cheap, and has very friendly service, but the food quality is a bit suspect."}
{"text":"Literally Italian food like mamma used to make. The atmosphere is very cozy and frankly big... they have an out front patio and is great for big parties. The statues and mini water sculptures are great for a romantic date. Now... it can get noisy with the patrons present or the cooks constantly ringing the bell to notify the food is hot and ready.

Now on to the food. I had the pleasure of ordering the calamari. It was great portion size... but not seasoned too well. For main course I ordered the large pizza (as there were 3 of us) with sausage and prosciutto. The sausage was homemade and the prosciutto was a bit salty. The cheese was nice and ...well cheesy... they did go crazy with tomato sauce on the base (which was homemade)... now on to the dough... it was perfect.. the crust wasn't too puffy like regular pizza places. DEF A MUST TO ORDER!

Now... if you're looking to have split bills... they don't do it.

In terms of value... it's worth it... as their site says... most items are under $10 which easy on the pocket for great italian food."}
{"text":"My review is solely on the dismal pasta and slow kitchen timing. Basically a family run pasta house. If you don't mind waiting 45 minutes for your food and then being delivered a sloppy, salty mess of spongy pasta, then you've found it. Big sizes and food court prices don't justify this level of food. I get that the price is low but dining out should be more than just price.  I thought it would have been better for the crowd inside. I can see the charm of the setting but I won't be ever coming back. This place makes Eastside Marios look like iron chef. Do yourself a favour, if you want a big meal, go home and cook yourself a better one. 2 stars for friendly service and charming interior."}
{"text":"Beautiful food and people! I have been going to this place for years. The moment you walk through the doors you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Friday night, and while it was very busy (line-up out the door), it didn't feel hectic and crazy. +1 for that. There's nothing worse than being in a busy place that FEELS busy, so distracting that you can't enjoy your meal. I liked the decor inside, it felt nice to not be in some chain restaurant for once. 

I had the Veal Parmesan (it was on special) with a garden salad. I was impressed by the portion size, very large...the taste was good but nothing 'spectacular'. The sauce didn't really have any pizzazz but I guess I can't judge when I'm used to my Grandma's authentic Italian cooking. The salad was nice as well, I'm glad I didn't get it with the spaghetti or I would've been stuffed. 

Service was very attentive and kind. I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly Disappointing.
Went for dinner mid week, wasn't too crowded, nice low-end casual atmosphere, extremely noisy, could hardly talk to people at the same table but that fits with the nice active feeling of the place. Our server had clearly been with the restaurant a long time, all the staff were very friendly, and attentive. Water glasses at the table were all very dirty, mine was also chipped on the top edge, and had lipstick prints on it. When mentioned, our server replaced two of them, but no apology or suggestion that it was unusual. I ordered their one signature/namesake 'pasta' dish (but, it's not pasta?), \"Gnocchi alla Mamma Martino\" (with bread). Everyone's meal arrived fairly quickly (though not at the same time), along with two small shared bread baskets for a large table of people. Our 'experienced' server repositioned some of our in-use glasses by gripping them from above, always putting her fingers on the edges where our mouths touch (something that will certainly transfer illness, cold sores, etc between people at the same and other tables). The bread disappeared almost immediately, so more was ordered during one of the frequent checks by our server, along with the beverage I had ordered which still hadn't arrived. Everyone's food was simply piled on the plate, not plated/presented in any way, but nothing wrong with that in a home-cooked style restaurant. My gnocchi was hot, but not cooked well, most pieces were like mush/paste. Some pieces were stuck together, and they varied in size quite a bit. With everyone now half way through their meals, I reminded our server once again about needing bread for the table, and about the beverage I was still waiting for. By the time we all had finished eating, neither the bread nor my beverage had arrived. Our attentive server came and asked about clearing plates, mentioned (for the first time) they were behind on bread and that it would come soon, and asked about deserts. I told her to cancel the bread as we were all long done eating (so none of us had any bread to eat with our pasta during most of our meal), and to cancel the beverage I had ordered that still had not arrived. As for parking, that is a big problem, but after driving around the area for a while, a spot on the street opened up nearby. In general, all I can say is that for the signature dish (which at best would have been a very basic bland tasting potato dumpling and tomato sauce) from a restaurant that has been open for 34 years, it was clear that Mamma Martino had long left the kitchen, and any home-cooked quality that may have once existed was also gone. For multiple reasons, I would not recommend this restaurant, which is a shame, since I wish there were more simple, basic, home-style Italian restaurants like I suspect Mamma Martino's once was."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance and service the food is even better and the prices are affordable. Their house wine is really good."}
{"text":"My first time at Mama Martino's was a hit!
The restaurant was much bigger than i would have thought, which is great as I assumed we would be smooshed in like other smaller family style establishments.
The menu was slightly overwhelming as there was so much to choose from, all of it sounded delicious and was so well priced.

I settled on a panzerotto. It was huuuuuge. I ate the whole thing. I couldn't stop. My friends all ordered the pasta, which also looked good.
The menu didn't have a single item that cost more than $16. How could you go wrong?

My only gripe, and its a small one, is that they do not do separate bills."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes for food. No one came by for refills during that time, I even lined up the empty glasses on the edge of the table!"}
{"text":"I love cheap eats! This is Italian place definitely qualifies for a delicious cheap eat. I came here with my girl friend for dinner. We ordered the bruschetta with cheese to start (good). I had the linguine pescatore sans calamari and she had cannelloni with meat sauce. They also bring complementary garlic bread. I enjoyed my food it was a generous portion. I would have really liked if they could if finished it off with some fresh ground black pepper but they did not have any. My friend wasn't a huge fan of get cannelloni the meat sauce had a burnt after taste. However, the prices were amazing so we will be coming back. I believe my dish was 12 dollars.

The customer service wasn't bad. Initially when we walked in the two lady's behind the bar completely disregarded us, which we found kind of rude. We thought maybe they were closing. Then this bubbly girl came out of no where and seated us she was nice and saved my customer service impression of the place."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mamma Martino's for over 10 years and have always been shocked at how busy it is, even during the week. The owners always seem to be there, greeting people and seating them with a smile on their face. The decor is wildly tacky, but in a non-ironic, comforting homey way. The food is....okay. The prices are fantastic. The tomato sauce is bland,  the pasta is not handmade, but fresh and the menu options are plentiful. I enjoy the caesar salad, it is extraordinarily garlicky. This restaurant is by no means fancy, the food is simple, plain and usually tasty. This is not a destination restaurant, but a place to try if you are in the area and want a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"Let me make this simple. Six hungry people waited in line. Six hungry people ate, calamari/mussels appetizers and garlic bread. 2 linguine pescatores/1 fettucine alfredo/ 2 chicken parmesans. 1 Veal parmesan. 1 liter of red wine. 2 Coffees and 1 expresso. 2 cheesecakes. $126.00!!!! Before tip. Six full diners, so full they were almost bursting at the buttons/belts. 
Serve was very welcoming and friendly. Food was like a home made kitchen. Something you would expect in an Italian home. Loved the flowers and décor inside and out. We were not in a rush nor did we feel like we were being rushed to eat and move along. It is a bit loud with all the patrons chatting. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Judge it for what it is, a neighbourhood family pale serving \"nona\" specialties; rigatoni Bolognese, spaghetti carbonara, you get the picture.  It's casual and unpretentious, and the flavours are good.  How do you beat warm toasty garlic bread and a heaping bowl of pasts for under $10?  This place hits the note when you are craving the flavours of home cooked \"American-Italian\" flavours and don't want to put in the prep and cook time to get there.  Dependable and sometimes busy so plan well!"}
{"text":"Fast Italian comfort food served in large portions at an economical price point. Not an eye appealing presentation but for the price you can't go wrong. Lineups on the weekend so arrive early or after 8"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves classic Italian dishes at such an incredibly cheap price. Most pasta dishes are $8.5 to $10. Chicken parmesan is $10.5 which comes with either pasta or salad. 
Portions are huge. Pasta quality is pretty decent, not the best but considering the prices they charged it's awesome. One downside is that the restaurant gets super busy during dinner rush even on weeknights so it can be very hard to get a table. 
Calamari is quite good, very lightly breaded $8.25. Entrees also come with home-made garlic bread which was so nice and warm. Our group shamelessly asked for an extra helping of garlic bread; the nice server brought it right over. Carbs overloaded!!!
Overall, huge portions, decent quality, very cheap."}
{"text":"Yummy pretty much sums it up! We ordered 5 dishes and all were good but would have to say the star of the show was the create your own pizza!  - the quality cheese and ingredients on this perfectly thin crust were delicious!"}
{"text":"This seemingly little restaurant does a great job. It's always packed, has attentive service and the food lives up to my memories of Mamas kitchen. The house salad is a simple lettuce and tomato mix with an outstanding dressing. I like the dressing so much that I ask them to put it on my Bruschetta. The bruschetta is very good, toasted just right and then on go the fixings. I had Rigatoni Bolognese, the pasta was cooked al dente, and the meat sauce rich and zesty. I find the meat sauce a bit acidic, but the Parmesan I sprinkled on did the trick for me. If I'm in the area this is one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Could there be anything more mayoral than stuffing yourself silly in Etobicoke? I think not.

Yesterday evening I piled into a car on a mission with three of my favourites to Mama Martino's to try heaping portions of cheap, decent pasta. The drive was long, the mood was silly, albeit hangry, but we made it and the second the food started hitting the table we were instantly jovial.

I annoyed everyone with photo taking, but hey, I was instantly nostalgic for big mama's place. You will be, too, once you check it out. 

I ate: bruschetta, caesar salad, chicken parm with a side of carbonara (extra $1.50). It was all tasty and really reasonably priced. Hooray! It's 12:50 the following day and I'm still full. 

PEPPER POINTS for the red and white checkered table cloths. It's how I know suburban Canadian-Italian locales are legit."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars here and there. This is the real deal. If you come and there is a line up... line up. It's worth the little wait. 

First of all, there's private parking . You had me there.

Second of all, service is really good. It's a family affair it seems and it works and quick.

Third and not least, the food is A-MAZ-ing. I'm not exaggerating. I had the chicken parmigiana with the spaghetti and Bruno Salad. The pasta was homemade and fresh. Soooo gooood .  Comfort food. Homemade sauce was soo good.

Highly recommended this place. But I don't want it to get too popular that I can't get in"}
{"text":"I had an incredible experience here!

We were about to dine here with a group of 5 at 7:30 (no reservations allowed for Fri/Sat), but early me arrived at 6:45 because I work downtown. I thought I (and boyfriend) could just sit at the bar.... anyways so the lineup was 10 people long already!? After 10 minutes of standing in line, feeling bad for asking to sit at the bar, the owner actually cleared us a spot for 5 at the bar saying, \"What if your friends come, where will they wait?\"

The prices are SO cheap!! -considering other places for fettuccine right? $10 for veal and spaghetti, $10 for penne. 

We ordered the Calamari $7.95, came out smoking hot and with SO many pieces. It's soft, doesn't taste like batter, and it's the only Calamari dish I think about ever since!! 

All other dishes were pretty good (I had Penne Albruno, creamy tomato sauce and NOT overpowering tomato taste, which is what I like), but I understand other reviewers' opinion that it's not anything special. My friend's Chicken Parmigiana was very tasty.

Still, with the busy level they get, the service stayed fantastic. Full bar (two bars, actually), cheap eats, GOOD eats!, cozy decor, washrooms ACTUALLY very clean even though it's ONE STALL. 

Unfortunately pasta is made with eggs and flour, my vegetarian friend could only have salad (because she is okay with cheese)."}
