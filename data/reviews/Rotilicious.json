{"text":"Best food ever! The customer service was awesome. I ordered the chicken curry w/ dhal puri, the roti was sooo tender and curry was seasoned so perfectly. My tummy wasn't satisfied so then I ended up grabbing the doubles... I have been to Trinidad many times, home of doubles, and I can honestly testify that this has been one of the tastiest I have ever had! Will be headed back there again very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Rotilicious=Delicious...this time.....   Finding Roti east of Toronto can be a task.  Rotilicious took over this sandwich restaurant approimately 5 years ago.  Wifey and I have been visiting everytime we get the craving for a roti.  They have been a little inconsistent with the chicken.  One week the chicken is tender and the next it is dry. We have never been to the sit down part of the restaurant and always go to the take out entrance.  If you are a collector of mixed cd calypso, reggae or B rated movies you must stop here.   The woman, who I think is the owner, greats everyone with a bright smile as you walk in the door.  I ordered 2 boneless chicken roti with hot sauce.  Total was $14.  Ended up talking to the owner about how her son will be lecturing her when he gets home because she made him wear long johns to school and Friday turned out to be a nice day temp.wise.  Nice woman who really appreciates her customers.  She served up the roti within 5 minutes and I was on my way home.  I was totally looking forward to this roti since the morning.  Opened up the roti at the kitchen table and smell of fresh roti and lightly seasoned curry chicken filled my nose.  With great anticipation I sink my teeth into tender chicken and flaky roti....yummy.    Will return"}
{"text":"Wow, love the roti! Bought chicken for my wife and beef for myself. The roti was moist and protein was cooked to perfection. Could use a little more salt but overall the flavor was there to keep me inhaling it.   Will definitely come here again! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the dine in service was terrible. Went on a Saturday night at 7pm and the server kept disappearing for about 15 minutes at a time. We had to track her down twice - once to get a glass of water and the second time to get a takeout container. I would go back but definitely wouldn't dine in."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I have never had a sit down meal here as I always do take out but there is a reason why this place has been around for many many years.  My family and I have been getting our Roti from Rotilicious since they were at their old location a few meters away in the Harwood Plaza.   If you want juicy, flavourful, succulent Roti come here.  Oh and their doubles...Delicious!  Sometimes if you are lucky, they have fresh fudge, be sure to try it as it will not disappoint.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The roti is always good at this place, I also love their samosas. Only reason I give them 3 stars, is because the restaurant is extremely run down and dirty. I would think with the amazing food that comes out of this place, you would think the building would match that."}
{"text":"I've been going to rotilicious off and on for the last 20 years or so.  I've tried many different places but I have to say this is my favourite place.  The flavour is great and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  I definitely recommend people to come here if you're in the mood for roti."}
{"text":"ROTILICIOUS!  Is a combination of roti and delicious, it's a good mix of West Indian food and Chinese West Indian food.   What I like the most about this place is the service, most restaurants that fit in the west Indian Chinese category usually suffer in that department and usually deters me from going.   If you're a fan of Island Mix and twilight you'll probably like this place."}
{"text":"I'm on a goal to eat at all the roti places in durham.  This place's roti is 2nd only to Taste of T&T just up the road.  but their DOUBLES are at the top!  I mean  fresh, hot and crispy.  Way better than any other place I've had it in Toronto.  DO NOT BOTHER with takeout, it'll get a bit soggy, just sit down for a few minutes to enjoy it in their dining area.  Tons of seating.  not a great ambiance, but I came to eat, not look around."}
{"text":"We went to Rotilicious because of a Groupon I had purchased.  It's tucked away in an industrial area in Oshawa but certainly serves up great tasting food.  This visit was almost a year ago so some of the descriptions could be a little off.    We ordered an oxtail roti, jerk chicken on rice and some sort of roasted or fried chicken.  Oxtail was flavorful and tender.  It took no effort to clean off those bones with the yummy dahlpuri.  The jerk chicken pieces were generously seasoned atop a huge pile of dirty rice.  We were both very hungry that day and feeling a little guilty for enjoying such good food for half price (thanks to Groupon), we tried the fried chicken which was also good.    All in all, it was a very good experience and we'll certainly go back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Four of us stumbled upon this place on our way to Ottawa from Toronto. The food is deliciousssss. We ordered goat with rice, jerk chicken and rice, jerk chicken roti, chickpea and potato roti, and three of us got doubles. The doubles. Are. So. Delicious. The barra is so soft and chewy while the channa is perfect with a little bit of heat. The owner recommended that we try it with the table side hot sauce and it was fantastic. The goat ended up coming out in a roti rather than with rice but my friend didn't mind as it was just as tasty. We're so happy that we happened upon this place and we highly recommend it to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy a good Roti and have to say theirs was great and I was treated very nicely by the staff.   Well done."}
{"text":"Just one thing to say. Don't make the same mistake I did. I dumped the whole container of their hot sauce on my roti tonight. After all, I have never met a hot sauce I didn't like, and the container is tiny; how much damage could it possible do? Rotilicious your hot sauce slayed me. Like literally smacked fire out of my ass. And did I mention the sauce tasted like what I imagine lighter fluid would taste like? Lord have mercy! That shit should come with a serious warning. Learn from my mistake friends!"}
{"text":"It's ok for Ajax, nothing special.  I found the veggie roti to be very bland and the doubles extremely soggy."}
{"text":"This was my first time having a roti and it was like a Caribbean burrito. The shell was fresh and baked a little bit. We got the spicy chicken joints with all white breast meat covered in a spicy curry sauce, it also had a few potatoes in there.    We had a pineapple soda to go with it. It was good."}
