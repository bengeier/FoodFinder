{"text":"Great pub on Seamer road. If you go here, it's not for just a drink.
You need to get the food because it is amazing.


 Have been here several times throughout the year, always highest quality"}
{"text":"Excellent pub.


 The food in the restaurant is incredible, very good and very large portions.


 Best described as traditional food. Due to popularity you will need to book in advance, would recommend this place to any one.


 Prices are average but the portions are large and the food is sumptuous.


 My favourites are the Liver and Bacon, and sticky toffee pudding"}
{"text":"Great food, staff really friendly, lovely inside. Well worth a visit. Is good for romantic meal, family meal or that special occasion. Thoroughly recommend it."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Scarborough we were told this was one of the best restaurants to go to in the area, and it was first rate. Unfortunately it lost a bit when it was taken over but now its getting back to being one of the best. The menu is first class and with a good range of dishes. Try the brisket! The main seating area is a bit like a railway waiting room so try and book a side table opposite the bar. Also make sure that there are not a lot of parties going on as the service (and noise) can be a bit heavy. But all in all a good place to eat during the week but avoid weekends unless you are booking for a party!"}
{"text":"Treated ourselves to Sunday roast lunch here and enjoyed it immensely.   We went for traditional roast beef but there were many other options available.   The atmosphere was everything you would love about a cozy pub and the staff and service would do credit to any establishment.  Well done...we'll be back"}
