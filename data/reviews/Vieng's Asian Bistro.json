{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 3 because the food quality is subpar for the price. My hubby and I have tried several dishes and have been pretty disappointed. Service is ok...not rude but not super friendly. 

The one item I we do like is the veggie egg rolls with that sweet sauce but that's about it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. And the food went DOWNHILL about 2-3 years ago. It's overpriced like crazy. It was blacklisted by me a long time ago...the breaking point was when i ordered some kind of vegetarian stir fry type dish and there was fucking birds eye frozen vegetable medley with peas, carrots and CORN in my dish. Corn, seriously, I didnt know that was a part of Asian cuisine. $14 for shitty frozen vegetables and rice. Save your $"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous.  The menu is full of options; however, it is way to long of a menu.
We started with the bon-bon shrimp which is a favorite of ours.  The sauce it is served in is delicious, and the rice noodles add a great crunch.  We then ordered the Dragon Roll from the sushi chef.  For a sushi novice, it is fine.  I am very picky about my sushi, so it was not the highlight of the meal for me.  For our entrees, I had the Pad Thai, which is phenomenal!  The presentation is beautiful and the taste is divine.  My partner had the Moshe.  It was decent, but I was disappointed that it came with regular soft tortilla shells instead of rice paper.
The service was great; however, a male in a Geisha outfit? Weird.  Every time we go here, we enjoy great food."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this a 3.5, went here my grandma. Ordered the starter of Asian potstickers pork. Nicely done, the sauce was really good we think it's a Soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil combination. I had the wonton soup, it was delicious had lots of extra vegetables which is uncommon in wonton soup. My grandma had the coconut vegetable soup and she said it was superb. Waitstaff was very awkward. the hostess who seated us was nice but the waiter looked at the ground and mumbled. I've been before and the waitstaff was great not sure if it was just this one man or a continual trend."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. I had the chicken pad Thai and it was absolutely flavorless. There was no spice to this dish. I do not like extremely spicey food but it was so bland and boring. For the price ($14), it should have been much better. Portion size was good though and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. 

I may go back to try to the sushi but I will have to find another place for pad thai."}
{"text":"Meh, I tried this place once recently, and thought it was okay. It was around 3-4pm on a Wednesday, and it was pretty empty. Me and my friends sat down, and we ended up with a waiter who was funny, but sounded like a pot-head more than anything. He was entertaining though - dinner, and a show!

The food was okay, not the best, but not the worst. I ordered the fried rice, and it came nicely plated. Honestly, it was good fried rice, but I don't know how you can mess up fried rice, so I can't tell you how good the quality of their food in general is. 

The dining and ambiance of the place is really nice, everything is leather, and it's a good place to take a date. Other than that, try to avoid the place, unless you want to pay 8 dollars for a plate of fried rice, plus tax and tip. Chinese/Viet take out would be a better option."}
{"text":"Located in the former Claddaugh Pub, this building was completely gutted and transformed into a wonderful pan-asian bistro.

They have a heavy Thai influence in the menu, but offer many different options of Asian foods.  From the standard Chinese restaurant fare to the Japanese sushi bar, additionally they offer Vietnamese and Korean dishes.

Friends and family highly recommended this new restaurant, and it was worth it.  Four stars for quality of food and price.  We agree that it's similar to PF Chang's in quality and ambiance, but done with a mom & pop appeal.

All of the dishes served were packed with flavor.  I particularly liked their take on Honey Chicken.

For the lactose intolerant, I suggest their non-dairy ice creams on the dessert menu.

I found no website (4/2009), but when I telephoned the restaurant I was directed to padthaiohio.com that has a similar menu from their other restaurants, minus sushi.

The BPM/dance radio channel they had playing may be fine for a bistro on Ocean Drive in South Beach, but it didn't really mix with the ambiance of this Asian inspired dining room.

It's great to see that the westside has another addition to the good Asian food realm.  Something it seriously lacks."}
{"text":"This place spoiled other Asian restaurants for me. Ive tried the Bon Bon shrimp, Crab Rangoon, Honey Chicken, Hibachi Rice w/shrimp and the Fried Rice with Shrimp and Chicken. All were so delicious and I thought the portions were sizable and the atmosphere relaxing. The only draw back is that it's almost an hour away from me."}
{"text":"I think a lot of the restaurants in Crocker Park are subpar but I'm a fan of Vieng's. I've eaten here probably five times and never had a bad meal.  I find the food to be a lot fresher than in your typical hole-in-the wall Chinese restaurant. I also love the gilded, trendy Asian decor. One complaint: spicy's not very spicy so you'll have to ask them to ramp it up."}
{"text":"Pretty great for a place that does multiple Asian cuisines. Have had spotty service before but just came from lunch as a 6 top and our server Ryan was fantastic. We'll definitely request him next time. Sedans tofu was the star of the meal."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! 
HORRIBLE SERVICE! 
FIRE THE SUSHI CHEF! 

I have never witnessed in my entire life such disrespect from a restaurant like I did here in this sushi restaurant. I don't know if the sushi chef needed to get laid or what. But he literally was an extremely ignorant individual. I never write on here. If they truly needed a rating place is beautiful service rating would be a zero. 

My wife and I came to the sushi bar to have a good time and shop. I decided to order sashimi yellow tail with Ponzu sauce a pretty simple order that every sushi restaurant that I have been too has the ingredients for. The sushi chef angrily stated if they don't want the meal to cancel. Hahaha, I was like what? If you couldn't make it I would have been happy to say okay let's try something else. No, he was so belligerent I walked out. I will be reporting this to the owner and Crocker Park. I am from Las Vegas Nevada. Customer service and hospitality at its finest. You do not treat your customers the way I was treated."}
{"text":"The food is great if you can get a seat. I never write bad reviews but this is the second time we have had issues here. If one of the three hostesses care 1/6th as much about their job as they did shoes and texting I would be recommending this place to everyone. 

We went there today and they told us the wait would be 20 minutes. We decided to wait. We figured it couldn't be that long since half the tables were open. After 25 minutes of watching them goof around and seat people that came in after us we decided to follow the dozen other people that gave up and left as well. It is one thing if the tables are full but only half were. 

We went there one other time and the electronic seat notifier was broken. Instead of calling our name they just skipped over us and we had to go ask what was going on after and hour and a half. Those girls need to learn to like that job because with brains like that they will never do anything better. 

I love the owners of this restaurant and I will continue to go to their other locations since they have the same food with a better experience, but never again will I go to Vieng's. I will also tell everyone I know about my bad experiences there in hopes that they will hear about it and fix the issue."}
{"text":"Awful Service!

What a shame that they can't provide good service.  We were a party of 8 who made reservations for Saturday night dinner.  The hostesses were absentminded (didn't remember that we were waiting at the bar after we went to them 2x's).  The waitress that served us (and I used the word \"served\" very loosely) was slow to get our cocktail and food order.  I asked for the manager to let him know that the service was bad, but he wasn't at the restaurant, so I'm taking my review to Yelp.

There are a lot of good restaurants at Crocker Park, so my recommendation is to spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I usually get either the Pad Thai or the chicken with broccoli. Both are excellent.  The wait staff is always helpful and nice.  I have one complaint and it is a minor one: the music.  It's a very nice restaurant but they play obnoxious techno music.  It's too loud and is quite distracting. Also it's slightly overpriced but I like this place very much."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and I love the dinner lighting and fixtures above t.   I tried the chicken satay and the pad Thai, and both were amazing.  If you get the coconut ice cream (it's a must) it's just like eating cool whip but better. The texture is different but worth trying.   Overall a great place and I hope to return soon.  Also the staff was very friendly and attentive as well."}
{"text":"I really tried hard to like this place.  It has nice decor, and it is close to home for me.  My wife and I are vegan, and love Thai food.  We have gone to Vieng's probably 6-8 times, so we have given it a fair shot.  We typically order the Pad Kee Mao, extra spicy with veggies and tofu.  The tofu is blah, and has a not so enjoyable texture when cooked.  The outside is minimally crispy, and the inside reminds me of chewy foam.  Maybe it isn't pressed properly, but anyways, I usually end up eating about 1/4 and tell myself just to order with veggies and skip the tofu next time (which I always forget to do).  The actual dish is mediocre.  No real sauce to speak of, just a lot of crushed pepper, oil, and garlic.  There are many other Thai places that have Pad Kee Mao that blow this out of the water.  Also, they are never able to make it spicy enough for our taste.  It's like they don't trust us when we tell them to make it as spicy as they possible can.  

On a positive note, prior to being vegan, we had enjoyed some very good sushi, specifically their big rolls.  The service is always quick and friendly.

Overall, this place is a disappointment.  Their prices are very high (expensive lease at Crocker Park I am sure), and unfortunately, their food doesn't justify the cost.  Many better options out there."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can . Smelly place with below average food . Wish there was a better Asian restaurant within crocker place ."}
{"text":"Sooo... service was horrible. Nothing bothers me more than servers that are inattentive and forgetful... even after having written stuff down. Oh and the thumbs touching my food when presented with my entrees... oh and the water pitcher lip physically touching the water in the glasses as he refilled the waters and the table in front of us and ours. Completely unsanitary. He is now asking us who had what meals and apps to appropriately split the checks. On a slightly positive note the food decent. I will give a second try unless I receive the same server"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The restaurant itself is beautiful but it always seems empty for some reason. I don't get it. Food is pretty good. Location is great. Service is ok. But I've never seen more than like 3-4 tables with ppl. All I gotta say is try the fried California roll. Love it."}
{"text":"We love this place! Sushi is the best. I recommend the hot and sour soup, Korean BBQ, hibachi rice, spring rolls... Basically everything I've tried was decent. The only thing I would NOT recommend is their version of Vietnamese pho. I was very disappointed with it. Other than that, love it!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really disappointing. Food was pretty good, and the room is really pretty. Service - not so much.  Went in for a quick lunch by myself, they sat me at a table for four, leaving all of the place settings there throughout the meal. I had a soup and roll as an appetizer. No busser ever came, and the server dropped the main course, leaving all the dirty dishes on the table. I asked if she could clear them ad she said \"in a minute...\" then went to a table to pick up her tip AND then went to the credit card machine to enter her tip while I ate with all the place settings and the dirty plates. Lovely. Also, maybe I was sitting under the speaker, but the most horrible Muzak was really loudly playing in the dining room.  An elevator itself would be embarrassed.  In addition, I heard other music coming from the service station, maybe a server's phone? Maybe I just came at an off time, but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Booooo... Bad customer service. Waited 5 mins for my order and when the girl finally came, she was short and didn't make sure my order was correct before running off to the back again.  Everyone kept acting as if they were so busy when there were only 4 different parties there. To sum it up, I didn't like the service or the peeps!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars actually..... based on the fact that food is hit or miss. 
Love the decor and ambience.  
Nicely done Asian theme. Comfy seating and plenty of seating. 
Service has not been an issue for me here. 
The first time we went, the food was good. We loved it.  We had sushi and lo mein noodles.  
Second time, food was below par. Curry fried rice had too much curry powder....and it felt like it was added after the dish was made.  
This time food was good again. I had the pot stickers ....they were good and so was the sweet soy sauce that came with it. My pan fried noodles were also good...though a touch salty. The assortment and quantity of veggies in this veggie dish was good. Overall portion is also more than adequate 
My friend had a spicy chicken-jalapeno stir fry. I tried it and it was delicious. Perfectly seasoned and spice level was also enjoyable. 
Prices are a bit on the high side for the menu....but its in Crocker Park......and they have a very big and nicely decorated place. So it is to be expected.
I will go again.....it is good place to go for an outing (with proximity of crocker park)."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many times I have been to Crocker Park and have never been to Vieng's! I absolutely loved it here! 

My date and I came on a Friday night about 9 pm and were able to sit outside on the patio. Their patio might be one of my new top favorites! It was so pretty and actually quiet for a Friday night. We had a new waiter who was just absolutely wonderful! 

We started with the Vietnamese Roll and the Thai Dumplings. The dumplings were okay nothing special but the Vietnamese Roll was simply amazing! I can't even tell you what it is made of I just know that I could eat this everyday! Yes, I thought it was THAT good! We also ordered 3 sushi rolls; Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll, Spicy Crab Meat Roll and the Dragon Roll. Everything was on point!

I can't wait to come back and try some of the entrees and order more of my beloved Vietnamese rolls!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, really good service. Spicy yellowtail roll was excellent. Ordered Beef Puket Curry which had just the right amount of spice. Yummy all around!"}
{"text":"Service at bar is best. Owner/manager is very friendly. Wait staff is hit or miss, usually miss. Sit at the bar if you want faster and friendlier service (added bonus no need to wait for often MIA hostess, you can just seat yourself). Food is great with plenty of vegan options. We give the lychee martini and the bartender 5 stars."}
{"text":"I took my wife in because I thought it would be a nice place to get sushi. Boy was I wrong. The sushi chief sure has lost his passion for his craft. \"Hey, Uncle Benny, its a sushi roll, not a Birthday cake.\" Easy on the sauce!! And don't count of the service. You have to flag your server down to get his attention. Then they seem annoyed when you ask for the drink you ordered..'before' your meal is over. (Plus, he brought the wrong one)

For quality sushi we normally spend at least $100. At this place, we cashed out on $50 and left as fast as we came in. If we wanted sushi of this quality we can always stop in Giant Eagle. At lease we don't have to deal with the service."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, it's just not good. I would eat here all the time if my whole meal was $10 or less (which is exactly what it's worth). I have done take out from here twice, both times was disappointed. We have tried several different orders of sushi, fried rice, all the apps one can imagine, orange chicken, a whole bunch of stuff. Mostly everything was fine, but some things were just bad. All in all, for what you will pay for this meal, I suggest you keep on yelping' because you still have more work to do. Hint; there's a better place 1 minute away by Marc's."}
{"text":"I don't think Vieng's is as bad as some of the reviews make it sound. I get mostly vegetarian dishes like siracha and veggie lo mein which I would say are OK, but have had better."}
{"text":"Having always gone to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner my boyfriend and I decided to switch it up a bit and try Vieng's out. We walked in and were very impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place! Very pretty and unique. 
My boyfriend ordered a shrimp roll and I ordered a vegetable roll. The waiter came out with the rolls and explained that they were both mixed up.. well I can't take a gamble with that since I am allergic to shellfish. I explained this to him and he continued to ask if he could cut my egg roll up to determine which was which....... are you serious? I don't want it after you've meddled with it. AND they both looked the same so again I told him I'm sorry but I can't take the chance of biting into the wrong one could we please get a new order? He seemed dumbfounded! I couldn't believe this guy couldn't understand why it was so important that I didn't eat the ones we were given. He was also.. for lack of better words weird. He made us really uncomfortable he lingered at the table each time he came by and he seemed a bit off. 
The food was okay but expensive..  the experience with the mix up and the waiter really has deterred me from this place."}
{"text":"Solid lunch option if you are shopping in Crocker Park.  I don't think I would go out of my way to dine here but we were in the area and decided to stop in.  They have some great lunch specials...lots of food (soup, rice, entree) for as low as $8.  The Spicy Garlic Chicken wasn't really that spicy--in fact it was more sweet.  The Chicken Lo Mein according to the bf was really good.  Food was served piping hot (love that!).  Interesting decor and prompt service.  Dead during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that, I got food poison at this place!

I ordered a boston roll (salmon and cream cheese) It didn't taste all that, after 3 pieces I stopped eating it. I also ordered what they call \"Hibachi fried rice\" that was even worse and after two bites I was done. I wont be going back to this place. It was a lot of hype for no reason. All the time I spent in the toilet later on was no worth it at all!"}
{"text":"My husband I have been here at least 10 times and love it.  Never had a bad experience, always enjoyed.  Our favorites include the spicy crab big role and oh my, the spicy tilapia is outstanding.  My husband goes for the traditional pepper steak -- unbelievably tender beef and perfectly cooked peppers.  We love this place....not sure about all the poor reviews, so I had to write"}
{"text":"Business's of Avon and Avon lake wake up. I just had another horrendous meal at a local restaurant that I am sure will close in 6 months . This so called Asian bistro couldn't even get me silverware let alone lousy food and of course service. I frequent local chains so I can support the community but trust me you all don't seem to care. So close up and I will go the next one"}
{"text":"Well, finally went to this fancy Chinese restaurant at Crocker Park. Feh, it was disappointing.  Very nice decor, but the miso soup was over-salted (probably not homemade broth) and the moo goo gai pan was, at best, average. (Though not an expert, it tasted like the sauce had too much corn starch in it.) The fried rice was too bland for my liking.  Portions were good-sized but you can find the same quality Chinese food at one-half the price (1/2 the price!!) at most Chinese restaurants (especially recommend Asian Wok on Detroit in Westlake.) I wouldn't say service was bad (like other reviewers noted), but our server was pleasant but couldn't offer a lot of helpful information. I would have been happy if this place approximated PF Chang's but it misses that mark and doesn't even come close to competing with Pearl of the Orient. Too bad (sigh)."}
{"text":"A beautiful evening with 6 other friends .They gave us a great round table in a seperate room for the 8 of us. The food choices are fantastic done perfectly
Our wait person Greg  did a fabulous job guided us through the varied menu and delivering the food quickly and efficiently.
The food was terrific"}
{"text":"Glad they have happy hour, love the cocktail menu, great atmosphere, I would eat there often but it's a distance from home.
Check the place out !"}
{"text":"Solid every time. Wide variety of Asian dishes--which keeps everyone in the family happy. Yellow curry duck and lamb shank are my favorites."}
{"text":"Upscale Sit Down Chinese. The venue is very spacious and super nice. Full menu including apps, sushi, pad Thai, and all the classics. Hot and sour soup was hands down the best I ever had. Sushi was fresh and the main dishes were perfect. Sauces are very tasty and they can make it as hot as you want it. Only negative is the prices are a tad high. $12-20 per entree. Would definitely recommend if you are in the Crocker Park area."}
{"text":"Vieng's has sub par staff and are very inconsistent.  The sushi is good and the wonton soup has WAY to many onions in it.  

I really enjoy the shrimp ebi here, good wine selection and friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Crocker Park to grab a few things, got hungry and decided we would go here. For someone who worked at Crocker Park before (and visit quite often), I have never visited Vieng's.

We walked in just before the popular dinner time and promptly seated as it was not too busy at all. I ordered crab rangoon for an appetizer. I think that I am so accustomed to Asian takeout that the crab rangoon (which I am sure was made of REAL crab) was not my favorite, while still good I think I prefer takeout crab rangoon! For my entree I had the orange chicken and again, I think I might just like the takeout version better. While good, I'm not sure I would have this orange chicken again.

The atmosphere was nice and a very lovely place to be at. However, I don't think I'll return just because my tastes might not be that defined."}
{"text":"I was all excited when my friend told me she was taking me to get Asian food. Little did I know that it was going to be a mediocre PF Changs. 

Average food with an average atmosphere. The noodles were pretty ok and the soup tasted good."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here after my dad suggested it.  We had free babysitting and even though it was Good Friday, we still wanted to go out somewhere before chilling out.  We had to wait for about 15 minutes before the waitress took our drink orders.  She apologized and from that point on she was very attentive.  We started out with some unfiltered cold sake.  We ordered the chicken satay, peanut curry (with chicken).  We were both happy with the quality of the food and the ambiance even though the guy at the table next to us had on a baseball hat!  Maybe he was selling peanuts at Jacobs Field??? I would go back and try the sushi which we didn't have have."}
{"text":"Courtesy of a ubiquitous lunch meeting I was forced to make a visit - against my consternation.  

Protest as I might my pleads fell on deaf ears.

I played it safe by ordering the wonton soup.  At least I thought it was the safe choice.  The dumplings were rubbery in texture and were all mostly falling to pieces - 2 of them didn't even have any filling in them.

After we were done talking business my client leaned over and told me that next time he'll let me pick the location.

'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options but In a word: disgusting. The pale, flavorless steamed veg dumplings tasted like they'd been pulled right from the freezer into day-old water and dumped onto my plate. We also tried them fried and those were just as dry, flavorless and freezer burned.  The General Tso's tofu was so drenched in an oily sauce that any crisp the tofu may have had was long gone.  The sauteed green beans were oily and overpriced. The service was friendly. But the food was some of the worst Asian food I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, amazing service and ultra competitive pricing. Atmosphere is really slick and the place doesn't smell like most sushi restaurants! Birthday party in a secluded section of the restaurant was a hit."}
{"text":"Everything bad about this place has already been said.  Went for Sushi last night and was pretty disappointed.  This was my first and last visit to Viengs, I'm thankful that Arashi Japan is across the street.  

Viengs in below average at best and I'm surprised they are still open after all of the bad reviews.  My advice is to skip this place and go across the street to Arashi Japan."}
{"text":"Enjoy going here for special occasions. It is a little pricey but it is good food and good service. We love the sushi and the cocktails!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Cleveland period!  I have been to every sushi place on the east and west side and nothing compares.  The Sushi is bigger, fresher, and the white rice is amazing with it.  Other menu items like the curry is great as well.  I recommend the avocado curry.  Soooo good!"}
{"text":"If Vieng's was on a Baseball team it would be the utility infielder/outfielder. Not necessarily your first choice but an good fill in for whatever you might want for a meal. Large menu selection covering multiple Asian cuisines from sushi, bowls to stir fry. 

The restaurant has a comfortable feel, maybe a few hints of the previous Irish pub that was the original establishment. The dinning room was neat and clean, decor having nice Oriental flavor without being overdone.  Parking is decent with the best options in the nearby garages located around Crooker Park. 

We started with soup, I went with the hot and sour while my wife had the Wonton soup. Nice bowl size and both tasted good and we would order again. Our main meals were sushi (salmon & scallops) for the better half and Thia Cashew Chicken was my pick of the day. The menu indicated the Thia Cashew was medium hot on the spices scale and I suspect for many dinners it would be a far assessment of heat. Next time around I would ask for a bit more heat / fire.  My wife seemed happy with the sushi, no complaints or raving endorsement."}
{"text":"I had lunch and dinner here and both were great. The decor is very PF Chang's and maybe it was the drinks talking, but the food was delicious. I loved the menu options and although I stayed away from their sushi rolls just because I wasn't in the mood, the yellow tail cheek was really great and fun to see something so authentic on the menu. 

There was something for everyone on the menu, (almost too much)  I have to admit the pad thai was only okay, but I'll go back again next time I'm in the mood for good asian. 

great, now I'm hungry. And downtown. That doesn't help me."}
{"text":"Pot stickers were good, the curry dishes were horrible. My green curry dish was dry, not enough curry!  My friend had the red Corry which was marginally better. Maybe just ordered the wrong thing, but not going back. Service was so so."}
{"text":"A FAIRLY GOOD PLACE...

Six of us stopped in here for lunch. We had Edamame, Sushi Lunch Box, Pad Thai, Chicken Pad See Ew, coconut Spaghetti & Red Curry Tofu. Everything was okay, but not great.

Recommendation? Stop in Aladdin's right next door. It's much better."}
{"text":"More good sushi in Ohio.
And a great menu with more traditional Asian food selections.
This restaurant has a nice upscale vibe.
So, besides good food, bring a date or, impress your friends.
If it weren't for the mediocre \"Crocker Park\" experience, this would be a five star.
Peace."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude service! We came in and asked two staff (hostess included) if we could take a seat at the bar. We were told we could, and the hostess confirmed. This awful waitress came up to us and smugly asked, \"WHO SAT YOU?\" We explained that we confirmed with two staff members that we could be there. She sent someone else to our table to kick us out. I understand there was a miscommunication, and the seat was not open. That being said, the waitress was horribly rude, and obviously the staff was poorly trained. Meanwhile, while they insisted there was a long long wait, I counted 20 open tables. Clearly this place is mismanaged."}
{"text":"The edamame and cucumber salad were both delicious. Tom yum soup mediocre. The wait staff was very friendly. However the only sushi roll we liked was the spicy tuna. Was not a fan of the crunch roll, did not like the stuffing."}
{"text":"OK food--but overpriced and very rude (bordering on hostile) service from a manager named \"Ricky\" and some of the worst mixed drinks I have ever had.  I would avoid going there if you are looking not to be ripped off and insulted."}
{"text":"Vieng's greatest weakness is the uncaring hostesses who make you feel like you committed a sin by choosing Vieng's to dine at.  A few of their young wait staff are equally as bad.  I have dined at Vieng's several times in hopes that they will do better in service quality the next time, my recent experience on New Year's day at this location has finally sealed my opinion that unless they change their service quality its not worth visiting this location.   The hostesses are completely inattentive to the patrons and at times do not even greet or acknowledge them upon arrival at their podium.  They are much more interested in talking amongst themselves on inside jokes and texting on their phones.   While seating us, the particular hostess literally pushed me while clearing some of the table setting that we would not have needed.  There was no apology.   The service staff although try to look sharp, utterly fail in attention to customer needs and are never around when needed. The food (sushi included) are at best decent and completely overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"If a restaurant was called a European bistro with an extensive menu that offered Spanish, British, French , German and Italian fare I would avoid it knowing no cook would be that skilled. Stupidly, I walked into Vieng's with a many paged menu of dishes from China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong. You can see where this is heading.

I ordered the bento lunch box which must be similar to a frozen Stouffer's lean cuisine in Japan. If you want to eat from many different Asian nations in one place, you have only two days a year. Go to the Asian Festival. 

If you are at Crocker Park with a group who all want different things from different Asian nations I suppose Vieng's will do. It does have an attractive Eastern inspired decor. It is comfortable."}
{"text":"Tom Yum shrimp soup. Pad Thai order spicy or it is just ok."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy.  A great place to head if you want to enjoy Chinese in a slightly classier environment than your couch. 

I've gone here a few times for dinner, everytime I enjoy myself.  The staff is always nice and cheery, the drinks are never bad, and the food is usually good. 

My most recent trip we decided to just do a bunch of mini plates and some sushi.. I'm not a huge sushi fan, but this was good.  The food came out quick, well cooked, and the sushi was very nicely plated.  

The only negative I'd say is that you aren't getting a very \"authentic\" experience as today I was served by a British man, and last time it was a red haired teenager."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! A colleague recommended it a week ago and I'm so glad she did!! Been looking for a fancy Chinese like pf changs but there are none close by. This place delivered on what I wanted. My husband and I had an egg roll, sesame honey chicken, pineapple chicken fried rice and the molten lava cake with pineapple ice cream. It was wonderful, all of it!! definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Served in a pleasant atmosphere.  The service was top notch (thanks Molly) and fast.  Well worth the dining experience. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"In town visiting home and excited to try some sushi in Westlake since the Daishin on Center Ridge closed down years ago. We were very impressed with the decorations and design, but that's where the impressiveness ended. Our waiter, a young man who knew nothing of the menu was slow, uneducated of sushi and the menu in general, and at times inappropriate (he touched our appetizer and mentioned when talking about the weather that he'd walk around naked if he could). We ordered the basil spring rolls as an app and when served the waiter explained that they were very loose (loose like a bag of lettuce and chicken) he told us the guy that made them was learning but he rolls them tight. Unnacceptable. Next we attempted to place our entree order. In Houston we have a ton of sushi restaurants to choose from and we frequent them often. We ALWAYS order our sushi with the soy paper or rice, never the green seaweed paper. This would be denied swiftly by a short man that appeared to be the manager or owner. It was like the sushi Nazi would not let us change anything on our order to accomadate us. He wouldn't look over or explain he just told the waiter no. No to changing the paper and no to altering the ingredients in any way whatsoever. We then told the waiter that we'd like our check and we'd eat somewhere else. His response after slowly retrieving our check was simply, \"sorry we could not fulfill your requests\". In other words, we'd rather deny you what you'd enjoy than have your patronage and money. Good luck to Viengs survival, because with service like this they won't last long!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice.  It was just eh.  We tried the pho, which may be unfair because my mom is Vietnamese and we make big delicious homemade vats of it at home, but there are some good places in the area (like Superior Pho and even Thai Spice).  Here it was expensive, didn't come with any of the proper condiments and our server looked at us like we were aliens when we asked for hoisin sauce.  She also told us how lucky we were to get cilantro and bean sprouts because they don't normally do that.  That's how you eat the soup.  Don't have it on the menu if you don't know how to serve it.  Also, the broth tasted like it came from a can.
Everything else was just so-so.  Like the other reviewers stated you can get much better stuff at a much better price from other restaurants. 
 Save your money, the decor isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is never busy. It's huge, maybe that's why it always looks empty. I've never had bad food here. Everything I've had (except a chicken dish?) has been excellent. Service is on and off, but nothing terrible. Their martinis are delicious!!! Portions are great, however I do agree with some people that are saying its a bit overpriced. Compared to other sushi places on the west side, this is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are excellent. Love the rolled tofu and curry dishes. Order spicy if you like it hot. Always sit at the bar with fantastic service from Molly."}
{"text":"Great selection. From drinks to apps to entrees. Decor and ambiance are a plus. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. My 3rd visit and I'm still happy."}
{"text":"The more I order from Vieng's to go, the more disappointed I am. DO NOT ORDER TAKE OUT. Regardless if it's over the phone or you sit in and order to go, they only give you half of the normal order."}
{"text":"Went tonight. Ordered a spicy scallop hand roll. Was charged $13 even though A scallop hand roll on the menu was only six dollars.  Tried to refute the cost with no avail.  The big rolls were very small probably won't go back anytime soon. I guess the customers not right at this establishment."}
{"text":"Wonderful and attentive hostesses/ servers..... great food BUT** awful manager/owner. I've only been here twice and both times he is yelling at the hostess for the way she was seating servers.  Completely unacceptable to have that convo in front of customers! Makes me really think if I ever want to come back here. Disappointing in manager."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with my husband on Valentine's Day. The food is OK, but after looking at my credit card statement I noticed that my server tried to charge $250 on my credit card. Luckily it was immediately blocked as fraud, but this goes to show how sneaky and unprofessional the people who work there are. So be careful. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Seems like Vieng's gets little love on Yelp. That's okay, less wait for  table for me. I like Vieng's, I liken it to PF Changs but with more authenticity and less fusion. The atmosphere in both restaurants are similar with an \"asian chic\" vibe. The food selection ranges from \"traditional\" chinese dishes (kung pao, cashew chicken) to thai curries and vietnamese pho. 

My standout favorite is the salt and pepper squid. It is a must order every time I step foot in the place. It's a little sweet, a little salty  and very, very addictive. I usually order the sushi for my entree. I won't say it's the best sushi in all of Cleveland but it's good. There are classic options of sashimi, nigiri and maki, along with a selection of 15 or so crazy futomaki rolls; my favorite being the Black Dragon - a full portion of bbq eel with masago atop a california roll. I have also heard solid reviews from family and friends regarding their kung pao, pad thai and massamann curry. I think the biggest complaint I have heard is that their spicy is not spicy enough - but that is always personal preference.

Vieng's also offers a very large wine/sake/martini menu. They have several fun and creative martini's and often offer a martini of the day. A few weeks back it was a key lime martini that was so delicious it could have been dessert!"}
{"text":"Whoa! Why does this place have such a bad rep?  I have been coming here for birthday dinners, carryout, and lunches for years and I have never had a bad experience.  To each his/her own I guess. To me, Vieng's is a solid 4 stars because the food has always been consistently good and service has always been quick and friendly (even with a party of 10 ppl).  I recommend the following: Pineapple Fried Rice w/ Beef, Spicy Scallop Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sashimi Sampler, Crab Rangoon, Red Curry w/ Beef, Sizzling Korean Steak and you HAVE to try the Lychee Bubbletini.  They put dry ice in it and I always feel kind of cool when I am drinking it. Yes, the prices are a little on the expensive side for above average Chinese takeout food (Don't act like you don't like Chinese takeout...you know you do), but I think you are paying more for the ambience (beautiful) and the location (Crocker Park)."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with electronic based music. Nice decorations and slightly upscale. The sushi was great (Spicy Scallop Roll) and our main dishes were good as well. The Crunchy Pineapple Chicken and Spicy Garlic Shrimp were both good. Enough sweet and spice at the same time. The spicy mayo is great as well. I dipped everything in it!"}
{"text":"I've been to westlake four times and have been to this place four times.  Its slightly better than PF Changs, but with a slightly higher price tag.

If one wanted to build an argument that would place this place above PF Changs in quality, they would focus on the following points:

a) Sushi.  And good sushi too.  Not the best, but definitely better than average and not stinky. 
b) Variety.   Their menu is like 6 pages; no pictures.
c) Many asian restaurants serve bland food so that it will appeal to the common person whose taste buds haven't been acquainted with capcasin.  For this reason, I almost always order my dishes \"extra spicy\".   This resturant is one that respects that request.   Ask for extra spicy, and they will make it extra spicy for you."}
{"text":"In summary: mediocre-to-bland Asian fusion fare.  

Pros: The only dish that seems worth getting is the pad thai.  Be sure to ask for chili oil on the side--that's what gives it an extra kick and a trace of authenticity.  Also, the dishes come in pretty large portions.  The pad thai we ordered was literally a giant mound, at least 4 inches high at its peak.  The salt-and-pepper calamari was also a pretty good starter.

Cons: Long wait to be seated (we went on a Friday night so I might be different on a weeknight), lagging service, not-so-fresh sushi and sashimi, dark, crowded interior, cluttered bar (beer selection was not entirely visible and included items not even listed on the drinks menu), and my personal dealbreaker, run-of-the-mill, unfresh food (but you can tell they try).  Definitely not a first or second date destination: unimpressive decor/ambiance, think PF Chang's slightly dingier ripoff. (Both restaurants contain the word \"bistro.\"  Coincidence?  I think not.)

If you're into more Americanized versions of Chinese/Japanese/Thai food--read: deep fried, processed or blander flavors--and want to be in a  TGIF/Chili's-style setting with the requisite few vaguely Oriental-looking wall furnishing, Vieng's Asian Bistro might make your cut.  But even then, you'll probably want to stay away from the sushi.  During the 20 plus minutes we stood in the narrow corridor by the bar waiting to be seated, the same four plates of prepared sushi waiting to be delivered to tables sat before us in the open.  The sushi prep counter is a part of the island that also contains the bar, and while the sushi chefs looked pretty competent, no one came to pick up the sushi orders during that entire time.

Despite these warning signs, I ended up ordering sushi simply because there wasn't anything else on the menu that seemed appetizing to me.  I ordered mostly nigiri because all the rolls seemed drenched in spicy mayo.  Sure enough, the fish tasted lukewarm, chewy and rather fishy, probably precisely because the mayo wasn't there to mask the smell.  I've had very fresh sushi and sashimi that didn't taste fishy at all and this clearly just wasn't that.

Other dishes we got at our table: the pad thai, fried rice, and three appetizers: asparagus (tempura style), calamari, and spring rolls.  The pad thai was pretty good (if you mess up stir-fried broad rice noodles, you know you're bad).  Opt for the spicy version if you can handle it--the chili oil whether they cook with it or give it to you on the side really makes a difference.  The fried rice was a little over zealous with the soy sauce and didn't really taste of anything else.  The asparagus was battered and deep fried and the spring rolls were actually deep-fried eggrolls--more fried food than I expected, as none of it was mentioned in the menu descriptions.  Both are decent appetizers if you're going for fried-food heavy starters.  The salt-and-pepper calamari was quite tasty on its own--we ordered sweet and sour dipping sauce just in case but ended up hardly touching it.

Vieng's could have inched towards a 3-star rating for me if the service was more efficient.  Even the sushi might have been better or at least not warm and faintly fetid if the food prep and waiters were more in sync.  Unfortunately, until they revamp their system, Vieng's comes off as a second-rate Asian fusion joint trying too visibly hard to be classy.  Gourmet mediocrity isn't worth the stress of the crowd, wait, and inefficient service--if you're craving their few good dishes, I suggest takeout."}
{"text":"Read the reviews from the other guys about how this place sucks, but still gave it a try because I was really in the mood for some sushi. It proved the reviews are right! The food, both the sushi that I had and the basil stir fry my friend had, were not good...I had the dragon roll which was expected to have large piece of eel on the top.  Instead, the eel was wrapped inside of the roll and can barely be seen (or tasted).  The stir fry my friend had was even worse I think.  I tried a little bit and can hardly swallow it.  The ingredients were literally soaked in soy sauce, and there is no taste of basil whatsoever.  For less money you can get a lot better food elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, well designed.  We were seated immediately upon entering around 630 pm on a thursday. Waiter was friendly and water was at the table as we sat down. 

Drinks: The Chai Martini had dry ice in it for a really cool effect, a bit strong but nothing overly powerful. We also ordered a Passion Fruit Mojito and it was spot on, not too sweet and perfect amount of mint.

Food: We ordered a spicy tuna roll to start. It came out promptly, had a nice, simple presentation and tasted good too. 

The Red Curry was also very good. Fresh vegetables and the chicken wasn't overdone or dry. Presentation was great and it came with rice on the side.

The Kung Pao Chicken is Spicy! Definitely what you are looking for if you like spicy Asian food. The red peppers (maybe chiles? ) were extremely spicy if eaten whole (do not advise) but the dish was great! 

Overall we spent around $60.00 for our meal and it was well worth it to us. We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Vieng's! I love their Savantini (martini), the red curry, pad thai and orange chicken. I don't eat sushi, so can't comment on that. We've always had good service. For dessert, we always get the flourless chocolate cake-- with coconut ice cream: 5 stars for that!  They have decent lunch specials, and the atmosphere is great, too."}
{"text":"Their pad Thai is top notch!! All of their entrees are pretty darn good, can't go wrong with anything on the menu in my opinion. However, I love some good sushi and theirs is just ehhh, at best. Service was also quite slow on a Wednesday night. I really like Veing's... Maybe just skip the sushi if you're picky on the sushi you eat."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister to celebrate my birthday before we had massages next door... We were seated by a very unfriendly older gray haired lady. She removed 2 glasses from our table. I picked up a third and noticed that it was covered in water marks and had something brown and crusty on it. She reached towards my glass and I said oh good you're taking it, it's dirty anyways. There's food on it. She took it, held it up and very rudely told me these are WATER SPOTS and proceeded to pour water in it and set it on the table. I said are you kidding me, it has brown food on it. She ignored me and poured my sister's water and walked away. Even though the food is good, I will not be going back. I'm a grown woman, not some kid, I know a dirty glass when I see one. Cannot believe how rude she was...and cannot believe she gave me the glass anyways."}
{"text":"I don't doubt many of the bad reviews. This place tries to do too many things to do any one thing really well. That said, I've always found something enticing on the menu and I've never had anything awful. It's not the best Asian food since they're attempting Americanized renditions of Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, and probably a few other Asian cuisines, but it's fine. I like the kitschy atmosphere, and it's solid for being at Cracker (sic) Park."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.. I read most of the reviews and can't believe anyone would give it less than 4 or 5 stars...We were seated immediately by a very cute and smiling hostess. The Waiter Brian came to us right away and was very nice and helpful. We ordered our usual Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Pork fried rice. All three were up there with the best we've eaten. We're from California where there are a ton of Chinese restaurants (believe me when I say I KNOW great Chinese food when I eat it). I must say that this is my new favorite. The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The Mongolian Beef melted in my mouth and the pork fried rice couldn't have been any better. Even the Diet Coke I ordered was ice cold. The decor was beautiful. I can't believe how great the service and food was. I'll definitely make the 40 minute ride back just for this restaurant. Maybe the haters are used to eating at Taco Bell and Mr Hero...."}
{"text":"I thought this place was FANTASTIC!  I am a picky eater when it comes to asian food because I am asian, I can just eat home cooked food-everywhere I go i compare it to homade food, and this place did it for me!  MUCH BETTER THAN Pearl of the Orient-they do not even COMPARE! customer service was wonderful, and the food was on point, I def reccomend everyone to go and try!"}
{"text":"I've gone here several times.  Good sushi, really good drinks, service is always pretty fast.  I've gone with people who have had good other than sushi and they really enjoyed it.  Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We like to get the Thai basil rolls, pad Thai, fried rice, and Suishi! Carry out food is always hot and it is ready within 15 min.  Atmosphere is fun inside the restaurant.  You can sit at the bar and watch them prepare the food which is kinda fun.  Great place that's close to home when you don't feel like cooking or want to grab something to eat before catching movie."}
{"text":"No thank you. The decor is probably the best part of the restaurant. It would be fun for a group of friends on a night out or for just a drink and appetizers. Those were good. I had the \"famous\" pad tai which had barely any real flavor. For 14 dollars I would have been happier with some nice take out. Despite what others have said the service was good."}
{"text":"I have tried out Vieng's twice now and each visit was equally disappointing.  

Both visits I tried a couple different sushi rolls, all were of poor quality and I honestly didn't feel entirely comfortable eating the raw fish after a few bites and didn't finish any of them.  For entrees I tried the Curry Chicken and the Thai Cornish Hen.  The Curry Chicken was pretty bland and typical of something you can get out of your local \"Chinese\" takeout, just twice as expensive.  The Thai Cornish Hen was strait up terrible; it was overcooked, flavorless and poorly presented (who garnishes with iceberg lettuce????).   The service I had during both visits was also average; the drinks were made well so I'll give them that.  

Overall I think Vieng's is trying to be something they aren't and due to their locale they feel they can overprice their food and not sweat the quality.  Needless to say I don't feel any need patronize again and advise everyone to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"We got the food to-go for a catering event. We got mostly vegetarian options and it was okay. Nothing really special about this place. The pluses about this place was that it offered a nice range from Chinese to Vietnamese food. However, the prices for the food were overpriced compared to the alternatives in the area. We paid around $200 for food which only had 8 main entrees and 2 sides of dessert."}
{"text":"There on Friday, haven't been since November 12th, 2016! 

Doubting my return! 

Same server that we had in November, not a friendly person....at all! Not an ounce of personality or personable skills! 

Couldn't even finish our appetizer and the food comes flying out! SLOW DOWN! It is insanely fast which in some cases is great! But for a night out, stop it!  

Doubt we will come on for a while! I will ask next time though NOT to sit in the servers section!"}
{"text":"When we came to Vieng's it was fairly late and it is understandable that it may be annoying when customers come in near the closing time. But our server seemed very unhappy and very grumpy. Onto the food. I  ordered the Pho and my friend and I shared  the California crunch roll. The pho was very bland but overall somewhat enjoyable. On the other hand, the California crunch was SO GOOD. Although it is is very basic and simply made for people who don't enjoy sushi it is so tasty. Definitely would come back and get the crunch roll again !"}
{"text":"The people that work here were extremely sarcastic and rude to me. On New Years Eve I walked in and asked how long they were open (we spent NYE here before) and they asked if we had a reservation. I replied, no so how long is the wait? They said well that's not good, awhile and we close at 10. I said \"oh that's weird we spent New Years here before and I got a very sarcastic \"no you didn't, I left at 11:45 last year\" from a host. We walked out and I will NEVER go there again. Too bad, their food isn't bad despite being overpriced."}
{"text":"My favorite place to stuff Asian food down my throat hole. Had potstickers (beef) as an appetizer and Pad Thai as my main meal. Both were tasty! It's a little pricey, as you would expect for a high class restaurant in Crocker Park, but you get what you pay for here and portion sizes are enormous. They have a good selection of craft beers as well. Had a Head Hunter from Fatheads, as well as a chocolate milkshake stout from another brewery. They have great cocktails here as well. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"We always have a wonderful experience!
Service is always great, food is fresh and drinks are so fun.
My mom and I came today for happy hour and wondered why it had been so long since we've returned -we love it
Awesome place!"}
{"text":"This is always a great place! I've been there multiple times and it's always been amazing. Everything from the hostess to the servers to the food and the drinks. I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. The ambiance is amazing and almost romantic. The drinks are really good and the all of their food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Vieng's many times and I am surprised I did not earlier write a review.  This is a spectacular restaurant.  I describe it as five restaurants in one.  Its got Japanese, including fresh made on the spot sushi and sashimi, Chinese favorites, Thai including fantastic Pad Thai, Indian including many curry dishes and some American.  I have never had a wait.  Compare right across the street at Crocker Park at Cheesecake Factory you have up to an hour wait and get the hand buzzer thing.  I like Cheesecake but I love Vieng's. The décor in side is about at nice and interesting as you can get for an Asian restaurant.  A huge Budda welcomes you on arrival. There are giant clay soldiers like the ones in China, dragons, people carrying water and many others. Most of these are very large and beautiful really works of art.   I love the round tables.  The round tables are in booths.  There are several smaller and very cool areas, and a private dining area.  There is al fresco outdoor dining too. There is a beautiful bar with a water feature in the middle.  Its a very beautiful bar.  The interior design is really something.  The design includes water falls up by the entrance. 

My food experience has been  fantastic. I have never had a bad meal and that is easily 20 meals.  Fresh, fast, ample, tasty and delicious.  I love the Pad Thai and some of the variants of it right now.  I love the Chinese.  My favorite appetizer is the Chicken Satay as its done superbly, nicely presented with two great sauces and I love the peanut sauce.  Its four skewers of lightly roasted chicken but they have a coating or something prior to roasting and are delicious without sauce.  I also like the pot stickers. ( I tend to order the same thing) I have had lots of folks I have eaten with order many things on their menu and all were great so far.  This includes multiple sushi lovers.  I love the coconut ice cream.  I always have it for dessert. I think (not sure) that they make it there. Its just fantastic.  The food portions are big and I always end up bringing some home (except there is no ice cream left over)  They bring you containers or put it in the containers for you. 

Service has been fantastic. I see most of the same staff now for at least a year that I am paying attention and clearly the staff and restaurant work well together.  I see the same gentleman who is either the manager or owner and he is always watching, working and paying attention and its clear that attention to detail is everywhere. 

After you eat you can step out side play chess, walk CP, go to Lulu's candy store, go to shop at any of the cool places near by Charming Charlie is fantastic. Its just so fun overall. You can get dessert somewhere else if you want, like Cheesecake or Aladdins's.  I have done that too. Walk to Starbucks at Barnes & Noble, or look at books there.  

Lots of parking at the many CP garages or lots and some on street parking you get every now and then. All are just a short walk. 

This place is a gem.  Don't miss it.  Joe"}
{"text":"Wow, I was really impressed with the decor and interior design. Absolutely gorgeous. Wow, I was so unimpressed with the food and service.  Not good at all.  
  I see so many reviews that reflect from fair to poor here so I will substantiate those also.  The outdoor patio is super comfortable with a relaxing and ambient charm , but, if the food just isn't that great, is it worth the visit? That's up to you, but just know that you'll pay a lot for a middling offering.  You decide.  For me, I'll go elsewhere when in the vicinity."}
{"text":"This place is so pretty inside. There are lots of statues and fountains, but tastefully done. 
The cocktail list here is huge! Martinis are served with dry ice in them, which makes for a cool presentation at your table. 
Our favorite part of our meal was the sushi we ordered as an appetizer.  I could eat the California Crunch roll every day. We also enjoyed the spicy tuna.
Our entree's were good, but pricey. Maybe more pricey than PF Changs.  You do get a generous amount of food though, as I took about half of mine home with me.  
Our server was very polite and attentive as well. He checked on us enough that we felt like our needs were met, but no so much that it was overbearing.
If I went again anytime soon, it would probably be for more sushi and a cocktail.  The price tag makes it difficult to get food here frequently."}
{"text":"If you want to spend $70 on essentially chinese takeout then you should go here.

The place on the inside was great, super swanky and nice atmosphere, but the food was just \"meh.\" Like literally it was no different than a chinese takeout restaurant, where you can get a feast for $30. Instead we got a normal amount of food for $70. I just think it's a waste of money. 

I got the Pad Thai. It was fine, but if you want really good pad thai drive down Center Ridge between Walter and Columbia and go to Thai Spice. 

Wonton Soup was VERY salty, albeit tasty. 

We didn't get sushi, but I'm reading good reviews. I don't think I'll ever try to the sushi here, just because the sushi at Ohashi on Lorain [in plaza with Fatheads] is just so damn good. 

So review: Not worth it. Just go get takeout and save the extra dough for a better meal."}
{"text":"Meh... Pricey and not as good as King Wah."}
{"text":"I received a gift card from my parents to use at Crocker Park and I thought there was no better way to use that on treating my lady to dinner. We both looked at the various restaurant options available in Crocker but we both had a taste for sushi, so we picked Vieng's Asian Bistro. We went up there at dinner time on a Wednesday a couple of weeks ago. The décor was a nice and modern and we were seated a large circular booth, which I enjoyed in having the extra elbow room. We were greeted by our server, a heavy set guy who seemed like he was a bit out of breath. He took our drink orders and came back promptly, which led to our order.
 
We started with the pork pot stickers which came out in good time. There were about 8 served and they were about as average as could be. No better or no worse than any pot sticker I would get at a takeout Chinese restaurant. We then moved on to the real reason we came, SUSHI! We went with 2 of what they call big rolls and one regular roll. The 2 big rolls we received were the Rainbow Roll and the Spider Roll. I preferred the Spider Roll and the spicy mayo sauce that came on top as did my fiancé. The Rainbow Roll was just ok, I didn't care for the filling on this particular roll and wasn't impressed with the quality of rice that was used in making it. The final roll we had was the Philly and I wasn't impressed with the freshness of the fish in this one. Very disappointed on the sizes of these sushi rolls.
 
To be honest, I enjoyed the décor of the restaurant but that was about it. The server we had was by no means a bad server as our food came out timely and he refilled our drinks, he just wasn't very friendly or have much care into giving a recommendation. The real downfall of our meal was just flat out...the food. I was not very satisfied for spending $50 on 3 small sized sushi rolls and some frozen pot stickers; luckily I paid with the gift card and not my own money. I was actually still kind of hungry after we left. I can't imagine we would ever go back."}
{"text":"Bad food bad service. Had the Mongolian chicken which was not edible since the chicken tasted old. My husband got the prick prack which was too spicy to eat. Another friend got the glazed walnut chicken which tasted like it had been made the day before. Our waitress was also very strange and not that attentive. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I came for some late night sushi.  It was sad.  The maki rolls looked as if they had been rolled by a drunken ape-- loose, stuff falling out, everything coming apart at the seams.  It didn't taste bad, but part of the beauty of having sushi is an artfully and skillfully created and presented meal.

No Pocky for you!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good entrees with some awkward additions: my sushi plate came on a wooden ship, the drinks had far too much ice, and an overall sense that the plates where more unhealthy than they needed to be."}
{"text":"Its been 20 minutes since we got here and we are still waiting for our server to come back. Just saw the guy at the sushi bar drinking beer while at the job. This place SUCKS because their staff is lazy and unprofessional. What a shame, such a nice decor."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite, laid back and fancy, the food is unbelievable and the restaurant offers a decent selection of drinks, the food is priced mid to high range but its very good food."}
{"text":"Normally this is our go to for Chinese takeout. However, that quickly changed tonight. I order the same thing every time and it's been wonderful except tonight my chicken wasn't cooked, I asked for plain Lo-main...they gave me noodles without sauce. We liked this place because it seemed like a step up from your typical Chinese restaurant. I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be great, but like others mentioned, it just doesn't live up to your expectation. It looks nice, but the food quality was just mediocre. We had potstickers for an appetizer and they were really good. That was the highlight of our meal. Our server was also very nice. But the food was just kind of blan. I probably poured like a gallon of soy sauce on my seafood dish. You're better off saving your money and ordering regular Chinese takeout. This place isn't horrible, but it's just so not worth the money for the food quality."}
{"text":"Maybe 2 star may be harsh, but I'd never go to this place again. The food is definitely nothing special, I could make a lot of the dishes at home. So for me- it's a definite 2 star."}
{"text":"Awesome menu. Awesome service. Good spectrum of various Asian foods and sushi. Also cool Asian beer menu. Like to hit this spot 2x a month."}
