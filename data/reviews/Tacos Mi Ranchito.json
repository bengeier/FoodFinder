{"text":"Tacos were fantastic and flour tortilla was also one of the best I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"We stop here each time I am driving from/to Austin/L.A. 

They have tacos, shrimp ceviche tostadas, Tortas, chimichangas, sopes, gorditas, even breakfast dishes such as chilaquiles."}
{"text":"Good little place to go to when hungry for something tasty. Love the aguachiles but getting red chilaquiles in the morning is a must!"}
{"text":"Make sure they get your Order right and 50 cent charger everytime you use debit/credit. 15.48 for plate of carne asada and two Méxican coke this place is rip off stay clear"}
{"text":"Mi ranchito has good street tacos and burritos . I had  3 tacos al pastor ( marinated pork) and a carne asada burrito. Both were good I recommend them. The staff was very niceand the prices are decent for the type of business.. Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"While getting gas at Quick Trip, we noticed the little taco shop next door. Service  was friendly. We ordered our lunch to go. I had soft tacos and my husband had hard tacos. They were very good, made fresh while we waited."}
{"text":"Service was slow slow slow food was cold. 

Stop there instead of going to Ponchos. 

Big mistake stopping here should gone down the road to Ponchos service great food excellent and you don't have to beg to be served."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to this restaurant to celebrate her honor roll award. This is perhaps the most disappointing Mexican food experience I have had since being in Arizona. I had a carne asada Nacho and my daughter had a carne asada burrito. They were both horrible. We will never eat here again. The green sauce has no flavor, the meat tastes terrible, and this is the first time I have ever been to a Mexican restaurant in all my years and they use nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese. I actually think my nacho had more jalapenos than beef. I should have taken a picture. Waste of money"}
{"text":"La comida tiene buen sabor hasta eso pero no inventes me querían cobrar 1 dollar por tortilla eso es un robo las tortillas cuestan 10 centavos en producción etc . Las tostadas deberían de ser gratis si estas ordenando más de 15$ de comida que robo 2.75 por una canastita .. no sean así con la raza !!    Y la cerveza muy cara 4.50 $ por un cuartito no manches mejor te compras  un six pack saliendo .."}
{"text":"Went here after a color run with my family. Good family owned restaurant! Staff are very nice and prices were great for entrees and such. They had a kids menu which is a plus. I ordered their carne asada- meat was already chopped up- not use to that; i am use to getting an actual cut of meat. The meat was tender and decent but i think they may have just used the same meat the use in the tacos! Oh well, the beans and rice where great! Topped off with authentic cheese and rice tasted like my moms! My husband loved this place and so did my boys! They cleaned their plates and my oldest even went is to order two extra tacos. They had fantastic homemade salsas and even offered an extensive seafood options. If you are in the area it is worth a try; you will find something you like i am sure!"}
{"text":"The tacos tasted okay at first, they were just over cooked but ended up giving me food poisoning. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Located in a non-descript strip mall next to a smoke shop and a now defunct music store it oozes mom and pop homemade Mexican food. 7 or 8 tables, some Hispanic memorabilia scattered around with the counter/order area in the back. My wife was feeling I'll and she was craving a bowl of hot menudo blanco. I remembered this place under a different name and suggested it but as you can see by the one star rating it fell far short. I waited in the car figuring she would be out in a couple minutes, but after waiting about 15 min and seeing through the window, only 3 customers seated and already eating, I had to investigate. As I sat next to her she said no blanco menudo, only rojo! I asked her what was taking so long?...it should only take 2 min to ladle up an order of menudo. I think they ran down the street to Food City and purchased a can of Juanita's menudo. I also noticed they had crossed out the $5.95 price and inserted $6.95 on the menu. Finally received our to go order after 20 min. and left with our prize.
Omg...32oz of cold, flavorless red water soaked slimy tripe and a few kernels of hominy..that's it!  Juanita's canned menudo is better and it is bad! My wife was so disappointed, hungry and ill she was almost in tears which prompted me to \"call\" the owner and write this review. I can't repeat what I said here for fear of being flagged but I think you get the idea. Not good! Tortillas are store bought too but that's prob a good thing. I don't trust this place! Steer clear! 
You have been warned."}
