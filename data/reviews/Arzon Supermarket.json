{"text":"Been here a few times to pick up some food. We ordered 2 koobideh and 2 gheimeh with 2 carbonated doogh drinks. Each and every time we came by the food was delicious. The price point isn't bad either. It's worth the trip to Toronto for this food!"}
{"text":"This place is great, if you like to buy good Persian food for cheap. A lot of times we have guests over, we come here to buy the food, we can feed a whole army of people on the cheap. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Where this supermarket lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in its variety of Persian breads, and food counter.  When you walk in, you are greeted by a counter, and different baked items available.  You can choose from a variety of flatbreads, from personal sized, to dinner table sized; pick according to your appetite.  I also stopped by to have some grilled lamb kebobs with saffron rice and a carbonated yogurt drink.  They grill the kebobs to order on a traditional charcoal grill, and you can also get their precooked items to go with rice if that strikes your fancy."}
{"text":"Wow.. I really liked this place before knowing that bread i purchased last night is NOT FRESH and has GREEN MOLDS.   I don't know why NONE of the packaging ate dated the manufacture date of the bread was baked ) All western and even Chinese places that sell bread have have manufacture and expiration date... see my pictures"}
{"text":"This is a great local Middle Eastern supermarket. The staff here are super friendly, even though I kind of stand out, they treat me with respect and are really responsive. I love the hot food take out counter. I always get the braised lamb, the koobideh, and of course, the stews! They are super tasty, and the meat is grilled to order. Not to mention, the desserts! They are divine. They are paid by the pound, and it's worth every cent. This is my regular joint, now and forever!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was gloomy, no one smiled and store was crowded and looked a tad messy. However I do really enjoy one Persian pastry that they sell of which I have not gotten the chance to get the name of it. It's a white square with cream, almonds and flaky layers."}
{"text":"Came in and picked up a beef and lamb skewer combo and some persian sweets. The meats were overcooked and burnt. The combo was supposed to include a salad, but I guess actually getting it depends on a dice roll. If it wasn't for the friendly lady behind the sweets counter, I would have given this place a 1-star. Come here if you enjoy the taste of charred and chewy meats. You won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"great people ... amazing food . it is bit stuffy .but it has it all . it would have been nice if they were bit bigger ."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I got a chance to enjoy some sweets that I was familiar with from before.  No idea what they are called but there's some that resemble a wheel and the others look like cream puffs.  Got a chance to also try one that looked like an ice cream cone.  Aside from Persian pastries, this store features some groceries at convenience as well as a variety of bulk items.    Open late, and the prices are pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"Well, this was exciting, and confusing. Exploring is fun! And confusing. We came for lunch yesterday. It was our first time. My grandfather and my father walked in through their bakery entrance. My mom and I walked in through their prepared foods entrance. Those two entrances are separated by a doorway leading to a second story hair salon, if I'm not mistaken. It makes for a fairly strangely shaped store, but it is what it is.   Super Arzon is a grocery store and (predominantly) takeout place. The store is fairly cramped, but boy do they have a lot packed into a small space. Most of their signage is not in English, so for people like me who only read English (and well, Koine Greek), you might not know what some things are. Thankfully, their prepared foods section does have a lot of English. I am incredibly appreciative of the fact that their prepared foods menu has pictures of everything as well as descriptions of things. Otherwise, I'd be stuck pointing. I don't mind the pointing, but I do appreciate knowing what I'm eating so I can order it again (or not). Two of the things I wanted to order weren't available that day, but there were plenty of other things I was keen on trying.   For four people, we ordered the koobideh combo ($8.85), the chenjeh combo ($9.99), the baghali polo & lamb shank combo ($10.99), and the kashk bademjan combo ($6.99). Combo basically means you can choose a pop or a side salad to go with your order. Our total was $41 and a bit. We had about a big square takeout box and a half's worth of food left over after we finished.   The kashk bademjan was a pureed mixture of eggplant, whey, caremelized mint and onions. I thought it came with bread. It did not, so my combo ended up being dip and salad. For $6.99, it wasn't cheap, but it was very tasty with our rice.  The koobideh combo came with rice, a grilled whole tomato, and two long skewers of minced beef. The koobideh was tender. I wouldn't make the trek out here for it though. I know a few places that do similar for about the same price and they're closer to home.   The chenjeh combo was the only one out of our main course combos that came in a rectangular takeout box instead of a square one. That was confusing. This one was a tad disappointing. One skewer of lamb. It just looked like lamb chunks haphazardly placed atop white rice, once again with a grilled tomato. The lamb was tasty, but for the price, I probably would not order this again. I would order the lamb chops.   The baghali polo & lamb shank combo came with dill rice with fava beans, and a fairly large lamb shank. The lamb shank was very tender, but not very flavorful. It was also not as strong in lamb flavor as I would have liked. The rice was good. For price to portion though, this was a good deal.  We also picked up two kinds of bread (at least one of which they made in house. It was still warm when we bought it!) and a slice of vanilla roll cake. The three came to a little over $5. Pretty good for price. The vanilla roll cake was filled with lots of cream and wasn't too sweet. I think I'm going to have the bread with curry tonight. It looks great. Lots of sesame.  There are so many more things here I want to try! Next time I get the chance, I'm coming back."}
{"text":"The owner was super nice and helpful and let me sample by touch and smell the Persian Saffron I was looking for before purchase. It was practically a pure red and I don't think any dies were used. This, compared with the really low price of less than $60/ounce might make \"Super Arzon\" the definitive local place to obtain genuine Persian Saffron, also saving on high shipping and import fees."}
{"text":"How much will I spend? If you want to get FULL here you will spend about 15-20$. A regular combo meal like koobideh with two skewers will be $10 including a drink.  Ambiance and service? Well it's a grocery store, so maybe not the place for a first date :P. Service is awesome and everyone is friendly. I really like this place and have always had good experiences here.  It is more of a takeout but you can sit down albeit in a cramped area. Personally I think this grocery store has a lot of character. You can have fun looking at the different food items they sell.   Food? The only reason I come here, the food here has a very homely home cooked feel to it. The deserts are also really good. They have interesting cheeses, and shakes you can try. I've also tried some of their refrigerated rice puddings, and halwa which were great. They have a ton of menu items all of which are very tasty.   Try the fesenjan which is walnut pomegranate chicken, so yum. Karafs is another one of my favourites. Interestingly I've never had the koobideh here so I can't speak for that because they have so many other interesting menu items to try."}
{"text":"Really good Halal kebobs and best part is that they are open 24-7 and great pricing. Food is delicious and they have amazing posterizes also with some Persian ice cream. Must try!"}
{"text":"A friend told me that Super Arzon would be a good place to buy a shisha in Toronto which is how I found it. They have a bunch of them along with a lot of other Iranian groceries in their store. I'd reccomend the Lavaash bread which I believe is baked in house. It's as big as a doormat and I think impossible to carry without folding and tastes excellent. They also have a little restaurant but seating is cramped and right next to a freezer. The food is about the same price as Altona Kebab next door which I'd reccomend over Arzon. The person who owns Altona used to work at Arzon and then went ahead and opened his own place next door. There's another, almost identical supermarket in the same plaza called Pars Bakery which unfortunately closes at about 10 whereas Arzon is open 24 hours (except the restaurant which closes at 4)"}
{"text":"Super Arzon is a great place to go if you're craving Persian food fresh off the grill.  I love coming here after the gym for a hearty late-night meal.  They're also a mini-market, selling groceries and Iranian items not available in regular grocery shops.  Highly recommend trying their Ayran drink, Gata cake, and their sesame flatbread!"}
{"text":"Super Arzon is a neat, tightly-packed Iranian grocery store.  They have a great selection of products that represent the rich diversity of Persian foods.  In addition to being a market, they have a lunch counter that serves fresh kebabs, rice, and other options. Limited seating is available for dine in patrons.  At the front of the store there is a nice display counter full of pastries, cookies, and other treats.  Parking is available in the front of the store, but it is limited."}
{"text":"Honestly i love this place, but for the past 8 months they changed the way the make their koobideh kebab, It's gotten really thinner it almost looks like a belt. And because it's gotten so thin it's gotten dryer as well, I've complaint to the workers in the past but I guess they just ignored it. If they change back the way the use to make, It I would come back in a heartbeat, but until them I have to go somewhere else.  This was my go-to place for koobideh and especially when I have family gatherings,  But besides that. they sell everything from  sweets to their deli meats which are really good  I hope the owner sees this review, because I really like this place and I really hope they change the  koobideh kebab back to the way it use to be."}
{"text":"Bustling, filled to the brim Persian market with an eat-in and take out deli. You can find anything from lamb hearts to saffron ice cream sandwiches. There is a large selection of still warm, freshly baked breads, sweets and nuts. Friendly staff, stop in for a warm bowl of ash, skewered koobideh and tomatoes grilled over an open fire, jars of pickled vegetables, pomegranates, dates, feta cheese pulses or rice -- this place has it all."}
{"text":"Cream filled sweets that are never too sweet to end your very satisfying kabab dinner from next door and Prince of Persia from Suuuuperrrrrr Arzon soon comes to mind as you get royally stuffed with their specialties.  24 hr operation and the bright lights shine proudly on the assorted nuts, baklava and dried fruits for your choosing.   I, on the other hand come here for their cream filled pistachio topped dun dun dun (see picture) and no matter how messy it gets in the car, every crumb is worth vacuuming.... in about 2 wks though, winter delays life."}
{"text":"If you are craving Persian food at 2 o'clock in the morning , this is your go to place!   Super Arzon is a Persian grocery store that offers fresh authentic Persian food made on the other side of the shop. I went with my best friend who is half Persian, and she did all the ordering. They grill all the kabobs once you place in a order, which makes it very fresh. I ordered the Vaziri combo, which has one beef and one chicken kabobs on top of basmati rice, with a grilled tomato on the side. My friend got Koobideh, which included two beef kabobs on top of basmati rice and a grilled tomato on the side.  The food portion was definitely more than I anticipated, but prices were very reasonable because of what was given. Although the location is quite far from me, I would make the travel there just to purchase the food.  The parking lot may be a little tight and busy, but it depends on the hour of the day. It is on Yonge street, and it is always busy day and night !"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a couple years, and they never let me down. I always get beef kebab with tomatoes, rice, and the bottom of the pan. I've never been disappointed, absolutely love their kebabs. Also their sweets are regular but pretty good. Custard one is my favourite."}
