{"text":"I think the quality of Ancora's coffee is superior. I frequent their University Avenue location for its proximity and big windows and bright interior that make it a pleasant place to study and write. (But why is it so small??) The staff there is refreshingly friendly and hard-working too. Sadly, they do not make the best cappuccinos. But far worse, their baked goods are terrible. The limp, greasy things they call croissants? Too-sweet, unsubstantial oatmeal cookies? The hoagie rolls they call \"baguettes\"? I don't think so! It seems a shame that proprietors who have such high standards for coffee lack the same requirements for the food they serve with the coffee. It's insulting to the coffee!! I'll spare the local producer of these sub-par baked items by not naming them here. Meanwhile, I suggest sneaking-in pastries from La Brioche across the street. Or for the King St. location, bring in pastries from Café Soleil. Stick with a regular cup of coffee and bring your own snacks."}
{"text":"Great coffee! But alas, the service is quite slow during the AM rush hour.  It looks as though there is quite a bit of new staff right now so understandable that it wouldn't be super speedy....but having two people making coffee during peak hours would make me much more likely to stop for java on my way to work.  Also, thumbs up on stocking Batch Bakehouse!"}
{"text":"Starting right when you walk in, this place is THE. CUTEST. It's like dining inside of a Pinterest board, complete with wood beams topped with plants, hand painted murals, and a built in garage door wall that opens onto a cute little patio. 
The wide selection of crafted coffee drinks are delightful, (GET THE MIEL IT'S SOO GOOD, also lavender lemonade so fresh), and their rotating selection of brewed drip coffees keep things interesting day to day. They also have killer house made bloodies and mimosas (with fresh-squeezed oj or strawberry oj!).
This is the first Ancora with a full kitchen and menu, and it is ridiculous. It's the kind of menu that makes you want to post up and just eat all of your meals there through the day. To name a few things I can't get over - lamb shank hash, veggie benedict (complete with cauliflower steak instead of an english muffin, I mean come on), and the basil chicken salad sandwich. 
To top it off, the staff is extraordinarily friendly, and the service is excellent. The front of house staff always greets you with a smile to start your day off right, and food flies out of the kitchen.
Just wonderful all around."}
{"text":"wonderful coffee .... not burned like st*# !^£!s  !

i have had coffee in europe , and central america ....... ancora is one of a few great places in the states !"}
{"text":"This was renovated recently and for the best! It is so adorable inside. If you are not a coffee drinker.... at least get there and get a tea or hot cocoa! You will love it. Perfect nook for studying. I know, Starbucks is reliable. But people: support something local like this! You can't get charm like this at Starbucks. I love to order the cafe au lait. Just Delicious. I recently got their cappuccino. SO adorable! They are excellent at their craft. The workers are friendly. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. You can even get some fresh ground coffee to take home! If you are near the UW hospital on University: hit this place up! You won't be disappointed. Always check for their specials: they will probably have something new to try on there that is more seasonal."}
{"text":"The best coffee in Madison hands down, and I've been everywhere. I almost always order the drip coffee of the day, and love it when I'm lucky enough to go in and find that African coffee is on the menu. Everything they do is gold, from great espresso to fantastic drip coffee. They do things the right way--roast their own beans, grind fresh for each espresso drink, and keep their equipment clean. You won't find these three qualities anywhere else in town. 

If you go to Starbucks down the road, you're getting swindled out of a great cup. Go to Ancora instead and support a fantastic local business!

About me: I've roasted coffee at home for the last 7 years and own two professional espresso machines along with two pro grinders and a lot of other equipment, so it's rare that I find cafes that can pull off better coffee than what I make at home. In fact, I've only ever found one or two that can. Ancora is one of them."}
{"text":"Such a nice place to come for your morning coffee. Staff is always smiling and friendly. Lots of options for drinks and also really great breakfast/brunch options."}
{"text":"The lattes and pomegranate tea are good. It's a nice place to study if you have headphones in given that they have a plentiful dispersion of outlets for your devices and speedy wifi. I don't know if I would be able to focus without headphones however, given that their weekend brunch has a pretty steady flow of traffic. It might be quieter on a weekday. Their breakfast menu was good but a little expensive given the average portion size. I really liked my Veggie Eggs Benedict and the breakfast potatoes were nice and crunchy. I'd like to try their pancakes the next time I'm there as I saw a few orders go out and they looked wonderful."}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE EVER

Love this place.
Actually maybe a bit better than my other review of Victor Allen's...but I like their cafe a bit better. This is more of a place to stop by than to stay.

Get the Ancora D'Oro for home, and the White Zombie for right now. (Almond flavor is my favorite) 
Or the mocha, which is heavenly. Seriously, the best mocha I've ever had. EVEREVEREVER. The chocolate has some weight, but blends perfectly to be a grown-up version of chocolate milk you had as a kid. 
The White Zombie is a strange and beautiful thing. A \"white coffee\" drink, it's light and powerful, you will feel like a high-powered cloud ghost zooming around after drinking this. They tried to change the name to White Lightning, but no one wants to feel a crackling electric jolt. Don't worry, the zombie will carry you through the day like a white flotaki magic carpet, smooth, airy and sensuous."}
{"text":"I came here from out of town and needed to get work done. The breakfast sandwich menu was limited (not the same one they had online). I got a bagel and a latte. Latte was pretty good.. (I'll give it 3.5 stars). Service was great. However it became packed by 830 am and very noisy! If you need a place to hang out, this might be it, but if you're looking for a quiet place to work then look elsewhere."}
{"text":"in three [alliterative] words- scrumptious, spotless, & stunning. It's a shame that many of the existing reviews for this great cafe seem to be for its incarnation in a previous location. the new one is airy and spacious, with a full kitchen offering up a brunch that rivals any downtown hotspot. I had the scramble of the day- a creative melange of local ingredients including Underground Butcher sausage- my brunch companion had a flawless eggs Benedict. They use local eggs & I gotta say I felt spoiled- the upgraded flavor profile was noticeable. We both enjoyed some thick-cut peppery bacon and bakery fresh sourdough toast with whipped butter. I saw their peach French toast on a nearby table and it looked so delicious I almost ordered one for dessert- but our plates proved filling, and there was no room. Next time! In fact, there are a lot of entrees I am excited to try on their menu. The dining area inside the restaurant was thoughtfully arranged and chicly decorated- a nice respite from the overly crowded/extra loud/cookie cutter decor often found elsewhere. There was also a little sidewalk cafe area outside for those hoping to dine al fresco- the on-trend garage door window out in that entry area gives the whole front of the shop a refreshing outdoorsy feel. Service was great- prices reasonable- beverage selection plentiful. Definitely worth a little detour to University Ave from the east side."}
{"text":"A tiny nook of a coffee shop and small menu. The baristas were really nice and explained that they can basically turn any drink into a blended frappachino or poured over ice for the hot WI summers. 

They do offer a limited bakery selection as well as have almond and soy milk substitutions."}
{"text":"Clean, bright aesthetic, good coffee drinks, and kind service.  It exceeded my expectations of coffee shops and I stopped in on the way to work the other morning and then again today to do some studying.

I ordered a white zombie latte and was impressed on how delicious it was; if you're a regular at any other coffee shop in this area, I'd highly recommend popping into Ancora to see what's up, because what they're doing is good.  Staff was friendly and attentive and there is ample numbers of tables, but maybe don't come with more than 1 or 2 other people.  

If you're looking for place to bite and study, there are plenty of outlets and the menu looked delicious, so I'll have to come back and try some of their food.  Also pro tip: got a late night ahead of you?  They have BOTTOMLESS coffee.  Absolutely wild and brilliant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and the first time I went they were out of what I went there for. Bummer! But I still walked away with a great coffee. 
I got their harvest bowl and it was delicious. It did not quite fill me up, but I like to eat. 
The decor is beautiful, and I love what they did with the space. 
Just a tip - they do sell out of menu items often, so be careful. That's the only thing that kept me from giving them 5 stars. Every time I went there were out of multiple items by noon."}
{"text":"I loved my light roast. Interesting after taste. Not bad but different. WAY better than mainstream coffee shops; I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ancora coffee is greater than ANY OTHER COFFEE. I'm serious. If you're in Madison and want a delectable, well-made latte, go here. The newest location (University Ave) is aesthetically pleasing and the baristas know what they are doing! Try a White Zombie if you need an extra-extra pep in your step - It is a beverage that uses lightly roasted coffee beans (white in color) and pack a little more punch (hi CAFFEINE) than your typical drink. I would go to Ancora more frequently if it were on my way to work, but I still make it a weekly stop."}
{"text":"My husband is really picky...
Really, really picky when it comes to coffee.
I order chai, lattes, iced coffee and have varying results at different locations. 
My husband drinks black coffee with sugar so he is judging by the most basic staple when he chooses where to get coffee. 
Ancora is his FAVORITE in Madison. 
After I tried both their soy iced and hot latte with a bit of honey I was convinced! 
Yes! 
So heavenly!!"}
{"text":"Ancora is a great coffee shop. The ambiance is one of my favorite coffee-shop environments, and they make a solid latte and iced brew. Their breakfast sandwich is incredibly tasty. The only reasons for the 4 star review instead of 5: 1) on multiple occasions I've had to wait longer than at other coffee shops to get my drink and/or food order. 2) I also feel their menu is not as straightforward as it could be regarding pricing - only one price is listed per drink, but they do offer different sizes (obviously different prices). 3) They have a limited selection of bakery items."}
{"text":"Wow, am I ever glad I went to breakfast this morning. This is a fantastic neighborhood coffee place. Just perfect for a long morning with your laptop, bottomless cup of coffee & a breakfast sandwich. Even though the menu is inexpensive, it can add up if you are in for the long haul. I love the extensive breakfast menu and the fresh squeezed orange juice. It is for the most part quiet, just the usual coffee place noises. Ancora has parking in the back where the outdoor tables are located. I would hesitate to use this place for a big group, there is a high top table & chairs that seat about six, but no more than that.

Those with small kids might want to go elsewhere, as maneuvering your stroller through the narrow spaces might hang you up and if your kid is ambulatory they could easily get hurt tripping someone in the tight space."}
{"text":"Food much better than the usual coffee house fare, and staff is great. My spouse has an unusual allergy to pepper and they went to great lengths to find out if there was any pepper in their ingredients and put  together a dish for him. Thank you!
Pleasant vibe, which you might not think from the outside.
One whole wall with electrical outlets at every table, so great for
working as well."}
{"text":"Always looking for the best brunch places and this place easily makes my top favorite places. Immediately when you walk in the fun decor catches your eye and soon you are greeted by friendly staff, happy to recommend their own favorite dishes. My friend and I ordered the chorizo hash with a smoothie and Ancora pancakes with bacon and a mimosa. The smoothie was finish to the last drop, delicious! the chorizo hash was full of flavor and the pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. And since I love mimosas I can happily report these were made to perfection. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I walked in at the stroke of 3 to get an iced coffee.  They close at 3 and I was told sorry we are closed.  It takes about 30 seconds to make an iced coffee.  It was a real turn off"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee in Madison! The salted carmel latte gives me life. The beans are great quality. Friendly staff, great coffee."}
{"text":"Such a cute coffee shop! Aesthetically pleasing decor - loved the colors and the wood work. 

The baristas are very friendly and went over all the coffee choices on the menu. They have lots of non-dairy milk options: almond, soy, coconut and oat milk. I got an almond milk single shot macchiato to go. It was small strong slightly bitter and delicious. The breakfast menu looked great and I wish I had time to sit and enjoy the meal. I ordered an egg and cheese on croissant to go. 

The weather is gorgeous right now and they had plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy it. 

I scarfed down the sandwich on my drive back to work. It was piping hot and huge! Not your BK croissantwich. This was a gourmet AF sandwich. The croissant was buttery and had been grilled so had crispy bits as well... the aioli was great and the eggs was fluffy. An awesome not-so-average egg and cheese sandwich. 

Can't wait to try more off the coffee menu."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop! Well actually its also very much a cafe. Their food menu is much more extensive than most coffee shops. They do have a small selection of bakery items. I haven't tried any since they didn't look all that enticing to me-most items look over baked. They have a very extensive breakfast and lunch menu. Ingredients were very fresh. The Hollandaise sauce got rave reviews from a very picky Hollandaise connoisseur. I really enjoyed the Southwest Veggie sandwich. Coffee was great and the iced tea was fresh. Staff is very friendly. The space is fantastic and it's much bigger than I expected. I loved the decor-somehow both bright/cheery and zen at the same time. There was a 50/50 mix of people doing work and those socializing. Easy parking thanks to the lot behind it. Awesome addition to the area."}
{"text":"Ventured in here for the first time after a sleepless night and was in dire need of caffeine. I opted out of the white zombie latte, but will try it next time. I chose the raspberry mocha latte during Valentine's week. It wasn't too sweet - it was like biting into a raspberry filled chocolate truffle. I'd like to sit down there sometime and try out the rest of the stuff!"}
{"text":"The smoothie I ordered was warm. They need to use frozen fruit or add ice or something. It wasn't refreshing at all!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, pretty good food but major drawbacks with the ordering, waiting, and coffee doctoring area.  The staff could stand to be a little more pleasant especially when their customers are...which might be helped if they were a bit more organized.  Definitely could use some improvement but a good coffee place overall."}
{"text":"Your to go cups are shit. The lid poped off and spilt hot coffee on my twice. Coffee was good,  shop was super cute. The girls checking me out were not welcoming. Hot coffee burns."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Madison. I went to Ancora mainly to get their excellent coffee but I didn't know they had this amazing verity of breakfast options. Hash lamb was delicious and the tomato soup was spicy and flavorful. One down part of my experience was that you have to pay to use their WiFi. Highly recommended the place."}
{"text":"Wow! Finally stopped in to this new location and am impressed. Note a lot of older reviews here are of their tiny old location. I was skeptical, because they are not my favorite coffee in town and the old joint was lackluster, but am really happy with the Guatemala I'm drinking and moist pastry I'm enjoying (cinnamon roll made of croissant dough). They have a small pastry case and all the goodies are either croissant or biscuit/scone (?) dough based. I had no idea they have a full breakfast menu! Everything sounds so yummy (breakfast sandwich biscuit with honey Sriracha butter!), but alas, I was only planning on a pastry nibble.

The interior is super cute and service very nice.  Some sidewalk seating in the parking lot area. Variety of tables, and sufficient outlets for computers. Free wifi, as expected. Tea lovers will also find lots of choices here. Small lunch menu, but nice options. I'm coming back for breakfast pronto!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to pick up a coffee or espresso drink before I head to my office.  I really enjoy (and usually get) the Caffe Miel.  It has the cinnamon notes I like.  Sweetened with honey.  So good.  There are seasonal drinks that are very entertaining to read on the menu while waiting for my order to be ready.  The Bakery items are usually fresh from local bakery locations. 

This location is small so I don't really linger here.  But it looks comfortable enough is you don't have an office across the street to go to.  Good price points on the drinks compared to other coffee establishments you may find along near westside University Ave."}
{"text":"I frequent the downtown location for coffee but finally went for brunch to this University Ave location Sunday December 3rd and had an eggnog latte, apple cider mimosa and the espresso french toast. Everything was absolutely amazing. I love the seasonality of the menu! Great atmosphere and staff also, I will definitely be coming back and recommending to others!"}
{"text":"Wee coffee shop; only open til 530 on weekdays and closes even earlier on weekends.  Options offered are OK.

This Ancora offers free wifi, pastries (origins unknown), and a small selection of Gigi's cupcakes.  It appears most customers are getting their drinks to go, maybe because the Starbucks on University Avenue is quite busy in the morning rush hour.

Beverages are actually a little too sweet for my taste, but I can't speak for the brewed coffee.   Prices are just about average for locally owned coffee places.

Not much to say here. I really just consider it more of a \"get in, get drink, and go\" kind of place/"}
{"text":"The coffee is decent and they have a solid WiFi connection, which are the only reasons this review was elevated to two stars. Good was under seasoned, cooked unevenly, and all around unappetizing. Furthermore, for all that you have to pay far more than I would have expected for a chain coffee shop. For my money, I'd go to colectivo (or even barriques) every time."}
{"text":"Ancora Coffee is the coffee shop that Madison wants and needs, we just need it downtown! Unfortunately, the downtown location of Ancora is VERY different than this one. 

A full breakfast menu? Heck yeah!!! I got the egg and cheese croissant sandwich with a side of veggie sausage, both of which were out of this world delicious. I also tried their cold brew, which was good. 

The space is bright and open, with a garage-door style door in the front which can be opened during the summer. 

The staff were friendly and inviting. 

Seriously, go check out the menu. It is large, progressive, and tasty. It could compete with many of the downtown \"brunch\" spots, and I am a tough brunch critique."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch, and this place was pretty disappointing.  Eggs were grossly undercooked, I'm fine with them being runny, but this wasn't that.  Sausage patties were really chewy and lacked flavor.  The bacon and sourdough bread was good though.  The bloody mary was pretty solid, but no chaser was offered.  My girlfriend enjoyed her cappuccino, but the espresso french toast were overwhelmed by the espresso flavor.  Not a good stop today.  The bloody mary kept this from being a 1."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the world! Everyone that works there is super friendly and helpful if you have a question about one of the varieties.  Give it a SHOT You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch menu, locally-sourced food, amazing coffees, spot-on bloodies and mimosas in this sheik new brunch space.  You NEED to check it out!"}
