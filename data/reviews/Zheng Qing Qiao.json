{"text":"You know what they say about Chinese restaurants: if it is approved by a Chinese friend, it's good.   My Chinese friend and I wanted to go someplace different, order for takeout and eat in the park, which is pretty much the only option at Zheng Qing Qiao (hereinafter \"Zheng\"). Located in a mall in Chinatown (entrance on St-Urbain), the restaurant is really small and there are only three small tables.   She recommended Zheng, because of the authenticity of Northern Chinese cuisine. Two great things about this place: (1) prices and (2) quality of the food, and let's face these two qualities are rarely found together in restaurants nowadays.   First, the prices are extremely low. They offer two portions for everything on their menu: small and large. I ordered a small fried chicken, rice and bok choy for $4.60 (all prices include taxes).  From what I can remember, the large portions didn't exceed $8.00. The small is about the size of a very large bowl of cereals. Perfect for a small appetite or for eating with an appetizer.   Second, the food is all handmade. My friend insisted that their Chinese burger is authentic and delicious (shame on me I didn't try it). While we were waiting for our orders, we could see one of the cooks making them by hand with the fresh dough. They smelled so delicious and I regretted no ordering one. Next time, I will.   My meal, despite being more Korean than Chinese, was delicious. Even though we walked 15 minutes outside in hot and humid weather, my chicken was still crispy. The rice was good and the bok choy was perfectly cooked and warm. Few things I hate more than soggy or tepid bok choy, which is what I usually get.   Will I go back? Definitely. Zheng is one of Montreal's hidden treasures in terms of price and quality. However, know where you'll eat your food."}
{"text":"I discovered this small restaurant in the mall underneath Maison Kam Fung after Sarah Musgrave reviewed their pork panini in her \"Sandwich Club\" series in the Gazette. This sandwich is so great and so cheap that it alone earns these folks a five-star rating. $2.50 gets you a toasted, oval-shape sandwich about the side of a ping pong racket, studded with sesame seeds and stuffed with shredded pork and cilantro. You could certainly get a McDouble at McDonald's for under $2 instead, but you'd need to eat two or three of those in place of this guy. The filling is reminiscent of pulled pork in texture but the flavouring is another thing entirely -- I'm pretty sure there's star anise in there among other things. It's rich and a little drippy -- it moistens the bread with fatty deliciousness and you'll want to lick every drop off your fingers. Napkin recommended.   Yes, they have very good bubble tea and noodle bowls too, but as far as I'm concerned that's just extra credit once you get a load of that killer sandwich."}
{"text":"Small place not for more than ten people. People most here to take out. I always sit in and it seems too tight. The price is soooo good.  You will be surprised.   The owner is nice. I like him.  I recommend the deep fried pork rice and beef rice. My friend ordered noodle which is good too. However, I prefer rice. We also tried curry fish ball and marinated egg. We love them."}
{"text":"I'm having mixed feelings about this place. Everything was nice until I had their noodle soup.  Let's start with what's good. The scallion pancake is crispy, thin, and satisfying. For 50 cents, they add an egg on the pancake. The drinks are colourful, but I've never had any.  The chinese hamburger isn't as good as people described it here, but maybe it's because I had the spicy version (whatever hot sauce they used, it wasn't good). It's essentially a braised pork sandwich. The meat has a similar texture to pulled pork, but the taste is chinese. They also add a bit of coriander, but it wasn't enough.  Anyway, the braised beef noodle soup is the reason I'm only giving 3 stars. The broth was bland, the flavours were hard to identify and it was even lacking in salt. The udon noodles were obviously store bought and of cheap quality. The braised beef was the only tasty element, but everything else diluted its goodness.   My friend had a fried chicken filet noodle soup (same broth). I didn't look closely but it seems like it was a frozen chicken burger patty, my god.  From what I understand, people call in to order cold noodle dishes and pan fried dumplings, so I might try that next time."}
