{"text":"Petit restaurant mexicain pas chères et très bon.... Le personnel est vraiment sympa et le service est aussi rapide que leurs espagnol (pour les plus téméraires)...
Pour ma part, je le prends a emporter (ce n'est pas très loin pour moi), mais le mieux est de manger sur place (C'est meilleur quand ça vient juste de sortir du four!!!)"}
{"text":"Good food but not out of this world, slightly pricy for lunch. Service was fantastic. I asked to alter my plate and it wasn't an issue.I would recommend trying the mole. Tacos are rolled up and deep fried, a tad on the dry side."}
{"text":"Went last night food was eh , to expensive for what you get. The cheese quesadilla had no flavour paid over $10 for 4 . Not worth it, if it was in a high end of town I would understand but it's not. The portions were just to small"}
{"text":"Margaritha trop sucré. Ceviche hyper salé dont le poisson était effiloché et les oignons blanc plutôt que rouge. Je n'ai retournerais pas"}
{"text":"Authentique, simple et simplement bon! Le guacamole est extra et les tacos délicieux."}
{"text":"Le vrai gout du Mexique. Pas de chichis dans ce restau simple et très agréable!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with colleagues today. We were looking for the best tacos in the city. We didn't find them. I ordered the tacos Nestor (shredded pork) as a lunch special. The soup (chicken) was meh, though the tortilla soup I was assured was delicious- a delicate balance between texture and taste. The tacos were small...three bites and move onto the next one. The rice and refried beans were ordinary...filler. I would go back and choose something different perhaps something featured. Maybe the trade-off of lunch special price to quality was too much."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with some coworkers. I lived in Los Angeles and went to many Mexican restaurants. This place did not meet my expectations unfortunately. The portions were super small and the food wasn't tasty. The staff was very nice. It was a bit expensive and not worth it. I don't think I will go back"}
{"text":"Viens a ce restaurant depuis des années ce trouvais de l'autre côté de la rue auparavant. Adore les tacos ici de bonne portion le prix est tres juste et l'on ressort toujours avec le ventre remplie. Une de mes tortilla soupe preferée un bon bouillons gouteux de la crème du fromage juste parfait. Le service est rapide employés très sympathiques. J'ai toujours tendences à prendre la table d'hotes on ne ce trompe jamais , mais il y a des speciaux pour ceux qui ne veulent que des tacos qui valent le détour. C'est un bon restau ils savent ce qui plait au clients et on service impécable un incontournable des restaurant mexicain."}
{"text":"Beaucoup trop cher pour ce genre de nourriture. Les drinks beaucoup trop petits pour le prix."}
{"text":"Great food although service was a little slow. Table d'hote is reasonably priced but appetizers a little expensive."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've had by far. The atmosphere is friendly, the service as well, and the food is filling (plus delicious!) We had the mixed appetizer which included chicken tacos, some kind of mini pizzas, guacamole, and beans. For the main we shared steak and cheese tacos. It came with onions. coriander and lime. So flavorful!! Their tortilla soup is also a must try. 

There is a mini grocery store in the restaurant, you can buy hot sauces and other condiments/items. Price is relatively reasonable and the waitresses were very confident about the quality of their food. They have every right to because it was amazing. Apparently the chefs have been working there for years and years so they consistently make good food.

If you're into authentic Mexican food, try this joint. (I'm positive it is authentic)."}
{"text":"J'y vais relativement régulièrement. De la très bonne bouffe à très bon prix. Les portions sont juste ce qu'il faut. Cuisine familiale authentique et la soupe aux tacos en entrée est juste trop bonne!"}
{"text":"We come here regularly to have Chipotle shrimp, the sauce is heavenly. The service is incredibly friendly. Our favorite neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I have a soft side for mexican cuisine; tacos, guac, churros YOU NAME IT. I stumbled upon this place while walking and i quickly made a google search and few days after i was here eating with some friends. Its REAL DEAL authentic mexican food. The service was kind of slow but it was a friday night so thats understandable, our waitress was so sweet and patient. The dishes were well seasoned and delicious. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food here wasn't to bad, but I've had better Mexican food. The staff was very friendly. The price was a little high for the portions they were giving. The tortilla soup was very good with a nice spicy kick to it. The tacos I had were pretty good but could use a little flavoring. The horchata was very good. I was kinda surprised they give free chips for the table."}
{"text":"J'habite le coin et j'ai eu l'occasion d'aller quelques fois la bas. J'avais vu les bonnes critiques quand jetais plus jeunes ainsi que Josée Distasio qui allait pendant un émission.

Je trouve que comparé a d'autres mexicains du meme type c'est quand meme cher pour la portion. 

La soupe de tortilla est bonne. Les crevettes dans une sauce coco chipotle aussi tres bon mais je suis a chaques fois decue par les tacos....  pis je suis une grosse fan de tacos. Les tacos al pastor manque un petit oumfff 

Jaime le fait qu'ils ont une petite boutique a meme le restaurant  et qu'ils vendent des produits mexicains. 

Le service est efficace et courtois. Les micheladas sont bons."}
{"text":"Something about temperatures in the -30s makes me crave Mexican, call me crazy, and this Montrealer's quest for authentic eats of this ethnicity is endless so when I saw Shirley's review I bookmarked it and headed east. I can second that the service was super friendly and chill and the food was delicious - I had a green salsa vegetarian dish that was dreamy and spicy and good. The decor is casual, but not too brightly lit and grocery-store-esque as at Roi du Taco. The tv is on and the Latin American families tucked into the booths seem happy. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Voilà ce que j'apelle de la vrai ourriture mexicaine. Les tacos son delicieux et le service sans reproche. Seul  hic: Les boissons ne sont pas tous bonne et les tacos petit mais le gout en vaut la chandelle"}
{"text":"I had never been to an Authentic Mexican restaurant before , so for date night my boyfriend and I decided to try this spot . 

It was fantastic ! Incomparable to the usual
 \" 3 amigos \" This is real rice and great fresh  ingredients . 

We took the Enchiladas Rojos side order with soft tacos and tacos Friyos meal;  It was Addictive !

Do not forget to try for desert the fried plantain con leche It is finger licking good ! 

The ambiance is very cosy and calm with latin music background. 

The best mexican i have tasted so far"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Very authentic and everything was fresh. 

The only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waitress was very rude for no apparent reason. I am not picky on service and I don't except much in this type of restaurant... But I don't like feeling unwelcome. We were 2 and we went in the afternoon and there were only another 2 patrons. The waitress was having lunch and she was not very pleased to be bothered. 

I will try it again or order take-out because food was excellent. Who knows... Maybe she was having a bad day."}
