{"text":"there's a restaurant among you that you probably never heard of. in a unassuming gray building on Denison avenue, I am speaking of LoVellee's grub pub. This place is amazing on the inside the owner chose a bold color scheme with a very contemporary feel. I was impressed with the feel it's cozy with a uncluttered atmosphere a refreshing take on what a restaurant should be. The food was equally extraordinary large portions served up like they should be with no nonsense, Just what you order the way you want it and plenty of it. There beverage selection is vast everything from your basic soft drink to and imported and domestic beer served like they should be as cold as an ex lovers heart. The more adventures may want to pair a nice wine with their meal or order up a mixed cocktail to suit their pallet. I know whatever your into LoVellee's grub pub will have something to satisfy it, I would highly recommend getting down there as soon as you can because you can't go another day without trying it."}
{"text":"I went to LoVellee's (not sure why it's spelled wrong here) and was pretty disappointed.  I figured we'd give it a shot because it was so close to home, but I'll probably never eat there again.

We ordered a pizza and hot wings.  The pizza wanted to be good, but it ended up being pretty mediocre.  I'd eat it again, but I think a chain pizza would probably be better, and I'm typically not a fan of chain pizza's.

Now the hot wings.  Here was the nail in the coffin.  I think I can honestly say these were the worst hot wings I've ever eaten.  Seriously, they were awful.  They were so dry they might as hell have been chicken jerky.  Then, the majority of the wings had so little meat on them I think the chicken must have been a skeleton.  The sauce was also some generic form of Tabasco, and was totally unimpressive.  They really were pathetic.

I was going to give this place one star, but figured the pizza was edible enough that I might as well give it two, but I won't be eating there again, that's for sure.

Good luck if you decide to try it out!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good pizza fresh. Takes a little longer but that's fresh pizza.  Can't be rushed! Will come again."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Huge portions! Great prices! When we were there for St. Patrick's Day, they had live music, and they often have an amazing live DJ."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town! Giant fresh cut fries and excellent customer service. Will be my new burger spot for a long time."}
{"text":"Plain cheese pizza is good. Not greatest but definitely not bad at all. I sat at the bar on a Saturday evening and found the service to be very accommodating. It's a family run place and really care that you're happy with everything."}
{"text":"We came into LoVellee's after a long day at the Cleveland Zoo.  We had an order of fried mushrooms, six mild wings and a white pizza and two iced teas. The food was delicious. Particularly the chicken wings. Cooked perfectly and with Frank's Red Hot and butter served with a side of blue cheese.  The owner of the establishment (Brenda) was wonderful. When we arrived we were welcomed very warmly inside and seated at a very comfortable and accommodating table.  The close proximity of this gem to the Cleveland Zoo should make it a no brainer to stop by for a good pizza good service and and a friendly atmosphere.  Dinner and service was topped off with a complimentary piece of Italian Cream Cake and strawberries.  The prices are fair - the food was great - the service was top notch. Go ahead and say hello to Brenda and her staff at LoVellee's."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I know jack sh!t about pizza.

I don't tend to eat much pizza as cheese (and larger amounts of dairy) tend to play merry hob with my digestion.  When I do eat this \"poison fruit\" I tend to commit, what I know to be a cardinal sin, by removing much of the cheese.  That said, most of this review is based upon the opinion of my 20 year old, college student brother, from Chicago.  So if it is completely off base, let me know and I will give you his address so you can get your money back.  And while you are at it, try to get the $50 he owes me too.

So little Bro decided to visit me from Chicago.  As he is but a youngen, \"hitting the bar's\" was out (have to be the responsible big brother you know.) Plus, I had my son and children's services also seem to frown on kids and bars (Don't know why, the kid is a descendent of a rum runner and a Polish/Irish hybrid, so I think he will likely spend much of his life drinking, why not teach him how to do it right?  But I digress.)  So we decided on a night in.

I saw this place open around the corner from me about a year or so ago, but until know I have not had a reason to try it.  I wish I had.

For my part, I found the pizza really good.  The sauce was flavorful with a little kick, the crust tasty and not greasy.  Much better than your national chains.  Overall I was quite impressed.  This sentiment was echoed by brother who, I know eats a lot of pizza.  Best of all, the bill for our large one topping pizza, garlic bread and 2 liter of Coke was $15.00 and change.

We picked-up our food, but did get to check out the interior of the restaurant.  It was colorful, clean, upbeat and had a nice bar.  (It also had a video gaming room for those into that thing.)  I believe they also have a patio.  Again I was impressed.  And as there is a lack of decent dining in the Denison-Fulton area, LoVellee's is a pleasant surprise.

They sent us home with a take-out menus that includes sandwiches and pasta.  I will definitely try their other offerings and update this review accordingly.  But based on my pizza experience, that of my brothers, the price and most importantly, the fact that I actually have a restaurant within walking distance of my home, I have to give this place 4 stars."}
