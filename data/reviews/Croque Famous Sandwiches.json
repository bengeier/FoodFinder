Love the owners too, down to earth and very caring people ."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while visiting a nail salon. The bulgogi sandwich and spicy pork sandwich are delish. Went back one week later to try the bulgogi plate and bibimbap. They were even better than the sandwiches. Very friendly service. A gem tucked away. I'm glad we found it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker because we were driving by and decided to stop. I ordered the Teryaki Chicken Bowl and he ordered the #3 sandwich with potato salad.

I requested brown rice, for a $0.50 upcharge. I was told a few minutes later that they didn't have any brown rice, so I'd be getting white. When it came, the broccoli, onions, and carrots were very good, but the chicken was obviously processed and pressed into a chicken shape. It wasn't bad, but wasn't good. If they had brown rice, it may have helped. If they had made any sort of attempt to appease me for the fact that I was paying extra for nothing would have helped too. I could have complained about it, but I didn't really think I should have had to.

My co-worker said the sandwich was ok, the lettuce was from the base of the leaf, so it was not very good. He said the potato salad seemed like an idea that they had with last year's Thanksgiving mashed potato left-overs. It was pretty bad.

I did like the Mediterranean pomagranate green tea, but since it was brewed via a machine, it doesn't feel like they deserve credit for that.

Lastly, on my way out I noticed two open cans of Progresso soup on the counter, right next to the soup crock. Maybe I'm naiive, but if a restaurant is going to serve Progresso soup, should they really bother serving soup at all?

It wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but I don't think they'll get anther chance from me, even though it appears a handful of people had a good experience here."}
{"text":"The mushroom brie soup was fine dining quality and they customized a wrap for me. That was so nice of them to do and so delicious to eat. My favorite lunch I have had delivered in the past year by far!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Croque for years now (and several times a week many weeks). Lily and David, the owners, are wonderful. The food is fresh and delicious and all tastes home made. We have tried lots of things here: many of the sandwiches, the salads, the ramen soup (our favorite, I have included a photo), the bowls and the other soups, all delicious! If you have not eaten here, you are missing out."}
{"text":"I had the #3 lunch special which is 6\" sandwich, small soup and small drink for $9.00 and change. I had the #10 sandwich which is the \"Croque Special\" in the Italy category. The menu was divided into regions... France, Germany, Italy, American and then somehow Korean is on there with teriyaki bowls and fried rice. They also have salads and a few wraps.

The sandwich was good and really liked the feta cheese that was on it. The soup was ok... Tasted homemade but was a little bland. I want to go back and try something else because I am a little up in the air on this place. Not knowing exactly what a \"Croque\" was I guess I was expecting something a bit more unique. Turns out it's a sub sandwich that is heated in an oven and served.

Service was good and got my food fast but it was a little hard to understand the guy who was taking my order. 

Will update when I go back..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I really liked the sandwiches and the garlic sauce that comes on it. However I will never go back due to a a long hair in my sandwich. Still really grossed out about it."}
{"text":"Excellent! I can order food for my office from here everyday because there are so many options!
I suggest trying multiple things:

Spicy Chicken Bowl
Beef Bulgogi Salad
Turkey Sandwich 
Chicken Caesar Salad

You really can eat here everyday and feel like it's a different restaurant each time because their menu is so vast.

Their delivery is also super fast, faster than Jimmy John's (who claims to be \"freaky fast\")

I love Croque!
Xoxoxo"}
{"text":"My friend and I happened to be at a business a few doors down. Decided to stop for lunch, and so glad we did. My friend had the Korean barbecue wrap, and I had the chicken teriyaki sandwich on a baguette. It appeared to be a family owned business. They were very nice and polite and the food was just delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken...could have used a little more sauce, but it was good, and spicy.
Also ordered a Greek salad. Could have had a few less slices of tomato, but easy enough to pick off and they should use kalamata olives not black, especially if they charge $8-10 .  I didn't taste the oregano or red wine...could have been in there , but minimal. The Greek dressing was good, but again, missing an essential ingredient to tie in the salad and dressing. It came with a couple of small garlic butter toasts, which were delicious... I think pita bread would have been better with the salad. 
Decent enough and plenty of options, fast delivery at lunch that I will order again."}
{"text":"They are a little slow on the lunch delivery side considering how close we are located to them. So, instead of waiting, we decided to go have lunch there. Surprisingly, even though we were there just prior to the lunch rush, it took about the same amount of time.

That being said, the food is worth the wait. It's something a bit out of the ordinary and considering the options in the area it is a nice change. My favorite is the bulgoki bowl."}
{"text":"This place was so Yummy! i love how when you order togo they wrap the sandwich \"chipotle style\" so i just tear and eat. Found them on Orderup.com. Most defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Update:

Croque has earned high marks with me. My office has put in detailed orders with several people, and our orders always arrive prepared well with no mistakes. The E-mail ordering make it easy. I've had salads, soup, rice bowls, and of course sandwiches and have yet to order something I didn't like."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but felt I needed to after my experience with Croque. We order from Croque all the time and most often have the food delivered.  In the past the food would arrive around 20 minutes later than we were told but it wasn't a big deal.  

Today when we ordered we were told our food would be delivered in 30 minutes.  An hour later still no food.  My boyfriend called and the lady told him the food was on the way without even saying sorry or anything.  Another hour went by now we had been waiting 2 hours for our 30 minute delivery.  He called back and told the lady we still had not received our order.  She said it's on its way again.  He told her I hope you are not planning on charging us for this food because we have been waiting 2 hours.  In a pissed off voice she says \"Oh so you want a free meal???\"  After some arguing she said she would not charge for the food.  

Twenty minutes later I received a call from the drive.  She told me her boss said not to charge for the food but demanded... \"you have to tip the driver\" over and over again.  I told her she could talk to my boyfriend when she got here.  She then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her.  My boyfriend told her just so you know I was going to tip you but when you deliver food 2 hours late you shouldn't call your customers and demand that they tip you.  Tipping is optional and it's based on performance.  When she got here she rang the doorbell 8 times in a row (No i'm not making this up) 

Needless to say at this point we did not tip her and will no longer be ordering from Croque.  Their customer service is a Croque of $#!%.  (Sorry I had to!!!!)"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today with a few co-workers and I was less than pleased. Then again, the name says it all - \"Croque Famous Sandwiches\". My co-workers ordered sandwiches and really enjoyed them. I ordered the Bulgoki Bowl and it was so incredibly gross. I've never tasted something so salty in my entire life. I don't even want to think about how much MSG I just consumed. i'd be interested in giving this place another shot - but next time i'm sticking to sandwiches."}
{"text":"I just had the worst customer service I've had in a restaurant in 20 years at this place.  My wife called in an order for a sandwich and a wrap, an hour early.  We get there, there is one wrap, and it's the one that was supposed to be the sandwich.  First they argued with me about whether my wife ordered a sandwich and a wrap, said we only ordered one.  I was right next to her when she ordered I know she ordered two.  Then they agreed to make the order correctly, but wanted me to pay more.  The difference was basically the sodas I ordered.  I asked them to just write off the $4.00 difference but they insisted on being paid more, even though they had an hour to get it right and couldn't.  The young girl with blue hair behind the counter was extremely belligerent.  I've been in there no less than 10 times in the last few months, yet the first time I have a problem they lied, blamed my wife and I, and the young girl with the blue hair and lousy attitude yelled at me.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"We order from Croque atleast twice a week through Grubhub at work. Their food is fantastic lunch food. I absolutely love their salads! Their croutons are AMAZING. A little too greasy for a salad, but they sure are yummy!"}
{"text":"I did not get a sandwich from here. I ordered the spicy ramen noodles since it was a chilly, rainy day. I was genuinely shocked on how amazing it was! Not that I didn't think it would be good, but it was seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had. I now crave it at least once a week! 

Not only did the amazing soup earn them the 5 stars. The service was awesome. I only ate about half a bowl of soup and asked for a to-go container. The lady came out and separated my noodles from the broth and put them in different containers. She also explained to me how to reheat it properly so it doesn't ruin the flavor. She then taped them tightly shut so it didn't leak in my car.

FYI this is an \"order at the counter\" type of place. This type of superb service was totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated. I was able to eat the rest of my ramen the next day and it tasted just as fresh and flavorful as when it was first served. This was all thanks to the wonderful service of this sandwich shop."}
{"text":"So far so good. Only been here one time and I got the chicken bowl. Was hot and fresh. I would return here again to try some more things. Service was friendly and my to go order came out pretty quick.  Oh and their chocolate chip cookies were delicious!"}
{"text":"So, I had to order two days in a row before doing a review. The first day I got the Philly cheese steak sandwich on wheat and it was delicious! The wheat roll had just the right amount of crunchy-ness on the outside and was soft on the inside. The steak was delicious as well, not cheap steak bits you get at some places, these were strips of juicy steak smothered in yummy cheese! 

The second day I got the Brie & Ham hot sandwich...again delicious! The ham was nicely sliced and had good flavor, not dry at all.

I also got a cookie both days...yum! I am a big fan and I work close so this will be a regular lunch spot for me!!"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches that are made with care. Family owned and they make own sauces. Thought it was pretty darn good! I would come back."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches and even better bowls! I order lunch delivery from Croque's about 2-3 times a week. I have never had any issues with timing or food quality. The family is also super nice every time they come in! Great experience overall. The soups are delicious too!"}
{"text":"The Hubs and I decided to hit up Croque during a weekday work from home day based on the awesome reviews.  Though I can see the potential, I wasn't as thrilled as past reviews suggested I would be.  I can't remember the specific sandwich I got, but it was decent, just nothing special (hence why I can't remember it).  Hubs had the spicy chicken rice bowl, which was his attempt at being healthy.  It really was healthy and left him longing for something more.  It did have good flavor, but really nothing that wowed either of us.

The highlight of the trip, however, was something free, believe it or not... the freakin' chocolate chip cookie!  I consider myself a cookie connoisseur and I must say this one was awesome.  Basically, I will go back to Croque simply for that cookie... ahhh... tasty chocolaty goodness."}
{"text":"Though they are known for their sandwiches, I've only had their salads. They are hand made and very good. Small location tucked in a strip mall."}
{"text":"We are on vacation, so pick restaurants based on yelp reviews. Soup of the day was mushroom Brie. It was very good. Oriental salad also very good. Bulgogi bowl very good. Ordered more soup to go! The cashier was very friendly and offered repeat customer card. Since we don't live here he offered grub hub discount which we will use b4 we leave."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and go a sandwich and side salad.  Both were great, super fresh ingredients in the salad.  I had the #2 with the garlic sauce.  O asked if it was really over powering and the reply I was given was it wont give a garlic after taste, which was spot on.  Also, the cashier asked if I was local and gave me a punch card, buy 10 entrees get one free!  Judging by the amount of cards they kept by the register, I'd say the locals frequent this place often.  Looking forward to a return visit"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, my girlfriend and I both ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl ( 1 white rice and the other brown ) and it was different than your average bowl. It wasn't drenched in super sweet teriyaki sauce and it was made with yummy sticky rice along with fresh veggies & chicken. 

As for customer service, the gentlemen kindly greeted us and got our orders. A lady from the back came and gave us our food and was very personable.

I recommend this place for some good lunch eats!"}
{"text":"I want to give them a 4-star rating but the 3-stars would be more accurate. We ordered delivery from here over a week ago but I am just now getting around to reviewing it.

We put our order in online because that is what we saw on their website. It also said it would take 45 minutes and that was not the case. I called after 45 minutes and the person on the phone said the driver hadn't left yet. A minute later, he said the driver was leaving. 

If you pay with your credit card, you have to enter how much you want to tip - can't sign anything when the delivery person arrives to provide a tip. 

I had the bulgoki salad with the garlic salad dressing. The meat was a bit chewy but all of the veggies were so fresh. The dressing was really yummy - I wanted to get chunks of cucumbers and eat them alone in this dressing. Pretty sure they make this dressing in-house too. 

The garlic bread that came with my salad was just okay - nothing special. 

Coworkers said their meals were okay. I might give this place another try because it's close to home but it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Picked up an order today. Ordered the spicy pork and bulgogi sandwich and it was really yummy! The only thing I wish they would put on the sandwiches is more meat or veggies. Other than that the taste and flavor was really yummy! Would go back to try the other stuff they have to offer!"}
{"text":"I must say this was a very disappointing experience.  My coworkers and I place an order on weekly basis.   Today, we placed an order for 8 people and we were all looking forward to it.  They do have delicious food however, it is below par when it comes to customer service and the amount of food you get for the money.  Most of us ordered Bibimbap and the amount of bulgoki in each order was 2 pieces!  We have noticed the inconsistency in the amount of meat in previous orders but we never complained about it until today.  We paid $90+ for our order today and to see that with all our meats combined to equal 4 oz was ridiculous.  They sent out more meat but the little girl who brought them was extremely rude, rolled her eyes and even told me to \"lose the attitude\"!  Wow!  She looked at me and said, \"this IS the usual amount!\"  I told her that it was untrue because we order from them regularly and also if that were the case, why would we ALL complain?  Honestly, it was less than tasty today...food got cold while waiting for the girl with special customer service skills and on top of that, I got 3 slices of sauteed mushrooms and a mound of kimchee which I PAID EXTRA for! So I paid, $13.00 for brown rice and kimchee with 3 slices of beef and customer service from a little girl with a sunny disposition...(NOT)!  Honestly, the poor customer service , inconsistency in quality, and the high cost is not worth it.   I personally like to enjoy my food as I eat,  not curse at it!   I do NOT recommend it...you will NEVER know what you are getting EXCEPT for the guaranteed poor customer service!

(Response to Owner Comments):

The partially eaten food that was shown to your employee was the way it came to us so now you can clearly see why we were very upset.  Your story is an absolute lie and I will not reply in detail since you are very misconstrued anyway.  We did not ask for more than what we expected as compared to our previous orders so please do not portray us as if we were unreasonable and impossible patrons to satisfy.    I find it very interesting how you can call all 8 of your former customers who regularly placed order with you for months and who have all stated that your food was delicious, liars.  Also, your comment on myself being older than your cashier...yes, that is true...she has much to learn about customer service, however I trust that you will guide her to serve as well as you have us yesterday.  It was disappointing and what is even more shocking is your perception of what actually took place versus 8 individuals who too were involved.  We all saw our own servings and the very fact that we were all disappointed confirms the very fact that something was obviously not consistent.  I will only speak for myself when I say  that your business sense is exactly the opposite of what loyal customers would expect from a good  vendor.  Good luck with your business as you continue to strive to improve on your service.  Lastly, this is a review on your service and our personal experience with your venue not about the place of my employment.  I see your desperate need to divert the focus from your poor customer service to 8 disappointed patrons  however, it is unnecessary and entirely unrelated.  Thank you."}
{"text":"We ordered the Philly cheesesteak and chicken cheesesteak.  It was good.  The baguettes were awesome!  The order was for delivery which was quick and they got the order right which is impressive."}
{"text":"Friendly family owned deli. The ramen soup is amazing!!!! My son always gets the chicken teriyaki bowl. I have gotten a few sandwiches here that were very good too. David and his wife that own the place are very friendly and really bend over backwards to please their customers. I love coming here, and so do my kids!"}
{"text":"I gave Croque TWO shots and will not be ordering from them again... 
They are close to my office and have brought us delivery menus on numerous occasions so I thought I would give them a try. 

The first time I ordered for delivery my food arrived FAIRLY quickly but was delivered by a woman who WREAKED of cigarette smoke.. needless to say after she left the smell lingered in the office because the paper bag my food was in also wreaked of cigarettes.  I emailed the business and received a kind response stating that this would be taken care of and was not acceptable... So I gave them another chance.

The second time I ordered from them my lunch took an hour and 45 minutes to be delivered. I am completely aware that lunch time can be swamped, as I have been in the industry before, but almost 2 hours for a salad and a side of french fries is RIDICULOUS.  And to top it off, the same woman delivered... and she still wreaked! 

It's too bad that their service is off because their food is great and they're so close to my office!"}
{"text":"You know how food always somehow happens to be THAT much better when someone brings it to you?! Well, the Chicken Philly I just inhaled was pretty darn good! I was absolutely famished, and my stomach was on the verge of digesting itself, but luckily Yelp24 and Croque Famous Sandwiches came to my rescue! 

I ordered my sammy and it arrived about an hour later... wish the delivery times were a bit shorter (hence my 4-stars). The sandwich, first off, was HUGE (see picture where I compare it to my arm) and quite tasty and still relatively warm, considering it embarked on a journey before it got to me. I would definitely recommend it -- however I just wish it had bigger pieces of chicken (sliced chicken); I had to eat most of the chicken with a fork as it fell out of my sandwich with each bite. Luckily I had ordered pickle spears on the side and they were so kind as to give me a fork, so problem solved! 

The sandwich definitely satiated my hunger, and made me and my tastebuds happy. Would definitely eat Croque Famous Sandwiches again. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"I found this place via YELP. I ordered one of the Korean sandwiches and it was really really good! The older gentleman who I believe who is the owner suggested it to me. They have a big assortment of different kinds of sandwiches and a big menu with different entree and wraps! Can't wait to go back here to try something else!"}
{"text":"Honestly, they can get some better quality ingredients if they're going to charge so much for a sandwich.  However, they make a good sandwich - not all sloppy, not oversized, good combination of ingredients.  I will probably go back and pay the hefty price next time I'm in the vicinity.  :)"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery it was the first time trying this place. It is one of the few places that will deliver to my work so I thought I would give it a try.

Delivery time said it would be about 45-60 minutes, it took 40.. It is Friday so understandable. But still... 40 minutes for one sandwich? Have ordered delivery from other sandwich shops on the weekend and usually takes 25 min max. But again, it is Friday and they did quote 45-60 minutes so I will not hold that against them.

I ordered the Philly Cheese Sandwich. I asked for no onions in the special instructions window, but there were tons of onions on it :(

The sandwich was okay.. not spectacular.. I probably wouldn't order it again. I did really like the homemade dill sauce that  came on it... it was the best part. The meat was a little chewy and just didn't have much flavor to it. Also, the sandwich itself was more on the colder side than the warmer side when I received it.

I got a large chocolate chip cookie as well.. it is really hard. I was expecting it to be on the softer side.. Tastes more like it was either made another day or earlier this morning.

Anyways, I will probably order from here again and try another option that people recommend. Hopefully it is a little better next time."}
{"text":"In the first two days of discovering Croque... I had eaten there twice. While I've been looking for new places to eat in the area, this one quickly sucked me in. On the second day, I also got two co-workers to eat there, and I think this is quickly becoming a Croque office.

I've now had a number of their sandwiches, including their bugolki sandwich (on multi-grain with the garlic spread) and the chicken pesto club (on white with their remoulade) and both are absolutely delicious. Very different sandwiches, but each is great in its own right. Unwrapping these sandwiches alone is enough to get you salivating. The scent is irresistible! Add fresh, quality ingredients hand assembled while you wait, and you've got a winner. I was even eating some of the remoulade straight out of the side container they gave me, that's how good this stuff is!

I also tried out their teriyaki chicken lunch bowl... YUM!

Matter of fact, I'm getting hungry again just writing this..."}
{"text":"Quite the find! Was looking for somewhere different to order for an 8 person training class. Lilian was super friendly over the prone. I told her what I needed & when. She suggested a platter of some of their popular sandwiches. I also got a choice of a side & a dozen fresh baked cookies. The delivery was right on time & everyone loved the sandwiches. Nice, flavorable hot sandwiches on fresh baked bread. Glad I came across this place- will definitely order again- great value & delicious food!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Croque. I have heard such great things. The menu looks amazing. Ordered lunch to be delivered at pm. I had the 12 inch BLT with the garlic sauce and a side of potato salad. The bread was too dry, it hurt my mouth when I took bites, the bacon was over cooked making the whole sandwich difficult to eat. The potato salad was also very dry and kinda boring :( My friend ordered the tuna wrap and also said it was not too exciing

. I will give Croque one more chance and maybe dine in next time instead of take out."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first visit.  Ordered the club sandwich and DELICIOUS !  Bread was soft and a little chewy, right balance of meat and veggies.  Very fresh and the condiments were perfect.   Not your typical sandwich shop.   Will repeat....!"}
{"text":"I ordered out through Yelp and had it delivered. The food was delivered on time and at a good temperature. I ordered a salad and chicken teriyaki with rice and veggies. Both were okay, seemed to be made fresh! I wouldn't say it was outstanding. I probably wouldn't order from here again, but then again I didn't get a sandwich so maybe I just ordered the wrong meal"}
{"text":"Croque is a very different as well as delightful kind of place.  Legitimately there is nothing else out there like Croque's.  You think it should be some kind of Louisiana style restaurant full of fried Catfish and gumbo like dishes or maybe a French restaurant full of less interesting French food but instead its a place that serves sandwiches, soups and various Asian themed bowls.  They have 18 different kinds of sandwiches that are American, French, Korean and German motif, so there is a lot of variety and each sandwich is of the highest quality.  I've only had the Bulgoki myself(people I've eaten with their have had the Madame and the Tuna but say there were equally amazing) but I've had it in the less traditional \"sandwich\" form as well as the bowl and the flavor is spectacular, rivaling Bulgoki I've had at excellent Korean restaurants all over the valley.  I'm looking forward to trying the other sandwiches as well as various soups of the day (ex Mushroom Brie looked amazing), overall this is the best new sandwich place around, forget about boring Subway for lunch and try a sandwich worth eating at Croque's"}
{"text":"Was cruising on my trusty longboard to the neighboring Fitness Cafe looking for some healthy skating fuel when I noticed it was out of business. Rolled on past looking for an alternative, confident in the universe's ability of pleasantly surprising me. It took all of 6 seconds to deliver another knock-out-of-park culinary happenstance!

I immediately fancied the no-frills-about-it deli style setup - these friendly Koreans are here for one reason and one reason only: food. Multi-cultural delights to be specific. There is something for everyone here. I was searching only for a simple lunch...but I got a complimentary side order of positive attitude from the employees, thus enhancing my already groovin' mojo!

I went with the Bulgoki Bowl - grilled Korean BBQ steak, stir fried broccoli, carrot and onion (check for the Yelp pic I posted) - served steamin' fresh with a crisp AZ green tea. I could not possibly be more satisfied. The perfect portion - no comatose afterburn. The flavor? Impeccably perfect, made just like the way that Korean grandmother of yours you never had would've mastered up! I'm looking for a reason to complain.........nope, can't find one!

I sit here in this hole-in-the-wall deli writing this review in hopes that another hungry internet surfer catches my good-willed words and takes a chance on this hidden gem so that they too may carpe diem.

Now back to cool-cruisin' this beautiful May day. Happy grubbin' people! B-) ~m/"}
{"text":"These guys aim to please and their menu will have you anxious to see the baguette dressed in various global settings.  I personally recommend those sandwiches that incorporate the Korean heritage owners."}
{"text":"The turkey was one of the best sandwiches I've had on a long time!

I ordered the hot turkey, mozzarella and cranberry sandwich online and picked it up. The 6-inch was plenty for a decent lunch. The order was ready prompty, the online checkout system was simple, and I was able to pay in cash when I got to the cafe instead of paying with a credit card online when I didn't know if my sandwich would be ready or not.

Considering Croque is in the same shopping center as some (not-so-great but cheap) chain restaurants, I really hope they can compete. 

The garlic sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Oh THANK YOU Croque!!  My favorite dish ever is the Goji Bowl with Spicy Pork and Kimchi Fried Rice from Seoul Taco in STL.  I have been CRAVING that dish lately!  I saw your menu in our office breakroom and reminded me how I used to order from you regulary in the 90's.  I looked at your menu and saw the Bibimbap...  I thought I would be getting myself excited for something that taste at least similar to my Kimchi Fried Rice Goji bowl.   I ordered the Bibimbap with spicy pork instead of the bulgoki.  Wow!!  I cannot tell you how happy I was with that dish. The flavors are amazing.  Tip:  Do not miss out and NOT put the entire ramekin of the 'homemade hot sauce' over.  It makes the dish.  My only request would be a bit more meat.  I'm not sure there was even 2 oz of pork in the dish.  Still, flavors were fantastic!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  The first time I had the bulgoki on salad greens.  The salad is served with a little garlic toast round that is awesome.  Not sure how to rate the bulgoki since I have never had it before, but it tasted pretty good to me.  The second time I had a chicken salad wrap.  It was quite large and included lettuce and tomato. Prices are not bad.  The place is tiny and is kind of hard to find and is really a little dive, but I like dives - that's where you can often find some of the best food."}
{"text":"This little sandwich, salad and Korean rice bowl shop is worth checking out.  My friend had the chicken salad on a bed of greens with raspberry vinaigrette and pronounced it delicious.  My MIL and I split a Hawaiian (ham, pineapple, cheese, garlic sauce) on a soft whole grain roll and it was scrumptious.  Service was fairly quick (and not overly friendly), and ambiance is limited (to say the least), but the yummy food at reasonable prices make it worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Food was most disgusting I have ever had in my entire life. Ordered the 6\" club sandwich with multigrain bread, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, remoulade sauce, extra turkey and ham. So what did I get? Never mind that I got white bread instead of multigrain. The bread they gave me was nasty weeks old stale white bread... It was so bad that it literally fell apart when opening up my bag. When I took a bite of it, not sure why I did looking back on this now since it was so bad, I almost gagged on it! Furthermore, it left a weird burning sensation on my tongue which I tried to get rid of by having a soda. But nothing I did would get rid of that weird taste in my mouth. I spat out whatever was left of it in my mouth and losing my appetite for any lunch in the end."}
{"text":"How have I never written a review for this place? What the hell? My coworker goes there at least once a week to pick up her (our) orders. We get the spicy chicken bowl and we order so much that the woman who runs this place knows her (our) order lol. Depending on who makes the dish determines the level of spiciness, but it is yummy for your tummy goodness. Oh and don't forget about the chocolate chip cookie. There have been numerous occasions in which by the time we order our lunch, they are already out of them since she makes them fresh everyday. So not fair! Even the sandwiches are yummy, but the spicy chicken rice bowl is number one in my book!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as I was on my way home frm the jewelry store down the street & am very drawn to little hole in the wall places!! Did not disappoint! 

I ordered the Croque Special and it was fabulous. Love the sauces they make for them and the unique combinations they offer. We dined in and the sandwiches are served on a marble cutting board. Nice presentation....

Can't wait to come back and try the ramen & bulgogi bowls. Where else can you find better bulgogi & bibimap but in a sandwich shop in Scottsdale?! Haha! They looked good!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Terriyaki bowl I've ever had! Filled with fresh veggies, and the most delicious clean yummy chicken and fluffy white rice. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Getting bumped up to 4 stars. Great customer service, and due to Amy D's review,  just tried the #5 Hot turkey breast sandwich and think I'm in love. Turkey, cranberry, mozzarella, garlic sauce, fresh lettuce and tomato..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I crave their sandwiches.  They have this garlic sauce that's simply wonderful.  Bring gum!

Try the turkey with cranberry (with garlic sauce of course).  It sounded strange to me at first but now I am in love.  

They have punch card so your 10th? sandwich is free.  Locally owned which is cool.  Not open for dinner or on Sundays to my knowledge."}
{"text":"I had the Bulgoki salad. The Korean bbq steak was perfect and the homemade garlic dressing was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"isI got a think around a few years later that tshe is a great day for me and my know where you guys were at the house I was just thinking of going and I thought maybe we can get some dinner and I have a few minutes before the church so family and friends I"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little discovery. Incredible array of sandwiches and dishes, not the same old sandwhich shop... and the owner is a wonderful guy worth supporting. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent hot sandwich! Great salad. Lots of vegetarian options. Also enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie. Great for grabbing a quick lunch. We will definitely come back to try their other options."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll be back! The staff was super friendly and my sandwich was delish! I ordered the chicken pesto on white baguette. The bread was perfect and the sandwich was flavorful. I'm sorry excited to try some other things on their menus. It's not just sandwiches, they have rice bowls which look yummy too. It's a nice little family owned place that could be overlooked but I'm glad I found it!"}
{"text":"It was lunch and I was starving! I wanted some type of sandwich so I checked Yelp and I find this place - based on a yelper friend, I decided on the six inch Chicken Philly. It took longer than expected to get my order, around thirty minutes. However, the sandwich was surprisingly good as hell. They Toast the bread- big plus, but the chicken with all the ingredients was not what I was expecting from a typical Chicken Philly. It had some type of garlic pesto sauce with red peppers and tomato. It was sooo good that I ate it all! 

I normally do not eat all of my lunch but I devoured this one. I will come back to try the other items on their menu. They have tons of options!!"}
{"text":"In all fairness I had this delivered to FLW & Greenway Hayden Loop so its likely my fault that the fries were cold (not even a little warm) but having the order arrive in a bag that isn't even closed at the top implies that the deliverer didn't care if I enjoyed my fries at all.  The hot sandwich, however, was tightly wrapped and still hot and super tasty not to mention filling.  I only ate half of it and had the rest the next day for lunch cold and it was still really good.  I had the hot veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in the Valley Hands Down. 

I was a bit scared when the owners changes but they kept the original recipes and the quality is still there. The Garlic and Dill sauce is what makes the sandwiches amazing a must have when you go in. the french fries are always made fresh and they are perfectly crisp and hot. I always go for the number 14 but I have had many other subs there and they are all great.

It is worth the drive to have a great sandwiches."}
{"text":"My friend said her office ordered from this place all the time and had decent sandwiches.  It was icky and hot in Phoenix (Scottsdale) and so I didn't really have a taste for anything.  Sure, a hot sandwich sounded just fine.  But what was I thinking ordering soup?

I had the Croque Monsieur (which strangely had fresh sliced mushrooms in it but I liked it). The garlic sauce was definitely subtle and desirable on the crispy baguette. 

It was probably a good thing that on this hot as hell day, my split pea and ham soup wasn't more warmed up. Still, I want hot soup! It was fine though and the ham was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the Valley! I live in Gilbert and whenever I make it up to Scottsdale I have to stop by for lunch. My usual is a #5 with garlic sauce and a side of their delicious fries. Everything is top notch and I love that it is locally owned and operated. There are so many sandwich places in Scottsdale including a chain right in their complex, but Croques is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant.  Now, I have never actually been to it, but it is my lunch delivery standby.  The owners are incredibly nice and accommodating and take pride in their food.  Delivery is super fast, and everything arrives fresh.  My favorite is the veggie bowl - delicious!  And, because of their variety, Croque is great for ordering for lunch meetings."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this place several times in the last month.  The food has been excellent every time.  Sandwiches and soup!  Today I had the mushroom brie and it was fabulous!  I love their baguette bread.  Always so fresh.  The delivery associate is always so friendly. I will be sharing their menus around the office."}
{"text":"I ordered catering from Croque a few weeks ago for a company lunch.  This was our first time ordering here.  The sweet lady who took my order was so helpful, and made it easy to figure out how much I needed to order.  We tried the wraps, sandwiches, pasta salad, fruit salad, and homemade cookies.  Everyone was happy and enjoyed everything they tried.  Pasta salad and cookies were homemade, fruit was fresh, sandwiches and wraps were great and nice to have a variety!  We'll definitely be ordering here again!"}
{"text":"I just finished a teriyaki chicken bowl from here and it was delious! Make sure to get it spicy which = deliciousness. My friend got a chicken pesto sandwich and it looked amazing. I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Why don't I ever like the place that other people say is amazing? Maybe I just order the wrong thing, I dunno. I wasn't terribly hungry so I got the grilled chicken salad. There was tons of chicken on it although it kind of had this fake look to it. The whole salad just wasn't very appetizing. But if you want to get great service, then I recommend this place. The women were incredibly friendly and because we had a party of 5, they brought out a free cookie cut into 8 slices, with a toothpick in each slice! It was so nice! But based on the 1 thing I got there, I was not impressed. Other people in my office love this place, so maybe I need to go back when I am more hungry and order a sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches.....great price...... friendly family owned business.m any style of sandwiches to choose from. They also have homemade soups."}
{"text":"Oh my word .. these guys have, by far, the best sandwiches I have ever put into my mouth! Nothing beats a toasted turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and garlic sauce and a side of fries or pasta.

The atmosphere inside is only so-so. You feel like a foreigner here, your food is grouped by country flags, everyone on the other side of the counter (there seem to be at least five or six people) is Asian with non-native English skills, the walls are plain white, and the self-serve beverages are where the patrons' toilet should be.

But take me here on a comfortable day and let me sit outside at the umbrella-covered table with my cutting-board-as-a-plate as it holds my footlong toasted sandwich with its specialty sauces, and my side, and I am seriously in chillout mode for lunch.  I love eating here!!"}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Bowl is amazing!!! Fast delivery & nice people running the joint."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why I can't give it five stars, but I guess I just wasn't \"wowed\".

Found through Yelp, and ordered the 6 inch \"Madame\" through the Eat 24 Affiliate yelp site. I ordered no tomatoes and with onions if possible (it was), a small drink (which was pretty big, at least 16 oz's or more) and a small cookie (which was also a decent size) and paid about 10.50 including a 15% tip. 

Accidentally ordered pick up for the wrong time, called and they were able to correct it. This place is located in a shopping center next to a salon and across from school of rock I think it was. Sign is hard to see, so keep your eyes peeled. Sandwich was ready to go, gentleman behind the counter was older and a little slow but otherwise O.K. He asked me if I had a punch card, which I didn't, and gave me one. 

Sandwich and the rest of the food was very good. 

I will be eating here again, even though a little out of my way."}
{"text":"I love when I have to retract a review I wrote.  Especially when it goes from 1 star to 5 stars.  I've ordered a few more times in the last year and it's been right on every time.  The spicy chicken bowl is wonderful... the salads are great.  I haven't made the jump to reordering a sandwich after my last bad experience but I'll get there.

Delivery is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful!  Had homemade spicy chicken soup,  very fresh and just the right spice!"}
{"text":"Always an amazing place to get sandwiches. It is a go too for our family and regularly get take out from here. The service is always great and speedy!"}
{"text":"Delivery service is great, especially when you drive an 18 wheeler. You can't just drive into your fav restaurant and pick up a meal."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches, especially with their garlic sauce. The Croque Special is my favorite.! It's a small family-owned  place that you can feel food about supporting. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"I made an order for a pesto chicken sandwich on a baguette and some french fries, the order was supposed to arrive at 1pm they were here by 12:40 which was a pleasant surprise.  The food was amazing and I will be ordering from them again several times."}
{"text":"We had a coupon at work - buy one 6\", get one free.  Believe it or not, 6\" is plenty for this lil girl! ;}
I got the #5 sandwich, which was turkey with cheese and cranberry.  There are two different breads to choose from and two different dressings.  I had the whole wheat bread and the garlic dressing.  They have the sandwich menu split into regions of the world, which I thought was cute, though then the number selection of the sandwiches was off.  It affected my OCD, but not too much!
This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in this area!  I'm in the Scottsdale Airpark and surrounded by restaurants.  Most are just trendy places that people go to, just to say they've been there.  And they suck, for the most part!
So, the sandwich was ooey-gooey and delish!  I had sauce running down my arm and cheese sliding out the sides.  That's how we do it on the East Coast, yo!  Oh, and a cranberry popped out onto my \"shelf\" (the chest, dudes!) but didn't stain, luckily.  5-second rule, right?
Anyway, with the coupon, my co-worker and I paid $3 for 6\"!!!"}
{"text":"Good little sandwich salad shop. Have been here a couple times and always had consistent good food. The service sometimes is a little slow but they get a good crowd and I've only been there when they are busy. If you're in a group best to order all together."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if the delivery didn't take so long. But, the food was great. I ordered the veggie bowl, spicy with brown rice. It had a lot of good flavor and despite the long delivery time, my food was still hot and fresh. The price is ok, can't really complain. And it's awesome that they don't have a minimum charge for deliveries"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here on several different occasions and had the pleasure of eating at the actual restaurant once.  I usually order the #1 Madame:  ham, salami, egg, tomato, mozzarella & lettuce with extra garlic sauce on the side.  I always order the small which is 6\" and $5.99.  The sandwich is actually quite large and makes me really full.  It is soooo good and tasty. I think the garlic sauce is what makes it a home run for me.  

I've also ordered the Bulgoki Bowl $7.99.  It's not like complete authentic bulgoki meat like you would get in a ma/pa restaurant, but it does the job considering there aren't any Korean restaurants in the area.  

Today I ordered the Albacore Tuna Salad Wrap $6.79.  And once again, I was extremely satisfied with the wrap.  The tuna was juicy and not dry and it was mixed with the garlic sauce which was fantastic.  

Delivery has always been quick and the driver friendly. I definitely will continue to order from them during my lunches."}
{"text":"Small family owned restaurant in a strip mall tucked away.

Mainly decided to come here because we were looking for a place and in the area with good Yelp reviews.

Not to be racist, all I have to say is beware of white people giving ratings for Asian Food, it is just a different standard.

I would recommend the sandwiches which come on a fresh baguette that doesn't break your teeth when you bite into it. 

We ordered the #18 sandwich - Korean Bulgoki Meat Sandwich and #20 - Spicy Pork Sandwich. I liked the Bulgoki Sandwich which had great flavor but could of used a little bit more meat. Would be nice if you could order double meat like Lee's Sandwiches. The Spicy Pork Sandwich was a bit tangy for me but I am not into spicy dishes.

We also tried the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl and the meat did not resemble chicken, looked more like a processed meat. Don't know if i would recommend the Teriyaki Chicken.

We also ordered some french fries to go along with the sandwiches which was pretty good.

Through some of the reviews people were raving about the Spicy Asian Fusion Ramen so we tried it and when it was placed on the table I started laughing because it looked like the Top Ramen Noodles from the grocery store that you can buy 10 for a $1.  So when we ordered the Spicy Asian Fusion Ramen we asked to tone down the spice,  appearantly they did not add the spice pack that comes with the Noodle package.

If you go, order the sandwiches, the bread is very good , I enjoyed the Bulgoki Sandwich and would recommend.  

Wanted to support small business and especially a family owned restaurant, but you can not serve that type of Ramen Noodle."}
