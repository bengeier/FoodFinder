{"text":"Food is good, nice date night restaurant.  Good wine selection. The patio is nice overlooking the water. I'd make reservations on a weekend they get pretty busy."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment once before and I must say, it was quite enjoyable. So coming in for the second time I had high hopes. Well to say the least it was an appalling dining experience. Right when I was about to order my caesar salad I felt a somewhat stringy substance on my tongue. It turned out to be a large black hair. I immediately left the establishment and will never go back. Fuck this place and fuck all the positive reviews"}
{"text":"good food and great service.  there is a lot of noise in the restaurant and it's not a place for 'quieter' dining experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great service, food is ok.  We had risotto and fettuccine Alfredo. Both were very oily and one of us got ill because of the amount of oil.  Neither one of us could eat all of the dish.  The place seems nice but was hoping for better food especially since both were pricey.  We may venture back to give another try just not have pasta."}
{"text":"I ordered their ravioli using Uber Eats - it was absolutely fantastic. The pomodoro sauce was really good and the seasoning was perfect. Arrived hot and fresh - delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Looked good and had good reviews by others but tried it. Don't waste your money. We started with Garlic Knots because they were recommended. Very doughy and tasteless. The manager took them off the table and brought out their standard \"peasant bread\" another loser. Nothing special at all. At an Italian restaurant you expect to have excellent crusty Italian bread with that special flavor. Their table bread is not worth the calories. My wife ordered Chicken Parm and I tried a pizza. Again both dishes very disappointing. Chicken Parm was dry. Not at all what you would expect from the price and ambiance of the place. She couldn't eat much of it. The spaghetti side over-cooked, heavy and doughy tasting. I don't really understand why people rave about the spaghetti at this place. The Pizza was awful. They are not using hard wheat (Semolina) which gives Pizza dough that unique taste. It appears they are using regular flour or very inferior ingredients. We won't be going back. I would strongly advise not to waste your money on this place. I'm frankly surprised where their reputation comes from. Looks can deceive I guess."}
{"text":"Ordered the prosciutto and fig pizza, not impressed. We were disappointment that crust did not have the crisp texture or flavor we were hoping for.  Tasted like it was lacking salt. Might try other items on the menu, but will stay away from the pizza."}
{"text":"The staff are very welcoming. The atmosphere is relaxing and feels roomy. Great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Enjoy this restaurant so it has become our go to for a nice dinner.  Happy hour is til  7:00 which is unusual.  The food is very good not big portions which is fine with me but I know some people feel they are small for the price.    Servers....especially Alexis is very good.  Most servers are friendly , but Alexis goes out of her way to be attentive to her customers."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant twice sine they opened a few weeks ago.  Very good both times.  Cesar salad dressing is one the best we've had and the crutons topped it off just right.  The flat bread pizzas we also very good.  Today I had the turkey and brie panning and it did not disappoint as my wife had the chicken cesar, again very good.  Service: Great Atmosphere: Great  We were very disappointed when Gramaldi's moved out of this location, but not anymore.  This place is far better with more variety."}
{"text":"We came back after a year ago enjoying our experience here. We were not disappointed. We got there early and got to sit outside. Others had reserved outside so I'd suggest that.  The music and water movement make you forget you're by a highway. Ambience is great! Pillars, stone fireplace, patio lights.  I had red snapper and subbed mashed potatoes for pasta. Very delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food, service and ambiance were exceptional!   Would definitely go back.   Not overly expensive either!"}
{"text":"One of my wife's favorites. Great food and friendly staff. The wood fired pizza is wonderful, and don't pass up the shrimp scampi."}
{"text":"Neighborhood regular stop for us. Friendly ambiance coupled with great food. A must for Pizza, and the short rib! Plenty of great appetizers!"}
{"text":"They burnt me and my sisters pizza and once our waitress saw that we were dissatisfied, she took it off our tab and immediately apologized. Wasn't her fault but she was an AMAZING waitress. Would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This a great spot in Chandler for happy hour, apps, dinner...it never disappoints! Love the bruschetta options with a glass (or two) of wine while sitting on the patio at night!  You can't go wrong at this place..."}
{"text":"Excellent! Especially given we went twice in their opening week and the service and food quality were both great. Considering it was their first weekend and packed, we were greeted and had bar drinks delivered to our table in first few minutes and throughout meal, waters were always being topped off without having to flag anyone down. We were sad to see Grimaldis leave but Stone and Vine's remodel improved the atmosphere (especially with a larger, modern bar area), the music is great and the menu offer a nice variety.   We've tried the meatballs, wood-fire pizza (thin-crust) and two pastas so far - I was happy with all and the garlic knots appetizer is highly recommended! They came out piping hot and fresh, right from the oven to our table, served with a side of marinara. We'll definitely be ordering those again whenever we go.    We sat at the bar for our second visit and the bartender was fun and attentive and had a good rapport with everyone sitting there. We love Italian beer so were thrilled to find Peroni on tap.  Very glad to have a modern, hip place with quality food to drink and dine at in South Chandler. We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"The Sun Lakes, Ocotillo, South Chandler areas have a new player in the Italian restaurant arena. They remade the interior of the old Patsy Grimaldi's to a brighter, more contemporary feel and opened the place up without losing the comfortable feel. The food was OUTSTANDING! Prices within reason. Service excellent. We were going to Grimaldi's for 10 years, and loved them, but with Stone's larger menu, I think we've become fans and will be coming back often."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour last night with a big group from work. The waitress was completely overwhelmed with her tables and she said we would have to wait awhile. We sat there as we watched several other employees just walking around not doing much. If you advertise that you have happy hour you should be staffed for it. A similar experience happened last time we went over 6 months ago with the same group, the same waitress was overwhelmed and she was all stressed out. It's unfortunate because there was a big group of us and they lost a lot of business. On another note, the food is really good. We had ordered quite frequently through door dash BUT the last time I ordered the meatball panini and asked for sauce on the side. I got a note from door dash that they charged a $1 for extra sauce! Ridiculous! The panini is usually very dry and I just wanted a little sauce, not a bowl size. I had ordered this many times before with no extra charge. It's an Italian restaurant sauce is not expensive. So, to be honest that turned me off from doing takeout and now I order elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and phenomenal service.  Can't wait to come back.  I just wish they would change the music.  They have country music and doesn't fit the ambience. ."}
{"text":"My husband and I had wanted to try this new Chandler restaurant that moved into a spot formerly occupied by Grimaldi's. We went in and were greeted promptly by a pleasant young man who asked where we would like to sit. We chose the outside patio since the weather was nice. Our waitress came over quickly and greeted us. She showed us the happy hour menu and let us know about the reduced prices on food and drinks. I was pleased that happy hour prices were  good outside, not just in the bar area - nice. Our waitress told us about the wines by the glass and which ones she particularly liked. We ordered wine and four different bruschettas to start. The bruschetta was very good; each section is cut into three pieces - a fun item to share with wine. We also ordered a 12-inch Godfather pizza. The pizza was tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We will go back soon and try some of the entrees. We really liked sitting on the patio. There was background music, but nothing intrusive."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I have never written a review before tonight, but felt you all should know the bad food that I received here.  I always get the Lasagna my first visit to an Italian restaurant, that sets them all on an even playing field and this place failed. I got a mouthful of stems from herbs OR something and then I bit into a chunk of something hard that's not supposed to be in a lasagna. The server offered me a new plate, but I did not want anything more after that. She apologized and did remove it from our bill. My mother in laws pasta was severely under cooked, but the shrimp was moist and tender.  Needless to say, I will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time at this bar and LOVED it! The atmosphere is so inviting and the staff were wonderful! Our waitress Alexa was on point with our orders and very attentive. The manager, John or Johnny I believe, greeted us with a huge smile when we came in and stopped by to see how we were enjoying our drinks and food. He made us feel VERY welcome! Luckily we made it in time for happy hour and even with a packed house, everything we ordered came out in a timely manner.   We will definitely be coming back and am spreading the word about our excellent service and dining experience"}
{"text":"Really bad new manager, Amanda Fearon, We have been going here several times a week for 2 years, Meatball appetizer came out \"Sophia's Way\" instead of plain, like we ordered it. Our vegetable appetizer came out at same time, by the time the correct meatball order came out, the vegetables were cold. We asked that the meat balls be comp'd due to the mistake and delay. Amanda refused and said she didn't care how often we dined there. She claims they corrected the mistake in 1 minute. Not true. All we wanted was to eat both appetizers while they hot, together.  The previous manager was good, however we eat out on a regular basis and we won't be back or spending a sizeable sum here again. Hopefully the owner, Joe Popo, will address this situation with her. My husband and I are well known at this establishment and I am sure the servers will miss their generous tips."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. Hostess was surly on the way in. Plate was dirty and I had to send it back. Calamari was about as rubbery as I've ever seen. Some of the bruschetta was pretty good but the salmon sat long enough to get soggy. Brussels sprouts were the highlight. Garlic knots were burnt and nasty with a truly weak and awful marinara. Won't do this one again."}
{"text":"Excellent food.The wait was a little long ,but was worth the wait.nice patio seating."}
{"text":"Amanda facilitates an amazing environment. The quality of food and service is amazing.  Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! What can I say other than OFF THE CHART. Had a surprise party of 50 people here for my wife and all i could say along with the guests was WOW!!!! I have to say thank you. Amanda and the staff went well out of their way to accommodate us. It was not unnoticed.  Will highly recommend them. I look forward to more parties here I the future.  Cannot say enough."}
{"text":"We just happened to stop at this place while our daughter was visiting. We were very happy with the happy hour prices on drinks and food!  Our waitress was very friendly. We ordered one pizza per person thinking they were like a flatbread.  She told us they were big and no one eats a whole one!  So glad she warned us.. we ordered two  and took half of one home!"}
{"text":"Our server Daniel was one of the best we've had in a long time! Very knowledgable on wines and menu items. Great atmosphere, delicious food. We will be back"}
{"text":"We went for the first time and were very disappointed. The food was very average and somewhat over priced. Salads are extra on a $16 entree And the least expense salad is $6. The waiter we had was poorly trained. We were offered \"happy hour\" pricing on drinks and were charged full price when we received the bill !   Had we known we would have ordered what WAS on happy hour. Again poor training on the waiter he made no adjustments to the bill. The is somewhat new but I would recommend training to the wait staff and some price adjustments."}
{"text":"Have been here twice with friends. First time I had eggplant with marinara sauce on the  linguine. The marinara was really good, with hints of garlic.I aslo liked the eggplant because it was cut very thin and not friend. The meal was good. My friend ordered the panini-I think with fig and whatever. Not a big eater, she finished the whole thing and loved it.  Second time-different friend. She had caesar salad and said it was terrific. I had the Bolgenese dish and was not fond of it at all. The sauce had NO flavor, and the meat was stringy beef  that was chewy and dry. Not good.  Well, you may wonder why I'm going again tonight (with yet another friend). IO have a gift certificate and hope I can find something on the menu that really \"sings\" to me. If dinner is not good this time, I won't be back."}
{"text":"A great new find for date night!  Everything we had was a hit.  Especially the Sea Bass.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here was outstanding as well as our service we went here on Monday night the place was pretty slow the deck where is beautiful and so was the menu a lot of good things to pick fromwe had the bruschetta it was fantastic you get to pick what kind you would like I highly recommend it I can't wait to go back here and sit on the patio when it's cooler"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wait service.  I will be going back.    Would have gotten five stars, however, I made a reservation and during the call was asked whether I wanted a high top or low top table.  I specifically asked for a low top table.  We arrived 5 mins early and had to wait 20 minutes for our table with people that did not have reservations appear to be seated before us.  Our table was a high top and in location where all patrons and wait staff had to pass through.  I asked about a low top table which was requested during the reservation and was told I would have to wait longer for a low top.  A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Second time here! Portions are enough for two..love it. Wait staff was outstanding..love Nicole.  Patio in March awesome"}
{"text":"The lasagna was good, however the Chicken Club Panini was not good at all.  Unfortunately, the avocado and sauce they use do not pair well.  Also, their fries were odd circle shapes that resulted in a soggy and thick cut fry.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a romantic but not over the top expensive meal. My husband and I shared a delicious Caprese salad and glass of wine. Great neighborhood spot, especially to sit out by the pond."}
{"text":"I ate here before and had the Mediterranean salad and loved it so we met friends there for dinner. The Mediterranean salad is not on the menu now but they have the Greek salad instead. They forgot the quinoa in the salad so when I asked about it, they brought me about a half a cup of it. The calamari was salty.  I was really disappointed but my friends enjoyed their dinners. The atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food, cool ambiance that feels welcoming and relaxing and good service. The only downside is road noise if you are outside but still a great choice"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for a great meal on mother's day. Had 4 different waiters in the 1st 10 minutes. Not a fan if the food. Had to ask for bread and when the small amount was offered it was so undercooked and not edible. Our waiter was very defensive in a weird way. I will not return."}
{"text":"Would have rated 3.5 but rounded up to 4.  We were not as impressed as the first reviewers who rated 5 but will keep S&V in our restaurant rotation because it's close and good enough, although somewhat pricey.  We really liked the garlic knot appetizer and the cinnamon knot dessert.  I had the lasagna and my wife had the penne vodka for entrees, which were both good with generous portions. We also ordered a pizza to try and it, too, was quite good...although not as good (in our opinion) as Tony Sacco's.    As for Italian eateries in the southeast valley, we would rank in order of preference: Babbo's, Tony Sacco's, Casanova Brothers and then Stone & Vine but you really can't go wrong with any one of them if you're craving Italian."}
{"text":"The chicken parmigiana panini lacked chicken. I think it sat under a warmer for a few days and became a dry dog treat. Portions are good. Prices are fair, but you need to have good food to justify paying anything. Great interior. Nice bar. Service was frantic. Caesar was drenched. In the end, food was horrible. Sorry, I had high hopes. One and done for me."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. I have tried the pasta, and the chicken pesto pizza. Both amazing."}
{"text":"Ambience: Walking into this restaurant, it feels very upscale and modern. It's very well put together and I love the tile wood floors. Well done.  Customer Service: Our waiter was very attentive and informative. Overall the service was good.   Food: The appetizers we ordered were excellent. We ordered dish after dish and weren't disappointed.   Drinks: They have a great happy hour and lots of selection. Also well done!  Restrooms: Very clean and it matches the ambience of the restaurant. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Loved the menu and ambiance of Stone an Vine. Service was less that awesome on a busy night, but had an enjoyable evening with tasty food! I would go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and WOW such an amazing ambiance sitting outside on the patio. Ordered a bottle of wine and dinner, came before the dinner rush and server was very attentive. Then half way through service began to go down... luckily food was good so that made up for it. I will come back to try it again but mostly for the great sunsets on the patio and amazing salads. I would rate 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! They have great appetizers on HH everyday, and there food comes out so quick even on their busiest nights. Have been there a few times and have been extremely impressed with their food and service!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation because of the ratings. We looked over your menu. Looked very appetising but got to entrées and all said Prices varies. Why? Not a good look..."}
{"text":"They were having issues when we went. While waiting for our outside table another guest was complaining to the host about the excessive ants on the patio. He then proceeded to seat us on the patio. It reeked of sewage or fish so we asked to move inside, didn't wait for the ants.  Our server was new so she admitted to know nothing of the menu.  Soup of the day was tortilla, pretty sure the restaurant was Italian. It was admittedly a rough start.   The food was ok. We had bruschetta, choice of four, they brought the wrong four. Rigatoni bolognese, tough and dry. Clams, delicious and a large portion. Calabrese panini, soggy.  Ravioli, very good. Spaghetti and meatball, average. The drinks and wine were good.  It looked like a ok wine bar but as a restaurant not so much."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! The sangria is great. Good speedy service and the pizza is so good. Reminds us of the pizza we had in Rome! Yum!"}
{"text":"Went to this place based on reviews.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere and an awesome patio area.  Food was mediocre.  Started with the zucchini friti...just ok...have had better. My wife and I were satisfied with our meals but did not feel the quality justified the price point.  The one reason I would still like to come back is to try the bruschetta platter...looks killer!    Not my go to place for Italian fare."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this restaurant and wished we found it sooner! The portion sizes are incredible and the atmosphere is great. They have a nice bar area and tables that are on a patio overlooking a small pond. Relaxing atmosphere but great food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this because I have Celiac.  Unfortunately we were BOTH disappointed.  My gf penne was way overcooked and the Bolognese was mostly meat and very little sauce.  It appeared as though the meat was ground beef.  The only spice I could detect was garlic and it was overpowering.  I ordered a house salad and the vinegar in the dressing was overpowering too.  It was so strong it made me cough.  I tried adding sugar to it to calm it down and it didn't help.  My husband ordered the Caesar dressing and it was very scant.  My husband wasn't offered any bread.  The service was good, but we won't try it again.  It is a nice place and in an easy location but fell short of our expectations."}
{"text":"Everyone enjoyed their food and the prices were very reasonable.  I am a big fan of veal so I was quite happy to see that Stone and Vine serves Veal Parmagiana, Marsala, and Piccata.  And they were charging only $18 for these dishes, which is quite a value compared to other italian restaurants in the area.  I ordered the Veal Piccata and it was a quality piece of veal and was prepared as it should be.  We also had the Rigatoni with the Bolognese and it was great.  Such a simple dish but not everyone gets it right..  Stone and Vine offers a varied menu including flatbreads and pizza, which are a few dollars less during happy hour.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Don't miss the meatballs, it's a must! The rest of the food (pizza, entrees, salads) are just ok. The atmosphere is great, service is just pretty good. They don't seem to have it together when they r busy, the host tried to seat us a dirty table, bathroom was less then clean but nothing that will keep us from returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service . Each ordered a pizza, but could've easily split one. Great crust!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really enjoy this place! It's a nice play to go if you're wanting to relax & not dress up, or if you are wanting something a lil' fancier, so it's good for both! They have a great happy hour menu for drinks & food. There bruschetta's are delicious & I love that they keep them changing! We've always tried something new when we went whether it's an appetizer, entree, or dessert & it never disappoints! It's always so yummy! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you are just caught off guard by great service and quality in something as simple as a lunch. I met my wife to grab a quick bite today at around 2:30pm so well after the lunch rush, when many places are closed and the staff, if still there, is not real happy to be working...Our waiter Danny could not have been better and just had a great attitude and was so willing to help. I had the Milan Salmon dish (sorry I didn't take a pic because the kitchen really did a nice presentation) and it was fantastic....simple vegetables over several grilled asparagus spears and then perfectly cooked salmon on top and with a glass of Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc as suggested by Danny...My wife had the Ceasar salad , which was great and the we did finish with the cinnamon knots....just a few but enough...Cappucino's were Lavazza and great...All in all, just a solid lunch, simple, tasty and a very pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this restaurant but I was disappointed with the atmosphere  This restaurant is very noisy and lacks a cozy intimate dinning experience. Definitely not a date night place. The food was \"just okay\" and pricey for the portion size. We had to ask for bread with our meal which should be a given with Italian food.  Once Happy Hour was over so was the crowd and for a Saturday night there was no one waiting to be seated. Half the restaurant was empty.  Not impressed at all. May give it one more try when the weather is cooler and I can sit on patio. But with so many great places to eat I doubt it"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times and have always enjoyed ourselves. Friendly service and laid back atmosphere.The Bruschetta is so delicious. We also tried the Meatball appetizer with the Arugula and cheese, comes with 3 good sized meatballs and they were very tasty. I wish there was just a little bit more sauce but still very good.  The Kids got a cheese pizza and my daughter ate the whole thing!   Nice little place close to home."}
{"text":"We've eaten here numerous times and have NOt been disappointed.  Our personal take is this is one of, if not THE best Italian restaurant on the east valley.  Always on point and will continue coming back thanks!"}
{"text":"After reading multiple yelp reviews on various Italian restaurants, I decided on Stone and Vine. I found it very convenient to make the reservation through Yelp. My reservations were made for 7 PM and my husband I arrived at 6:50 ish and saw that there were multiple people waiting. The Hostess told me to give them a few minutes and they would seat us. At 7:05 PM, my husband and I agreed that we would leave by 7:10 PM if we were not seated yet. We were kind of frustrated of having reservations and understand we were 10 minutes early but having to wait 20 minutes was a disappointment. At 7:10 PM, we were getting ready to walk out and the Hostess called us back. Interaction with waitress was minimum, she was polite but did not really engage in conversation. Food was amazing but Calamari was just okay. Portions for actual entrees were huge. We ordered two slices of cheesecake to take home to our daughters and I was shocked that they were $9 a piece. Very expensive all together and I would recommend going at Happy Hour, not for dinner. I also prefer Postino's in comparison and my husband I agreed we would rather go there and my husband does not drink wine or eat bruschetta."}
{"text":"Food looks ok, but taste nasty...the calamari was chewy and the shrimp was just thrown in with pasta that I could make and mine would actually have flavor...the place was loud not enjoyable at all...will not be coming back."}
{"text":"IWe came here for her birthday and they accommodated a large party of us around eight people very quickly. All the food tasted good and although it took a little bit long to come out it was worth the short wait. The servers were really friendly and the restaurant was very clean and comfortable setting. We quite enjoyed our food and will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Amazing food and the patio was so awesome. The only complain I have is the pop music that was playing. It did not fit the atmosphere at all. For such a classy, beautiful place, I would assume the music wouldn't be poppy Bruno mars and other annoying stuff for teeny boppers."}
{"text":"Very relaxed place to relax after shopping...love that the patio is over the water. Stopped in for a glass of wine and garlic knots..."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem for Sunday NFL watching. Bottomless Bloody Mary's, all the games you could ask for and GREAT service, Sarah and Kevin are the best. This will be my new go to football watching spot. And by the way, the pizza is out of this world delicious."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open for a few months! Now that it's open, we couldn't wait to try it.  We were very impressed with the food and the service. Most restaurants seem disorganized when they first open, but not this place.  We ordered the garlic knots appetizer and ordered the wood fired pizza as our meal. Both were outstanding! It's so nice to have this new restaurant in south Chandler!"}
{"text":"Excellent wine, food and service.  Don't think there is a better bruschetta board anywhere.  Ask for Jaylen (check the spelling) for a top notch experience."}
{"text":"They make a properly good pizza. My personal favorite is the funghi they really take all the ingredients to another level.  When the weather is nice the setup they have outside is perfect. Definitely a place for setting up larger gatherings too I was a big fan of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Nice menu options. Service was not amazing but acceptable. I ordered meatballs Sophia's way and 2 bruschetta ( tomato balsamic and brie with apple. Both very good. I do wish they had a GF bread for bruschetta. My friend would have really loved that. My complaint is the friendliness of the staff our wait time was really long. Told it was 45 min-1 hour. It was 1:15. It was prom night so maybe I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend the other day, and I ordered the eggplant parmesan. I was given eggplant rollitini instead. I asked the server if that was the same as eggplant parmesan and he said \"you didn't order eggplant parmesan you just said eggplant.\" ??? I specifically remember him reading the order back correctly. I work in the food industry so I understand that mistakes happen, but I was very frustrated that he argued saying I ordered it wrong (which I didn't). He offered me a side of pasta, but we were then charged for it. Why should I be paying $8 for a side of pasta if he messed up my order and argued with me about it? The food here is good, but because of this experience I'm not sure I will want to come back."}
{"text":"Brunch with Honey.  Short rib hash and french toast were sublime!  Excellent service and ambience.  Go!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for brunch but it was completely unnecessary as there only three or four other parties in the restaurant when I went. The bottomless mimosas wee sensational. They were probably 70% alcohol, 30% juice so if you like a less alcoholic beverage, ask for light champagne. The food was good but nothing to write home about. I would definitely visit again just for the good drinks and great vibes."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad. Was greeted with, \"it's not happy hour anymore\" instead of a hello. Things never got better. Food was decent, nothing spectacular. Ordered a small salad with shrimp for my dinner. When they say small they mean small. Probably won't be back unless a friend wants to. I know of at least 15 restaurants that I can go to and spend the 35$ this place cost for one, and get better service and better food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome...right next to a small pond.....darkened room, feels cool and cozy.  The wait staff are impeccable.....polite, attentive and thorough.  The wine list was good, but maybe needs to a little larger???  I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with a slice of salmon.  They were very gracious as the salmon offering does not normally come with this-- this was my request.  The fettuccine was not quite al dente--- needed to cook a bit longer.  The whole plate needed salt to bring out the flavors....a bit bland.  I am not someone who normally adds salt to anything so there you go.  Overall, I would like to try this place again--- pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Veal picatta  is amzing! Alfredo was creamy awesomeness & the pizza is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Stone and Vine had a nice urban vibe for an Italian restaurant. The decor is cool and it's right on this man made pond which was cool for pictures. Came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner. They have a private area and patio to host small get together a maybe holds 40-50 comfortably our party was probably 20-30 which was more than enough space. the food was okay we had some chicken Marsala, lasagna, and a white penne cheese Alfredo dish. They were good. The salad was drenched in dressing and was soggy. Not my favorite. The cheesy Alfredo penne was really good. It was like a white macaroni and cheese paired with the Marsala very good. We had canollis as well. They were okay they were a bit hard but I don't eat canollis a lot so that's probably how they are supposed to be. I didn't care for the filling it tasted tangy which wasn't very pleasing. But overall a great experience in a quaint area of south chandler."}
{"text":"I read other reviews and maybe I hit the jackpot day, but we went for lunch (4 of us) and the food, and service, was fantastic.  Lunch offerings are \"8 for 8\" ... e.g. 8 items that are 8 bucks each.  Portions are very large and the taste is great - not too much garlic - for me, just the right amount of spices.  I had a couple of Italian draft beers, too - very tasty and strong (alcoholic content seemed very high).  I would definitely go back for lunch!  They offer a very interesting dessert - espresso over vanilla sorbet - I definitely thought this dessert is an excellent after meal treat!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night there was a line of people waiting to be seated but we had reservations so we're promptly seated. Started with the carpaccio and the burrata board, both were very good and great portions. I ordered the pesto chicken pizza with jalapeños and the hubby had veal piccata with the fried gnocchi. The pizza was great but I have to admit my husbands dish was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was the fried gnocchi that just took it over the top!!! Dessert however was a huge disappointment we had the zeppole which was fried phyllo dough that was extremely greasy and somewhat undercooked. I'm definitely going back but staying away from the dessert!        Wow what a difference when you do take out! We ordered the bruschetta which was fine but the burrata board was anything but....it was literally less than half the size of the one we ordered when we sat down for dinner. If I'm paying the same price as if we were to sit down why am I only getting a portion of the food?! Consistency is the key when it comes to restaurants survival, why would we want to return if we don't even know what we will be getting"}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise!  We found this place sheerly by accident a few weeks ago and it was fantastic!   Even tho it was quite busy we walked right in on a Friday night before Christmas.  Chicken parm was on point, piping hot and a large portion that also made a nice lunch the next day.  Hubby's short ribs with mushroom sauce and risotto was absolutely delicious.  The meat was fork tender and the risotto creamy and perfectly cooked.  But that mushroom sauce...that was the highlight.  I could have eaten a big bowl of that with a spoon!  Great ambiance, extensive wine list, indoor and outdoor seating, excellent service even on a super busy night.  I plan to go for my birthday this week."}
{"text":"The food here was great.  Is  becoming  one of my favorite spots. Went on a Friday night and it wasn't so packed you had to wait. Wait staff is friendly and prompt. Definitely would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and ambiance.  We had the chop salad (small size) substituting onions for the egg, caprese salad, zucchini with a tomato sauce, & house wines that were on the happy hour special.  Our server was very good and not intrusive.  There are several other personnel delivering food and available for anything you might need.  There is no searching for someone to help.  A manager was floating around the room double checking to make sure everyone was happy (two thumbs up for such a manager).  The place is on a waterfront for a lakeside housing development.  It was too hot to be outside even though there were misters.  An ideal time would be the beginning of September.  We had a booth which was a bit tight so I would suggest the hightop tables.  Be sure to check the link on the Yelp sight for the menu.  It is very up to date."}
{"text":"This was a great place, especially with family members that have food allergies. Their steak and eggs flatbread was fantastic. The chicken club with apple smoked bacon that my wife had was also delicious. Our grandkids had the kids meal spaghetti & meatball which they loved. Our daughter & grandson have gluten allergies and they had a great gluten free, egg free, dairy free menu. We sat outside in this beautiful AZ weather. A great restaurant for the whole family."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time back last night which turned into a pleasant surprise above our expectations thanks to Tom, Blake and Theresa...thanks you 3 for a wonderful evening!!   S&V is what the corner of Alma School/Queen Creek needed to light up Ocotillo!! Clearly the economy has come back with many new places around town but S&V is the best to have arrived...it was thriving last night and with many repeat diners like us enjoying the amazing food and service! I'm from the east coast (RI), I haven't had mussels this good in a very long time...simply delish!! Love the salads, pizza and soups too...I'll be back to try verything on the menu! Welcome to Chandler, S&V...Cheers!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and it was alright. The bruschetta was the best part of the meal! The pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food is amazing! We had the eggplant rollatini which was to die for! I had the Milan chicken which is a great meal if your watching carbs. I can't wait to go back and try other things in their menu!"}
{"text":"I tried a chicken panini And it was excellent, my friend tried the chicken pesto pizza...it was one of the very best. I like the place...good ambience , not pricey and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Actually woke up in time for brunch @stoneandvine today We ordered the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, the Chicken Pesto Flatbread, the Half Linguine with Alfredo Sauce and Half Caesar Salad, the Tomatoes with Balsamic Drizzle Bruschetta, the Apple & Brie Bruschetta, and the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta. I personally thought the Fettucine was decent. I just thought the noodles were too thick for my liking (I should've ordered some Capellini noodles). The sauce was still good though! I didn't try the flatbreads, but I was told the BBQ one was alright because the sauce was overpowering the flatbread. However, I did enjoy all the bruschettas (but I still prefer @postinowinecafe hehe. It's hard to top them). My personal favorite would have to be the Apple & Brie followed by the Tomatoes with Balsamic Drizzle, then the Smoked Salmon. Overall, my experience here was pretty good. The one thing you should know before coming is it is on pricier end, but honestly worth the dining experience"}
{"text":"Nice. I usually like High Tide for seafood, but tonight we tried Stone & Vine. It was very nice. About half an hour wait for a 2 top, Service was good and food was even better. Had a nice evening."}
{"text":"Most amazing dinner. Service was amazing. Great wine and Italian beer. It's a must. Took my family and customer"}
{"text":"We came to check out the new place in same spot as the old Grimaldi's.  We arrived at 630 PM on a Sat night so the place was very busy!  We had an acceptable 30 minute wait and got seated out on the patio.    Ambiance:  The patio dining area is nice and has a nice open view.  Note though, the place is VERY loud inside and outside.  The acoustics of the place and the fact that there were so many people makes for a very loud place.  The waiter had to practically shout to take our order, and it for me it made the dining experience a little more tense than I like because it's hard to even talk to your dining companion.   Service:  The service was friendly and professional.  Our appetizers and salads came fairly quickly considering how busy it was.  My only compliant is that it took a long time for the main entrée to come (25-30 minutes after our salad was done).  The waiter came by to apologize for the wait, but still too long to wait.  Food:  For appetizers we had the Caprese.  It was pretty good.  We also had Caesar salad which was good although a little heavy on the dressing.  For the main course I had the Chicken Marsala.  It was decent, but not great.  It was served on a pizza plate (see my picture) which made the dish look a little odd too.  Prices:  Prices all seemed reasonable and fair.  Summary:  I think this place is geared more towards pizzas and paninis (that seemed to be what most people were getting).  Maybe I should have stuck with that.  It is strange though because it displays itself as a fancy Italian place so I expected more entrée selections.  I will definitely go back and try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Always impressed with the quality and portions. Very accommodating servers and hostesses."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything was nice! It's not 5 stars because I solely give those to restaurants that wow me. Though this restaurant was delicious, it did not wow me. It was like most restaurants in Scottsdale. However, the only problem was that they put too much ice in my drink. Overall, a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe I just am used to the high standards kept at S&V up in Scottsdale, or maybe this place just doesn't care about keeping standards. My visit last week was subpar at best. The service was slow. Not, the restaurant is packed and they needed extra time, but literally everything moved at a snails pace. The pace of the service wasn't the only issue we had. It was abrupt, not friendly and hopefully just an off night for the server (I hate to rat out a bad server unless I've experienced bad service from them on more than one occasion).  The food was just so disappointing compared to S&V up in Scottsdale. It feels like they just sloppily copied and pasted it. Calamari was chewy instead of tender. The sauce on my spaghetti was oily. How do you as an Italian restaurant screw up something so basic.  To top it all off I was talking to the server and saying  I usually went to the Scottsdale location and she had the audacity to say it was closed. In a panic I drove by on my way home (thank god I live down the street, it's one of my fave restaurants)...and it was open (I could see guests on their uber cute outdoor patio).  All in all if you live halfway between Chandler & Scottsdale, don't risk it, go to the S&V in Scottsdale where the food is always as excellent as the service. Heck, I would even make the drive if I lived in Chandler. Why settle for second best when you can have the best??!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here and it was very unsatisfactory. I ordered the chicken club sandwich and found SEVERAL hairs in my sandwich...gross! Margherita pizza was flavorless and soggy, had almost no sauce at all and no basil like it should. The penne vodka tasted alright but was not spectacular by any means. Safe to say we will not be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday hoping the food would be good.  I had chicken marsala which had the worst gravy for marsala I have ever tasted.  My husband had a pizza which was supposed to have pizza sauce on it but you could have called it sauceless it had so little.  I was disappointed with the food.  We also had a caprese salad as an appetizer and it was had virtually no olive oil a main topping on this type of salad.  They need to work on improving the quality of the food and how it is prepared.  I did like the atmosphere of the place. Update, So i emailed the company to let them know how unhappy i was with the food and never heard anything back."}
{"text":"Just tried Stone and Vine for the first time.  It was a fantastic experience.  First, the staff was very attentive, drinks were refilled timely and they checked in at good intervals.  The food was great!  We had the bruschetta, the calamari and a pizza.  All were prepared to perfection.  The restaurant was also very kid friendly with all of our boys favorite items on their menu.  We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Had to ask several times for anything/everything.  Food was a disappointment."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for Happy Hour & Dinner this past Friday.  After reading the reviews, I was a bit concerned but we decided to give it a try.   Atmosphere: Very large with a variety of table options.  Not much room at the bar.  It was quite busy but as it was just the two of us and we were willing to sit on the patio, we were seated within 5 minutes. We did not notice any bugs or bad smells that other reviewers had noted.  Overall the decor is very nice.  Not fancy.  No tablecloths that I noticed.    Service: The hostess was friendly and immediately greeted me. Our server was very nice but seemed to be stretched a bit thin.  General observation of the other table to staff ratio confirmed my thought. They need more bus folks to support the wait staff or maybe just more servers for such a large place.    Food: We opted for a full bottle of wine since it was happy hour (a nice Sangiovese) and the Bocconcini E Pepe starter to share.  We liked it but both agreed it needed a splash of Balsamic. For an entree, I chose the Harvest Salad and my friend had the Pasta Primavera.  The salad was large and very tasty. However, the kitchen forgot to add dressing to it so it took a few minutes to flag down the server and get that fixed. The pasta primavera was also quite large with lots of veggies. The pasta is served with more of a broth than a 'sauce' and it tended to all run to the bottom of the bowl, so much stirring was needed to get the penne coated.  We both thought a noodle or shell would have been better for getting the sauce-to-pasta ratio better balanced.    Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Perhaps not a rave review but I wouldn't discourage you either.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Ocotillo with patio! Came here for lunch and had the Beet & Burrata salad that was on special! Everthing about this salad hit the spot, the creamy burrata, the peppery arugala, the perfect beets all dressed and seasoned to perfection! Service was great too! I can't wait to go back and try more! Thank you Stone and Vine!"}
{"text":"When there's a wait it's usually quick. Staff is friendly and prompt. However, what keeps us coming back is the consistently excellent food.  Wild Salmon dish = amazing. I can't say enough good things about the linguini and clams in white wine sauce. Candidly, 99% of the menu is delicious.  I really appreciate that the food is prepared fresh, served hot, and always tastes great. Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!  First time here and what a delicious meal!  Our server, Maria was so helpful in explaining menu options and pointed out the great happy hour specials.  The Bruschetta was so great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Try this restaurant for the first time during happy hour. My whole family was very impressed. Even the pickiest of us was well satisfied.    Salads and appetizers were great and delivered quickly.   Vegetable risotto was excellent.  Very flavorful.   Penne vodka was declared \"very good.\"  The cheese pizza was very fresh and not at all greasy.    Rainbow trout was extremely tasty.  Cooked and spiced just right.  The accompanying vegetables and pasta were perfect.   The thing that really stood out was the service.  These folks know teamwork. I think out table was visited by no less than eight people.  Empty plates were quickly cleared and drink refills were smoothly transition in.  Everyone was very friendly and professional.    The atmosphere was great.  Very comfortable.    The only bad thing is we were too full to try dessert. The dessert menu is pretty extensive and maybe worth a trip all on its own.  I anticipate that this was just the first of many visits to this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great weekend brunch spot.  Quaint ambiance.   Stefanie the bartender nice and provides awesome service.  Have been for dinner and everything has been delicious"}
{"text":"On Sunday September 30th my daughter baptized her child and we decided to host the baptism  dinner at Stone and Vine restaurant in Chandler.  It was a party of 30 and the gal  Amanda did an awesome job accommodating us with a meal that was delicious, filling and work within my budget.  Service was awesome everyone had a great time and comment on how delicious the food was.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome for everyone! My parents do date night here, our family had a big celebration with all the kids, I see lots of people sitting at the bar always. It's just a great atmosphere with delicious homemade food. We love the toasted ravioli appetizer, the soups, the veal Marsala, the walleye and the lasagna. It's all so yummy! Portions are generous, so you get to enjoy your meal twice. Don't miss out on this local gem."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our meal at Stone and Vine. First, we were able to make a reservation which is always a good start.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and they have a great patio. There were 4 of us and everyone enjoyed their food!  My husband is picky about his pizza and he was quite impressed. I had the shrimp scampi and it was delicious!  And to top it off, the service was very good. I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and date night worthy atmosphere. We tried 4 different types of bruschetta during happy hour which was the best decision ever. We then enjoyed a pizza that was oh so yummy. We sat on the patio which can be a bit cramped but the only person bothered by that was another customer who didn't think to ask anyone to scooch over. We enjoyed the tiramasu and their complimentary birthday zeppoles which is similar to sopapillas. Soft, airy pillows of sweet goodness dipped in chocolate sauce is always a great thing. Service was attentive and the cost was appropriate for the quality of food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My BF and I have been here twice.  Each time the service was excellent. Actually outstanding.   Food is really good. The appetizers have a nice selection. The salads come in small and large which is a great idea. Good pizza. Not a large menu of selections but lots of choices to satisfy all.  Cheesecake was awesome and the coffee is the best! You will want a refill once or twice!  Sit on the patio by the pond.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was good! Place was packed but that's to be expected since it's new (used to be grimaldis here), it was Friday, and the location. They take reservations so we'll remember that next time. Service was great! Sat at the bar waiting for a table and the bartenders were awesome! We got seated on the patio which was nice. Ordered lasagna to share and a pizza to take home. Yummy yummy! They were nice enough to split the lasagna for us and I can't believe how HUGE the portion was! We thought they might have misunderstood and given us two separate orders, but no that was not the case. The pizza was really good too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot. Atmosphere is really nice, chefs board is a winner. Very good happy hour."}
{"text":"YUM the pizza at this place is excellent. My family tried Stone & Vine on Monday and enjoyed the food so well we order take out pizza last night! We started with the meatball appetizer. I recommend ordering it \"Sophie\" which means you get yummy spinach and cheese on top. I ordered the ravioli and my husband had pasta and pizza.  All were great. My only disappointment was our server had not tried the food and could not make recommendations. We probably would have ordered more if we had items recommended."}
{"text":"We've been several times. Love the atmosphere. Priced right for amount if food. Suggest sharing the entrees. Specialty drinks are great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place until tonight's experience.  I don't eat meat, so I ordered the Mushroom risotto which has been fabulous in the past.  I ate a few bites and I tasted. . . chicken.  I looked and I could see what looked like chicken amid the rice and mushrooms.  I had my husband confirm it was in fact chicken.  I called over our waitress who confirmed that my dish should not contain chicken.  She said she would check with the kitchen and find out why my food contained chicken.  She came out a bit later and said she really did not have an explanation why my meal was made with chicken.  After a bit of a wait, she did bring me a new dish, this one not contaminated with chicken.  I was a bit surprised when she presented us with our check and we were charged full price for everything.  When our waitress came to pick up our check, I let her know it did not think it was appropriate that they made the error that they did and then did nothing about it.  Only then did she take my husband's dessert off the bill.  We paid the check and left.  Because this situation was so badly handled, my husband and I will NEVER go back to Stone and Vine."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the food was excellent and the vibe is great (I'm all about the ambiance). I recently held my rehearsal dinner at Stone and Vine. They have a nice private room that can be closed off from the main seating area which was perfect. At our original meeting in June (I think?) we set a time and agreed to reserve the private room. About 30 days out from our wedding, I called to change the reservation to an earlier time. I was told it was no problem (yay!). Fast forward to 3 days prior to the wedding I received a confirmation call for the original time (hmm). I explained that I changed the time several weeks ago to an earlier slot. Again, I was told \"no problem\" (yay!). We walked into the restaurant the night of the rehearsal dinner to find a buffet set up in the middle of the main dining area and another party in the private room (boo!). When I spoke to Amanda, who I think was the manager, she explained that because the time was changed to an earlier slot, the private room was not available and so they have everything set up in the main dining area. Needless to say, surprises like this does not make for a happy bride. I expressed to her that I would have appreciated a heads up when I spoke to 2 different people on 2 separate occasions about changing the time. I was offered little condolence before she walked away. As a result, the main dining area was too loud for our guests to make any type of speech which was disappointing for the groom and I. The buffet food was presented in a timely manor and our guests enjoyed the food. There was a gentleman who was very attentive to me and made sure my wine glass was never empty. All in all, we had a fun evening with our family and friends, despite the mix up."}
{"text":"Excellent food, phenomenal staff if you enjoy Italian food this is the place to stop in chandler! Great service and friendly environment, they do weekly specials called the \"daily stone\" and they're no joke from the osso Bucco to the scallop scampi every dish on there will leave your stomach satisfied. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Unique mix in an unassuming building with a dentist office above - great wine list, classic and new-twist Italian dishes, and eclectic playlist including Zeppelin and live Petty. 7pm Sunday night, Memorial Day weekend and a lot of locals are here. I see why - great food, service, and a friendly neighborhood ambiance. The calamari and Caprese with a glass of Montepulciano for $25 was near perfect."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time last night and will definitely return. They have a diverse menu that accommodated our gluten free, vegetarian and dairy free family members along with plenty of traditional fare. The food was delicious, portions large and the wait staff did a marvelous job even though they were very, very busy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The charcuterie board is great! Their pizzas are amazing! Oddly enough, my favorite thing on their menu is their minestrone. Soup is not usually my thing but this minestrone is so fresh and delicious. I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"First time here. Made it for happy hour and miraculously my husband and I got a seat at the bar. The restaurant was busy and flowing with people that seemed to be content, happy and lively. I felt comfortable.  The bartender was extremely friendly, happy, and provided excellent service--I believe his name was Tony.   Must try the garlic knots! They are baked dough balls coated with fresh garlic and olive oil served with a flavorful marinara sauce. The red wine sangria was the best tasting sangria that I've had in quite some time--2 had me feeling carefree. We shared one of their pizza selections and even had food to take home.   Unique decor for an Italian restaurant. They also have outside seating on their patio. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed talking with other couples at the bar as well. I highly recommend this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Would probably be five stars but due to the slow service it's three. Arrived about 7:00pm with a party of 6 and was seated on the patio by 7:20 which was good but we didn't get our food until well past 8:30 and the restaurant wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Enjoy going for happy hour. Excellent appetizer selections. Friendly and attentive servers. Great patio, especially this time of year."}
{"text":"Brand new urban Italian restaurant in Chandler!!  This place is AWESOME. Grandma took me here as she's been Andy about them opening the new space.  The patio, is not to be missed if you love a good view.  The food is on point too. We ordered the caprese as an appetizer and I was shocked at how much you get for your money. Home made mozzarella, giant tomatoes, fresh basil. I could eat it every day.  Since it was just lunch we split the lasagna and.... You guessed it. Amaze balls.  I'll be back at least 3 more times to try other menu items. Support local business kids, skip Olive Garden and head over this a way!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this restaurant on Wednesday night...December 13th, 2017. We ordered lots of food, now knowing how huge the servings were!  Hubby had the mussels as an appetizer..huge bowl..I had the appetizer meatballs (3 giant ones) and for dinner he ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana and I had the Frutte de Mar or something like that that included Mussels, shrimp, calamari and scallops over linguini and white garlic sauce.  OMG we were blown away. We had to take much of it home because it was just so much food! Kudos to our server, Alex, who gave us many menu suggestions and descriptions which helped us so much!  She made our evening memorable. Ask for her, if you can, when  you decide to go there!  We just spent a month in Italy and this was by far better than the food there, which was pretty darned good and authentic!  BTW, we dined outside on the patio next to a heater lamp. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"We had our team lunch at this place today. I have to say they have very cozy seating, great ambience and excellent food. Couple of TV's at the bar showing sports and there were pretty good selections of liquor on display. I took the penne pesto pasta with sausage as extra. Food tasted delicious and I loved the freshness in the food. Also the lunch portion was good enough to be a dinner plate. The only complaint I have is that there was only a couple of servers serving the 10+ tables. This caused considerable delay in our food being delivered to our table. Service could have been better. I will give this place another try soon. Overall I will recommend this place for good food and fun."}
{"text":"We went for brunch this weekend.  The service was good, but I found the food average.  I would say the chicken parm panini was the best thing that we had."}
{"text":"I ordered the lasagna and while it was very good, it could have used more sauce and a little less ricotta cheese. It was delicious and I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day and it was excellent. The service was a little slow, but not terrible. We went on Father's Day, but there was not a large crowd, so that's why I thought the service was a little slow. The atmosphere is very inviting and the staff was friendly and professional.   Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would eat here again. A word to the wise; if you're not a fan of high top tables, that's the majority of the seating, so if you don't like that type of arrangement request a normal table."}
{"text":"Excellent service... Great serving sizes and delicious and fresh food. Not to forget great ambience as well."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  I can take my business clients there during the day, we bring our kids here and they love it and I've even had a huge party in the back room and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there and was pleasantly surprised!  Had the Pasta Fagulie and Eggplant Parm. It was delicious!!   Definitely will go back for lunch. It was not crowded and service was good!"}
{"text":"Never once, in 20+ trips, have we ever been unhappy with our experience at S&V.  My personal favorites are the chefs salad, BBQ chicken pizza, any risotto they make and the penne with vodka sauce (I add shrimp). Wife love the bruschetta, penne with vodka, pear salad and the pizza with arugula oh and their sangria. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good selection of Italian foods on menu and drinks are not bad.  Nice vibe and quite packed even on Thurs night"}
{"text":"Really love this place as a classy neighborhood haunt. Great drinks, food and service. We've only had one experience where service was very slow, but I wasn't in a hurry, so it didn't bother me to use the time to have another glass of wine, haha. Brushetta is delish for a snack or a meal anytime. Haven't ever had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Super loud! I realize it's new and still working out the kinks, but I hope they figure it out soon. Took way too long to even be greeted by our waiter, who then didn't even ask if we wanted to order drinks...then when we flagged him down to order drinks, he had to ask THREE different times what wine I wanted. Wow...then it literally took another 15 minutes to get our food, one entree and a bruschetta board. The bread for the bruschetta was good but not crunchy or crusty at all :( Lastly, and it may seem silly, but there was (and still is an hour plus later) a leaf on the floor next to us. Now, while that is not a big deal in the grand scheme,  there have been employees that have walked over and around the leaf like 100 times! Someone pick it up!! Not sure we'll  be coming back again...sure hope they figure it out soon."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food, I wish I could remember the name of the bruschettas I tried, but I am pretty sure any one of them is going to be delicious. The Turkey and Brie is pretty spot on and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"First time great food, staff, wine cannot say enough good! Matt was our server and did an excellent job!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I'm happy to have a stone and vine in lovely south chandler. My personal favorite is the Godfather pizza. I have tried a few other dishes as well, and they never disappoint. I love the chic, modern atmosphere. And what a lovely lake view! This place is great to sit down and relax during lunch or after a long day at work with a nice drink, a beautiful view, and great food. Make sure to get here early, because there's usually a wait. But trust me, the wait is worth it. It is a nice sit down restaurant, therefore the prices are in accordance. The servers are pretty nice, and the service speed is average. If you are looking for great Italian, this is the place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is surprisingly empty for a  Friday evening which was strange. The atmosphere is very nice. They play great music and the food is wonderful.   We had busted this restaurant about two years ago and said we would never return. Actually after waiting over an hour for someone to take our drink orders, we decided to leave. There was a waitress standing there and asked \"are you leaving \". When we replied we were she kinda giggled. So that was that.  Well last week my daughter suggested we go there for dinner. I said no way, but she said it is her favorite restaurant. Well, I know us is very picky about her food, so we agreed to good. What a pleasant surprise!!!  The food was great and the service as well. Try it, you won't be disappointed. The Osso Bucco is to die for."}
{"text":"Came looking for the new Italian restaurant advertised. My husband and I were impressed with the decor and ambiance. It was around 3:30 on Monday afternoon and we were the only ones at the time. Shelby was very pleasant and welcoming. We enjoyed the cool breeze coming in from the veranda. The lasagna and pasta primavera were good, not great.  No bread, we had to ask for it. The lasagna had a chunk of hard parmigiana cheese my husband couldn't bite into, perhaps the rind? The server, Shelby, said she would bring to chef's attention. The service could have been much better, could be lack of supervision, training, etc. no one came by our table to check on us, ask about the quality of the food, nor refilled our water. It was shift change and many servers came on the floor. The plates were promptly removed as we were finished eating and asked if we wanted dessert. We originally planned to partake, however was disenchanted. I'm writing this to share with management, so improvements can be made to have an all around great experience for the patrons. We may give this place a retry in the distant future."}
{"text":"Classy food, relaxing environment. Kid friendly but still looking and feeling great! Awesome selection of foods, great waitstaff and the food tastes amazing. Had lots of leftovers and they tasted just as good reheated! Reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Stone & Vine can be summed up in one word: meh. We arrived shortly before 6 p.m. and were promptly seated on the patio. The inside dining area was already pretty busy with happy hour. Our server was polite and was more than happy to explain what was on the happy hour menu.  We ordered two pints and the sausage and peppers to start. Unfortunately, those were the only real highlights of the meal. The flavors of the sausage and peppers were great. It had some heat without being overwhelming. I did feel the dish was a little small for the $10 non-happy hour price point. Next was our salads - the mista. We ordered a large to split and the kitchen was kind enough to split in onto two separate plates without us asking. The salad was just waaaaay too over-dressed. The dressing was tossed on and the whole thing was just drenched. I know some people like this, but it just wasn't for me. We also split the brussel sprouts pizza. From the menu description, I imagined the brussel sprouts would have been sliced and then oven roasted. They were actually just a handful of leaves that had been lightly steamed before being placed on top of the pizza. They added zero taste and wouldn't even stay on the pizza. The cheese, pancetta and caramelized onion were good, but the brussel sprouts just seemed out of place in comparison. The pizza crust was the biggest disappointment of all. It was completely bland. No seasoning, no taste, no anything. It honestly reminded me of a pretzel without the salt.  Ultimately, there's nothing wrong with this place. The outside seating is nice and they have a good happy hour. The food just wasn't compelling enough to make me want come back in the future."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant!  Nice variety on the menu and food is very consistent and a good happy hour.  Friday nights are super busy but week nights are fine."}
{"text":"Bruschetta is very good - I've tried them all! Recommend for lunch or dinner. We often grab for takeout and staff is always very polite and friendly. Looking forward to enjoying this place for a date night away from our newborn soon!"}
{"text":"Love stone and vine. The meatballs Sofia's way are the best. We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Saturday Night, it was your topical 30 minutes Wait..... Yahoo bam we sat out on the patio overlooking the lake. Bam the pizza arrived its out of this world. This is my place."}
{"text":"Phenomenal on every front!  Food is excellent, ambiance is almost perfect, service is excellent and drink selection is good. Highly recommend for date night, business dinners, outdoor dining or just about anything else."}
{"text":"My party wanted to go somewhere for Sunday Brunch...specifically somewhere with bottomless drinks. I mean, what is Brunch without bottomless whatever? I found this place that offers bottomless mimosas/blood mary/bellinis for $15! So, we decided to go here. I made a reservation for Brunch, just in case. When we arrived, we were the only people there and a reservation was definitely not needed. During our stay, people slowly trickled in but it there was still plenty of open tables. I was told this place used to be Grimaldi's. The inside looks like it has been renovated recently since the interior is pretty modern and trendy. The restaurant sits alongside a lake, and they do offer outdoor seating on the patio by the lake. It's actually pretty beautiful inside and out. Since we were the only people there, the hostess let us choose our table. We seated ourselves at a table that I felt could have been better maintained. Most of their patio chairs had the hard-surface material (I think it was wood), but the table we were at had fabric seat cushions that seemed a little dirty from weather and spilled items. Cleanliness is extremely important for me, and this was definitely a turn off.  This is an Italian restaurant, but their brunch menu had a pretty good and diverse options, including a quesadilla and chilaquiles. I usually eat egg whites and there was a $2 upcharge for this. That up-charge did rest uneasy for me since most other places charge less. Honestly, I don't even understand why there's an up-charge to begin with, but what do I know about the cost of running a restaurant. They did allow me to substitute potatoes for fruit without an additional up-charge. This did rectify my opinion a little. Portion size was surprisingly large given the pricing. I was happy about that. Service was decent. Our server could have been more engaging, but he was friendly enough and seemed to know when we needed him. He was present when it mattered. I definitely want to come back to this restaurant on a different day at a different time to experience more of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"What can I say? We had our parents' 50th anniversary party at Stone & Vine and they couldn't have been more accommodating. I worked with Amanda to get everything coordinated and the servers we had, Hillary and Taylor, were phenomenal. We had the back room for the entire night, were not rushed, were treated like royalty, basically. We always enjoy Stone & Vine for happy hour and now I will recommend it for special/private events. Couldn't have had a better night. Thanks Stone & Vine!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Stone and Vine in Chandler several times.  The Lasagna is excellent. Although a couple times it is not hot all the way through. The Spaghetti is also good. The Zeppole dessert is very very greasy. The Cinnamon Knots are excellent. The prices are a little high for the portions that are served.  Service has always been very good too.  Almost 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been with my husband and with a friend.  It's really cute and great ambiance! it's the quaint places that offer the most interesting experiences!  I just wish they had gluten free options."}
{"text":"My husband & I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. We usually make a reservation so we get seated promptly, otherwise it's crowded & there may be a wait. The food is always great, we've tried the stuffed shrimp appetizer and the scallop appetizer, the Caesar salad and spinach salad and for dinners, the Veal Marsala and Chicken Marsala with a mushroom risotto, topped off with the cinnamon knots for dessert. All delicious! We definitely keep coming back and will try many other menu items since we've never had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"First time picking lunch up for an office.  Restaurant is VERY UNDER STAFFED. ONLY 2 women helping customers. Carla the manager and Taylor. Waited 20 mins or so for food.  Brought order to office and Dr wasnt happy with salad. They were not able to add carrots, mushrooms to the salad. Taylor claimed salad is a mixture of greens however there was only Kale in salad. If you are looking to have a frustrating dining experience this place is for you."}
{"text":"Good food for brunch. Great service. Will go again! Mimosa were good. Breakfast was nothing out of the ordinary but well flavored."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place and the food was good.  My risotto needed some seasoning.  Bland is a nice way to phrase it.  When Risotto is good I will eat my weight in it.  I left half of this in my bowl.  Enough said.  Follow me for more reviews...I LOVE food!"}
{"text":"What an improvement!  Excellent calamari!  The cocktails were amazing.  Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"Won't be back. Food is decent but took well over 45 minutes for lunch. We were their first customers. People are and paid for their food before ours was even delivered. Hard to justify or find an excuse for this. Also, our food was undercooked. So, after waiting almost an hour the food wasn't even cooked all the way. Kind of sad considering how much we liked this place previously."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and an extra star for the atmosphere.  We sat at the bar, which is beautiful and ordered the house salad and a pizza with pesto sauce, ricotta and roasted red peppers.  The salad was just ok.  Not bad, but not great either.  The pizza was VERY thin.  I don't think I've ever eaten a pizza as thin as this one was.  That aside, given we ordered it with a pesto sauce I expected it to be really flavorful, but I found it to be a bit on the bland side.  The best thing about it was the roasted red peppers, unfortunately there weren't many of them on there.  I definitely want to give them another try and order something different."}
{"text":"Always a fun place. Great appetizers and entrees as well. The clams are very good. The bar serves great drinks...Stone IPA on tap!!! There are plenty of tv screens available for your favorite game. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every Time I eat there it keeps getting better and better!!  The chef is excellent!! My family love eating lunch and dinner there! The cook the pasta to order too"}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  The bruschetta is some of the best I've had and they have a pretty good wine list.  A little on the pricey side.   We got the gnocchi and it was pretty small for as much as you pay.  But still pretty good.  Very good service every time we've been there."}
{"text":"Everything was great and I would like to give more stars but they ran out of bruschetta ? Which they have a separate section for? So that seems extremely weird. It was more or less our waitress shift was over and she was ready to leave."}
{"text":"Rhett, the server was Awesome Decent beers on draft. Great/fast/friendly service. We had the nachos and meatball sliders-YUM!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Stone & Vine. The patio sitting next to the lake was lovely. The garlic bread, olives, calamari and the abundant poor of a glass of wine was great. The service was good. Inside dining had a good atmosphere as well. You can go casual or dress up. We will be back."}
{"text":"Met some friends up for dinner and although there were some technical difficulties at the restaurant we enjoyed our meals. We started off with the bruschetta board which our fav was the tomato, onion, basil, evoo and balsamoc drizzle. We also had the gorgonzola and apple (not the biggest fans), wild mushroom, goat cheese and truffle oil, and the proscuitto arugula with balsamic (def fans).  Each had:   Eggplant parm...decent could have used more sauce but tasty!  Gnocchi Pomodoro with grilled chicken...the dish had flavor but the chicken was a bit chewy   Short rib with parm risotto (tad bit salty) but the ribs were tasty  Lasagna....excellent  We also split the caesar salad and the arugula pear salad which were both excellent. Given the snags with their system issues we were able to have a good time and our waiter (although frazzled) did well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit. The atmosphere was nice and the pizza was delicious. Besides you can't beat a pizza and wine for $30!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good food, service still getting up,to speed.  Overall, a good experience and we'll be back.  Now, the owners only need to bring Salt and Lime down to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Ahhh! Nice Friday nite stop.  Sweet help and good food.  Referred by a local who was excited about the change and I see why.  Broad menu.  Biggest problem...what to order."}
{"text":"We have dined here on many occasions celebrating birthdays and more. The food has always been excellent and the service superior. I love their iced tea, it is so much better than the typical tea you get. My sister was visiting and I took her there. She loved it too. The server was so kind to find out the brand/blend for us. We have been ordering it ever since.  Our wine pairings group met there once and they were awesome in letting us choose individual appetizers to pair with the wines we selected. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"What a great place for dinner and drinks on the patio. We made it in time before the heat hit. But still, the inside looks great, too. The service by Kevin was on point. The food was good and the leftovers were eaten for breakfast. The ONLY thing I would suggest changing is the music. Iron Maiden does not at all compliment gnocci and sauvignon blanc on the patio.  Not a total deal breaker, though. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for happy hour and have had great service and good food each time. Ask to sit in Alexis' section. She's super friendly and attentive and has great recommendations. We are never left waiting for anything when we have her! She's always on top of making sure we have a drink and are enjoying our food. The crafted drinks are all great and are not poured weak (thank you!). The cucumber press is my favorite! We tried the Barrara which was really good, however there wasn't much on the plate to support the price. The salads are great! Try the arugula pear or harvest. Yum! My husband and I usually get a half salad and split a pizza or bruschetta which is perfectly sized. The pesto chicken and fungi (we add prosciutto to the fungi) pizzas are really good and are thin crust. The bruschetta is also good sized and delicious!  Happy hour knocks a few dollars off the prices which are clearly outlined in the menu. Outdoor seating is great and the indoor seating has lots of ambiance. This is definitely our new go-to restaurant! All of the staff are very friendly and there is always ample parking."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for Mother's Day. We had a reservation for 5:45 and when we arrived we were good we would not be seated for 30 min. Once we visit got seated we told by a very rude and unprofessional waiter that we could not order food for another 20 min! We should have been informed on this right from the beginning."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here last night for my birthday!  Great bruschetta platter and a few $ off for happy hour!  Several choices in both red and white wines for $5.  Entree of penne vodka was simple and delicious.  Deserts a bit overpriced but tasty- has the Italian pastry with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I make sure to visit every time I'm in AZ. Great wine selection, happy hour prices, and the food is delicious! I love the bruschetta options (my favorite!) and the way that they plate your meal makes you feel like you should be paying more! Service has always been great and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is classy, yet laid back.   Highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I'd give the food an A+  The price of the food for the quality and quantity you get is amazing.  Bad parts, it's insanely loud in this place.  Not sure if it has to do with the layout or what.  Not crazy about the bar being in the same room as the eating area.    Service was good but also chaotic and was overcharged.  The menu is ok, seems they are pushing salads and pizza more then entrees.  They could use 3-5 more pasta dishes and some kind of beef dish.  This place is for sure for the younger crowd, which could be good and bad.    I'd probably hit this place up once a month just for the food.  Their beer and wine selection pretty much sucks, hopefully they can expand it."}
{"text":"I loved this place, had chicken Parmesan which was cooked perfectly. $5 wine during happy hour, liked the room & even the music was good. Can't wait till it's a little cooler and I can sit on the patio at night."}
{"text":"Good food, convenient location, and pretty good service.  Love the menu options!  Prices are a bit high though."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Got the short rib hash from the brunch selection. Exceeded my expectations! I have also had the Brie and Apple panini and the Harvest salad, also very good. My fiancé enjoyed the Brie and Apple panini and the vegetable one as well. We will be back :)   Side note: Ridiculously clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I've ever had.    Let's see taste of sauce none   Taste of cheese none   Taste of crust none  Price was ok    Hey fa get about this place for  pizza !"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Very rustic, the interior is dimly lit at night which makes it a great date spot I bet. It's definitely family friendly, and casual too though. Went with my sister though for a celebratory dinner. We didn't intend on ordering anything heavy nor as much as we did, but everything looked so good that we couldn't help ourselves.  We both got cocktails, which were so strong it's like the first sip slaps you silly. They have some interesting flavor profiles in their cocktails, but you definitely acquire the taste after a couple of sips. We ordered the eggplant rollatini and bruschetta (4 different kinds), she had the mini cannoli for dessert and I had the brownie a la mode (me and my chocolate). The eggplant was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The pieces of bruschetta were so big, and each one was cut into 4 pieces which takes 2-3 bites, and they are each loaded with all the goodies they promise. I think my favorite was the smoked salmon, and least favorite was the wild mushroom one, because of the goat cheese. I'm definitely not a fan of goat cheese especially when it is so strong. But my sister loved it.   I was a bit disappointed with my dessert. First, they were out of vanilla ice cream and the closest thing they had to it was birthday cake flavor, so I opted to have that. It was a big piece of brownie and it was warm. Because everything else had been so good, I had high expectations for this brownie. Unfortunately it fell very short of expectation. It was VERY average. I have tasted store bought brownies that were better than this one. But otherwise, I would definitely come here again for appetizers and entrees."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on our way to a concert. We were seated immediately, and our waitress came right over to get our drink order and bring us water. We started with some appetizers. Got the carpaccio and bruschetta. Both were very good, and almost enough to just have for dinner. My wife ordered the Brussels sprouts salad, and I had the chicken pesto pizza. They were both excellent. We had a great experience there with great service, and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food comes out fast and is delicious. It's a cozy atmosphere and I can even take my kids and not feel out of place. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We love this place. Tip: always make a reservation so your table is waiting for you when you arrive. Food is always wonderful. My red snapper with shrimp and risotto was perfection."}
{"text":"My server Alex was awesome! Prompt service, very polite, super accomadating! Loved it, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant quite a few times. The service is almost always great. The food is just ok.  A few months back our fried calamari was raw which was a bit disturbing. Then my son's Caesar wrap was made all wrong.  Not sure how you mess that up but it happened. The soda from the soda gun was flat and they didn't seem to care or try to fix the carbonation, but... So it took us a while to go back.  We did however go back on Saturday July 2nd. Forgetting the soda incident, I ordered my usual soda and again it was flat. I mentioned it to the waitress at which point she said to me...\" This is our soda.  I remember you from the last time and you are the only one who complains about the soda here...\"  UUhhhh excuse me? I was taken aback and so shocked that I was spoken too like that. I told her that I guess I would just have water.  Well, it took her a long time to return and we decided to leave.   I'm sorry, That is NOT how you treat a paying customer. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE!!!   SHE SHOULD BE FIRED!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for Mother's Day and the service was exceptional! The employees are very friendly, especially out waitress Hilary. She was very accommodating and always did things to help out we never asked her to. Stone and Vine also had great bruschetta haha"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Came here for happy hour (3-7pm daily) and had a few apps, a pizza, some drinks and dessert.  Overall things were good.  The place is nice and the prices are fair for what you get.  The apps were just ok (chefs board, garlic knots), the pizza was larger than I expected and done well.  The desserts were really good.  The cheesecake and gelato were both outstanding.    There's a lot of italian/pizza places around but this one is pretty good.  If you're in the area this is a good spot."}
{"text":"The quality and freshness of the food is questionable.  I order the panini. One slice of the bread was served green and moldy.   They tried to blame it on the grill, but that makes no sense because only one of the slices was green.  The other side looked fine.  We waited for them to remake it.  When the server brought it out, she did not even apologize!   When we got the check, they did nothing to compensate for our experience.  We asked to speak to the manager.  She was defensive and also blamed it on the grill.  When we asked to have it removed from our check, she said she couldn't because they remade it and because we ate it.  Again, no apology or attempt to make our experience better.  They do not value the customer or take ownership of a problem.  Very poor service and experience was disappointing.  The manager and staff need customer service training."}
{"text":"So my first time was a bad experience when I took my mom. The manager did contact me and offered me another experience ON THEM. My mom was busy last night so I took my fiancé instead. I have to say it was a great experience due to the awesome waitress Carla! she was so sweet and recommended her favorite things on the menu. This time I got the zuchinni fritti as an appetizer. The marinara sauce was delicious to dip the fried zuchinni in. For the entree I got the Ragatoni Bolognese,  I swear it tasted just like the one I make at home. Full of flavor and I even added shrimp to it. Huge shrimp! My fiancé got him a pizza he enjoyed it and really loved the crust. For dessert I got their homemade tiramisu which was delicious! so I had plenty of leftovers lol! I think I just happen to come on a bad day with a terrible waitress my first experience. I will definitely recommend this place after my 2nd experience."}
{"text":"Best brunch I had in Arizona hands down. Amazing food (the honey bruschetta -- cant remember the name, is amazing) and the bottomless drinks are to die for. Good ambiance too!"}
{"text":"WOW! My wife and I really enjoyed this place. Atmosphere was great and so was the food. We started with the garlic knots. They were huge and okay, but the marinara sauce was fantastic. I had the Godfather pizza and it was great. My wife had the salmon salad and she enjoyed it. The prices are reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Not my type of pizza or food. I should have sent back what we got. I just picked at the toppings.  This was my second visit here because I was assured my initial visit was a fluke. Husband chose scampi thinking how can that go badly. Previous visit was rissoto. Yeah don't order either."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary because we wanted to try something new. We were very disappointed. My chicken parmesan was very salty and overcooked and her four cheese pizza didn't taste good and was very bland. The floors were very dirty and the service was slow. We are both Italian and have been to Italy many times, so we know what good Italian food should taste like. We were really hoping to like this place because there's not a lot of really good Italian restaurants around to begin with, however we will not be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times and it's always fabulous, timely, and very well priced. They feature an $8 lunch menu that is perfect to run in for real quick and head back to the office. The salmon picatta is to die for! Not a lot of places thicken their sauces with corn starch, but they do here. Flour for me leaves a chalky after taste so it's nice to see a place that actually knows how to cook to let the natural flavors shine thru all on their own. Stone n Vine's kitchen clearly takes pride in their cooking. The bolognese is done by hand as well as the salad dressings and the divine tiramisu. On top of awesome food, the service is impeccable. My server was very attentive and asks about any additional accoutrements that I  would like with my meal so I don't have to wait for an extra wedge of lemon or additional parm for my pasta. This tells me that management actually trains their staff for a full dining experience. I personally do not drink booze, but they have a full bar menu that includes some fabulous looking martinis. They also have a great patio that is right on a little lake. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. We really love it from the bruschetta to the stuffed shrimp, pizza and other awesome entrees. The atmosphere, the people and the crowd they draw fantastic place."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. My husband is Italian and knows good Italian food. He said it tasted very good and was well made. I was disappointed in my salad that had oil as a dressing with no flavor. They then brought me a raspberry vinaigrette that was as thick as sour cream. Tasted OK. He had lasagna and unlike Olive Garden had to ask for grated cheese. Surprisingly instead of grating it fresh over his dish like most good Italian restaurants, he was brought a cheese shaker like you find on your table at Pizza Hut. They also didn't offer any fish dishes and their sides were only fries, salads and soup. No veggies, mashed or baked potatoes or anything else. The salad was ok, but the garlic knots were large and tasty.  The menu was very skewed toward appetizers salads and pizza. They need to add more entrees. It was one of those menus where you turn it over looking for more choices and find the blank back cover.   I was excited about happy hour and looked at the drink selection. Very disappointing.  I think there were 8 beers and 4 mixed drinks. The vodka in the fruity martini tasted like rubbing alcohol. And they forgot the olives for my husband's martini."}
{"text":"Fun date night spot while visiting in AZ. The selection of bruschetta was awesome and super tasty. Also recommend the fried ravioli. Thanks for the good food and good time!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Chandler! Their food is delicious along with all the different food options they have. Such a wide variety of menu items that will satisfy any appetite.  Also have a great happy hour for food and drinks. For brunch they have $15 for bottomless Bloodys & Mimosas"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I am also a tough critic of Italian food having moved here from NY and this place is pretty spot on.  The ambiance and service is on point. It's a solid location. The food was really good. We had the drunken shrimp appetizer as well as the bruschetta.  My wife had eggplant parm and I had linguini white clam sauce. Both were very good and authentic.  It's a very nice place and although sort of trendy and on the louder side, good for kids as well as its kind of noisy. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks & service. Had lunch yesterday & everything was great, from appetizers to drinks & dessert. We had enough leftovers for late Saturday dinner. Close enough to our home & yet a delightful experience comparable to any restaurants in Scottsdale or Phoenix. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I've had a number of their dishes and have never been disappointed. My boyfriend is gluten-free and I've had their gluten-free pasta and I have to say it's great. Definitely recommend this place for dinner and drinks. I'll be going back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went for Easter Sunday. We tried to make a res via the website but it said there was no availability. We called to double check and they were able to accommodate our party of 6.  They sat us promptly, even when half of the party came a little earlier then us.  We had our choice of the brunch menu or the dinner menu since it was a 2pm reservation.  The brunch deal is awesome! $15 for Bellini, mimosa or Bloody Mary and a penny charged per extra. So I paid a total of $15.03--for some tasty Bellinis!  I ordered the egg bruschetta with avocado, tomatoes and mozzarella. I ate the whole thing and it was a very generous portion! (It was my first meal of the day ok?! Lol) Very tasty.  They had the patio doors open and it was a great view with a cross breeze even! We got lucky on the day!  Mickey, our server, was great. Attending and took good care of us.  I can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great location! I love their brunch menu and the prices are unbeatable :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot for Italian in Chandler(Queen creek). Yay! Now I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale.  I have to start my review with dessert first, the Zeppoli and Tiramisu are phenomenal. I don't like the term foodgasm I think it's weird but the Zeppoli here....yeah foodgasm, light melt in your mouth, fried perfectly, and great sauces. I agree with many of the Yelp! reviewers the Tiramisu is the best. The espresso was also very good.  Alex was our server and she was fast, efficient, and friendly. We really felt welcome.  The food is always exceptional, everything we have ordered has met and exceeded our expectations. The bruschetta is made with high quality meats and cheeses and very flavorful. The Calamari was cooked to perfection. All the salads are fresh with tasty dressings and toppings, especially the Harvest and Kale. All the entrees are huge servings served hot. My favorites so far are the Veal Parmigiana, Gnocchi with Pesto, Tagliatelle with Bolognese, and Chicken Risotto.  I recommend sitting on the patio it's breathtaking.   FYI I read a Yelp! review that said the soda was flat and I disagree. I have had four Diet Cokes all were good. I also disagree with the negative Zeppoli review, our experience was different."}
{"text":"I had gone to the Scottsdale location a few times with clients and enjoyed it. So I decided to plan my wife's birthday party there. We had a big family gathering of 20. Called 2 days before to reserve a spot. No problems there. I kept telling the family how great the food was and we should have a great experience....Well, today was not to be the experience we hopped for. The wait staff seemed very unorganized. It took 15 minutes for my wife, kids and I to order a drink. We finally did, were served fairly quick then we went another 10-15 minutes without being seen by our waitstaff. We shrugged it off and ordered apps. A couple orders of Garlic knots, Calamari and an order of Meatballs. Garlic knots were good, Meatballs were not as good as The Scottsdale location and the calamari was under cooked and had to be sent back. They graciously brought us a new order and it was cooked properly and was average. Oh I forgot, they also never brought appetizer plates for us. So we had to flag down a busser from another table who handed us a pile of plates and we handed them around the table. During this period of time we hardly saw the waitstaff. See, I say waitstaff because we literally felt like we had part time staff assisting us. No consistency. Went long periods with empty glasses and if we wanted a drink we had to flag down someone to get us refills. Finally ordered our food and it took close to an hour to get our entrees.  When we did the servers placed the dishes and walked off without offering grated parm. A few of us had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get our meals while everyone else was served. Not one time did the staff come by to let us know it was taking longer or offer us refills or just a common courtesy apology for the delay. We had to approach the staff. Finally my wife, who's birthday it was asked to talk to the manager. The waiter was nice and asked if there was anything he could assist with, but by now we were past that. She graciously declined and asked to speak with the manager. She came by and apologized and basically said it's tough serving a group of our size....I called 2 days in advance and made reservations so that they could prepare for this. Our group size should have had no bearing on all of the lack of follow through that we experienced. I was a bit shocked that an Italian restaurant doesn't serve bread with apps or meals. What are you supposed to soak up the gravy with?! Anyhow, the manager took off a couple of meals that lacked and set us up with a wide array of deserts for the family. Totally appreciated that, but I Would have rather paid for desert than have the experience we had there on what was supposed to be a special night for my family. This place needs a tune up with the staff, the food was inconsistent with how they used to do things at the Shea Blvd local. I would like to give them a second try, but it will have to be with a small group and not during a typically busy time. Oh I had the veal parm. It was decent. Not the best I have had but I would order it again. I have had better service at The Olive Garden....."}
{"text":"Continues to disappoint... made reservations for 6 people and walk in and have to wait forever because as the hostess said, \"people aren't leaving their tables like we expected\"... huh? This isn't the first time this has been an issue here. Food is ok once it gets to you."}
{"text":"We came in with a 15 top on Monday night and everything was fabulous. I'm very picky about my penne alla vodka but it was so delicious! The waitresses were on point they have all our drinks right and out right away. They had all the food correct and all out at the same time, the atmosphere was great!! Will definitely recommend and be back! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Tried them for this first time today for lunch. Food was delicious. We had bruschetta and panini. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a nice spot that has a decent menu.  I really enjoyed the beet & burrata special, but the minestrone soup was not as impressive.  We sat outside on the patio that has a relaxing vibe with a pond nearby. If you're looking for a decent bottle of wine and a relaxing environment while in Chandler, try this spot out."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous night out on the patio with good friends.  The food was wonderful and the wine selections were very nice as well.  Service was perfect and such a wonderful atmosphere.  Made reservations through Yelp and that worked great.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Alexis was our server and she was great!  We were seated immediately upon entering and found the atmosphere to be awesome.  Nicely maintained place with enough elbow room to enjoy yourself.  There are plenty of TV's for those who enjoy keeping up with the latest games.  The food was very good!  I might argue that it's just a wee bit too pricey, but when I factor in the nice environment and the great service, I can get myself right on over that."}
{"text":"Amazing food ok/slow service. They really need more servers, ours had way too many tables and the poor girl was getting frazzled. I would have given this 3.5 stars but decided to up it because the food was really good and it was not the server's fault that the restaurant didn't schedule properly. More Vegan (Plant Based) appetizer and entree food options that are NOT salads would be a plus!"}
{"text":"Happy hour selection is diverse and well priced. The food is amazing ! Had the Fig&Goat cheese Bruschetta and the Sea Bass for main course . The Sea Bass is a five star meal . The people are very friendly. **Only ask would be Live music."}
{"text":"Left a lot to be desired.    Finally got a chance to come in for dinner. And I guess I had set my expectations a little high for what I ended up getting.  First off, the service was excellent so this review is more about the food then the service.  Friendly hostess and our server was excellent as well.   The food however was average at best.  I ordered the Rigatoni with Bolognese sauce and it was bland and lacking flavor. It tasted store bought. Not something I'd expect from a restaurant. I'd rather have pasta at Oreganos. Much more flavor and freshness there.  For the price the food quality was no where near what they are charging.    I might give it another shot and order something else as they have a decent happy hour hopefully next time the food will be better."}
{"text":"I had only been to Stone and Vine a couple times and last I was there about two years ago.  Last weekend my husband and I had date night there with another couple. The place was packed! We were lucky to get a table outside. The patio area was very nice and cozy. We got there a little bit before dusk and once the evening hit they put on several fire lamps and candle which I really loved! I don't remember the server's name but he was better than what we had in the past. You can tell he was busy but he was on-point checking in on our table. We only had bruschetta, garlic knots, a couple drinks and dessert - brownie with ice scream! The bruschetta was ok and everything else was good!  Will have to come back and try some entrees. Overall, I really like the ambience at this restaurant. The outdoor dining is probably one of the best in the area."}
{"text":"LOVE this place - great addition to the shopping area. Everything I have ever ordered has been delicious, service has always been great, atmosphere is a big plus whether inside or out in the patio over looking the water. You can not beat the lunch specials or the reverse happy hours. definitely is becoming a fast local favorite - recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a winner! I've only tried it via UberEats so far. To start, their Caprese is fantastic! Hand pulled mozzarella with fresh basil and tomatoes. I can't wait until heirloom tomato season is back, just missed that. The tuna tartare was one of the best I've ever had. They serve a nice heap of tuna, neatly sculpted into a mini tower atop avocado and tomato served with cucumber slices. So refreshing! And lastly, the spaghetti and meatballs is out of this world. Their meatballs are both full of flavor and delectably tender. I can't wait to experience the restaurant in person soon!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing service from Jalen! super kind and understanding. will be back to see him again! Thank you Jalen!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Can't say enough good things about it.  Food is great, service has always been Great, ambiance is great.  The only gripe I can possibly think of is that they don't have a bigger pizza.  All pizza's are a personal size, although it's a big personal size!  Meatball appetizer is legit, salads are good.  Lots of food come with each kids meal!  I mean really, what else can you ask for!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Stone & Vine often. This building is the location of our very first date over 6 years ago so it is very special to us and we love that it is still an Italian Restaurant. The service is always very good here and it's a full on team effort. The food is always piping hot and their portion sizes are perfect. We recommend taking advantage of their bottle of wine and pizza Monday night special. If you're looking for a family dinner, friendly happy hour, or a date night, then this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for dinner. We got the caprese (very bland, unripe tomatoes and missing EVOO) for an appetizer. My daughter got the kids spaghetti and meatball (super good), my husband got the Milan Chicken (bland and overcooked chicken) and I got margheritta pizza (not amazing....pretty soggy). My husband said we would come back again and give it another try sometime but we would definitely order different things. We really wanted this place to wow us but that didn't happen tonight."}
{"text":"Servers unable to articulate specials. And a little bitchy, to say the least. Don't go here ever."}
{"text":"So so disappointed today. Mothers Day and we had 3 mothers celebrating. We made reservations last week and obtained a copy of the \"brunch\" menu. How disappointed were we when seated and told that they were not serving brunch \"because the kitchen got overwhelmed.\"  The managers were too busy to talk to us. Nowhere to go but home.  My 95 year old mother was a trooper about it but I am so disappointed that our day was ruined. No matter how good food is - service and dependability is so important. You failed Stone and Vine by the bait and switch. Shame on you. You should have called us so we might have gotten reservations elsewhere. We were coming for brunch - not dinner at 1 pm."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite local places for happy hour and dinner. The atmosphere is lovely and we especially like sitting outside overlooking the water. I love Milan's Chicken and the Sangria is great on happy hour prices. My husband usually orders the mussels on the appetizer menu and orders bread to dip in the broth which he says is fabulous! The service has always been great!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  That was the opinion of everyone in our group.  Not great but it was edible.  It was also stone cold and soggy, mine and another Eggplant Parmesan that was ordered.  We all expected better.  I asked the waitress if they would substitute the linguine with the veggies.  She said yes.  The menu states that the linguini is included but veggies are extra.  Then, they ended up charging me for the veggies.  Another party member was likewise wrongly charged for the same substitution.  When I questioned it and reminded her that we did not get the linguini, that the veggies were substituted in place of it, the waitress knew very well that they do not substitute it but she lied.  She said they substitute it for $x.  That is not a substitution and she said nothing about charging when it was ordered.  I do not appreciate being lied to and manipulated. However, our refusal to pay for the \"substitution\", which she later reneged on was not pushed and, even though she had to speak to the manager to get the charge reversed, the veggie charges were refunded.  She was also unfamiliar with the menu, unfamiliar with other food questions and was pretty much a useless waitress.  In determining whether to ask about the substitution to begin with, I asked how the linguini was cooked and what came in it.  She did not even know that and had to ask.  Matter of fact, she knew nothing.  Newbie waitress and in the evening, one would expect outdoor heaters.  The patio got so cold as the evening wore on that I was shivering by the time we finished eating.  Good thing nobody wanted dessert.  I do not see another visit in the future.  Either does my husband.  He was unimpressed and as disappointed as I was.  Perhaps the Scottsdale location is better - I do not know but, one would expect consistent food and service in a chain.  I was going to give it two stars.  By the time I wrote this and thought more about the visit, considering all, Eek Methinks Not is more appropriate."}
{"text":"Great patio, drinks and food. Shared capers salad (beautiful), meatballs (softest I've ever eaten), garlic knots (great for dipping) and the mahi with gnocchi (menu doesn't lie, sauce is spicy and it's amazing). Huge portions so easy to share."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Loved the food! Loved the ambience, had my favorite wine by the glass and service by Joe was great! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow, such a meal! My family (of 4) went on a Thursday at happy hour and the place was a good amount full (a few empty tables, no wait). The atmosphere is a fancy casual with some office people and some retirees and several tables with kids.  We ordered an appetizer and entrées and everything tastes fresh and Italian. The wait staff was all very attentive and we cleared every plate that was put in front of us. I'd recommend this spot to any of my friends and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other night with the hubs and thought it was a pretty good meal.   First off, I really have to praise the waitress we had. She filled drinks like I've never seen before & boxed up the food we had left. She was pleasant without being too intrusive and quick without making us feel rushed. Can't speak higher for the staff.  Meal was good. Not great but still good. Hubs had the garlic knots for the appetizer and I tried the bruschettas. Date and Goat Cheese, Fig and Ricotta, Salami and Pesto, & Smoked Salmon. Fig and Ricotta & the Smoked Salmon were my favs but I do think the aioli on the was a little too think. It cut the taste of the salmon too much. The salami was a nice kind, maybe needed a little more pesto. I was a little disappointed with the date and goat cheese. I love both of those flavors but there wasn't near enough date flavor. Still, over all, tasted good. Hub like the knots but said it wasn't the best he'd ever had. Seeing as he's a bread guy, I guess he'd know.  For the entrees, he had the Five Cheese Ravioli and I had the Smoked Salmon Pasta. Hubs said it was good. Still not a wow but good. The salmon dish I had was a special. I tend to get those when we go out because I know it's what the chef is excited about doing. They said a creamy red sauce but it wasn't quite what I envisioned. I was seeing more cream in it but this was really just a red sauce with a Gemelli pasta. There were big chunks of salmon but the smoked flavor was totally lost in the sauce. It was good but not really what I was expecting.   For dessert we picked up a tiramisu and 2 mini cannoli's for the kids. Both were decent but not the best I've had.   Over all, good meal. Not the best and nothing quite what it should be but still a good meal. Loved the staff though but that's just not enough for me to bump this to a 4."}
{"text":"Can't believe it has taken me this long to get here as it is right down the road.  Really enjoyed my lunch.  Gluten-free pasta that wasn't too chewy.  Delicious vodka sauce with tender flavorful chicken.  A real Caesars' salad.  Solid service."}
{"text":"We've been going for about a year now, once or twice a month and an occasional to go pizza.  The salads, pasta and risotto are good choices.  We always order the bruschetta and all are so good our biggest decision is which to order that day.  Service is always good even when crowded, even the bus staff are polite and efficient.  Lately we have been ordering from their \"Chalkboard Specials\"  Delicious!  We often order 2 bruschetta plates and then split an entree, the first time we did this we were pleasantly surprised that the kitchen split the entree for us!  This continues and is very nice.  Only 4 stars because when we call in an order it is seldom correct, always something slightly wrong.  Nothing devastating, wrong portion size, wrong name, missing pizza topping,  but its happened often enough that I expect it but still make the call.  The quality of the food makes up for the slight inconvenience."}
{"text":"Great food.  Everything I have tried here has been fantastic.  Egg plant, Sausage and Peppers, Salad, Veal.  Can't go wrong. Always want to go back."}
{"text":"We just found this place and have been there 3 times already. So nice to sit on the patio near the water. The Meatballs with arugula were to die for.  My husband loves the Stella on tap."}
{"text":"Great overall impression. The atmosphere is very inviting coupled with friendly service. You could come here for a casual meal with friends, on a date, or even dress up and have a quality meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"We had a great time trying out this new spot. We came in for happy hour, where apps, bruschetta, pizza, and some drinks are discounted. Our server Alexis was outstanding. I got the red sangria, which was fantastic, and my boyfriend got a Stella Artois. We got meatballs and garlic knots for appetizers, and both were delicious but we both liked the meatballs better. We also got a pesto chicken pizza which was great. Every dish was very fresh and straight-from-the-oven smoking hot, which I love. During happy hour, the total for 2 apps, 1 pizza, and 4 drinks was less than $50. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great!  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  The patio was delightful!  My husband and I enjoyed a bottle of Argentina wine that was good.  The bruschetta was just ok; we tried 4 different varieties and not one of them really stood out as fantastic.  My parents shared a pizza that they said was delicious.  I had 2 cups of soup...pasta e fagioli and cheddar broccoli.  I could definitely make better at home.  My husband had chicken parm; he said it was meh!  Surely wouldn't be my first choice to go back to for the food; it was pretty standard run-of-the-mill restaurant food."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 630 and we were not seated till 650. The cocktails we got were not so good. I had 3 of their specialty cocktails and I just was not feeling them at all. Waitress was sweet, we never waited long for anything, our food was delicious and that's why I'm giving 3 stars.  We had the meatballs and bruschetta. I'll be going back for the food alone, maybe next time we will be seated on time and I think I'll stick to wine."}
{"text":"Short rib over risotto is worth the visit!!! Plenty of other incredible choices but this dish was so good we went back two days in a row for it!  The atmosphere is great and such a nice spot in south Chandler for families and friends."}
{"text":"First time at the Stone and Vine, very good food atmosphere was good casual.  Service was good overall a very good experience I would defiantly go back again."}
{"text":"Stone & Vine is awesome! If you are looking to host an event they have a separate room with  all amenities available to you like music, food, etc. They will even allow you to arrange the tables for specific functionality and bring in your own decor. We hosted a bridal shower here over the weekend and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!   Upon arrival, the staff immediately began helping us set up and made sure we were fully accommodated before leaving us to do our thing. Matthew, one of the servers, was great at checking in on us periodically, and he even let us use his hot spot on his phone because their wifi was unexpectedly down! Without him, our party would have had no music which would have totally sucked. The food and drinks were also great.  If you are considering hosting an event and don't know where to go, 100% book with Stone & Vine and you will be thankful you did!"}
{"text":"Really great addition to South Chandler food scene - we needed a delicious Italian place and this hip, but traditional food with flair delivers well! I got the chicken parmesan = one of the best that I've ever had. Pizzas  solid, even the sides were good. Friendly, fast service and a cool setting means that I really want to come back!"}
{"text":"We had our baby shower at Stone and Vine on Sunday, July 9th and everything was perfect!  The food, the wait staff and especially Amanda Fearon, Director of Operations, did not disappoint.  I highly recommend having your next event at Stone and Vine, Chandler."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for a nice dinner. Great service and atmosphere for people who like to have fun. Only down side was my panini came on pita bread, which was not put on the menu. Pita bread tastes pretty bad in my opinion, but with the ingredients they used I was able to stomach it and still say I had a great time!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food! It would be great if they offered love music even if it was just a one man acoustic guitar etc. It would add to the experience for sure!"}
{"text":"Great location love the patio.  We usually go for happy hour great selection of wines on their happy hour good service"}
{"text":"Had late lunch there recently. I had house soup with spaghetti and meatballs. Food is good but service was a bit lacking. No crackers with soup or any bread with entree. The place was recently renovated but nothing special. Chairs a bit uncomfortable. No manager seemed to want to stop by and ask how the meal was. I only mentioned this since this is a new opening. Manager is a women walking around with tight slacks and never made any suggestion that she cared about your experience. The bartender was also serving out in the patio. Service needs improved and manager needs to get involved with customers.  The food was fine and the bartender seems to be holding things together barely. A bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is so clean and the service was amazing! The remodel took a while, but it's so nice inside. Appetizers we tried: Mussels and Meatballs. Mussels were tender, broth was SO delicious, by far the BEST my wife has ever had!! Meatballs, a must try!! Pizza was thin, crispy, and ingredients were fresh. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari, bruschetta, chicken pesto pizza and the zeppoles. The calamari was pretty good...it had great flavor and a nice kick to it with the peppers. The bruschetta was absolutely amazing... my fave was the salami and prosciutto. The bruschetta combinations were very flavorful. Lo The pizza was delish. The crust was soft, chewy and crispy at the same time... just the way it should be. We ordered the zeppoles for dessert and they were a bit disappointing as  they were pretty greasy. Overall, my hubby and I enjoyed the vibe and food."}
{"text":"Great chicken pesto pizza! Also there is a wide variety of specialty boards. The patio has a beautiful view as well."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is good. Wine glasses need to be cleaned better. Air conditioning wasn't working everyone including employees were miserable."}
{"text":"Our new favorite neighborhood restaurant hands down.  Easy to give it a 5, nothing to dislike.   Food, Ambiance, Staff all fantastic!"}
{"text":"We went for HH and wanted to try out dinner with a mailer coupon. The server was attentive and bubbly. It's a great space, however, the pizzas were a little less than average. After ordering the Chianti and this new recommend red blend, we tried the Tuscan salad, prosciutto and fig pizza and the Diavolo pizza. Our wine was tasty and priced very well ($5-&7)  Back to the pizza: too much arugula on the fig pizza and not enough cheese. For the Diavolo which is a spicy salami pizza, there was not enough sauce and it was pretty bland. My date commented and said that he felt like he liked the pizza at Sauce more than their pizza. And at a heck of smaller bill, I would agree.   Out of everything, the salad was the best. Great bacon flavor and crunch...the cherry tomatoes were sweet and fresh. Ordering the small was enough to split between 2 people. With the mailer: 3 glasses of wine, small salad and 2 signature pizzas, our bill including tip was ~$50.   Service was a plus and salad was a plus but if the place is supposed to be a modern Italian restaurant, think we will pass on Stone and Vine...especially since we tried their pizzas."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar as it was pretty empty for lunch. Had the salami pizza add pepperoni. It was above average. The bartender advised to get the pizza extra crispy and I think I will take that advice next time."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hour and they had some good lunch specials for 8 dollars. I had an excellent chicken panini and a salad for a good price. The food came quick and was filling. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is a good choice for casual Italian with a nice atmosphere. Outdoor and indoor dining and the outdoor patio is on a pond. Good food good wine selection and friendly helpful staff. My favorite dish is the braised short rib on risotto. Melt in your mouth tender with great flavor. The Risotto is excellent also. Lots of menu choices and they are all good. It's popular and if you don't want to wait a long time they do take reservations. Prices are reasonable. If you have never been there, give it a try. I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch. Pretty busy inside but nice atmosphere has a really nice patio seating area. Got the garlic knots as an appetizer very good! Got the margarita pizza with sausage on it super yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp scampi!!   Service great good food great company what more could you ask for???"}
{"text":"The place was busy and service was slow but the staff was friendly. Not a quiet setting but good for families and groups. The bruschetta was delicious and the entrees were average but nothing special. I'd go back and give them another try.  Gave them another try with a group of six celebrating an anniversary. We sat outside which was very nice. All appetizers were delicious and service was good. They gave us happy hour prices on bottles of wine. All of our entrees were very good. The salads seemed small until you try to finish them. We are going back."}
{"text":"I've been now twice and both times were great. They have an amazing playlist, great environment. The patio wasn't too hot both times we ate outside and was nice eating with a view with the background music. Both waitresses we had were attentive and gave good recommendations. The food was also great!"}
{"text":"Okay. Service was great!  Food was a bit over priced and very small pour for a glass of wine!!! Great ambiance!  Need to drop entree prices down a bit!   Again. Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Best meal we've had in years!  We have eaten at some of the most expensive restaurants in the valley over the last 30 years, so we know. The service, depth of menu, taste, & ambiance is right up there.  Food is service quicker than most places. There on Sat night, granted 5 PM, but prom night and every think was timely.  Would highly recommend the Brochette. (sp?). Osso Bucco  & Halibut dishes were excellent. Should probably classed as $$$, but when you have a special celebration, consider this place if in the east valley."}
{"text":"I think this is a great location and very clean, open atmosphere. But the food itself is not fantastic. I had the penne vodka which did not feel special, like the sauce could have been store bought. My mom got the chicken parmesan which was not good at all. This is the second time I tried it and I was not very impressed either time. You could go to Olive Garden and you would get similar quality food for a lower price."}
{"text":"Great good and service! The best eggplant parmesan and linguini with white clean sauce. Desserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I grew up on Italian food (New York) and it's pretty authentic for what little I've had here. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and always checked on me. I came during a lunch special which lasts quite some time and is fantastically priced. I stop by the complex for work often and I'll definitely be eating here again and again. Additionally, the ambience and decorations are awesome. Cheers to the young waitress for the suggestions and service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meatball appetizer, and the pan seared chkn with asparagus and avocado. Very few Gluten Free options."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Stone & Vine.  We made a dinner reservation on Yelp for a Wednesday evening.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and were promptly seated after being greeted by the hostess.  The restaurant has a very nice ambiance that I would describe as modern and trendy.  It is also well appointed and very clean.  There is an outdoor patio area that looked really cool, although we dined inside.  Overall ambiance - 5/5.    We ordered a Bruschetta Board, Calamari Fritti, Chef Salad, Godfather Pizza, Penne Vodka with Shrimp, and Five Cheese Ravioli.  We thought the pizza was excellent with exceptional flavors and a crispy thin crust - we actually ordered a second pizza because the first was so good.  The calamari and salad were just average, and the two pasta dishes and bruschetta were good.  Our favorite bruschetta was the mushroom, goat cheese, and truffle oil.  We had wine with dinner and the selection was adequate.  Portion size is above average on most dishes and pricing is fair.  Overall food rating - 4/5.    The service was pretty good although the server was a little slow with drink refills and didn't make quite the connection with the table as I would have liked.  Overall service - 3.5/5.  The group enjoyed our dinner and would be interested in dining here again.  Next time we'd like to try a few different selections from the menu, and maybe dine on the patio.  We've also heard good things about the weekend brunch and would like to give this a try at some point as well."}
{"text":"What a nice find! We were driving through on the way to Sedona and this place had good reviews. This family of 5 picky eaters did not complain. The portions were more than enough and we rolled out of the door. From pizza to lasagna to soup and 3 appetizers...all were full of flavor, cooked wonderfully and pleasing to the eye. And the service was immaculate! Beautiful ambiance for date night or a family dinner. I would love to come back for a romantic evening on the patio at sunset by the outdoor fire. Very clean and all around wonderful! Matt you were very attentive along with the rest of the staff. Thanks for a great evening.  I am a bit of a wine snob and tried several whites on the menu that were not to my liking but this will not deter me from returning, not even a bit."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food was really good. I wasn't sure what to expect as I remember the place before this one, but this is definitely a step up. We had the calamari which tasted nice and fresh. The pasta was cooked just right. Portions were pretty big so we didn't make it to desert. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First time here. Horrible service. Waited over 15 mins to get anyone to stop at our table. Had to go to hostess to complain. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for happy hour on a Monday. The happy hour specials are just ok, 2.00 off appetizers and pizza and a few drink specials.  We ordered a pizza with procuitto, arugula and shaved parmesan and it was fantastic! Also had the caprese salad which we thought was good.  Minus one star for the sangria, it did not taste good at all.  I will definitely keep coming back for the pizza tho."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the staff! I hosted in my wedding rehearsal dinner here. It was fairly priced, great service, great atmosphere and the food was impressive! My husband and I continue to come here at least once a week. The happy hour is amazing as well. Xoxo!  Se you soon stone and vine"}
{"text":"Amazing service wine and happy hour everyday a must stop for music friends and eats......excellent daily specials"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful on the inside!! ...And then there's the food. Lol. My friend and I went here for dinner. It was a Sunday night and pretty dead so we were seated right away. The bar area is nice but we opted for a table. It had nice views overlooking the lake BUT, anyone that knows Ocotillo knows that smell is NOT so nice! Even with the misters on, it's a hundred degrees outside. I'm not sure why they kept the large patio doors open. So anyway, the atmosphere was great. Candles lit and dim lighting. Could be very romantic and posh but, instead of Bocelli or Sinatra they were playing Smashmouth and Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was so \"off\" for this type of establishment. What made it even more awkward, was our waitress kept dancing and signing near us like we were in a club. Not very professional for such a nice place but again, whatevs. The wine list was not impressive at all. In fact, we both had a really hard time deciding because there was so little to pick from. I mean, I've seen a couple of these bottles at Target, come on. Since you can order by the glass, we did since buying a bottle of something they had was just not going to be an option.   I ordered the chicken vodka penne. My friend ordered the Godfather pizza and we had a Caesar salad. Right away when the food came out, we both kind of looked at each other surprised and he said to me, \"Uh, that was fast. There's no way they cooked that pasta just now\" I agreed. The pasta sauce was great but the chicken was dry and I kept thinking, it was like it was made for something else and they just cut up and tossed it in my penne. The salads were delish though! I had a couple bites of his pizza. It was pretty good too. I would probably go here again just to see if my experience would be different and to try something else, but it's definitely not living up to it's potential."}
{"text":"Great location for Ocotillo dining. It's a charming place has a very cozy yet modern feel to it.  The patio is awesome with the water and lighting. Good wine selection, food is above average.  Service could be a little better.  Takes a while to get a drink or put in your food order.  Not terrible. But could use some efficiency."}
{"text":"Loved it! Pizza was amazing service was fantastic! Will definitely be back! Calamari was so delicious and fresh and sausage on pizza was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Ambiance was nice but loud . Had the short ribs which were tender,moist & very tasty as was the Rizzoto that came with it. For dessert we shared a large piece of Terimesu which was also very tasty. Even though the restaurant was packed , our server  Kevin took care of us in a timely fashion with the help of another young man whose name I don't know."}
{"text":"The gold standard for brunch! If there were a test, to certify a venue for brunch accreditation, Stone & Vine wouldn't just have passed it, they'd have written the book on it! Staff, service, food, and location just all come together so perfectly, 5 stars simply is not enough. The breakfast panini and bellini is a favorite of mine and my fellow brunch going friends! If you're passing by or want to try something new, Stone & Vine is where it's at! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Dinner with family and we all had an excellent meal. This is a casual but contemporary eatery with a combination of traditional and updated takes on many dishes. Our party was seated quickly and we were greeted, given water and menus promptly. Drink orders taken and delivered in no time. By the way they have Happy Hour everyday and it was still going when we arrived at 7pm.  Food arrived prmptly. The bruchetta selection (a choice of 4 toppings) was great. The bread was very good and we had a variety of toppings that included traditional tomatoes, figs and ricotta, pears and ricotta and crispy prosciutto and arugula. All toppings were great. Main courses included spaghetti and meatballs, chicken panini, pizza and my dish which was a seafood risotto. The risotto was loaded with mussels, clams, shrimp and scallops in a tomato-based sauce. It was wonderful and I'll order this again. All the other dishes were enjoyed.  Great place, excellent service, rand reasonable prices equals a satisfied and repeat customer."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and hot. We ordered the eggplant parmigiano, gnocchi, and chicken picatta.  Service was excellent also. The patio is the best place to sit for dinner except during the summer.  All seats inside look out through the wall of glass to the patio which is so nice."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Great ambiance the servers are amazing and the bartenders make em right! The owners are great guys. Now let's talk good food!! Braised short rib over Risotto amazing.  All the pasta dishes are wonderful their Arbiatta and vodka sauces are spot on and portions are healthy. Appetizers, sausage and peppers yum and the Caprese salad is solid!! I consider myself a Tiramisu freak and S&V's is a perfectly balanced desert. So with that enjoy and I guarantee once you go you will come back again and again."}
{"text":"We just walked out of the restaurant. Unfortunately, I have to downgrade the rating for this place from 4 to 3 star after my 2nd visit. The service was not nearly as good as the first time I was here. The waiter was nice, but he did not ask us once for refill nor giving us a glass of water during our entire meal. The food was average. I ordered one of my favorite Italian dish, Linguini with fresh claim in white wine sauce. The clam meat portion was generous, but I did chew on sand in it every now and then.  Due to the disappointing service, I am not too sure if I want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner at Stone & Vine with my family last week. Bruschetta was great and my wife and I split a Chicken Parmigiana. The place was jumping on a weeknight, felt like a weekend. Great to see this restaurant thriving in the South Chandler area. Keep up the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I have been going here once a week since they opened. The staff is great, the food is good and the atmosphere is good for all ages."}
