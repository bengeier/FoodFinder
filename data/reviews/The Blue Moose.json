{"text":"Game day and the place was packed. Drinks were fast but food a little slow. Girls waiting tables apologized 5x for the wait and offers to buy a round. Food was great and service really not that slow."}
{"text":"This is another place that is close to my work so I go here fairly often.   The service, almost without exception, is lacking. If I'm with a big group, the service is generally pretty good. If I come here by myself or in a group of two (which is usually the case), the service is spotty at best. One of the waiters - a blond guy - is really bad about forgetting about his tables. I think this might be because he is also the bartender...?   Anyway, the food is pretty good for a sports bar. I usually get either the Chef Salad (huge! and delicious), Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad (huge! and mouth-wateringly good), Bleu Cheese Burger (they drown it in bleu cheese so be prepared!), or one of their wraps (eh. nothing special). The salads are really where it is at because you get a LOT of food for a decent price.   I've also had their desserts once or twice. The strawberry shortcake is fantastic! LOADS of fresh strawberries... yum!   Quick Tip: Watch out if you ask for an additional dressing as they charge $0.50 for it!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at The Blue Moose after the Parada del Sol Parade on Saturday, February 11th for lunch, drinks and live music: The Dave Dodt Band!  We had great service too from Karen!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"NY Giants meet up place to watch games during football season. Good food and affordable drinks and a decent amount of tvs."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at the Blue Moose.  I live very close and have been meaning to check it out far sooner than I did.  On a lazy Sunday, my husband and I decided to head over to watch NFL football.  Unfortunately, our viewing time was cut short by a pushy waitress.  She did not seem amused by the fact that we obviously were planning to stay the duration of the Vikings game.  Though we had ordered numerous drinks, apps, and 2 entrees, we still felt like we were a nuisance to her.    I don't think it is crazy to want to watch a non-locally aired game in its entirety, but I guess it is here.  Blue Moose was not busy and there were several open tables.  Sadly, the food was forgettable and service was poor.  I don't think I will be giving this joint another shot."}
{"text":"Great scene here, but, the food is 'Sisco cheap' low grade dog food! Also, they are extremely wasteful . . . which is a category that I'm going to consider for Yelp."}
{"text":"Only gave them one star because i had to. Placed an order i never got, placed it again then got only half of it and the half i got was wrong. When i complained,i was called rude! Don't come here on football day, understaffed :("}
{"text":"Besides being close to the stadium, The Blue Moose is also right in between the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center and the free parking garage, so it's a perfect place to stop before taking in an event at SPAC.  It's quite large inside as is it's outdoor wrap-around patio so even when it's busy it's easy to find a spot to sit. The place is conducive to all ages, even little kids and older folks.The food is amazingly inexpensive and very tasty. I had a veggie quesadilla which was loaded with cheese and vegetables and definitely enough for 2 people at only $6.99. The sodas are less than two bucks which was a surprise. The food is brought out quickly even when the place is slammed.  The only reason I gave it just 3 stars is because the service is horrible (with the exception of the cook being speedy). It makes no difference if it's slow or busy, the service is bad (and there are plenty of waitstaff when it is packed anyway.) Theresa S mentioned that she found the service to be lacking if she is by herself or in a party of two, as opposed to the service being good when she's in a large group. I've been there and seen that! The servers and bartenders are polite but not especially friendly. You have to hunt them down or wave frantically (even if you're at the bar) to get them to notice you need a menu, you need to order, you need something else, you need your check etc. Be prepared to not get silverware or napkins, they always seem to forget to bring those. What is really bizarre is when you have to ask for those items and there's two of you at the table, be aware you have to make it clear you need TWO sets of silverware and TWO napkins, otherwise you are only brought one of each while your guest sits there having to use their fingers to eat and wipe their mouth with their sleeve."}
{"text":"I've never been to Scottsdale and was recommended this bar, near my hotel. I'm a very social person so I didn't mind that the first night was pretty slow. Me and Eric, (great Bartender) passed the time.  So I came for lunch the next day, and The beautiful Miss Gretchen was behind the bar. And she made sure I had all the pineapple I needed. And helped do the crossword with me, too. The menu looked great, I just wasn't that hungry. Great selection of beers on tap. A pool table, and a killer jukebox! There were plenty of T.V.'s and I had a wonderful view the whole time, thank you Gretchen!!!"}
{"text":"Not gluten free friendly on game day.  Was ignored by numerous staff. Asked if they could make nachos (on regular menu) and they had queso gauc salsa plate but \"too busy to whip up nachos\". Poor service around. Wouldn't return here before a game."}
{"text":"If you like sports bars/ restaurants you'll love this place. During spring training lots of Giants fans hang out here and the food is great. There is lots of different types of draft beer and the service is excellent. My wife and I went there a couple of days ago and at this time of year there isn't a lot of activity in that area of town. Even at this time of year the food is great."}
{"text":"I come here once a week and really look forward to it!  I've had the soup/salad combo, the Canadian hamburger, the chili cheese dog, and HUGE chicken Cesar salad.  All of the dishes are huge (try the tuna melt!) and the wait staff is always friendly.  It's laid back and a great place to come with friends to hang out :)"}
{"text":"Patio seating or inside with nice big windows all around. Great place to hear a band!  We had coronas w/limes, relaxed at a high top and listened to Big Nick & The Gila Monsters play. We sat inside but doors were open to the patio. A cool, laid back feel."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good times!!  Chili cheese tators were great and filling!!  But what I want to know is where I can get their moose t-shirts.  I won't be in Scottsdale anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for football and spring training. There are plenty of TVs and the food is awesome. My favorites are the Texas Tater Tots, the Volcano wings, and the Grande Quesadillas. The volcano wings aren't so unbearably hot you can't enjoy them and the Texas Tater tots are a meal in tater tot mountain form but SO good. I have been coming to this location for football mostly on Sundays and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"A very good, non-apologetic, old school beer and burger bar that is quite enjoyable.  The Vegan, gluten-free, micro-brew snob crowd should steer clear. This place may soil your adult diapers."}
{"text":"The Blue Moose is a great place to watch a sporting event and have a drink.  The food is fresh with great taste and large portions.  They provide great customer service.  This bar is my home on Sundays!  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Blue Moose is a fun place to go to hang out with friends and enjoy some good conversation and some decent food. I have been going off and on to the \"Moose\" for almost 6 years. The staff is friendly and the service is great and the food is average for being a bar. Try the crispy chicken wrap if you are a fan of chicken. It has this tasty sauce, lettuce,  tomato, and cheese as well as warm chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla. I like it because you do not have to get  the chicken fried if you do not care for  the extra calories. They offer it grilled if you request it and it  is good either way! The outdoor patio is a nice place to sit and relax when we are beyond the summer months. This place is a bar but not very crowded the majority of the time and a nice  place to go to have a nice romantic evening with your honey or  just hang with your buddies over some ice cold beers. The place is only loud during the month of March when spring training is taking place. Yes, please bring back the shuffleboard table. I  miss it also and it was a popular gaming piece for all to play and enjoy!"}
{"text":"For a sports bar, the food is pretty good. The owner seems to be the one in charge of making everything and I think he does a good job. Everything seems fresh enough. I love the nachos, potato skins, chicken tenders, edamame, and my boyfriend enjoys the club sandwich and burger. My only complaints are that the buns on the burgers should be toasted, and fries should be available (not just kettle chips) as a side. I wish there was more of a buzz when we go too... It's always pretty dead. But it's still one my go to places for watching games!"}
{"text":"I've been going to The Blue Moose for almost 2 years and the service is excellent. This is a family run sports bar and the owners and workers treat their customers with respect. Though it is super busy during the day, after 7:00 pm or 8:00 pm it is nice and quiet for those who just want to relax with a cold beer. Ideal place for couples, and those if they come by themselves to wind down after a long days of work. There used to be a pool table, but with a nice patio, dozens of TVs to watch sports, and a jukebox, it compensates. The Blue Moose is ideally located right across from the Civic Center of which you can meet a lot of new people from town, or out of town who usually come here after shows and events. No wonder I keep coming back, this place is my chill hangout..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The bathrooms are from 1996 and have not been cleaned since 1997. The manager is rude. The staff is horrible. And if you saw the kitchen you would call the police!!!  Do yourself a huge favor and STAY AWAY!!!! There are so many better options just a stones throw away. Can not find a worse place to eat within 500 miles."}
{"text":"LOCATION: The convenience of the location if you are going to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts is unparalleled. You walk out the door, walk about 10 steps, and there it is. They also have outdoor seating, which is nice on a comfortable evening. However, the tables were too high for dining. I felt like I was 7 years old, trying to eat at the grown-ups table. :D  MY FOOD: I had the Pear, Blue Cheese and Pecan Salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was good, not outstanding. The pear was pleasantly thin and sweet, but the salad was about 20% shredded carrots (too much for my liking), light on the blue cheese, and scarce on the pecan pieces. (These were not even 1/4 pecans. They were the bits that fall to the bottom of the bag, scraps.)  OTHER FOOD: My boyfriend ordered loaded tater tots and potato skins for everyone to share. I had a handful of tots to negate the healthiness of my salad. (haha) They were good. The bite of potato skin I had was over-done.  DRINKS: The drink selection was fair, about 12 - 15 beers and  8 mixed drinks. I was the D.D. so I had lemonade, but my boyfriend enjoyed his Mules.  SERVICE: Um, rude. My boyfriend asked for a spoon so we could easily share the tater tots without using licked forks or dropping toppings on the table. The server said with an annoyed glare, \"There's silverware right there.\" My boyfriend politely said, \"I was wanting a spoon\" (which, incidentally, was not included in anyone's silverware roll). The server continued with his glare that I usually only see come from a teenager's eyes as he flatly repeated, \"There's silverware right there.\" Someone finally said we could use her fork, since she was only having a drink.  He was also rude to the other guest who asked for clarification regarding ordering drinks after the kitchen closes.  The restaurant was almost empty (only 4 other customers); so it wasn't like the server was overwhelmed. He did come back regularly to ensure we had drinks, but he was obviously really unhappy to be there. I can appreciate his frustration. He was a bartender/server with a restaurant of 8 people on a Friday night in Scottsdale. He was hoping for more money. However, that doesn't change the facts of his rude service.  PRICE POINT: Very reasonable. My salad (without meat) was $9.99. Adding chicken would have been an extra $3. I didn't look closely at other items, though.  OTHER: Beware that the kitchen closes at 10:00, and the whole restaurant at 11:00.   BOTTOM LINE: I would probably come here again if we were going to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts because it's just so convenient. However, I would look for another restaurant within walking distance for a future visit."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick work day lunch. Really nice service and good menu options. All four of us were pleased with our lunch choices and the server did an awesome job keeping up with refills and other service needs. Would totally go back for lunch again, even if the moose is sad."}
{"text":"Not the best sports bar but nice patio. TVs too small for the size of the place. Avoid Sunday football, not well set up for breakfast or coffee."}
{"text":"Have to update my review every year. They have some new football specials and I liked the $5 domestic pitcher deal. The bar has more Giants fans now, so if your a fan, get there 30 minutes before kickoff. The also have new food specials, but I'm not sure they are so special in terms of prices. In fact, the same exact bacon, egg croissant sandwich went up two bucks this year to $9. Other specials have prices that are what they normally would be priced or maybe a buck less. Still, the food is good and it's a good atmosphere (at least during Giants games). Go Big Blue."}
{"text":"Best sports bar in Old Town and a great place for a drink before a Giants game and a quick walk to the stadium before (and after)."}
{"text":"This was a nice place in the heart of Old-town Scottsdale. I went out there with a couple friends just to eat, take pictures, and relax on our time away from home. The food was OKAY.  As an appetizer we got the nachos, which were actually pretty good! But, the salsa, not exactly up to par.   As my meal, I got the patty melt. To say the least, not impressed. It was OK.   Our waitress didn't seem to care much about us while we were there, and I feel like it was because we didn't order any drinks, so our table price would be down. Nonetheless, everything was on time, and when we needed something we were helped, even if it was with an attitude.   A different gentleman however, Greg, was really friendly. We were looking to go do something after our meal, and he recommended to us a few places where we would go enjoy. Props to him for being patient with us, because we were really unsure what we were up to :) !   Would not recommend for just food."}
{"text":"Great sports bar to go to if you are in Scottsdale area- especially during Spring Training! All the waitresses are hot and very personable as well....Food isn't anything special but what sports bar does?!! Only a few blocks away from Scottsdale Stadium so great place to go and celebrate after the Giants win!"}
{"text":"The Blue Moose has a great location, right across from the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts, and within the Scottsdale Civic Center/Library area, just a few steps away from Old Town Scottsdale. However, that is where its advantages end. Yesterday, my (adult) son and I stopped by for a drink and a something to eat -- a burger, to be precise. We rode bikes all the way up from Tempe on the Greenbelt trail, and were thus both thirsty and hungry. I had promised my son a good place to go for a burger -- intending to take him to Blue Moose, as I had been to Blue Moose a few times before over the years. \"The veggie burger is really great,\" I told him -- \"Let's get that!\" The way I remember it, it was every bit as thick and juicy as a beef burger, with a fresh warm bun and lots of lettuce, tomato, cheese, and pickle. Well, it had lettuce, cheese, tomato, and pickle, but the so-called burger itself was about 1/8 inch thickness, and way less that the circumference of the bun; in fact it was kind of hidden within all the toppings.  It was not good (but we ate it anyways because hungry, had to ride all the way back home, and didn't want to make the waitress Andrea have to do re-work, at least not at first). It was not bad, but it was not worth the $9.00, and was nothing like the way they used to make this burger -- it used to be a stand-out -- and we are not even vegetarians.  The french fries were acceptable, hot, plentiful. The service was friendly, but when we did ask Andrea about the burger being not up to standards, she went to talk with her manager, and then came back with non-information that they had not changed recipes, or something like that. She did not offer to remove it from the tab, but did offer another beer. Long story short, as infrequently as we go out, it should be really good where we go to splurge on a simple thing like a burger, veggie or otherwise.  Sorry Blue Moose, we will not be 'herding' from you again."}
{"text":"Sooo, I'm a fan of The Blue Moose... not necessarily a sports fan, though. Lol. Although the day I went there to meet some friends, there was a football game on (and forgive me if I piss off all the die-hard sports fanatics out there; not my intention), and when the blue team scored (yes, this is the extent of my sports knowledge), they gave the whole bar free blue jello shots! Awesomeness!!!   I did notice, however, how united everyone was at The Blue Moose -- it was like you walked into a friend's Superbowl party -- it felt like everyone there was family, which was pretty darn awesome in itself."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar atmosphere, ordered the nachos for our appetizer, generic flavor not bad, but not spectacular. Same with our main course."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great, have not had one thing on menu that I didn't like or want again. They have great beer on tap, Try the Moose Hefeweizen....  The atmosphere is fun and the bartenders Rock! Kelly, Eric and Gray are always so accomidating and make you feel at home. It has quickly become my \"local\" hang out! A must all year long!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some drinks after baseball. Had a good selection and were friendly! Drinks were good, bartender and owner were nice, everything was just fine! Would stop back again."}
{"text":"I love the Blue Moose! This family run establishment is one of my favorite places in old town. Great people and great service. Maria was the best server!"}
{"text":"Service is unbelievably good here. We never went more than 5 minutes without being checked on. In addition to the service the music was great. Perfect spot to hang with your friends and watch sports games!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool bar because it is convenient if you are in the old town Scottsdale area and it seems that the crowd of people that go here know each other. The bar is great and the service is friendly. However, the food I ordered here on several occasions was pretty bad. In sum, great if you want to grab a drink but not if your hungry and going to eat."}
{"text":"If you are going to Giants spring training, you must stop here before and/or after the game for some pre/post game time!  This is a huge bar for Scottsdale, with a great outdoor  patio.The bar is tucked away behind the parking structure, near the Scottsdale Center for the Arts -  it's definitely worth finding.  Good vibe, interesting mix of people.  They have an awesome beer selection, I love going here and trying new beers and seeing what's on tap.  Probably one of the best selections in Old Town.   The food is good too and there are lots of options - even some decent healthy options (hummus and veggies appetizer is my go-to!)  or you can get the tater tots...mmm!   My suggestion, stop by the Blue Moose on your way to Spring Training.  Then come back, have a few more - and then you'll just walk around the corner, hit the Old Town Tavern for a beer, meander on over to the Grapevine and end up at Pattie's and it's a great Old Town bar crawl!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a beer, but even though they were pretty busy--as it was noon--the owner and his son both made a point of saying hello to my boyfriend and I. Their craft beer selection was pretty good and reasonably priced. If we weren't in a hurry, would've loved to have had some of their food!"}
{"text":"Walk into The Blue Moose around 4:00 pm on a Saturday in March and it'll be hard to find a seat. Why you ask? Because this hidden dive is a spring training hot spot and for several good reasons.   I like The Blue Moose because it's off the beaten path and nestled in the Civic Center park. It's pretty much your typical dive bar. You can spend a good amount of time playing pool or watching sports on one of the 10+ flat screens. Oh and did I mention the specials? Try, $8 for a bucket (4 to a bucket) of domestic beer. And for imported, it's only $12 for a bucket. Not bad right? They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers. Typical bar food, but you don't have to be blacked out to enjoy it. I love that I can eat and drink here and not go into overdraft protection along the way.   The Blue Moose is awesome for large groups due to the selection of indoor and outdoor space. The bar was recently the start and finish line for a 5k around town and a good 100+ people gathered here with plenty of room leftover for the other visitors.   So whether you want to stop by after spring training, enjoy a couple drinks with friends or shoot some pool and watch the game, The Blue Moose is a great dive bar option in Scottsdale. Too many people forget about the hidden moose in the corner of Old Town, so let's do something to fix that!"}
{"text":"I was here recently on a Tuesday evening and this place was pretty dead.  They were out of my first two choices from their skimpy craft beer selection.  I had to settle on a Blue Moon.  It's a fun place to go before or after a Giants spring training game or big event at the Civic Center but doesn't have a lot going for it otherwise."}
{"text":"The best local New York Giants football bar in The Valley! Delicious food menu and a good selection of spirit drinks and beers on tap! Repeat customer for sure !"}
{"text":"If you're a San Francisco Giants fan or a transplanted Bay Area person you have to go to this place! Located just across to the entrance to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts in the Scottsdale Mall, this hidden gem has great salads and burgers, tv screens all over and a definite San Francisco funky vibe. During spring training this place is packed with Giants fans who walk over from the Scottsdale Stadium after the game. Tons of fun!"}
{"text":"Food is tastey and consistent.  The chips and queso dip are great.  Service is fine.    If it's nice, do yourself a favor and sit outside and watch people going to and from...  great people watching.  We go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Nice enough place for a drink and some bar food by the plaza. Nice selection of reasonably-priced craft brews. Some good people-watching to be had. Went there Saturday night for a fundraiser. They had some live music going (70's covers). Wings were fine, service was fine. Just nothing noteworthy to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Plenty of TV's and a great selection of beer on tap.  Staff was awesome."}
{"text":"What kind of sports bar doesn't serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!!   Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!!   On the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when it's not a busy time!"}
{"text":"Fun & lively place near Scottsdale Stadium.   Full bar, large beer selection, good food, indoor & outside seating."}
{"text":"Why do my husband and I keep coming back to the Blue Moose?  Two words my friends:  Tater Tots  (Well that and the moose decor.)  My husband started bringing me here about 5 years ago when I moved with him back to Phoenix (he's practically native).  Honestly they had me at Tater Tots.    The food alone warrants two stars but there are other variables which warrant the other two stars:  the staff are friendly, my husband loves their Frisco sandwich (which has officially been taken off the menu but they make when he asks for it so we'll keep coming back), there's a million TVs for watching sports, they have great happy hour specials, and it's good for groups.  Their queso dip is excellent!  And they have tater tots as a side. (Yes I know you can get those at Sonic but I saw them here first.)"}
{"text":"Soo Short and sweet. The staff is extremely friendly but not a huge fan of the food. I ordered the 'Island' Burger (emphasis on the Island for Thousand Island but there was literally just a quarter size portion on the burger. Granted I asked for a side of it later so I could 'fix' my burger but just irritated me that it didn't live up to its name. It's pretty much a bar food type place, stuff you could make on your own with ease- just saying."}
{"text":"Best service in Scottsdale.  Come here year round . Best food and best service. Love this place. You always feel welcome here"}
{"text":"The Blue Moose is kind of an odd duck in Old Town, and that's what I kind of like about it.  I mean, a divey sports bar in Old Town?  There's not very many that I know of.    There's not really anything all that special about Blue Moose, and quite frankly if it was in a different location I'd probably only give it three stars, but like I said, the novelty of where it's located makes it seem a little more special that it really is.    Funny thing is, growing up in Scottsdale I don't think I had EVER been to Blue Moose during Spring Training.  I used to come here for lunch every now and then w/my parents on random weekdays off when I had moved back after college & when I was in grad school.  However, when I was in town for Spring Training a few weeks ago I stopped in for a couple beers before heading to the Giants game.  The crowd is definitely different than it is at other times throughout the year.  It's a little more mixed in terms of ages (I would say it's a bit older most of the year), and overall it's certainly more crowded.  There's quite a bit of seating though.      I didn't have any food this time around, but the menu looks like it hasn't change much (if at all) from a few years back.  It's a pretty typical menu that you'd find at most sports bars that serve food.   If you're in Scottsdale during spring training this is certainly a good spot to hit up before a Giants game.  Also, if you're looking for a quick bite to eat & drink w/out dealing w/ \"stereotypical\" Scottsdale at other times throughout the year, it's not a bad spot either."}
{"text":"3.0-3.5 stars  Nice and attentive bartenders. TVs all around the bar. Good beer on tap at good prices. We didn't get to try any food but what they offered sounded good."}
{"text":"Me and the wife grabbed lunch there on Sunday on the way to a movie - my wife's chicken sandwich was the worst excuse for food we've ever seen/tasted in an eating establishment.  The chicken patty was, at best, 1/4\" thick including the breading!  It was 60% breading, and twice as big as the bun, so it was sticking out everywhere.  So, what I'm saying is, the actual meat part of the patty, might have been 1/8\" thick.  It gives the appearance of a lot of food, sticking out of the bun like that, until you realize how thin it is, and that it is mostly breading.  Of course, it is not deep-fried from fresh, it is just the typical crappy frozen, heated up garbage.  But somehow, I guess due to the lack of meat inside, it is completely tasteless.  The cheese was not melted.  I guarantee you, if you were blindfoled and tasted this, you could not tell what type of \"meat\" it was.  Her sandwich came with a side salad, which at this place means, dump a bunch of lettuce on the same plate as the sandwich, throw in a couple of tomato wedges and some carrot shavings, with a little cup of dressing on the side, and we're done.    I had a club sandwich - it was not as objectionable - I mean, how do you screw up deli meats, bacon, mayonnaise and sourdough bread?  However, it was the 2nd blandest club sandwich I've ever had (worst in my life was Cheesecake Factory - no place will ever \"top\" that one).  My side of cole slaw was cabbage and mayonnaise with no seasoning.  Completely tasteless.    When I tell you that you would get more flavor and enjoyment from a $1.00 Mcdonalds McChicken than this $8 chicken sandwich abomination, I am  not joking.  My club sandwich had a bout half as much taste as a $4 footlong cold cut combo at Subway.  Our bill was $25 for those two items, a glass of house wine and an iced tea.  I felt as robbed as I would if I was mugged for the $25 outside the restaurant.    As for the rest of the place, typical sports bar/dive bar look, with the TV's, the dark wood, long bar, bla bla bla.  That part is fine.  It was clean and well-kept.  But with food that bad, who cares.    I understand we were there on a Sunday in the Summer, totally off-season.  But if you don't even care enough to serve mildly pleasing food because your revenue is so bad this time of year, just shut your doors for the summer and wait for on-season, buy the higher-grade products from your food supplier once your revenue picks up again in October, and TRY a little.  It's a shame - we've always loved going there in the spring and the fall, when old-town is buzzing, but I won't give anyone my on-season business if they don't care part of the year.  I was never ga-ga over the food, but then mostly we'd go there for drinks in the sunshine out on the patio.  But ya gotta give me at least edible fare.    Bye Bye, Blue Moose.  I thought we knew ye."}
{"text":"It is probably the closest bar to Scottsdale stadium, and likely the cheapest in Old Town  We hung out here all week, and the bartenders were good - mostly - and the drinks were stiff  Ugh, I just read MalibuRum's review - give me a break - no sliders or Malibu rum? Good, then I guess you wont be there - try going back when your over 18 and can drink real alcohol."}
{"text":"Maria was our waitress and was MIA alot. My girlfriend and I were meeting up over cocktails and apps and probably would have had more than one drink each if we had service. we sat on the patio which was filthy and didnt get cleaned up when they sat us so we used our napkins"}
{"text":"The Blue Moose is a definite \"go-to\" during Spring Training, walking distance to the Giants Stadium. Great food, plenty of seating and many tap beer selections."}
{"text":"The Moose is the place to go for spring training, seeing a venue at the Scottsdale perforning arts center or just hanging in Scottsdale. The place is large with big patio area, they play good music, large bar, lots of brews on tap, full bar and good bar food. The owners are really nice and it's a family run place. I like to frequent  family run places.  Grab a brew and relax outside and people watch."}
{"text":"Stopped by this established Old Town Scottsdale Bar a couple of times during our recent Spring Training Trip with some friends of mine visiting from Sacramento. Servers Andrea, Jennifer and Chelsea were great and made our visits fun! They took pictures with us and Andrea even bought me a beer and a shot for my upcoming Birthday. Thanks again that was super nice!!! Hope my travels find me down there again before next Spring Training.  I first went to Blue Moose in 2004 and it's definitely a fun lively Bar to visit before and after a Giants game at Scottsdale Stadium. The service is prompt and the food is good. Try the chicken strips with fries. Good beer selection and excellent cocktails.  I have been coming to Old Town Scottsdale for many years to see Spring Training games and Blue Moose has hung in there standing the test of time even when there has been a lot of turn over, over the years especially during the recession. Continued success!!!"}
{"text":"the bartender is pretty quick with the brews and he runs to ask the kitchen if you have a question about the food but the waitress just kind of slings your food at you then never comes back...hey when im out...we ALWAYS WANT another round, so at least glance over us so we can sign language it out or something...basically we got there early before performing arts show, then went back and sat at the beer to avoid the table service to have another brew before the show but they have some crappy hefenveisen brand, how about upgrading to four peaks or just something better than whatever lame brand we drank, i mean we will drink it anyway but if it was better brand, we will drink more."}
{"text":"I had the oddest experience there last night; Thursday the 8th.  I went in alone for a bite and a \"beverage \" as this is a \"bar/restaurant.\"  It seemed everyone else in there had no interest in partaking in what the Blue Moose had on their visual menu.  The bar maid was not kind and the owner not friendly this particular evening.  The owners wife appeared in madam type of attire. The whole thing just seemed out of character for this place as I am a pretty regular customer along with my husband Michael. The food was descent as usual. Nothing special. Drinks good. But weird night."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad night, but after reading the reviews I expected more.  It was quite uneventful.  Walked-in and there was bunch of people in a group.  Not sure what kind of group, but without them the place was dead...Zzzzzzz.  Oh I'm still writing this review!  They have pretty good prices for food, but maybe there's a reason.  To my chagrin it was basic burger and fries with some lettuce and Thousand Island dressing.  Yawn!!! Okay those people left it's just me and my friend now -- crap!  I'm too young to shut this place down!  Service was good, but serving 2 people isn't really that hard.  The cool thing about the place of course is the moose head.  Not much of a hunter, but I can appreciate it.  Matter of fact next time I will become a hunter and search for a more happening place. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me set the stage for you. It's a wednesday night. My brother's girlfriend's 21st birthday. Started off at saddle ranch, where 14 of her friends stood her up. Sucks, right? This poor girl is left with only her mother, her boyfriends, and her boyfriend's sister to celebrate this momentous occasion. Spirits were low.  A change of venue was needed.  She chose Blue Moose because she liked the name. It's a nice looking bar.  Laid back. Clean.   Hey! There's shuffle board! She likes shuffle board. But shuffle board is not enough to turn that frown upside down.   No, only a miracle would save this night.  Enter Derek, AKA the most amaizing bartender and possibly greatest human being alive.  He saved what started off as a disastours night.  He was elated when he found out it was her 21st.  He carefully planned what her first drink would be, asking her what flavors she liked.  he suggested fun shots, other great spots to hit up, turned the night around.    Really, without him, this would have been the absolute worst 21st birthday in the history of the world.  We will be back, because not only is this a nice bar, but the service is truly unbeatable."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere inside. Our service was wonderful. I had the pear, blue cheese salad and it was great!  The prices are very reasonable, especially for this area. It's a little off the main drag so we had a little trouble finding it but glad we did. We will return."}
{"text":"A little hard to find...  Once you are there, its the epitome of a sports bar... lots of TV's, 2 pool tables, and a huge bar!   Decent bar food - a reasonable lunch destination. Unfortunately, every night I have visited here it has been dead...   A crowd would make this place much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great sports bar in Old Town.  This place really is a gem among the typical trendy old town bars and restaurants.  Its right by Scottsdale Stadium and in one of my favorite sections of Old Town ... (the park area with all the grass, fountains and the LOVE sign)   All the bartenders were super friendly and drink prices were very reasonable.  I went there with my Dad (not the most easily impressed man) and my younger brother.. all of us have very different tastes and standards BUT we ALL LOVED Blue Moose.    Its really clean for a dive'ish' sports bar and right next to Orange Table (one of my favorite breakfast places)... So next game day go have brunch at Orange Table... read in the park... kiss your boyfriend under the LOVE sign, go drink too many beers at BLUE MOOSE!!!... and finally sleep it off back at the park :)  Your car will be safely and conveniently waiting for you in the huge and never-crowded FREE parking garage next door!"}
{"text":"Great dive bar tucked in scottsdale."}
{"text":"The owners should probably train their wait staff to be proper.  When a table is done and they have paid their bill it would be very nice you did not ignore them completely and go and pick up their chat. Until the customer leaves the restaurant it would be proper to continue to serve and refill their drinks."}
{"text":"There's no better place in Old Town than the Blue Moose for a beer (or several in my case) before and after a Giants Spring Training game.  We hit the Moose on Saturday and we had a blast!  Great people, good bar food and a cutie bartender.  Plus the Giants beat the Dodgers.  What more can a die hard Giants fan ask for?  Love it!"}
{"text":"Forgettable food, drink, and atmosphere.  Friendly service though and easily accommodates midsized to larger parties which suited our needs."}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday for the Giants/Packers playoff game. This is a Giants bar for football. The place is packed today for the game and Giants fans paid 25$ per person at each table and 150-200$ for a booth. Service is terrible because they are so understaffed. You would think on days like this they could afford a little more help because they are making bank today. Poor business decision on management because you could have sold more alcohol in return! On top of that fans had to pay in advance to reserve a table, so the bar was well informed on how busy they would be. Silly error on your part which gives Giant fans a reason to take there business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great bar during spring training. It was a 5 when it was larger, but still a great place to go."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place randomly.  I decided to order some fish and chips with some beers.  Everything was decent.  Not necessarily five-star rating because it was pretty empty, but it was nice."}
{"text":"During spring training in March, this one of my favorite places to hangout before and after SF Giants baseball games, walking distance to stadium. They have indoor and outdoor seating, great food, drinks and service. Jennifer, Andrea and Chelsea, bust their butts, giving you the best service possible, as do other waitresses do too!!! They help make your visit fun and dance while working their tails off. On  occasion, they have a live band with dancing. Otherwise, a jukebox is provided for your music pleasure."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale for an event at SCPA, so we decided to have dinner at Blue Moose. The food was good, typical bar food, but the service was really lack luster. It wasn't even busy when we first arrived. Our waiter seemed to walk one table at a time, instead of doubling up to bring things out to people. Then after he brought the check, both me and my friend were able to go to the bathroom, and the check was still sitting there waiting for him when each of us returned. Eventually we had to walk up to the bar to pay, so we wouldn't be late for our show. Not the best of dining experiences. I'd probably go back though, I imagine it's one of the cheaper places to eat in the Civic Center area."}
{"text":"I consider this a hidden gem in the valley.  Very out of the way (located by the Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts and AZ88), and it is very usual for it to be very crowded.  I used to go here daily when I lived nearby, and got to know the owner pretty well who said that they make their year pretty much during spring training, and the rest is just gravy.  The food here is very good, as far as bar food goes.  Nice tall beers served ice cold to go along with a full bar.  Staff is friendly and service is attentive, a big plus in my book.  There are also plenty of TVs, a good juke box, a couple of pool tables and Golden Tee as well.  This is a great place to go to catch a game or just hang out with your friends.  I would have given the Blue Moose 5 stars but I dropped it down to 4 due to the fact that they recently removed the shuffle board table.  In place of it are 4 high-top tables of four.  Considering the place is not very crowded except for the month of March and getting a table is not that much of an issue, why the hell remove a piece of gaming equipment that brings people in the other 11 months of the year?  I'm not sure what brain trust came up with that idea, but they should be tarred and feathered."}
{"text":"Great crowd, cheap drinks, fast service. Will make sure to stop by again next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always good and the staff and owners are awesome. Grey is always there and always friendly. Highly recommend their street tacos and reuben sandwich!"}
