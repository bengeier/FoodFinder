{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend so I decided to try it out. I ordered the horchata and some carne asada tacos, the steak was cooked perfectly. I've had better horchata but the meal was still great together. The waitresses didn't speak English, but it was okay, the service was still great! Will definitely recommend this place to a friend. The best thing was prices were really affordable."}
{"text":"Best place ever!! Love it here. EXTREMELY AUTHENTIC MEXICAN and HONDURAN food. I'm extremely picky when I go out to eat Mexican food since I'm Mexican-American. This is my go to place to eat with my boyfriend. Great atmosphere and extremely friendly staff. If you come eat here brush up on your spanish since the servers speak mainly spanish. So many options on the menu! So delicious and big portions! I had the steak and chicken sopes and a side order of fried plantain. My boyfriend had the mixed quesadilla which comes With shrimp chicken and steak. YUM!"}
{"text":"Baleada #5! Steak, cheese, beans, avacado wrapped up in a freshly made tortilla for $4!!!! The servers don't speak english, but the food is so great I don't even care. The papusas are also fantastic! I can't even rave about this place enough. They have salvadorian, Mexican, Honduran food and so much more!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for crappy service this is the place for you!   The waitress made faces everytime we ordered a refill. She forgot a couple of the things we ordered and she didn't like that we were taking a little longer to figure out what we wanted.  The cashier charged me for the wrong thing, then said it was too late because he already charged it.   The food was good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I can't remember who recommended it after bitching charlotte mexican places all pretty mediocre at best. This place is like heads and shoulders above all other mexican places I've been to in charlotte. It's in a strip mall but the vegtables and everything was incredibly fresh and dirt cheap. Must visit. Only mexican place I'll eat now. La Unica is terrible but I can walk there. Tres Amigos is overrated imo and actually expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This people change management and now they are looking good. Great food! Nice beers although they need to add more variety. Give it a try to shrimp cocktail"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have eaten here about a dozen times and are never disappointed. This is one of our go to Latin American restaurants! Looks can be deceiving when you drive-by but it is worth the stop! The food is delicious and the portions are big. The prices are also really cheap. I personally love the balleada #5-crispy steak, black beans, salty cheese, avocado, some sort of paste, wrapped in a fresh made tortilla. I usually get one to eat there and one to go!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The only thing I dislike is the service. Wen I walk in there the staff is not friendly and acts like you are bothering wen you go in."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband expecting a delicious meal based on past reviews. First problem was the service. The wait staff was very slow to greet/seat us and just plain rude. Drink glasses were filthy and one was leaking with a crack. We got a visible eye roll when we politely asked for a new glass. The food was decent but Pulgaracito just a few blocks down has WAY better food and staff. Sorry Morazan- we won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"This place serves fantastic authentic food! The portions are huge for the price you pay and the menu has endless options. I try something different every time and always love it, although I always get the ceviche to start as I can't resist it! So fresh and again such good value.  The majority of staff don't speak English which can make ordering a little difficult but it has been never resulted in a mistake and there is a man who speaks great English on hand who I think is the manager/owner?   All in all definitely worth a visit for cheap authentic food from Latin America."}
{"text":"Decided to give this spot a try after reading a few reviews and man I was impressed! It's like a hidden gem in Charlotte! The portion sizes are huge!! I struggled with the menu a little bit because I don't speak Spanish but our server was very helpful! I was highly impressed with the quality and flavors! They aren't scared of spicy which is a refreshing thing to find these days!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Honduran and Mexican food, this is one of the good ones. In an unassuming strip mall between Eastway Dr. and Sharon Amity Rd, this no frills, hole in the wall has some of the heartiest and comforting Central American food I crave.  Their hearty meals usually have ample portions and after eating there about five times, I've noticed everything I've tried is a little greasy and a tad salty. But the right kind of salty, more like tasty curly fries rather than cheap microwaved ramen.  It's the perfect place to treat yourself for lunch. Warning though, an afternoon siesta is mandatory post-meal. It happens whether you want to or not, just deal with it.  Highly recommended, it's the little things like the pickled onions and salad with a healthy slice of avocado that transport me to another place and get all the little pleasure neurons firing in the brain. Really the closest thing in Charlotte you'll get to the streets of Tegucigalpa."}
{"text":"Food is good and consistently authentic and tasty, but don't expect good or fast service. We go often but the last time we went, there was a sweet 16 with a really loud DJ and smoke machine. It was funny but at the same time it was really disrespectful to customers that just wanted to eat in peace."}
{"text":"I like this place  it may use a little remodeling but food it's good and lots of it. You can try Mexican , Salvadoran and Honduran dishes  , the staff Its friendly and tends to get busy on weekends. Im original from El Salvador so i go crazy trying the different plates, like tamales or pupusas given them  a try you'll be happy."}
{"text":"The chicken soup and grill shrimp are so yummy!!!! The plantain is sweet too!   We went in late on Friday night around 11pm, and I got to say the area didn't feel safe at all around this time. You'll see a lot of random people on the street or parking lot.   The service is ok, bc they have a soccer game on so the servers were more into the game than customer. However, the food is worth our time.   Maybe, next time I'll go in during the daytime."}
{"text":"Warning... Lots of food. Come hungry. Not hungry like you skipped out on lunch, hungry as if you've never had a meal in your life. I'm telling you, portions or mother effing huge. Now while I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and all the food that was served, I didn't feel welcomed by my server. Sure, she provided what I needed but she was very short and spent more time with al her other tables. Perhaps because I didn't speak Spanish? No biggie. The guy at the check out counter was super friendly though.   From all the pics I saw on Yelp and from what I stalked around me, everything seems to be cooked the same, grilled and fried. I found all the meats in my meal to be juicy with the exception of the chicken. Most places seem to always overcook chicken. Aside that, all seemed to be pretty good."}
{"text":"Beware that the rating on the wall is 90.  I went for lunch with a friend as the $5.99 lunch specials were from 11am - 3pm.  Warning, the place is not fresh looking, the floor was grimy and I sat on a damaged torn seat.  The waitresses swept with a whisk broom while people were eating.  The waitresses were on their best behavior since the owner was cleaning the AC filter.  My friend's drink glass was dirty and had some sort of white coating smear.  The food was ok (nothing to write home about) was warm (not hot) and had to return it for nuking...  I was charged the regular price and just paid as I will not patronize any longer.  I was referred to Moraz√°n and also Loco Lime (now closed for business) and will continue seeking the best authentic Mexican restaurant on Central Ave."}
{"text":"Always good food here....Place could use a re-modeling, but Lempira across the street is basically the same thing but updated and cleaner with no alcohol unfortunately...So you got to go with whats important to you at the moment....Alcohol usually wins. :)"}
{"text":"We revisited and there was a manager on-site guiding the waitresses. We were seated promptly and our server was very attentive throughout our meal. She was even polite about correcting my husbands order. Food is consistent. Just as good as our first visit. Service much improved with the manager on-site."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner 6pm. I was the ONLY customer. Weird huh. When I entered the 3 waitress we're sitting at the table near the front entrances chatting.  One got up and escorted me to my seat. She was very polite and told me about the menu. I don't know her name but she has red hair :) I ordered 3 tacos the plating was very appealing to the eyes you can tell someone took time to place the food on the plate. Well that the GOOD part let's let me tell you the bad. The place is dirty dirty dirty why we're the tables and floors dirty and no customers. The waitress should have been cleaning instead of sitting down talking. I will attach pictures of the floor   I recommend get take out for the tacos. I won't sit in there again. I had the house margarita the waitress informed me they don't have a bartender and she made the drink she didn't know HOW to make it she just threw some shots in   Huh???? Anyways like I said taco was good   The food was displayed nicely but the place is a whole in the way dump. Management please clean this place. I mean clean the windows tables floor and walls."}
{"text":"Today at had a take out of a chicken taco salad there was broccoli in the salad instead of lettuce the taste was good but the arrangement in that take out box was horrible  a cucumber salad with lettuce tomato and mayonnaise under the shell and pico de gallo on the other side made the shell Soggy everything was soggy"}
{"text":"Surprise surprise Stopped in strip mall in east Charlotte   And found a real gem  Latin food the way it is suppose to be . Did not look like Tijuana throw up. Recommend by the whole family"}
{"text":"Dirty. Seriously dirty. Tables, floors, windows were all covered in dirt and grime. There was trash and crumbs all over the place. Couldn't find their health score rating which is probably alarming now that I'm really thinking about it. I opened my menu and a spider crawled out...   You'd think I'd have walked out at that moment and I really wish I would've. I ate the carne asada tacos. They seemed good... at first. Halfway through my second taco my stomach started hurting. And it's been hurting ever since. I couldn't finish my food.  The sever was never around. Left cash on the table when she neglected to return and only stayed talking to the other server up front.   Waste. I still have a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"nothing like chicken soup from a central american joint to bring you back to life after a rough night.   Obviously I had the sopa de pollo and it was pretty delicious and an absolute monster of a portion. hangover aside, finishing more than half of it would be some kind of challenge. It came filled with chicken, potatoes, carrots, squash and a big serving of rice.  I also got a baleado, which is sort of similar to a quesadilla but with a different sort of fluffier thicker tortilla which at $3.25 filled with cheese, beans, eggs and sour cream is a real steal."}
{"text":"Honduran in focus, gargantuan in scope - Morazon has it all and in huge portions.  I mean, friggin' HUGE. Plates like movie props from some Roman Banquet, piled to overflowing teetery, waitresses wrangling the cramped dining space to get it onto your table before things start tumbling down. If you're a meater, these plates are for you - and there are a hundred to choose from. A fav at our table was the Pollo y Plantanos - green plantains piled high with roasted chicken, bone-in, sauced and covered with minced herbs, 14 bucks for more food than you could share between three.   Veggies are going to have to do some picking and choosing, and will probably come away with a Chile Relleno, or maybe some papusas, and if you're lucky and your espanol es bueno, a Burrito Vegetarian. There's breakfast to be had, plantains both sweet and non, lots of cheesy, beany options, and the papusas aren't bad. But not amazing either.  Which is pretty much the theme - flavors, on the MexiEcuaHonduraCharlotte Scale, were some midway between Azteca's blandness and 3Amigo's sharp - so the salsa was meh, but the sauce on my Relleno, awesome.    Cheap, quick, and decent. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. If you want authentic Honduran, columbian, and Mexican this is the place! The staff is very helpful and friendly and the food is absolutely wonderful. I've tried steak, shrimp, chicken, rice, beans and a salad. They're all good. A bit pricey for the specialties but definitely worth it! Must try. Oh yeah margaritas are definitely worth it they hook em uuuup!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican, Honduran, Salvadoran etc food. So much selection, all of it great. This is where I discovered fried yucca, which is so much better that potato fries. Carne asana is superb along with the fried tacos, publanos and cream sauce and all the other sides that come with it. I will never get over how good there food is."}
{"text":"Great Honduran restaurant with a menu catered to less adventurous diners who consider fajitas \"branching out\". I recommend picking out a handful of house specialty apps and an entree or two to split it with friends. You can't beat leaving with full bellies, to-go boxes, and an average of ten bucks a person.   I'm one of those less adventurous eaters who tried fajitas the first time I dropped in. They were good, but pretty greasy--even for fajitas. So, my boyfriend convinced me to return and let him order. Now, the Choripollo will be something I'll be craving again before long (see photo). I give it 4 out of 5 stars only because their Mexican is half of the menu but not their calling.   Make sure you check out Las Delicias across the street for chocolate cake or their chocolate mice with almond slivers for ears (they taste like Swiss Rolls)."}
{"text":"Food is great and the portions are large but... the service is inconsistent, some waitstaff and the cooks don't know the menu. I have ordered the same thing three times -one time it didn't match what was on the menu and another I got the wrong order! They don't speak English or at least pretend not to. Overall nice place but won't be heading there anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my most frequented Mexican spots in CLT. It's close to my home on central. I hate that they're not consistent in food, but when the food is good it's really good! The last time I went it wasn't so great, and sometimes they make it perfect; others not so much. Great prices thought. They used to have beer on tap but for some reason has stopped this, so that really sucks no 32oz specials at a Mexican place. Good place to pop into especially if you're doing laundry next door. Some of the waitresses don't really understand English, but other than that, if you're looking for cheap, fast Mexican, this place is def worth checking out."}
