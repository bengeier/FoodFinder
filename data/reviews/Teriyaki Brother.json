{"text":"This place is awesome! The first day I tried it for lunch I got the teriyaki chicken special and an order of crab rangoons. It was so good I had to come back for a late dinner. The portions are generous and the staff are friendly and wonderful. This place is a hidden gem. I will definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Order food for delivery and had to wait a while. It was totally worth it though. I ordered the teriyaki beef, chicken and shrimp combo (spicy). Delicious!"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty food, good portions, friendly service and reasonable prices. What else can you ask for? They also do deliveries. Can't go wrong with the  $4.99 chicken teriyaki deal."}
{"text":"Very nice and polite people great service and food was fresh and delicious the general chicken is great and my kids love the orange chicken and cant wait to try the beef and mushroom great stamp card program free entree after 6 purchases"}
{"text":"Went today and the food was delicious and fresh! Great service with nice smiles and wi-fi . I told my husband all about it! I will be taking him there soon."}
{"text":"I love this place . I come here atleast twice a week . The prices don't break the bank , the portions are pretty big and in overall the food is great . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great food,good prices,family owned I go often always smiling friendly owner once in a while good promotions,freshly made food always and boba is good"}
{"text":"My first time here. Beautiful looking food. I ordered the general tso chicken , the sesame chicken and a taro bobba milk. Everything is fresh tasting and flavorful. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Everything is cooked to order and big portions for a good price!! Very friendly staff and everything I have eaten was delicious!! My wife and I eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"No nonsense with this place. Simply the best teriyaki chicken I've had in town. Get the extra meat for $1.99, absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"We already have plenty of teriyaki chains in Vegas, and Teriyaki Brother is no different: menu of plates, apps, and boba beverages. Location is small and plain but clean, staff are really friendly. Their grand opening special is a $4.99 order of chicken teriyaki with rice and veggies. Unfortunately they either do not offer or were out of brown rice during my visit. On the up side, they aren't heavy handed with the teriyaki sauce as other places.   The best part:  their stamp card only requires 6 purchases for a free order, which is pretty easy to do. Delivery is free for $10+ orders in the surrounding area!"}
{"text":"I'm a be honest this place is the best place ever to go eat. The reason I say this is because I had Asian and Chinese cuisine and I have not found one that I really loved. Until I had teriyaki brother is one day. The food taste amazing especially the salmon. I haven't had anything that I did not like. One thing I would say is I am obsessed with the Macha tea. I always get one when I go. Everyone there is very friendly. It's a small restaurant but the food is really good. I also tried the almond ice and the orange ice which was really good. I would recommend anyone who wants a good cuisine to come i'm here. I also have the teriyaki chicken which my daughter loves. My fianc√© had orange chicken which I was able to get some and It also taste really good."}
{"text":"Out of towners. Tried this place based on reviews on Yelp. We had Salmon teriyaki, beef teriyaki, dumplings, and a taro snow. Good prices. Great food! Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I was driving by trying to find some place to eat and  Found this place. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with the fried rice it was good the crab Cream cheese  wontons are amazing!!! ill be back but not something ill crave."}
{"text":"PERFECT!!!!! The best Teriyaki bowl ever. This place saw me a week STRAIGHT when I first found out about it!"}
{"text":"Came to this place cause it's so close to my house and with the reviews that I saw thought it was going to be a good place had very high hopes, very disappointed. I definitely agree with other people don't understand why this place has 5 Star reviews, not the case. The prices are okay but the quality of the food isn't. I ordered teriyaki shrimp with yakisoba, the yakisoba was awful ... I've tasted way better and the shrimp was overcooked. I also ordered a Thai tea ... didn't taste nothing like a Thai tea. The only thing that was somewhat okay was the crab rangoons and the fast service."}
{"text":"Best Teriyaki bowls I've had. Very reasonable price and i live 5 miles away. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and plenty of food! Definitely like the orange chicken more than their teriyaki! Very crunchy, sweet, and not too spicy. We also got the crab rangoons but they forgot the dipping sauce, still enjoyed them though! The rangoons and tempura appetizer tasted very fresh, crunchy, not oily like some places!"}
{"text":"Not happy at all. The quality of the food was not what I was expecting. Pretty blend."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Really good bang for your buck I would say. I got the spicy teriyaki with the fried rice. I prefer it online for pick up. Food was still hot when I got home. The flavor was pretty good. Nothing really exciting, but a good lunch or dinner spot if you're really jus craving some teriyaki and rice."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try out a new place for teriyaki because the typical chain restaurants just aren't cutting it. I came across Teriyaki Brother so I went in to give it a try. The place is small, but there are seats inside if you don't want to just pick up your food and leave. I went in to order and only waited about 10 minutes.   I ordered the teriyaki chicken and beef. The food was fresh. It came with rice and vegetables as well as a lot of meat. The food was pretty good. I prefer a thicker teriyaki sauce on mine, but it was still really good. The prices aren't bad either, considering how much food you actually get. I think mine was $8. I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Brand new place, heard about it from a friend at Relentless Church so came over to check it out. They have a deal right now with the spring rolls for 99 cents for two. My wife and I got the spring rolls and a spicy chicken and beef teriyaki combo. It was big enough for us to share and be full. The prices are also very reasonable. I would recommend this place for anyone that is wanting something good and cheep. So thats why I am giving it five stars"}
{"text":"Great little place for delicious, fresh, fast food. I got the chicken, beef, and shrimp teriyaki with fried rice and my husband got the orange chicken with yakisoba. Everything was great! We ate there. The restaurant was clean, the food came out fairly quickly. The food was super hot and tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. We had Thai ice teas, regular and snow,  and they hit the spot! Very surprised by this place and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately teriyaki brothers are officially closed, with no warning at all. I really enjoyed their service and food. Their shrimp fried rice was always on point! Everything was made to order and very fresh. Its sad to see them go and i know that their competition china agogo put them out of business. But it was great while it lasted. Now to replace them, its another Chinese spot called Fu Man Dumpling House Homemade."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place for the price. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. There are a few negative reviews citing that it isn't \"real teriyaki\". In my opinion, this is better than most because the sauce is lighter (it isn't the thick sugary stuff most places drench the food with)."}
{"text":"Husband, kids and myself always come for their teriyaki special. Big portions for your money!"}
{"text":"Called in my order for lunch. 10 min turnaround time. Guy was friendly.  4.99 chicken teriyaki special. Large portion. Tasted ok. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend !!!!   Back to back with this place. First night we ordered the teriyaki with veggies and the beef with mushroom. Boy this is he exact teriyaki flavor I was looking for. Brings me back to the sarku days at queens center mall.   Day two we came in for the sesame and general tsao chicken. They delivered in flavor and there were plenty of sauce you can roll over into the rice.   Pretty decent size menu, you have our tempuras, teriyaki and bubble tea too!    Service is unbeatable and they also offer a reward system. A stamp card is you may, buy any 6 meals and you can pick up a teriyaki chicken for FREE!    I know I'll be back to collect my reward soon enough. Cya"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Tasty and unique orange chicken & the rice is perfectly soft and sticky! Wish there could've been a bigger serving of veggies but still overall, the entree was satisfying"}
{"text":"We ended up trying this place tonight. What a great huge improvement from the last menu that was held at this location. The chicken was perfectly crispy the way Orange chicken and General Tso chicken should be. The pricing was very affordable and restaurant was very clean, along with friendly staff members. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not good.  All these '5 star' reviews are just their friends.  Teriyaki Chicken - Bland and flavorless Teriyaki Beef - Tough, leathery, and very oddly seasoned. Not teriyaki at all (or even edible) Yakisoba Noodles - Not yakisoba noodles. These are boiled lo mien noodles, mushy and flavorless.  Will definitely not be back especially since Teriyaki Boy is less than a mile away and is way better."}
{"text":"Love this place and I'm so glad it's near my home. I always get the chicken and shrimp plate but everything is great! From the appetizers to the plates to the best Thai tea I've ever had, this place is it! Fast friendly service and fresh food."}
{"text":"I went here expecting a 5 star joint because if all the reviews but sadly I was disappointed. It's wasn't even a real teriyaki place it was more of a sub par Chinese restaurant. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the service was better than the food."}
{"text":"Whoa...some really stellar teriyaki on my side of town?  Sign me up baby!  I love me some teriyaki but I find I'm very picky on the sauce itself.  I like sweet but not sickly sweet, and I kinda like my sauce on the thicker side & not too thin.  Can't be too salty either.  Wow, Teriyaki Brother nicely fits the bill!  Pretty much still a newer place in town to eat, I can say I'm a fan!  Kinda a no frills type place but no matter to me.  They actually do really good in their take-out operations.  We went for their grand opening special - Chicken Teriyaki plate for only $4.99!  What a great deal!  Even better was the portion size, lots of chicken & lots of rice!  Take it home and add your own veggies!  Seriously, for the price the Chicken Teriyaki plate fed 2 of us easily.  We also ordered their Beef & Shrimp Teriyaki plate with yakisoba for $8.98 ($7.99 + $0.99 for yakisoba upgrade) - also very good!  HUGE portion!  Tasty food, the sauce was just right and pretty flavorful.  The meats were cooked well but not overcooked, and even the shrimp were of decent size!  Definitely a great meal for a great value!  They even offer boba drinks which we didn't try this time around but maybe next time.  Owner was pretty nice too, told us some of his favorites on the menu and if we wanted extra sauce on the side too, no charge.  Teriyaki Brother is now our go to for cheap & delicious teriyaki!  I don't even care if the place is in the ghetto!!  #veryveryteriyakibrother"}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Beats the hell out of teriyaki madness. Huge portions, good prices. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki.  it was very good tasting and a large quantity.  the staff is very friendly.  Matcha tea, really good and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great teriyaki at a wonderful price. I like to request some extra teriyaki sauce on the side b/c that's what I like. Lol  The brothers are always here and they're nice. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"I was prompted to come here by an automatic Yelp notification on my phone. It was pretty good timing cuz I was hungry. So I came here and realized it was an old Chinese food restaurant that closed down a while ago. If I came in I got greeted friendly they offered the Teriyaki combo I want decided to get the chicken and beef combination and it was really really good. The food came out within 7 minutes I also got a Thai milk tea. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Would not let me order something that was on the menu without making it a combo. Would rather have no sale then a larger sale I guess. Was really excited to try this place but the customer service put me off :/"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Brother is a welcome addition to the neighborhood's selection of Asian food. The prices are low and the food is delicious. We got the spicy teriyaki chicken and the General Tso's chicken. Both were delicious, but the General Tso's chicken was overall more flavorful. We got our food to-go and the wait was only about 10 mins. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very kind service. Offered a lot of condiments. Great price and free delivery for orders more than $10.  Standout point: HUGE boba tea cup size...literally double the size of other boba places for less than $5. Definitely worth a drop-in to support a new business in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicous and super fresh with reasonable prices too. I definitely recommend them!!!!"}
{"text":"Mu food was ok, shrimp didn't seem very fresh. Restaurant didn't seem very clean to me, had carpet that looked like it belonged in a 90s living room and it just seemed out of place and really needed to be vacuumed. There are 4 teriyaki restaurants in this area, I thought the food here was better than teriyaki boy but I will probably continue to go to teriyaki madness due to the questionable cleanliness and freshness."}
{"text":"Good portions for a good price. The Yakisoba is really tasty and a good upgrade for only 99 cents. The shrimps are large and seasoned well. They also deliver for free if the order is over $10 and less than three miles from their location. All in all not a bad deal and quick service too."}
{"text":"My to go spot for Taro Milk Tea. These guys are incredibly polite from the minute you walk in the door,  and the food is always fresh and fast."}
{"text":"I am so sad that we live in Mountains Edge and we don't have anything nearly this good or reasonably priced in our area. This place is worth the drive and we'll definitely be back ESP if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious Lunch ...teriyaki beef & chicken over yakisoba noodles & vegetables & teriyaki beef & shrimp!"}
{"text":"I am here every other day for their milk tea boba. It is delicious and refreshing! This is a family owned restaurant and they are very nice."}
{"text":"The teriyaki combo was very good as well as the shrimp tempura & all for $9.70. All it needed was a side of extra teriyaki sauce & sarachi."}
{"text":"Not understanding all of the five star reviews. Did you eat the same food as me?  This is very average Chinese food, nothing special. Ordered the teriyaki chicken which was dry and in need of seasoning. With so many other better Chinese places in town I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So I'm torn with this one. I feel like their teriyaki sauce is reminiscent of gravy. It wasn't bad, just...DIFFERENT. Their fried chicken wings tasted like it had vanilla in it...it was sweet. Idk...it wasn't bad though. I got the shrimp and chicken with rice and beef noodles. The shrimp and chicken were cooked perfectly.  It was just the \"teriyaki\" it was coated in that took me by surprise. My husband really liked the noodles. I LOVED that the food was extremely fresh. Still burn your mouth after the drive home fresh!"}
{"text":"Cheap food with huge portions!  Chicken plate/bowl thing was heavy with a ton of rice and noodles. And for five bucks? Can't beat it.   Now, with that mentioned, it's not the greatest teriyaki/Japanese food... It was pretty bland. I wouldn't really call it Japanese either. I speak Japanese and the mumbling between the two guys sounded like it was a form of Chinese.   I almost gave it 3-stars but the guys were polite and I always like a good deal.  For a hole-in-the-wall, it's got value for a return visit."}
{"text":"I read good reviews about this place on Google while trying to decide what to eat for lunch. So I convinced my coworker we should try it. I don't remember what she had, but she wasn't impressed. I had the teriyaki plate. The chicken was undercooked and there was hardly any teriyaki sauce. There was also chunks of the part of the chicken that is rubbery, gristle maybe. The serving size was large, and I ate less than half & tossed the rest. We had ordered a teriyaki plate to go for a coworker, and she said hers was just as bad as mine. I felt so bad at my choice of lunch that I offered to treat my coworker next time we went for lunch.   When I saw the great score on Eat24, I thought it was a different Teriyaki Brothers. So I came into Yelp to discover that there's only the one. Well, despite the great reviews on here, I do not have the desire to go back."}
{"text":"they have some fire extra crispy orange chicken and teriyaki   it's a B rating but the food is on point   freshly cooked  coo peeps"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Huge portions and great flavors!!  I tried the teriyaki shrimp and chicken with fried rice on a recommendation from the chef. I was not disappointed!  Also tried the Crab Rangoon which were also amazing and very fresh!  Highly recommend this place a must try!"}
