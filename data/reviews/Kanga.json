{"text":"Quick very friendly service this evening! She was very welcoming and made some suggestions after knowing it was our first time.   Butter Chix- Creamy subtle kick of butter chicken spice... Saucy very enjoyable!    Mum's Chicken Pie - Classic  was not disappointed LOVE the touch of Chardonnay really gave it that extra little something   Traditional Aussie - Saucey , meaty, has a little potato (not too much... Which I really appreciate because I didn't have an allergic reaction to it from that very reason )   Surprisingly even though these little guys are the size of your palm they are actually decently filling ! ... You might just need 2-4 to fill you up depending on how much you can handle.   Price is okay ... About $7 each Palm sized pie. They have 4 pies for $24 to take home and cook located in the freezer ( I feel that is a better suited price for the cooked ones too)     On the plus size the hand held sizes lets you try more flavours!!   Would recommend people to check it out!"}
{"text":"The best pie I ever had and will ever have. Definitely go for traditional taste. I regret that I only ate one piece of it. It seemed a bit big but it was multi thin layer of pie crust made it look big, so you can actually eat a lot of them! If I visit Toronto again in near future, I must stop by to try other taste like Kiwi."}
{"text":"4 stars, because I have only been here once. Consistency is key. The quality here is top notch. $7 for a quality product is not over the top. Really good food has a cerebral quality to it for me. The flakiness of the pastry, the butter, the savoury flavours and texture. Stop staring out the window during lunch and truly feel the flavours you are experiencing. If you want more food, then but another pie. If you are complaining about the prices, then go spend $13 at a mega fast food joint where the packaging has more nutrition and flavour then the food."}
{"text":"The sad thing about this place isn't that I could grab the same types of pies for like a dollar back home and that the place is a rip off (seriously you can get this crap on any street corner dairy), but that the guys that work there put on a hardout aussie accent when no one fricken talks like that in Oz..."}
{"text":"The whole store smells great. I missed kiwi pie so much, has to try it. The kiwi one tasted good, but definitely not for someone on diet.  The pastry is not quite right as I remembered. Too crispy, don't get me wrong, it tastes good, just not exactly a Australian/Kiwi style.   Will come again for sure"}
{"text":"Got a chance to taste three different pies with an Aussie friend of mine. I spent a month in Australia with her a few years ago, and we were both had the craving. Each was more delicious than the last! .. but Aussie pies they were not. Close, but no cigar. They're similar, and very tasty, and they satisfy the craving.. but it's not the first time I've heard \"you just can't make them the same here\". Something about the water perhaps. The particular brands or ingredients used. The change of taste in livestock from one continent to the next.. All factors that take this from 'just like home' to a near miss.  All the same, the service was quick and friendly (non-Australia, but we won't hold them to that). The space itself is small, but it's not trying to be a restaurant and there is some seating along the window, and was clean. And most importantly, the food was delectable and fresh."}
{"text":"Great spot for picking up lunch for those working in the area. Shared three pies between me and a co-worker: the Aussie classic, El Diablo and Chicken pie.  The aussie classic was my favorite. You can never go wrong with minced meat with gravy and there's something extra comforting about this classic combo.  The El Diablo was alright. It's like a shepherd's pie with pulled pork which was an interesting twist. We both thought the pie crust were excellent. Nice and flaky.  Price is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Dropped by here after reading raving reviews on Yelp. Well.. The pies were just 'ok'. Given the price, they are not cheap but the fillings were ..hmm...a bit underwhelming."}
{"text":"Disappointed. My husband and I had high expectation of this place after reading the great reviews. We went over the weekend at the end of day ~6:30. There were only 5-6 pies left so very limited selection. Maybe its end of day, the pies were dry and way too salty for our taste buds."}
{"text":"If I could eat one hand-held food for the rest of my life, it would without a doubt be Kangas pies. I have been following them like a crazy foodie stalker since they launched at the Toronto Underground Market and I tasted their Aussie-inspired beef pie. Since then, they've upped their game, coming out with a whole line of savoury pies- some with meat and some with veg. My favourite still remains the classic Aussie pie though-gah, I'm having a wicked craving right now as we speak. The flaky tender crust, the rich meaty filling, all topped off with a good squirt of ketchup.  Some may think they're expensive, but if you compare it to a lot of downtown restaurants its a very reasonable option- even a lot of food trucks food is a lot more expensive. If you're comparing it to fast food, well, then I can't really help you.Personally, I would rather pay for a quality hand-made product than an  fast food factory-farmed meal but that's just me. When something is so satisfying, you don't need an excessive amount.   Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Was a rainy day at the Toronto Urban Roots Festival, but on the plus side, had a tasty aussie meat pie! Pastry was super crispy and tasty. Fresh out of the oven too, but watch out the filling is really hot.  I had the Canadian and my girlfriend had the Aussie... I liked the Canadian more. Had a chat with Megan, one of the owners, and she's really nice - definitely support these guys!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place a couple of times and figured I would finally give it a try. I decided to get the 4 for $24 frozen pie deal (price is included in the tax) but there weren't a whole lot of selections available. I asked the lady at the cash if I can only select from what is in the fridge but she told me that you can pick your own combination of the four.  After letting her know that it was my first time and asking for some recommendations, she told me a couple, like Traditional Aussie, Canadian, Butter Chix, Mum's Chicken Pea, and Creamy Zucchini. She also told me of this 'four fave' combo which includes most of the 5 I've mentioned.  I ended up getting two Traditional, one Butter Chix, and one Creamy Zucchini. They got them out from the freezer in the floor below (through the employee only area), put them nicely in a small pizza box. The lady at the cashier explained about how they have this icon system so that you can tell which pie has which flavour.  After I got home from about an hour and half of public transit and walking, the pies were still cold. The box came with instructions so I preheated a toaster oven at the suggested temperature and applied egg wash meanwhile. Half an egg would have been enough for all four pies but they're kind of hard to find in grocery stores. I baked them for about 40 minutes (considering the unavoidable thawing time) and they turned out to be quite soft. If you want to have it a bit crunchier you could try baking it for longer, or try using an actual oven. I did notice that one of the icons started dissolving into the crust.  They all tasted okay. Traditional tasted like salty gravy (not super salty), Butter Chix tasted like what you would expect from curry chicken, and Creamy Zucchini tasted like Alfredo pasta minus the pasta. And more zucchini. Considering the price of about $6.50 each (unless you get the four pie deal) about the size of the palm of your hand, the pies were alright. I wouldn't come here on regular basis.  While the staff was friendly and helpful, the taste for that price is just okay. Maybe it would taste better if you get them fresh from the shop, or maybe the other ones taste better."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4-5 times since they opened. First time was perfection (also with a grand opening price of just $5). I had the chicken pot pie and there was so much chicken and flavour. So delicious.   Other visits began to disappoint for the reasons given in other reviews (value, cold filling, not much meat in the pie, still hungry after eating it).   Today I had the chicken  pot pie and was tremendously disappointed. It wasn't until my final bites that I found a piece of chicken.  It was basically a sauce pie with a single small piece of chicken. Is it terrible of me to expect multiple pieces of chicken in my nearly $8 pie?  I wanted to love this place. I tried, but I just can't."}
{"text":"Baked fresh every day! These tasty pies are an awesome grab and go type of meal. I've been back multiple times and every bite is DELICIOUS! My personal favourite is the Mum's Chicken Pot Pie! I've got a sweet tooth and the Billionaire Shortbread bars are an awesome way to top the meal off! Everything is made from quality ingredients and worth every penny (real butter, locally source and hormone free meat). Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Deeelicious!  Kanga offers a variety of hand pies and sides, and I have to say, everything was yummy. The staff were friendly, helpful, and accomodating.  Between 4 of us, we had The Kiwi Classic, The traditional Aussie, and the Canadian hand pies.  All were so good, we're plotting our return.  We had fries and the Aussie salad (greens, shredded beets, goat cheese, and nuts (we're nut free and they were happy to leave them off).    The only thing missing was seating. They have a counter that seats 5, and lucky for us, no one else was there.    Please come to Boston--we'd love to eat at Kanga at home!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Great \"personal\" sized pies and cute little store. Came here for lunch on weekday, short line but I ordered through an app beforehand so was able to pick up my order right when I got there.  Pie was nicely packaged up and was warm. I ordered the Aussie pie (~$6) and in my opinion was the perfect size for one. The crust was flaky which I love and the filling inside was delicious, not too salty as some savoury pies tend to be.  Will be back to try other flavours and definitely recommend to those who have not tried it!"}
{"text":"Contacted Kaga to make a bunch of Lamingtons for a birthday party we were having for an Australian co-worker.  He and the entire office loved them.  Deliciousness of the dessert aside,  Megan was amazing to deal with when making arrangements.  She was prompt in her replies, very helpful and extremely personable.    They gave the birthday boy a traditional Aussie pie and he said it was almost as good as his mum's!  I totally recommend them!"}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional and it was ok..nothing special.  It didn't have a lot of taste or spice. Probably wouldn't go again. Also quite expensive at $7 considering my husband and i were hungry again in 2 hrs"}
{"text":"I recently found out that Kanga had finally opened their own shop. I first tried Kanga meat pies last year at a food festival, and instantly fell in love with their pies!!  Everything tasted amazing. The pie crust was nice and flaky, and all the fillings were full of flavour!  To read more about what I though about Kanga, check out my blog http://barbellsnbistros.blogspot.ca"}
{"text":"We bought a batch of frozen pies from Kanga - and we ate them slowly and tried different kinds. My favorite was the traditional, although I found the creamy zucchini spicy (I'm spice intolerant). Regardless I really enjoyed these pies and would recommend them!! Very warm and comforting to eat!"}
{"text":"Super fresh and delicious. I've never had Australian meat pie before.... And I can say I am totally impressed! There flat white is also very delicious too :)"}
{"text":"Kanga has quickly turned into the perfect lunch mainstay when you're craving something comforting and delicious with that close-to-homemade quality. The pastry is light and fluffy, the fillings are rich. I've tried several of the varieties and the butter chicken is my favourite thus far. Beware, though, because it WILL splorch on your pants and you WILL smell delicious all day.   I have to say that I do appreciate the attention to detail and the little designs in the pastry top of the pies, but the pies themselves could be a little bigger. One pie seems to be not quite enough, while two pies is definitely too much! Price point could be a little lower, as well, as $9 including tax for one small pie is a bit much.  Regardless, the pies are delicious, the staff are friendly, and the coffee's strong, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy meat pies- $7 average for a pie and it's pretty filling. I tried both the creamy chicken And the kiwi. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"As an Australian, I'm so happy to have a meat pie place in downtown Toronto! Megan and Erynn, the young entrepreneurs of this restaurant, lived in Australia temporarily and fell in love with a food very dear to our hearts - our meat pies.   In Australia, meat pies are traditionally consumed as take-out food, topped with tomato sauce, and handheld while it is eaten out of a paper bag. At the Kanga's soft launch, this was exactly how I had my pie, and it just tasted like home. Pies are about more than just a tasty meal, they are a part of embracing the footy, the beach, and even a day at the shops.   There are several creative fillings available, and I do like the \"Traditional Aussie\" pie, with a vegemite-braised minced beef filling. I've also heard great things about the vegetarian \"Creamy Zucchini\" from friends. The pastry is amazing, better than most pastry crusts you'll find in Australia. Pies are available straight from the oven for take-out, and frozen for preparation at home. One day, if I'm brave enough, I'll try to Poutine my Pie.  These girls went on a long adventure in Australia seeking out the best pie places to learn from and hone their recipes. They are passionate about bringing this Aussie style of casual food to Toronto, and I'm proud to showcase their pies as Australian cuisine."}
{"text":"On food alone, definitely merits a 4 star, maybe even 5 star. However, I can't get over the price of these tasty little pies! I don't mind paying more for quality ingredients, especially when minced meat is a key ingredient. At $7-8 a pie these are quite expensive.  1 is more like a little appetizer, 2 is barely filling but buying 3 for one person is just excessive. I purchased 4 frozen pies (Kiwi Classic, Traditional, Canadian and Butter Chicken) and baked them at home. The Kiwi Classic was hands down the best one! My fiance and I did not care for the traditional - something about the gravy was off. I really liked the Canadian because there was lots of gravy although it was pretty salty (probably due to the bacon!). The butter chicken was okay - didn't really taste like butter chicken sauce though. Anyway, I'm glad I finally checked this place out but I can't say I'd return because for nearly $30 on a take out meal we were just not full.  PS the buttery crust on the pies is SO good!!!!"}
{"text":"Great job guys......really liked the crust and filling.  I guess there's not much else to eat but next time I'm around I'll be stopping by!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get little pies!  My go-to flavour is the creamy zucchini and the steak and mushrooms is a close runner up. As a reviewer noted below, the creamy zucchini is peppery and it may strike some as a bit too spicy however, I love it. I usually get these pies frozen for those days where I am too lazy to cook dinner.   They are surprisingly very filling for such little delights! The crust is very flakey and buttery. I would recommend leaving them in the oven for a couple more minutes than the recommended cooking time to further brown the crust if you get them frozen.  Would recommend the sausage rolls and the coffee as well!"}
{"text":"The meat pies are delicious, however they are too small. I just ate one for lunch and I'm still hungry. If I'm going to spend $8 on one meat pie I would hope I would at least feel satisfied afterwards. Tasty food but not worth the price in my opinion"}
{"text":"My pie was tasty but small. At $7.50 I left hungry and looking for another snack."}
{"text":"I saw that kind of pies in australians' tv shows and reminded me my trip in Australia. I've tried TRADITIONAL AUSSIE and CANADIAN. Flaky pastries, good gravy. Perfect, a little bit expensive but so good."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite food in the city. I've had Sri Lankan food maybe twice besides Kanga, and it never touched Kanga's deliciousness. Most of the staff dont speak English well (see: at all,) and often many of the items they have to offer aren't on display. Which is difficult, because ordering sometimes comes down to pointing to what you want (MAKE SURE IT ISNT TRIPE. M.A.K.E. S.U.R.E .. unless you somehow enjoy tripe... In which case I would just recommend digging up some worms and tossing them in hot sauce outside because it would taste similar and be cheaper.) They have different foods on different days (even different times of day)... They often have a mutton (stew?)- YOU MUST EAT THIS. If you like spicey food don't heed their warnings that it's too spicey (unless you are \"white.\") It is perfection. If you manage to order the mutton and some biryani, you will be eating my favorite dish in all of Toronto. I can't write much more, the place is a mystery, I step in and I walk out with food somehow, and it's always an adventure. If you're willing to step out of your comfort zone and roll some culinary dice, step into Kanga.  Also, best of all? Dirt cheap. DIRT. D.I.R.T.  Oh, and finally- it's a hole in the wall... A tiny hidden hole in the wall. takeout only."}
{"text":"I went to university in Melbourne and ate my share of countless amounts of sausage rolls. So when I heard about Kanga, I definitely had to try it out! Unfortunately the sausage roll of extremely dry and overly salty which was very disappointing. I won't be back and will wait till I'm in Australia again to get an authentic roll."}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited to try Kanga, and I give it a two star for it's decent customer service and eye-catching storefront, but everything else was lackluster. I couldn't agree more with the reviews calling it underwhelming; it certainly was. I love flavourful food, so biting into an Aussie pie (I had the traditional) which was lukewarm, bland, and incredibly overpriced was disappointing. If the pie was small and it had been good, I wouldn't have minded, but it was small and bland and just not memorable at all. I really wanted to like this place, but don't see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the original and it was good. It was sort of similar to a Jamaican patty. Tried a bite of the Canadian and I liked mine much more! I would have one again but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"I popped in for a quick lunch when I was in the area, and got a \"mum's chicken\" pie and a side of fries.  The pie was a great tasting classic chicken pie, with delicious flakey buttery pastry.  The fries come with normal salt or chicken salt (delicious).  I also saw they have lamingtons (iconic Australian cakes), so will have to try one next time.  They also have healthier alternatives to fries, like a really nice looking aussie salad with beetroot, which I only noticed after I had placed my order.  The service was really quick and very friendly.  Perfect place to pop in for a quick bite, or to pick up some of their frozen pies that they also sell."}
{"text":"As a pie expert (I'm not really, but apparently anyone who can hold a fork is considered a \"foodie\" these days, so I am a pie expert), SO, as a pie expert I decided to try it out.   I stumbled upon this little unassuming \"Aussie\" pie place while wandering around hunting for food at 3 in the morning, so I quickly pulled out my trusty phone and bookmarked it for a later date.  Three months later, here I am! The space is small and cozy with only two counter top bench tables to sit at, maximum seating is about 7 people.  The table benches were white and strewn with memories of previous happy pie eaters.  I assumed this was on purpose, because I was there for about 20 minutes, no one else entered, but the one staff member never cleared off these memories, what else could it be right?  I ordered one Traditional Aussie pie and a Mum's Chicken Pie.  The crusts had a flavor deliciously buttery and golden, but it wasn't flaky, which being a pie expert, I would expect in a golden pie crust.  It was slightly tough and chewy and the bottom of the crust had a similar consistency and taste to that of those frozen Swanson pies.  I struggled a little to tear apart the top with my hands.  The contents of the Traditional Aussie was minced beef in a rich beef gravy, with a hint of vegemite.  The Chicken pot pie had, well, chicken with a splash of Australian Pinot Grigio from Mallee Rock vineyards.  If anything, I found the pies here delightfully flavorful if not a little bit on the salty side though.  I'm not sure why, but the Traditional Aussie pie had a strong overtone of cheddar cheese, which I found a little bit offensive and overpowering.  The chicken pie had nice generous chunks of chicken drowning in delicious creamy sauce.  At $6.95 a pie, it was decently affordable given the size.  They have many more varieties of pies available and different combo options, perhaps worth a try next time I come around.  What else is there to say about them? They're pies, pies are yummy, go try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered The Canadian pie.  Came to $7.85 with tax.   The pie was so tiny you can literally finish it after a couple bites.  There is barely any meat inside, its mostly gravy.  I definitely recommend going to The Pie Commission for a way way better meat pie that will actually fill your belly."}
{"text":"My Kanga meal delivered today was the best ever! I'd never experienced your cuisine (or delivery) before. The pie was delicious, the french fries outstanding, and the salad entirely perfect (not to mention generous). Delivery was prompt and the food arrived in perfect condition.  Indeed, it was like eating in Australia itself!  I shall be eating your meals frequently in future."}
{"text":"Never even heard of this place which isn't surprising but it was very tasty. I had the original pie with fries that were made fresh just for me. The fries had a chicken seasoning and it was delicious. The pie crust and filling were great not too salty but very flaky. The girls were so helpful and nice for accommodating all my inquiries. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Walking by Kanga on my way to work, I decided to pick up the Traditional Aussie meat pie combo with a garden salad and their propellor coffee ($11 + tax).   Just thinking about the perfect flaky texture of the puff pastry is making me hungry again. The pie was packed with minced meat and potato - Perfectly seasoned and not overly-sauced that it would leak through the pastry. The salad came in a small plastic container with the dressing on the side and it was A-OK for what it was.   The coffee was unfortunately, AWFUL! My first sip of it was sour and tasted like muddy water.. so I do not recommend getting coffee here.   There aren't many seats in this tiny establishment, so most customers are here for take out. I'll be back to try the other pie varieties, but probably not order it as a combo next time."}
{"text":"I love Kanga for a quick meal.  It's definitely a comfort food option, though.  They have a great range of pies, but it's just pies and french fries.  If you're not in the mood for a heavy meal then you have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I first tried Kanga Aussie pie at a night market event and from then on I cannot forget about that delightful meaty texture and flavor (extra points added due to I am a meat person)  Excited walking in this small shop, there were at most 8 high chairs available to sit inside the shop, and 2 benches outside for summer time overlooking the street. Bought the traditional aussie pie $7 and got a plate & knife, sit down.  It was served hot which makes it even more tasty. Pastry is buttery and flaky. When I cut it in half, the minced beef and sauce (gravy) comes right out. The filling is not too salty, moist enough, and the amount of it was enough for me to share with another person as a snack.  I understand why people are complaining about the high prices of the pies ($7-$8) for the look of it ie the size. However, I can promise you, you will not regret trying the pies in this place. It is a good pie overall with a variety of pies to choose from. Next time, I will be trying chicken pie/the canadian pie (steak and bacon)  Friendly service, and clean environment. Stop by for a bite when you are tired from shopping on Queen street."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I accidentally stumbled upon this place while walking to Queens Street.  I saw it on yelp, but forgot all about it until I was across the street.  I decided to come in and check it out!    The pies are pricey for what they are, but they are delicious and totally worth stopping by!  I recommend you eating this hot or heating it up in the oven when you get home.  I like the little shaped cut outs in the pie.  Mine had a heart on it and I thought it was so cute!  I tried the Canadian which was steak and bacon.  It was so so so good!  I also got the Butter Chix and that was delicious!  It wasn't spicy at all and I loved the curry flavor.  The one thing that I thought was odd was the store said they close at 9pm.  I was there a little bit before 6pm on Saturday July 3 and this guy comes in.  He tries to order coffee and the girl working the counter said she already closed the coffee machine since they were closing at 6pm.  There were no signs saying they were closing early.  I felt bad for the guy.  Why would you refuse business?!"}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday around 5 and it was pretty empty. I ordered the Traditional meat pie and salad combo with drip coffee. I was happy with the texture and taste of the pastry part of the pie. It was flaky and buttery and delicious the meat filling was savoury and meaty! I also really enjoyed the salad which included spinach, grated beet root, candied pecans, goat cheese and a lovely honey dijon mustard dressing. It was so delicious that i ended up ordering a box of 4 frozen meat pies to go. It's $6 each, whereas it would normally be $6.95 each if you get it heated up there. I would definitely come here again the workers there were really nice and answered any questions that I had and I love the Australian accent"}
{"text":"I visited kanga for the first time today. I had the kiwi classic. While the pies are good, they are way overpriced for what you get. I paid just over $8 with tax for one meat pie which barely satisfied my hunger. For the same price I could have gotten a burrito which would have definitely filled me up. If the meat pies were priced around $5-$6, I would have given them 4 stars but price-value only warranted 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up a quartet of frozen meat pies for the weekend after having a full dinner at Pai (down the street on Duncan), but was so tempted by the warm goods in the display case that I gave in and also got a fresh order of piping hot chicken salt fries ($3.75, regular size box). The Porcelain Price, you are worth it.   I've come here for lunch take-out or a quick snarf on the outside bench by their window, where in the past, I've chosen the butter chicken pies.  Or here, as they call it: Butter Chix.  The sweet way the pleasant blonde lady shop manager said it in her cute Aussie accent made it it even more appealing.  Buttuh chee-icks.  Cuuuute.   Hubs ate the traditional pie today and said it was OK.  Tasted like Vegemite to me, but the hubs could only feel the umami mouth-feel, the kind you get from tomato paste.    I'll probably eat the frozen Butter Chix soon, since we've already cracked an egg for the egg washed top (this is only if you decide to get them frozen - they will do this for you in-store if you're eating them that day).  It's less creamy than the way I usually my butter chicken, but I think it does make sense not to make it overly creamy when it's already surrounded by a pie pastry.  After that, I will go for the creamy zucchini. Then after that, I will eat the Kiwi pie.  Then after that....Kanga pies forever."}
{"text":"I've never had an Aussie pie but now I have and it's great!  I always past by Kanga when I'm heading to school and I just recently tried it out. Once I walked in it smells like buttery pastry goodness. There were many pies shown and it all had a unique design on the top of each pie.  The person behind the counter was super friendly and told me all about Aussie pies and the Monday special. (You get a dollar off of the original Aussie pie on Mondays)   The pies were hot and flavourful, it was generously filled with stuffing and was very \"juicy\". My favourite part of the pie is the pastry!  There are stamp cards where if you get 10 stamps you get a pie for free."}
{"text":"I gave Kanga another try, following my \"only ok\" experience when they first opened. They now have a lunch special with a pie and salad or fries, for around $11. It's still a bit expensive but roughly on par with lunch prices everywhere else.   The pies themselves are much better, with a thinner, flakier crust and a better filling to pastry ratio, in my opinion. I still haven't ventured from the traditional, but the pulled pork pie looks amazing and is next on my list.   Plus points for offering frozen pies to take home and charging points for cellphones in the (small) sit down area. They also have a bench outside which is nice.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We are here on Saturday afternoon.  It's now Monday morning and I am dreaming of the Butter Chix pie that I ate.  My god, was it good.  I am currently debating paying an international shipping fee to experience the goodness again."}
{"text":"It was, how do you say... underwhelming. Having gone to the GTA's other major meat pie places I have saved my visit to Kanga for last, and it flopped mostly because of the filling.   I ordered the Canadian which was described as a steak pie made with ale gravy, which I usually get over the mince filling. Maybe that was my mistake, but the pie hardly had any steak in it! I tasted some small bits of meat with gristle, but steak it was not. The saving grace was that the gravy was at least delicious, but I would have preferred the meat portions found in almost all the other pie places over this.   At $7.25 plus tax, it wasn't cheap compared to its competition either, but I'll give it a pass for that given its downtown location. The small pie size didn't help either, nor does the fact that the top of the crust, though flaky and delicious, frequently fell out of place when biting into it, allowing the copious amounts of gravy to drip everywhere. None of this was a problem with the other pie places I've been to.   There were some good spots to the experience but I can't recommend this place when the competition like Wisey's and Pie Commission has stepped up their game so much."}
{"text":"Went there recently for lunch and ordered the el Diablo pie combo with fries. The pie itself was very good although quite small. What's interesting is that you get a massive amount of fries, more than enough for a lunch. Overall while I enjoyed the food, I feel it is a bit overpriced for what you get. $6 for a side salad at a casual lunch place is too much."}
{"text":"Really small space on Duncan street in between Queen St and Richmond. We try to pick up frozen pies here regularly and whenever we come we can't resist having one.   I get the kiwi classic almost every time. A few of my friends enjoy the butter chix which is yummy too. The pastry is so flaky and delicious. I've tried a bunch of the other fillings and they are all worth trying. Tried their flat white and I really quite enjoyed it here. Pastry (savory or sweet) and coffee just go together in my mind.  Baking the pies at home are almost foolproof since even I can do it! :-)   Seating is very limited here, kind of like a bar setup with high stools that overlook the street. They have really cool charging stations where you plug an adapter to your phone and place it over a marked spot and voila, your phone is charging. Downside is they are limited on how many adapters they have."}
{"text":"I've never been motivated to write a yelp review ever before tonight, I had the kiwi/New Zealand whatever pie and it was amazing. It tastes even better than what you imagine eating looking at their sites pictures.  Legit everyone needs to try this place."}
{"text":"Aussie meat pie kinda place ... not too far from union station, Queen West area. Small with a few seats.   For about $7-$8 you get a big-ish fist size (I have small hands) meat pie made quite uniquely. It's good, filling and comes nice and hot. Although for that price you can get more in portion elsewhere but if you're in the area I'd say still give them a try.  They have the following pies:  Traditional Aussie (minced beef with gravy), Kiwi Classic (minced beef with white cheddar), The Canadian (steak and bacon), Butter Chix (chicken curry in tomato sauce), Mum's Chicken Pie (chicken pot pie), Creamy Zucchini (zucchini and caramel with onion, garlic and cream cheese), El Diablo (pulled pork filling and mash potato top), Mates Masala Pie (Indian chickpea curry with egg plant and sweet potato) and Brekkie Pie (tomatoes, bacon, eggs and cheddar cheese).   They also have Sausage Rolls and Spinach Rolls.  They sell frozen pies in boxes too (4/ $24). Some boxes consist of one flavour and others have a variety. If you buy in box I calculated a bit cheaper than getting an individual one there.  No I did not see any kangaroo meat pies or any kind of delicacy with that kinda meat but it's not bad for what it is. Apparently they're famous for their coffees too but I didn't get to try so can't comment on that...  And if you're still not full after a pie, there's also a sawarma place next door!  Oh AND because you know I enjoy my alcoholic beverages .. they also suggest certain wine (Shiraz and Chardonnay) to go with your pies too!  Oh AND they have wireless charge spots on the tables."}
{"text":"Going to have to pull out the British card and say Aussie pies do not compare.   Came here before an event, with a friend who recommended the place. It was his treat so no complaints as we both got the combo meal.  My first thoughts were that the pies are titchy, i will need something more to eat after.  Chose the El Diablo with fries and a drink combo, and my first thoughts were definitely wrong as the pies are more filling that I imagined.  The El Diablo was the pulled pork one and it would have been nicer with some more kick in it. The top of the pie is a layer of potato mash. The fries were done fresh and came out nice and hot.  Only about 5 high stools to sit at by the windows so not an ideal eat in place."}
{"text":"I tried my first Kanga pie at TUM and have been obsessed ever since! I am so delighted that I can now buy a pie whenever my heart/stomach desires and not have to wait for the girls and their pies to return to TUM.  The pastry is always flakey, and you can truly tell that the filling is made from high quality ingredients. I serve these pies for breakfast, lunch and I have even warmed one up for myself as a midnight snack (shhhh).   I have travelled to Australia before and eaten many pies, the Kanga ladies have created a fantastic gourmet Canadian interpretation of the Australian staple food!"}
{"text":"Had the Kiwi Classic - very nice crust and easily edible with your hands. Can't wait to try their other pies."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like these because this store is so close to where I live. However, when compared to a certain other pie shop in Toronto, these pies are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Oh man, I love me some meat pies. My husband and I were visiting Toronto for the weekend and were killing time downtown before heading to the Tragically Hip concert when we decided that getting a couple of meat pies would be a wonderfully delicious way to spend some time.   We chose the Australian and the Butterchix and each had half. They were both excellent, but the Butterchix was absolutely the star of the show. Like, so good that I need to learn how to make it because they don't have anything as good anywhere near me.   Service was very friendly, and they have a nice variety of bottled drinks in the little place, and also have frozen ones available to take home. I feel like if this place was by where I lived, I'd have a problem."}
{"text":"I happen to run into  this place after an afternoon at the four seasons center for ballet. We were hungry and looking for a place to eat and it seemed great, the pies looked beautiful and we decided to give it a try. The place was kind of small but cozy. The pies tasted great but it was a bit on the pricy side ($8)."}
{"text":"I was in the queen west neighbourhood and following the raving reviews from my fellow yelper's I had to make a quick stop in here.   Came here during the lunch hour and picked up a Traditional Assie - minced beef in a rich beef gravy with a hint of vegemite. Costs averaged around ~$7 - $8 a pie depending on which pie you select. The pies are all made with 100% pure butter pastry and local, responsibly-raised meat. The pies are about a large fist size. For bigger eaters, you may want to opt to combo your meal with a side salad or fries.   The pie was really rich and tasty, and kept me satisfied for the next hour. Would have liked if there was more meaty goodness stuffed in the pie.   Time: It took about 15 mins from entry to the time I could leave the store armed with my decadently scented pie. There were two others in line before me. The store is a petite gem and on this day there was only one staff. She was fantastic at holding down the kitchen and cash, however it was clear the shop was understaffed.   Protip: arm yourself with a handful of napkins if you're going to eat the pie on the go. The buttery goodness may find a way of spreading all over your face and hands.   Check out these pies if you're already in the area. G'day mate."}
{"text":"Holy Moses, my girlfriend and I were blown away by Kanga Australian Pies.  These signature Pies that they do are made with love. Blasting your taste buds with flavor. Real close to queen st, is always a great idea, to cut in, and grab yourself a pie.  We had the Canadian, and the auzzie. Amazing. A great discovery, right around the corner from the Rex and the friendly stranger.  I will be recommending this to my friends, and I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Location/Service It's along Queen Street (pass University Ave), but on a smaller side street. The place won't be hard to miss as the exterior is very colorful/vibrant, a beach day Aussie feeling. It's a small restaurant with a few bar table seating available - it's more for a come-and-go kinda style. Interestingly, there's a wireless charging available by the table - if you are planning to sit down, remember to charge your phone (iphone + android available)!  Food I came at around 7-ish, so most of their products are sold-out. Had the opportunity to try Mum's Chicken Pie and Pepper Steak Pie. Perhaps it was almost closing time, the food may have been sitting out for a little while. So I did find the chicken a little dry and the steak a little rough to chew on. Nonetheless, the pie crust was very crisp.   Portion wise, one pie definitely won't fill you up as a meal. I shared this with a few friends, so it was a light quick snack. The staff on duty gave us a few complimentary spinach+feta rolls - those were actually pretty tasty as it was still fresh and had a strong flavor of both spinach and feta (i.e. not just a plain pastry).  I would like to come back again when there are more to choose from, also like how there's a lot of different unique cuisines around the area!"}
{"text":"I had the Traditional Aussie Meat Pie - Minced beef in a savoury gravy with a touch of vegemite.  Loved this!! The meat was very delicious and went well with the gravy. The gravy was just the perfect amount - it wasn't soupy inside nor overpower the meat. The pastry was very fluffy, and to which I find they use butter instead of shortening (a win!). As they recommend, \"best enjoyed with ketchup\". Initially I was skeptical about adding ketchup because meat plus gravy was perfect already for me. But after trying it with ketchup, there is the salt + sour combination from the gravy and ketchup that just made everything more delicious!  The fresh cut fries were awesome too!  Also had their Flat White. This was a damn good flat white, using beans from Propeller Coffee. Love the taste and the smoothness of the drink. And best of all, I didn't feel the acidity that I feel on others.  I will be back to try the other interesting pies like Kiwi Classic, El Diablo and The Canadian."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and it wasn't too busy.  Pros: - Seating - Nice ambiance - Good food  Cons: - Pricey for the quantity offered (pies are small) - No parking"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I REALLY did - I love meatpies.  But - Kanga just didn't do it for me. The filling itself was okay. The crust was (admittedly its a preference) just far too buttery and flakey. It felt more like I was just taking a bite out of a giant puff pastry with a bit of filling in the middle."}
{"text":"Soft opening today, grand opening tomorrow (Friday, May 23rd).  Australian meat pies; some with a twist.  There's a good variety of fillings so definitely something for everyone.    Flakey, buttery, and quite delicious!  Served piping hot so don't burn yourself on your first bite!  I think their prices are a tad expensive for the size of the pie, but it's still worth a taste."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I have never had anything so delicious!!!! Pulled pork def the best one. Steak is a close second. Pricing is very fair. They also offer coffee specialty drinks,, what more could u want? Hmm? The woman who works here is very kind and sweet, every time I'm here service is great. Great grab and go  bite on the run."}
{"text":"I grew up in Sydney, but haven't had a meat pie in over a decade, since I left Aus.   But these don't quite live up to what I expected. The crust was decent. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the filling of the Aussie pie (I think because of the Vegimite gravy). I've NEVER had a pie with vegemite gravy in Aus!   My suggestion is to make an option with more traditional gravy. And also have the option to put more gravy so it better resembles a true Aussie pie.   I do think its overpriced too... just under $7 after tax, and I could easily eat 2 of these (although I just heard from a mate that pies in Sydney are now $5-$6)."}
{"text":"I had a sudden urge to eat meat pies recently and decided to come here for lunch.  I gave the Butter Chix and Kiwi Classic pie a try. Both were delicious, although I preferred the Butter Chix pie more - chicken curry in a creamy tomato sauce! The Kiwi Classic pie contains minced beef filling with white cheddar cheese and has a stronger taste than the Butter Chix. It was recommended to eat with ketchup but I didn't feel the need to. The pastry was very buttery and flaky - quite delicious!  Meant to be a takeout place, the seating area is quite small, with seating enough for six people. However it wasn't really busy when I went during lunch hour and could easily get a spot to sit.  The only downside to this place is that the pies are a bit on the pricey side for the portion you get. One pie will most likely not fill you up, especially for males and others who have a good appetite!"}
{"text":"I picked up the 4 pack of frozen pies (24$) which included the traditional, creamy zucchini, butter chicken, and the Canadian (steak and bacon).   My fav was the butter chicken and the traditional meat pie. The crust on the pies is divine - they definitely use real butter.  I liked the cream zucchini the least, the flavour is just not there. The Canadian was so-so but don't think I'd have it again.   It's a little joint just south of Queen on Duncan Street. The service was fantastic! I didn't get the girl's name but she was very attentive even though she was preparing three coffee orders.   I would definitely go back and pick up a bunch of the butter chicken pies. It's so easy to prepare when you just don't feel like cooking, or you have company over."}
{"text":"Took a 4 pack home of the frozen pies. Butter chicken, and the veggie. These are crazy good. Like I wanna eat one every day good. Pastry is flaky and the pie is packed with fresh ingredients. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place a few times and decided to treat myself for lunch. I chose the $10 kanga box which featured a small basic salad (mixed greens & light balsamic dressing), a choice of a mini roll (I chose spinach & feta) and a Butter Chix pie.  To start, I think the value for the lunch special is comparable with other offerings. I've also tried other businesses lunch offerings which come in around the same price, and the value was there.  The salad was fine and got the job done. The spinach roll was delicious... I'd actually go out of my way to go back and get a full size. The pastry was super flaky and the seasoning was balanced. The butter chix pie was flavourful and delicious. It had a good amount of filling and the flavours were spot on.  This is a very small location with a handful of seats so it's best to go for takeout. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place and I really wanted to try. Walked by the other day and thought I really need to grab some.   The place is super small so it's more like a take-out or a quick bite place. It's a little hidden off to a side street and you may not notice it if you are just browsing on Queen. The staff behind the counter wasn't really friendly. Since it was my first time there, I wasn't sure what was offered and I didn't know what was in the pies. But even though she saw that I was confused, the girl behind the counter still didn't help me. Finally I found a menu \"postcard\" on top of the counter and I looked at that. They offer rolls, pies, lunch combos as well as frozen pies you can take home. I went up to the girl and told her that I wanted a Kiwi Classic, Pepper steak, El Diablo and Spinach roll.   Before she went and grabbed the pies that I wanted, she proceeded to ask what the person behind me had wanted. I understand (kind of) why she did this, so that the person behind me didn't have to wait as long, because he ordered a combo with fries. But honestly, you just need to grab the four things off the shelf it will take like 30 seconds. So instead of only waiting 30 seconds for my food, I had to wait more than 5 mins. Because everytime she grabbed a pie for me, she would go do something for the customer behind me (put fries in the fryer, warm his pie, put it on a plate. Therefore the person who's ordering a combo (who probably had expected to wait a bit longer) doesn't have to wait as long, but me who's ordering takeout (who expects it to be fast) have to wait longer. It really doesn't make sense to me.   Of course it was only a few minutes, but I was sort of in a hurry (back to work) and I was sort of pissed that she was serving the guy behind me, when I was there before him. The pies were alright, pepper steak had big chucks of steak in it. It honestly didn't taste much better than a frozen one you get at the grocery store. The El Diablo was hard on top, because of the potato and the consistency didn't seem right cause it was hard to bite into it on top. The Kiwi was actually my favourite because I thought the minced meat was much better in the pies. The spinach roll was nothing special.   Overall the food is okay. The location not that great and I did not enjoy the service at all."}
{"text":"Had the traditional meat-pie, YUM!! I have no idea what Vegemite is but is amazing. The crust on the pies are really tender and flaky definitely a great snack for a hanger over cure!  Only bad thing were the fries, they had way too much salt, easy fix and I guess they're known for the meat-pies so you can't blame them too much."}
{"text":"I had the Butter Chix Pie combo with fries.  The food itself was good enough, and I would have it again.. but as is quite often the case you walk into a place offering the authentic thing and somehow its just not there.  It was more invoking the memory of Aussie meat pies rather then the real thing.  Down under I feel they are generally more \"meat filled\" and certainly cheaper so when I had less then that for 7$/throw you know how I would feel.  If a Jesters Pies opened up beside them they wouldn't stand a chance but it is a good effort without competition in the area."}
{"text":"The pies are wonderful and the staff are courteous , a must try if your anywhere nearby."}
{"text":"The original meat pie was a good size and the filling was savoury. However, the pie was luke warm at best. I also know that some people prefer eating the pie with their hands, but I wished they had knives available for those of us who don't want to roll up our sleeves. The fries and coffee that came with the combo were mediocre. I would have given two stars if not for the friendly servers who worked there. As mentioned before, it is a tiny store with limited seating, so I would recommend taking out your pie (and maybe pop it in the microwave before you eat it)!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to sample Kanga's traditional aussie meat pie at a recent Yelp event and it was fantastic! It was definitely the highlight of the event. The buttery flakey crust (and I love anything with a good crust) was filled with the perfect blend of beef, tomato and vegemite gravy (and yes I had it with ketchup :)... I can't wait to try the full sized one at their storefront location very, very soon! #eatkanga ftw!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place was here while walking to Scotiabank Theatre to see Gone Girl. In the spirit of the film, I came back afterward to make a pie disappear (into my stomach).  I ordered the Creamy Zucchini, seeing as 1) I already knew it would be delicious based on my previous sampling at a Yelp event and 2) it was the only vegetarian option. Boo. But as I always occasionally say, if you're only going to have one veggie dish, make sure it's damn good. Which Kanga certainly does.  I hovered between 3 and 4 stars for a while because, as noted to death by virtually every single review, these tasty little tarts are overpriced by a couple dollars. We'll make it 3.5 stars with a \"must try at least once\" flag. I obviously can't vouch for the quality of any other pies on the menu, but the zucchini is a winner.  I'd also be more likely to return for ONE more different non-meat pie. How about an Aussie smoked fish pie? If you're reading this, Kanga, you're welcome to take my idea in exchange for calling it the Ell \"Sea\"."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to meat pies when I worked in central Toronto.  I was located next to a New Zealand meat pie shop and boy were their pies juicy, hot gems.  Therefore, I was an eager beaver to try Kanga's Australian pies. I had seen the smaller kiosk shops in the underground pathway of the downtown core.  My initial thought was that they have great marketing collateral, particularly with their little postcard sized guide about all their pie varieties. Unfortunately, the marketing collateral was all that I found to be positively quirky.  I tried the kiwi pie, which was recommended by both the clerk as well as  Yelpers. The kiwi pie is the cousin of the Traditional Pie but with cheese inside to give it an extra kick.  This kick wasn't really a kick though because I barely tasted any cheesiness in most of my bites and instead had mouthfuls of just minced beef and gravy.  Of course, by all means the beef and gravy had a great flavour, but the pie leaves you with a greasy after-taste that can make your stomach churn if you're not used to frequently ingesting heavy and fattening foods.  My other coworker also noted that the crust was average and was nothing to take home about, as it was similar to crusts he gets at the supermarket.  Speaking of supermarkets, I think I would prefer warming up a pie from the local grocery store rather than going to Kanga.  At least I would get double to triple the amount of pie there for the 7 dollars you pay at Kanga, where you would get a measly pie that's the size of a large palm.  The way its pricing system is laid out, it makes it hard to believe that its stamp system works as an efficient incentive.  You get a free pie after paying around $80 for pies?  Maybe there are some hardcore meat pie enthusiasts out there, but I'm just not one."}
{"text":"Little, warm, flakey bites of deliciousness! Oh so good! They have a nice variety as well. I've had the Aussie traditional and the Kiwi classic, and they were very good!  Not great for dining in, as you will not find a spot sit if it's too crowded. Although I love the hanging boomerangs.  Service was a tad slow, but the staff were really awesome."}
{"text":"Great service from the gentlemen manning the counter. Really intrigued by these delicious smelling Aussie pies. Unfortunately thai dinner awaits. I will visit another time and endulge."}
{"text":"A tiny restaurant that has a pretty big punch. I tried the traditional pie and It's pretty much the size of your hand! It's piping hot right out of the oven. My friend's pie got stuck to the aluminum so it pretty much ruined the entire pie and he had to eat it with a fork. I also got a coffee with my order and I suggest you do the same. Coffee was so good that I had to ask what it was. They showed me coffee grinds from Guatemala; definitely worth getting.   Overall, a good joint to get a quick bite to eat and be in and out within 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Kaanga caters in pies, pies pies, not only pies, Australian pies on top of that (not like I know what's the difference between normal pie and an Australian pie).   So it's on Duncan, right on the west side of downtown, I have been there 3 times and tried,  1. Mates masala: it has Indian chick peas curry inside. It's spicy, right amount. You would think the filling is a bit weird, but it totally works with the crust.   2. I got the pork and mashed potatoes: this is the only one I didn't like because of the filling. The pulled pork was kinda ok, but the mashed potatoes were not tasty. Also carb in a pie is not such a good idea.   3. Sausage roll: lightly spiced sausage with hints of fennel. Amazing   4. Spinach roll: creamy spinach and cheese roll , the filling is amazing, spinach and cheese makes it.   It's a must go if you like pies. But it's on pricier side$7 for a small pie."}
{"text":"Good Australian style pies.  Great service but a bit pricy to eat at daily.  Desserts are a nice treat."}
{"text":"Love the boutique feeling and the friendly service at the counter. The pie is reminiscent of better quality fresh-made meat pies. Pastry is really fantastic. The beef is fresh and of good quality (yes, even with minced meat, it's possible to detect quality :).    To those that would compare this with a Jamaican patty, I'd say they are two different things entirely. The pastry here is of the fluffy phyllo variety, and the feeing is much heartier and has a homemade texture and taste.   That said, I had the urge to go instead to a particular restaurant on King St W (rhymes with Har Bop) that serves many local craft beers and makes meat pies in-house daily (rather than heated from frozen like Kanga) that taste like heaven. However those pies are double the price, double the calories (for sure) and take a long time to come to the table.    For the quick, drop-in convenience and homemade-level quality (and the novelty) I'd say these are worth a try... but honestly the traditional I had was a bit boring and predictable, and  oilier than I anticipated.   In conclusion, ~8 dollars and 20 minutes later, I'm still hungry after my \"Traditional\" pie. :/"}
{"text":"My tastebuds fell in love with their Aussie meatpies when I had a chance encounter with their booth at a Toronto Underground Market event many moons ago. And it's never been the same since whenever I look at pies.  Their savoury meat pies are the bees knees, to my taste buds and tummy. I don't know if it's crack or cocaine (or maybe both) that they add as a secret ingredient, but their pies are f^&%g delicious.  I always want MOAR!  It may make my gut a but softer, but whatever, that's why I lift heavy - to be able to to squeeze in a pie or two from Kanga :)  The owners, Erynn and Megan are absolutely delightful. I recall seeing their Kickstarter campaign and I immediately fell in love with their story, enthusiasm, their infectious smiles and adorable faux Australian accents.  I had the chance encounter with them at one of Propeller Coffee's Barista Latte Art Throwdowns over a beer. I have to say, they're just as delightful in person as they were on camera.  Oh, did I mention they serve some pretty dope coffee as well? They were trained by the folks behind Propeller Coffee who also own Crema Coffee, so their coffee is just as good if not better!  Back to the pies.  While a bit pricy, you certainly get what you pay for as they're just the right size to hit the spot whether a snack or for lunch.  Now if only they opened up late so I can get a late night snack...."}
{"text":"I past by this place almost everyday when I go to school and never tried it until recently. I'm so glad I tried it because the pies are absolutely delicious!  I ordered on Ritual so the service was pretty fast and the people working there were really friendly. I got a meal combo which consisted of a Kiwi Classic meat pie, a spinach & feta roll and a small container of mashed potato. It was really filling and tasty! I can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"I popped in for a quick snack. I had the zucchini pie and it was amazing  So garlicky and the pastry was flaky and buttery. I tried a bite of my friends sausage roll and it also was yummy. The sausage was spiced nicely and the same flaky crust was around it. A great snack!"}
{"text":"Tried to order with them on Uber. One of the worst experiences every.The restaurant cancelled my order after uber had charged my act.  All because the can't update there menu to what's in stock and what's not.  30.00 now having to be returned to me by uber in the next 5-10 days. Great experience.  Thanks alot"}
{"text":"Came here at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night, just before they closed at 9pm. I got the chicken pot pie (~$7) and it was so delicious! The pastry is buttery, rich and flaky and the filling is comforting and creamy. I just wished there was more of it because it only took a few bites to devour it.   I'd come back for the pies once in a while--the food is dynamite--however, the service I got on that particular day wasn't very welcoming. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I walked out, the lady behind the counter only spoke to me when I paid (she asked if it was only the pies that I wanted). No greeting, no \"Can I help you?\", no thank you, no warmth.   I was also disappointed in the fact that they don't label the pies when they pack it for you. I had bought a couple different pies and they all look the same and I didn't want to cut into them because I was giving some away."}
{"text":"Excellent savory pies.  I had the Peppery Beef pie - very savory with a great pleasant peppery finished.  My wife liked the Spinach and Feta roll - the best she's had .  My son's enjoyed the Classic and the Butter Chix - Indian Butter Chicken.  Good filling snack"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Kanga for quite a while now. I love pies, savory or sweet. I heard the prices were good too. Walking in here, it smelled incredible! The prices were as I heard, but the portions for the price aren't as fantastic as I thought they'd be. I would consider myself a person with an average appetite, and I'm pretty sure I could easily eat two of their pies, which makes it a less than cheap meal.   They have meat pie Mondays now, which means their traditional Aussie pie is $6.50 after tax. I got one of those, but brought it home. My brother ate it, so I have no clue what it tasted like. I had a snack sized spinach and feta roll though. It was amazing! It was about three bites, and cost me just over $2, but it was like no other spinach and feta roll I've ever eaten. The filling was so soft and basically oozed out. The pastry was flaky and also delicious.   I still haven't eaten their pies, so I'm doing that next time."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for savoury pies, and this establishment hit the spot!   After reading the reviews we tried the traditional and the butter chix combos with both the spinach and the sausage half rolls (+fries and gravy)   The pies themselves were delicious and flaky.  I preferred the butter chicken (tasty and not spicy hot) while my husband liked the traditional more. The spinach roll was good, but I didn't love the taste of the sausage roll.  Fries were good, but I couldn't really taste the chicken salt (?) that was advertised. Gravy had a fancier wine taste which was a bit unexpected.   Agree that the pies were on the smaller side and a tad pricey, but the combo filled us up just fine.   Totally the place to go to if your in the mood for comfort meat pies!"}
{"text":"I got the creamy zucchini and mates masala are so good. i've been craving it for days.  So much flavours. You cannot have too much of them. I almost said yummy, these pies almost make me a foodie...almost"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on the recommendation of my Aussie friend who recently discovered it.  I had the chicken curry pie and though it was delicious, the $9 price tag threw me.  I was expecting a larger portion at that price.  When they handed over my tiny pie, I felt like someone was handing me one of those single serving frozen pies you can pick up at the grocery store, the kind you re-heat in your oven and serve with SIDES because one teensy tiny pie isn't a meal.  For $9, I expect a meal!  At that price, one visit is sufficient.  I tried it once - good enough."}
{"text":"Had the Traditional pie today. Nice balance of filling and ingredients to pastry. Good overall flavour, not overwhelming like some of the other places I've tried. Pastry good but not as flakey as the best.  All in all though a good pie!  Friendly service, clean establishment.   Update 09/2016 - over the past year have eaten here a few times and it's been consistently excellent. On my last visit they had a new pie - peppery steak.  Great flavour, huge chunks of beef, and the usual excellent flakey crust. Nice!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny little hole in the wall that looks like half a bakery or diner. There are about six seats at a cramped bar, but you don't come here for ambiance.  You come for meat pies. My wife had the Kiwi, and I had the Canadian. They were both flaky and delicious, and not scalding hot as the sun, like most places serve pies.  A tad pricey for what you get, but very tasty. If it's cold outside, and it was for mid-June, this is a nice place to stop and refuel."}
{"text":"Flaky, crispy hot meat pies. Have tried the Canadian, Creamy Zucchini, and El Diablo - all great choices! Love the heartiness of the Canadian, the mash potatoes that top the El Diablo  DO try the lamingtons and pecan bar - they are so, so, so very good chilled!"}
{"text":"Only ever had the frozen meat pies from the grocery store so was very happy to try the real deal.  These pies are stuffed with meat and veggies and has an amazing crispy top. I'd recommend Kanga more for a quick bite or a snack rather than a meal. The pies are $7 which I'd like to see a little cheaper seeing it's not a full meal more of a snack.  My favorite pie were traditional (beef) and El Diablo (pulled pork)"}
{"text":"so i decided to give this place a try after walking past it so many times and reading so many good reviews on it.   first of all, it was quite expensive for the size they give you. like around $8-10 is pretty ridiculous. it's smaller than the size of my face ok.  second, the taste was alright. i had such high hopes and it didn't taste like how i would imagine it to taste like. i would rather walk down to owl of Minerva down on spadina then to eat this. i could get a pork bone soup for around that much. honestly."}
{"text":"Tired their pies. Very delicious. I'm giving the 3 star just because the food was good quality. Very pricey for the quantity they provide. The pies are like really small. U ve to eat like 3 of them to just fill u up. One pie is like $7.50. I've had better quality n quantity for same price range."}
{"text":"Stumbled into Kanga unexpectedly and I was super excited as I have heard good things about this place. It was mid-afternoon and there were a wide variety of pie to choose from. Pie also came out fresh from the oven and it smelled amazing! I opted for the Traditional Australian meat pie as one, I have never had one before so I thought why not keep it original and two, it was fresh out of the oven! I got this 'to go' and it was still really good after an hour before I got home. The pie crust was perfect- buttery and flakey. The filling was tasty with the right amount of meat filling.  I will definitely be trying the other pies when I get a chance. Also they have these wireless chargers if you happen to have no juice in your phone and want to enjoy some pie!"}
{"text":"Great takeout place for authentic srilankan/Tamil food. It is very affordable. Saturday/Sunday 5$ briyani specials are best."}
{"text":"Small take out restaurant in a strip mall near the corner of St. Clair and Victoria park. No menu or prices posted, j ust have to point and ask. Their meals are super cheap $5 meals that come with a ton of rice and a veggie side. Tried their roti (75 cents a piece). It was thick and chewy and the taste reminded me of a pancake. Ordered their chicken wings. Generous portion, crispy and tasty. For those who remember Pioneer Fried Chicken the wings tasted like they came from there. Then ordered the shrimp curry and the mutton, tasty and surprisingly mildly spiced for a Sri Lankan dish. I would have given it a higher rating but the food wasn't even warm. Better to come  when it first opens up so the food will be hot."}
{"text":"Good pies! My friend and I each had an original and it was great. A little expensive for what it is, but a good snack / small meal. Coffee was alright too. I'm from Texas and only here for vacation, so I don't know when I'll find something like this again, but I hope I will in the future!"}
{"text":"This takes me back to when I was in primary school and the school tuck shop had these delicious sausage rolls and hot british meat pies. So satisfying.  I personally wish you could taste the marmite more but overall delicious and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Walked by and saw a sign indicating \"damn good coffee\". I had to take them up on the challenge. Ordered a \"Cortado\"... and DAMN - it was good.  Their Pies - Kiwi, Mama, and Butter Chix were extremely flakey, greasy, super flavourful and my kids (3 and 5 year olds) liked them which is a huge selling point."}
{"text":"After reading a lot about this joint I was very excited to try it out. However, I didn't have the best experience. I asked for my food to go but when I got back to my office there were no utensils packed and not even a single napkin which was quite frustrating since this type of food has a lot of oil. The pie was very tasty but lukewarm temperature. It was also not as big or filling as I thought it would be and I was still hungry after. I wish I had ordered two but spending $12 on two small pies didn't seem worth it. I probably won't return here."}
{"text":"Aussie pies? Never even heard of such a thing (I apologize if I've insulted anyone). But damn! this stuff is GOOD.  An assortment of gooey, saucey and flavourful fillings wrapped in a flaky, buttery phyllo crust. What more can one ask for? Aromatic and tastes off the charts!  I don't know of any other places in the GTA that serve meat pies and especially Aussie meat pies so I can't compare But whatever I have eaten here, be it chicken, beef or just simply veggies, they are all so satisfying. Butter chicken is my favourite so far.  The only quibble I have is that one is just not quite enough and 2 maybe a bit much. They are an odd size (about the size of a clench fist).  They also have this stuff frozen and in bulk so you can eat this stuff at home.  Definitely drop by and give them a try. I love this stuff."}
{"text":"Very expensive for the quality and the size of pie. Small sized, luke warm, nothing special. Save your money"}
{"text":"Pro: Pies are delicious.   I bought Aussie Traditional and Kiwi Classic. I like the Aussie Traditional more but they are both very delicious. Now I kindda want more!   Cons: I didn't care for the staff much. He was being a joker and forgot about our order. Also, I wished he would label which pie was which because I had to refer to yelpers pictures to figure it out."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is an \"authentic\" Aussie meat pie in Canada! I miss the meat pies in Australia, especially when i lived there for 5 years since my childhood days.  Although the meat pies are very pricey, i think it was very worth the price because of the food and the way they made the pies from scratch.  The place is tucked in the corner near momofuku though, so im pretty sure people will have a hard time looking for the place. The inside of the store is very cute, it has the Aussie fast food place feeling, like i remember back then.  I will def go back to the place to try out other meat pie flavours they have."}
{"text":"I thought the pies were just 'OK' based on the cost. I would give it 4 stars if it were cheaper but for the price the quality and taste was not out of this world.I had the butter chicken and classic beef. To be honest i think Pie Commission is the better place for pies."}
{"text":"Overrated. It's a simple meat pie. No need to go deliberately for it."}
{"text":"I walk past kanga everyday and finally rewarded myself with a visit after a stressful day. Being a kiwi i had to get the kiwi classic mince and cheese pie. The pastry top is beautifully flaky but the base I thought a bit thick. Filling was yummy and even had the cheese sticking to the top. Not quite the same as a Georgie pie (my barometer of an awesome pie) but it was tasty and hit the spot.  As previous yelpers have mentioned it is quite exxy for the price $8. The service is lovely."}
{"text":"I love savoury pies but these pies somehow didn't really hit the spot. The pie crust was kind of dry and not very flavourful. The filling was good however but I was really craving some mash to go with it.The size of the pie is also very small. I would say the pies are more of a snack than a full meal."}
{"text":"Hey fellow nerds. Today, 3/14th is Pi day 3.1415920 so get your nerd on and eat plenty of pies pies pies.  Kanga's pies are so buttery, so flaky, and so good. Go there early to get best of selections. These are savory pies. And one pie is very filling. I usually get the \"creamy zucchini\" or \"steak and mushroom\". Small establishment. Most guests take it to go."}
{"text":"Came here and got 2 pies. The Canadian and the traditional. The pies were of good quality, decent size for one person.  3 stars since there's not many meat pie places to compare against and the food was on par. Not mind blowing, which is why I'm reluctant to give it 5 stars. I would give it 3.5 if possible."}
{"text":"I got the El Diablo, the spinach roll, sausage roll as well as the meat lover's pack of 4 pies a couple weeks ago. The El Diablo was kinda weird tasting, not that any of the ingredients were bad but pulled pork + mashed potatoes was... Interesting.  The other four pies that I made at home were pretty good though, but for $6 a pop I think they're quite expensive. In summary, the pies are decent but not really worth the $6, maybe $5 at most. The rolls were alright as well, nothing exceptional but certainly not bad.   Also, it would've been nice if the store also baked the pies that you got in-store because when I got mine they, along with the rolls, were about room temperature (not even warm) and in comparison to the ones I made at home, the pies are so much better when they are piping hot."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious, flaky, buttery crust. Heaven. I tried their traditional, masala and butter chicken pies. Everything was really good! I wish their made dessert pies too. Great place to grab a few pies for a quick meal. I need apple pie please."}
{"text":"I love kanga pies!!! Soooo good!! Honestly all their pies are good.. the sausage roll not so much.. their puff pastry is perfect puff pastry. I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I get lunch from them sometimes........a pie, half a roll and potatoes. Nice and filling. I do wish the pies were more spicy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really, REALLY wanted to. But somehow I just didn't. I ordered three different pies through Hurrier and got to eat them in the comfort of my own home...but they just weren't very good. I ordered the Diablo with pulled pork and mashed potatoes, the original, and the kiwi classic. They were edible...but I found the crust was very dry and they were a bit overlooked, and there really wasn't much filling in any of the pies. They were simply underwhelming. I probably wouldn't order from there again."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for a bite as I was in the area. Tried the traditional and creamy zucchini... Loved it! The pie crust was flaky, lots of texture. The fillings were seasoned very well, nice balance overall and super yummy! :) I liked it so much I bought the fav4 pack to go to bring home! Their coffee is also really good. The expression blend was excellent. Totally enjoyed my cup of joe :) would definitely come by next time I'm down in the area again! Seems Pretty authentic :) staff are super friendly and helpful with suggestions as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for Pi Day! We originally intended to go to Pie Squared, but they close at 7PM on Saturdays, so Kanga it was! Got there around 7:30ish and the only pies they had left were Traditional and Canadian. We bought one of each and split them.  The Traditional was definitely my favorite of the two. Full of flavor, with little chunks of potato and onion. The Canadian was more gravy-flavored with pieces of tender beef, however, I found myself adding sriracha to it to make it more interesting. As good as they are, I find them to be a tad over-priced. We came here for a special occasion but I can't see myself coming regularly for that price.  The place was being taken care of by one woman who was friendly and nice. I liked the fact that they have charge spots to let you power your phone while you chow."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try out kanga pies at a recent yelp event, and I was very impressed. The classic meat pie was delicious, perfectly seasoned and was generous in the gravy (which I love). The creamy zucchini was also fantastic and as someone who generally needs to have meat in everything to be satisfied, I was very impressed with the full flavour of the meatless pie.   I can't wait to check out the shop and try more!"}
{"text":"Tried the Australian traditional combo along with spinach roll and a Aussie salad. I had several Aussie pies when I visited Australia. Kanga tastes nothing like those. In fact, I can't distinguish their pies from just any ordinary meat pie from just about anywhere. Not terrible, but really nothing special. I think maybe even below average in terms of meat pies in general."}
{"text":"Been twice, enjoyed it twice. Handheld buttery flake pies of meat and gravy. Makes me happy every time.  Why aren't there more meat pie shops in the city?! This needs to happen.   If only Kanga had Sausage Rolls left...missed out both times. If they're anything like the Pie Commission Sausage Roll I may need to move West of Yonge."}
{"text":"Cute hole in the wall. We got the original and the butter chicken - both were great but the original was definitely my favourite. Really flakey crispy crust with a savoury filling. A little off Queen st but worth the extra 2 seconds it takes to get there. Little bit steep ($15 for two pies) but not unreasonable at all."}
{"text":"I didn't know Toronto had Australian pies, so I decided to give Kanga a go. It's a cozy shop with 5 or 6 seats. The service was indifferent. The woman at the counter seemed disinterested. The food was alright, but the pies were expensive for their size. It was about $7 a piece, and each pie was a bit larger than my fist. The pies were mildly warm, and not as hot as I liked. They should've been reheated before being served. The crust was flakey, but not the best I've had; but, there was a nice buttery taste. Between the Traditional Aussie, Kiwi, and Creamy Zucchini, I liked the creamy zucchini the best. Other than being creamy, there was a heavy pepper taste (black pepper lovers rejoice). I happened to be there when deliveries were being made, and it seems like the pies are not house made and are frozen (I may be wrong here). Regardless, Kanga is a neat place to go with a small group. There's also wireless charging for guests to use while they eat."}
{"text":"small, quick serve lil joint downtown, just off of queen street, with five to six seats  tradish aussie pie minced beef in a gravy with a unique flavour  seems like a blend of subtle spices my palate can't discern too well  god bless flaky crust the way a good pie should be i'd have it again!  impressive menu boasting various options no kanga meat though  like a boomerang, i left right after i ate, but i'll come back soon"}
{"text":"Bomb kothu rotti!!! Good prices.... just call ahead to make sure they have what you want!"}
{"text":"It's pricey for the size of pie. $7 for a pie the size of your palm. often times they run out of the flavour. also no place to seat so best is for take-out"}
{"text":"Pies are $7 but they're small, smaller than your palm. Pie shell was delicious (claimed to be all butter and I don't doubt it). At $7 and being small, I expected it to be stuffed with filling - like when you bite it, filling should be oozing out. Nope. It was half empty. I scooped out the filling and you couldn't make a mcd hamburger patty out of the meat from there. Should have taken the photo. I suspect the location and running the oven drive up the cost, which result in mediocre pies. Savoury pies are good alternative to all the fast food, burrito, shawarma places but I don't recommend this for a lunch. Shame."}
{"text":"$7.50 later, im left still hungry. Don't get me wrong, it's great commercial meat pie (ie buttery). But to me this is a substitute for a beef patty which costs about $1.80.   Overpriced but quick, so I sometimes get it and immediately regret it after I finish eating it (which is about 5 mins because it's tiny).  And just FYI, girls think the pie is small and unfilling too.   2.5 stars out of 5   Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"I got the frozen pies, and when I baked them up at home, the pastry puffed up all light and flaky, with the filling all perfect inside. Some of the other reviews didn't find the filling all that special, and the main Aussie filling is largely ground beef + sauce + Vegemite, which might be nothing special for most people. I thought it was tasty, for what it was.   I also tried the Kiwi pie and the pulled pork pie, but the butter chicken was the most memorable :)  I would eat that tasty butter chicken filling on its own, but it works really well in the flaky pastry."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying savory pies, and I'm definitely sold! The menu is quite small, which is perfect for indecisive foodies! I got two fresh pies, specifically the Canadian (beef and bacon) and masala vegetarian. I loved both options! The filling was very flavourful and the butter crust is to die for.   Before I took my first bite of the pies, I already decided to buy the pack of four frozen pies for later. This was the best decision of the day!  We came on a Friday evening around 6pm, and the tine store was crammed with people. It's impossible to tell where the line starts and ends, but it moved very quickly. Glad that I got my pack of frozen pies because I was not ready to line up again!   There's definitely no room to eat inside the store, so we ate our pies on the bench outside in the cold. This didn't bother us at all, because the pies were totally worthwhile to be eaten in the cold!"}
{"text":"Reserving final review for now, but: so far, the traditional pie, with ketchup, was divine. I suppose it could have used more filling. The sausage roll? Ummm...I like a traditional SR, and this was not it. Pass. Verdict? I can't wait to go back at lunchtime for more meaty pies!"}
{"text":"Love the Pies but hate the fries. Either they put too much salt (chicken salt/regular) or not at all. And they changed from shoestring fries to the thicker ones. I prefer the shoestrings =]"}
{"text":"Delicious pie! Got minced meat and was too minced for my liking (felt like could be those frozen dinner things).  I would love to try others though.  The butter chicken was highly recommended.  This is an easy takeout spot. The pie came in a small ghetto paper brown bag. So be careful not to get it too soggy.  location is decent as it is on queen st."}
{"text":"Yum. So much yum. The pastry is what the pastry in your dreams tastes like -- so buttery, so flaky, and so perfectly brown and crispy. I have tried butter chicken and the classic australian beef and preferred the former. The fries with chicken salt were also pretty special, though I wouldn't make a special trip for them.  All in all I'm so glad I found this place! Go there and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Australian meat pies. Had the original which was fairly tasty, but my only knock on it is that it comes out lukewarm, which is a bit disappointing. I think it would taste better if it was a bit hotter.   Not really sure how they're made. They ran out of the butter chicken pie and said they won't expect another shipment for a few days, which makes me wonder how they're made and how long they sit there before I order one.   The fries are pretty flavorful. The chicken salt is very tasty, but the fries aren't crisp and some of the fries are a bit droopy."}
{"text":"I love these damn pies. Had them at a Yelp event & been in love with them ever since. Finally went to the Queen/Spadina area last week & made a trip just for 4 pies ($30 after tax!). IMHO, they are a bit expensive & it could be a little bigger. But they are so good it almost doesn't matter.   My fav is the creamy zucchini & traditional. Absolutely to die for! Tried making these on my own, but it is just not the same. Yummy buttery crust ^^ I hope they open up more locations up north! I would be there lining up almost everyday....  The shop is nice & there is a little area to sit down & finish it. I was greeted right away & the girl was telling me which was the most popular etc. But before she got into her speech I kinda cut her off & told her what I wanted lol She was so nice & also included a chart which helps identify the type of pie so you don't mix them up."}
{"text":"Just had a lunch for $15 which included a butter chicken pie, Aussie Salad and coffee. All were so tasty! The pie was filling and full of flavor, the salad is made fresh with a light flavor dressing, goat chs, roasted nuts and cranberries with a beautiful medium roast coffee. Cool spot for a quick lunch just off queen."}
{"text":"Delicious pies, a bit pricey if you're super hungry. LOVE their cookies"}
{"text":"Amazing pies!! I tried their secret menu Pie-tine (Poutine with a Pie on it) and I have to say that it is one of the best things I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"The aroma when you walk in the door - it's like you've gone to warm buttery heaven!  The pies were truly delicious with buttery crusts and rich hot tasty fillings with a variety of flavours (and vegetarian options available!) which you can buy piping hot or frozen to cook at home.  The Aussie side salad was also a pleasant surprise with it's arugula, baby spinach, beets, goat cheese all in a yummy honey-balsamic dressing!   It was love at first bite! But the best part is that the owners Megan and Erynn are absolutely lovely to work with! We had a luncheon in the office today and they were very helpful in assisting me with ordering and the food was piping hot and ready on time for pick-up, and they were a huge hit with everyone! So just give them a bit of notice and they can easily handle larger orders (we're around 15 people)!  Fantastic food, awesome experience, we will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Must try: Butter Chix  This little pie shop offers a homey treat that will leave you wanting more.   We had the Butter Chix and the Mum's Chicken Pie, both were delicious and satisfying. Butter Chix definitely takes the \"pie\" (heh, get it) since it was super buttery and tasted exactly like the best bite of your chicken curry + nann combo. The chicken pie wasn't bad either (but may be because I have a soft spot for pot pies... to my friend apparently the filling tasted like those canned chicken pot pie soup?).  The price was a little steep though given the size... it will definitely be a once-in-a-while, if-I-deserve-it kind of treat."}
{"text":"Good for a light on the go snack. I tried a couple of Kanga  pies and preferred the more classic ones (Kiwi Classic, Traditional Aussie or the Canadian) much more.  I wasn't a fan of the more unique ones - the ones with an Indian flair or the vegetarian one. It just didn't taste right to me for a meat pie.  Each pie at Kanga is around $7 which I think is pretty pricy for the portion. However, you can't find these kind of meat pies at many places and they transport well if you choose to bring some home to heat up in the oven for a snack."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey, but very well executed. We sampled three for dinner between two of us and both the butter chicken and creamy zucchini were nom nom nom. An excellent place for a quick tourist meal."}
{"text":"Very little meat in the pie. I was mostly just eating pastry. I lived in Australia and ate tons of pies when I was there. Kanga unfortunately falls way short of what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"My husband and I had these pies last weekend and I wish we got more! The pie crust was perfect and the fillings were all so flavourful. They have 4 filling  types including a creamy zucchini one. Conveniently available at Kensington and Roncesvalles. I've also seen them at various food shows and events.  I'll be going back for more soon! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Love the pies here!! I always get the lunch special - a regular meat pie, a little side pie and a salad.  For $10 it's a pretty tasty lunch. I could definitely eat 2 of the main pies though. My favourite is the butter chix."}
{"text":"As others have already perfectly summed it up, the verdict is: tasty, but overpriced, pies!  Mine cost $9 with tax and to be honest, it wasn't even to fill me up! To buy two small pies will put you at $15-$20, and considering this is a small take out joint with only a couple stools, it's not really an affordable lunch option.  I can't see them staying in business unless they fix up them prices!  I did have a very delicious pie though - pulled pork with mashed potato on top :)"}
{"text":"3.5*   Kanga served as a perfect option for a quick pre-show snack on a weekend evening when most other Queen St. establishments in the area had a long lineup.   The service was fine for a quick takeout place and the person serving us took the time to explain what was inside each pie (probably for the umpteenth time that day)! The prices were alright as well and around what you would expect. I would say sharing 3 pies between 2 people would do the trick in terms of portions.   As for the pies themselves, I found the pepper-steak surprisingly flavourful and well balanced. The pie was fresh and the proportion of filling:pie was on point. On the other hand, I was not nearly as impressed with the butter chicken as I found the flavour a little overpowering.   Overall, Kanga is probably your best bet for a delicious snack on an otherwise bland Queen W. block."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Kanga. Came here on Pi day and tried the Traditional and Canadian. All the pies are baked fresh which leaves less variety when busy. I really liked the Canadian and the chunks of beef were huge. I do think that the pies are overpriced for what it is, probably won't be coming back anytime soon because I'd rather get a bowl of pho for the same price."}
{"text":"Ive never been to Australia so I dont know what authentic Australian meat pie is supposed to look/taste like. All I know is that I've never seen an Australian meat pie shop anywhere else (outside of Toronto and America), everything is baked fresh daily, diff varieties, take debit and credit and did not rip off an idea from a restaurant/vendor aka original. I had the chicken pot pie inspired one and it was really good- chunks of chicken in a spicy curry-like sauce and the crust was super flaky and buttery. Yum.   Definitely coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"Kanga, where have you been all my life? After sampling Kanga's Aussie meat pies at a Yelp's Summer Fling event, Kanga has officially become my favourite pie joint. Their 100% butter pastry Aussie meat pies are INCREDIBLE! The traditional Aussie minced beef pies in tomato and vegemite gravy are out of the world.   a splash of ketchup + a splash of surfer love = sinfully delicious 3.14  The creamy zucchini pie is just as (if not more) delightful! The pie consists of peppery garlic cream cheese sauce, mixed with roasted zucchini, caramelized onion and some extremely addictive substance I cannot put my finger on.   Well played Kanga, well played. I will be back in my stretchy pants for your Kiwi Classic, The Canadian (Steak & Bacon), Butter Chix, Mum's Chicken Pie, El Diablo, Mates' Masala, Brekkie, sausage roll and spinach roll!"}
{"text":"Best meat pies ever! Layers n layers of flaky delicious tummy happiness. I had the kiwi pie which is beef n white cheddar."}
{"text":"Oh god, words cannot express how extremely delighted and happy my tastebuds are after taking a bite out of the butter chix. I certainly couldn't help myself as I completely devoured the delicacy known as curry chicken in a fluffy pie crust and as I fell to temptation, I took a bite out of the minced beef pie and literally cried tears of joy.   I bought the box of four for $24 and while that's venturing on the danger line, I'm going to tell you now that those few thousands of calories are totally worth it.  I'm craving for that delicious moment when I'm finally able to introduce my tastebuds to the traditional Aussie meat pie."}
{"text":"We tried the minced meat pie, the chickpea pie, the peppered steak pie, the sausage roll, mushy peas and gravy. Got from uber eats. All the pies were amazing, very tasty. However we had ordered the butter chicken pie, but got chickpea pie instead and we ordered spinach feta roll and got sausage roll instead so half our order was incorrect. The gravy was not good, I wouldn't recommend it. It was little gelatinous lumps. The half sausage roll was burnt black and didn't taste good. The mushy peas were our least favourite part of the meal. It just tasted really, really bad. The colour was gray and the texture was off putting. I would definitely go back for the pies but will skip all the sides and add ons."}
{"text":"A nice find!! Their coffees were good and the desserts better!! A little Aussie experience in Toronto... That's how we do!!"}
