{"text":"This locally owned pizza place makes you feel at home. The pizza is down right great. Owner always there with a smile and a how are you today. If you have not stopped by you better soon. Why would you stop at a chain when you have a great local pizza place that makes all dough and sauce from scratch. Stop on and say hi to your next home away from home."}
{"text":"I must admit I love Tasty's. A nice family run Pizza and then some restaurant. When
I saw they have artichokes I knew I would love it here and come back again and again.
Now they have whole wheat and even glutten free crust that is delicious and really
nutritious. May I please suggest Kalmata Olives they pair nicely with artichokes and
garlic white sauce and I'd be honored to order vegetarian and vegan cheese
options. All I can say is Yum Good work Tasty 

All The Best,
Sandy"}
{"text":"This place is the home for laid back atmosphere, good food, and coolers full of beer.  Tasty's is the place friends go to have a good meal and good fun.  Great atmosphere for kids."}
{"text":"Love this Pizza! Perfect amount of sauce, always hot out of the oven! They say 20 minutes and it's ready for pickup in 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza spot with an old school vibe.  You order your pizza from the counter and then can either sit in their large dining room and eat there or take it out.  The dining area is mainly self serve where you get your own plates, napkins and silver wear.  You can also serve yourself beverages (including a decent selection of beer and wine) from their coolers.  When you are done eating, you let them know what and how many you had and they add it to your bill.  

The pizza is decent.  Good sauce and a great selection of toppings.  I usually ask them to cook my pie a little well done as I feel like it can be a bit soggy/limp if you get a few toppings and don't have it cooked a little extra.  

Definitely a neighborhood place with a lot of regulars who know each other by name."}
{"text":"Great local hangout and ambiance. The first impression is a place for families and friends. Lots of regulars on a Friday night. Small, cozy, with a fun self-serve and honor system for cashing out. Fast service. The salad was a typical honeymoon style (lettuce alone - an old spouse joke) with lots of cheese and a pepper. The pizza is cheesy, a crunchy crust, slightly sweet, flaky. A bit doughy but that is typical I find for the Midwest. Toppings were plentiful. Very good. A place to go for a casual good pizza. I recommend highly. Say hi to joe!"}
{"text":"Go on Mondays for the buy one get one free pasta. The Cavatelli with meatball is the belle of the ball. You get a side salad with some pretty legit Italian dressing (we take the extras home and put it in the fridge). Nothing fancy. No frills. Just about the best damn bargain I've found in the East side of Cleveland. Love this place."}
{"text":"I just don't understand what all the fuss is about.  My friends rave about this place and I was eager to give it a chance -- their laid-back approach to dining appealed to me and I loved the idea of a \"help yourself\" beer cooler.  But once I got there I found the \"laid-back\" staff to border on inattentive and the \"help yourself\" beer cooler to be blocked by loud families waiting to place their order at the counter.  The dining room was cramped and uncomfortable, and I found the idea of cutting through the kitchen (past the guy dishing out salad) to get to the restroom kind of gross.  My friends love it for it's homey feel but I would rather have pizza delivered to my actual home.  Sorry Tasty's, I think I'll pass on you next time, but I know you'll be fine -- you have hordes of loyal fans."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and salad.  Also for some reason the extra large pizza has the best tasting pizza.  
I have had the pasta only once and it was fair.
They do slice the sausage, which is unique.  And the cheese is on top and the \"toppings are below the cheese."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from work and my wife wanted me to bring home a pizza. She asked me about this place and told her I have never ordered from Tasty's before. I called placed the order for a large one topping pizza. When I got there the store looked a little dirty but I probably got there after the dinner rush so that wasn't a huge deal. The reason I'm giving two stars is because the pizza was $16 !!! With all the pizza places around this has to be the most expensive place in the area. The pizza was decent but not worth the $16 price tag. There are much better local places for a pizza and you'll pay way less. The owner needs to wake up and see what other places are charging."}
{"text":"The counter guy is overworked and has no help. He has no customer service skills. The pizza is like cardboard, frozen grocery store pizza would be better. I watch as the guy goes from food to money to food barehanded without washing. He really needs help. This place is a one and done."}
{"text":"You either like the sauce... Or you don't.  I will come back to that in a second.  I LOVE the old school setup of this place.  Place your order at the counter, take a seat in the back, and your food is delivered to you.  You are responsible for getting your own eating utensils and plates.  Back to the food... Garlic bread with cheese is killer good.  Did I mention how good the garlic bread is?  Don't you dare miss it.  The pizza?  Hard to describe the sauce as I think it is an acquired taste.  It is thick and less garlicky and tomatoey and more oregano and basil than most places.  Suburbia-wise around here I think it is tough to beat the sauce at Tommy V's.  Crust is very good on its own.  Underneath the sauce and toppings it gets lost taste- wise but on its own dddddaaaammmnnnn it is good."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. I called in and was placed on hold immediately. And I waited. And waited. I hung up. I called back and explained to the young man who answered what happened his response? Do you want to order or not? I said, will you forget to place the order since you forgot to get the call on hold? And he hung up. I called back and spoke to the manager. I eventually ordered. Delivery wasn't available. Great. I picked it up and got a stare down from the young man. Lovely. Attitude was unreal. I won't be going back because I felt uncomfortable. The chip on his shoulders while he drank his smoothie from Pulp was typical.
Thank you Tasty for making my first and last experience here memorable. I won't return and won't let anyone I know go there."}
{"text":"Tasty Pizza USED to be a good place for a relaxing salad and a slice.  No longer. We were the only customers in the restaurant. I  had a groupon, and was told they no longer accept it. OK, so we ordered our pizza and tried to order salads. Were told we had to go to the kitchen to order it.  We served ourselves our water, utensils and plates. Not a problem.
Pizza came out looking good.  Not what it used to be.  It was ok .. the veggie pizza had a lot of liquid on the pizza pan, meaning the veggies were not precooked and weeped all over. No one else in the place, so the manager and his 3-4 helpers seated themselves and loudly had a private party.
What used to be a go to place will no longer be. Sorry guys, but if you changed owners, perhaps you should have kept their recipes.  Prices have gone up a lot. $15 for a 12\" pizza with a few slice of topping was not worth it.
Perhaps the owner who seemed to be doing the cooking could have had a better attitude toward customers.  Grouchy doesn't work."}
{"text":"I joined yelp so no one else would make a mistake and buy pizza from here. This pizza stunk. No flavor, almost no toppings, 15 bucks for a tiny pizza, and I actually wish I would have bought a pizza from Aldi...that tastes better.

If you want real pizza, drive 40miles south to Luigi's in Akron...bring cash, best pizza in NE Ohio"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what you get. I was surprised when I went to pick up a \"large\" pizza. Opened the box and saw a SMALL pizza by any family's standards. It was 15.25 and was worth about half that at best for a skimpy pepperoni! Never coming back here again. Not even worth describing the other elements of the pizza...."}
{"text":"Called the delivery line and managed to get a high school drop out that didn't understand anything. Had to keep asking someone if they could deliver etc. When they found out I was not calling from a residence they informed me that they couldn't deliver. I found that strange since the website said that they delivered to Beachwood. Customer service doesn't seem to be important to these folks."}
{"text":"Extreme bias here. Tasty Pizza was the hangout in high school.  We'd go on Friday nights after football games and order the biggest, greasiest pizza we could imagine. We'd just sit, and eat pizza and just do the stuff that high school kids do. 

I love that I can return and the food tastes exactly the same. The dining room hasn't changed much, even though the front counter / kitchen area has changed quite a bit.  But, the pizza is still Tasty Pizza.  It's great comfort food served with a side of nostalgia.  (For me.) 

Would I put this in a category as the best pizza? Well, without all of the history, no. But, pizza is supposed to be good for the soul. For me, this heals a lot of ails and brings me back home.

You can't beat the meats here. I usually go full pepperoni, and sometimes mix in the sausage and banana peppers. Note: their peppers are the mild variety, and fresh. Don't expect heat or the acidity sting of jarred peppers. 

But, it's pizza. Do your own thing!"}
{"text":"Great local spot..delicious non chain pizza, with crushed red pepper shakers and Parmesan cheese on every table..grab your own beer and wine out of the cooler and drink as many you want without waiting for service..I know they're probably counting but it still feels like the buddy system on how many you drank..something great about that..stare at the years of accumulated beer signs, iconic pictures and Cleveland sports posters and eat pizza and drink beer..great place..I offer the guy who owns the place money for his Wilt Chamberlain laying down and drinking colt 45 poster after about the 3rd beer every time.."}
{"text":"Tasty Pizza is a throwback that's for sure. Even though they're a throwback, still also offer  gluten free pizza. You walk in and order at the counter, grab your drinks from the coolers and then have a seat in the dining room. If you ordered anything other than pizza and drinks, a person come around to give you the extras but you'll have to flag them down."}
{"text":"Small pizza shop, good pizza, reasonable price, self serve drinks, casual seating, great for hanging out"}
{"text":"I started going to Tasty when the original Joe Compola was at the healm with his wife Mary.  That was over 30 years ago.  While I have drifted to other pizza places, I still find myself a huge fan of the plain cheese pizza and pepperoni, sausage, and onion pizza at Tasty.  They slice their tasty italian sausage and peppers thinly, like no other pizza parlor I know.  The pasta sauce is also quite good, as are the stuffed bananna peppers."}
{"text":"I called to order and the guy who answered gave me an attitude and was rude and hung up on me when I had to cancel my order because he said his delivery driver couldn't drive to my house which is only a few minutes away. I have ordered from here before and they were able to deliver to my house."}
{"text":"Simple, cozy and delicious.  

Their sausage, either on pizza or the baked subs, is something special.  Pair that with their sauce that's well balanced and seasoned and consistently baked crust - perfect.

Great informal dining experience if that's what you like.

Best pizza for the money.  Everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"It's hard to review food when I never got a chance to eat. I went in starving and I left starving as the guy behind the counter spent 2 min. yelling to the back of restaurant about something that didn't have anything to do with restaurant service. I stood there and he never acknowledged me once."}
{"text":"Been buying Taste's pizza for 40 years. Love the crust or the sauce. In fact I think I 'll pick one up on the way home tonight."}
{"text":"Compola's Tasty Pizza is a Lyndhurst institution. A 50+ year staple of family, tradition and honor. 

If you eat in, you tell Joe at the counter what type of pie you'll be having. When it's ready, he'll bring it to your table. If you want a drink, help yourself to a cold one from the cooler. If you want a salad or soup, go through the saloon-style swinging doors and back to the kitchen to tell Edith. She'll serve you up right there. At the end of the night, tell Joe what you had throughout the night and he'll ring you out. No checks or invoices are kept. It's all done on an honor system. At Tasty, you're a part of the family and this is one of the main reasons why it's so comfortable to dine here. 

Tasty Pizza is a rare kind of place. A throwback to a more trustworthy era; a simpler time when family gatherings around the dinner table and sharing good food was commonplace. Places like this make me proud to support the Mom & Pops over the competing chains. 

Long live Tasty!"}
{"text":"Not worth one STARS All ZEROS!! The worst PIZZA I EVER HAD BESIDes frozen it's on the same line. Crust cardboard with no taste, hardly no cheese, sauce NO FLAVOR WHICH I COULD TAKE THIS GARBAGE BACK IT WAS 13.00 all others for this size are 10.00.  It is horrible I can't say that enough the owner needs to eat that garbage . I just ordered and threw that mess away my entire family was pissed.  We went to Thersea should went there in the first place!!! To THE OWNER YOU OWE ME 13.00 YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED SELLING POOR Food  QUALITY!!! Horrible experience"}
{"text":"Tasty's has been around forever! I've been going my entire life. The laid-back atmosphere and help yourself fridge of beverages brings back great memories of a mom and pop shop. 

I highly recommend the salad and hot Italian sub. 

This is always on my list of places I must go to when I am back in town visiting!"}
{"text":"Pizza was edible but that's about it. I would never go back. Guiseppes masters jets maybe even pizza hut are better than this place. Also the driver forgot the salad dressing and garlic dipping sauce. I suggest any other pizza place."}
{"text":"I am in search of the best pizza on the east side.  There is only one place so far that I have found to be amazing.  Tasty's is not it.  Tasty's is however tasty.  Pizza is good, crust is a bit dense, but not too dense.  Sauce is good, and the toppings were of high quality.  It was a little pricey, 26.75 for a 12 cut pizza (that wasn't huge) and an order of wings - but everything is expensive anymore. 

I will definitely stop back - probably to eat in as I can imagine this pizza would be even better fresh from the oven.  Looks like a nice family run place with some history and I wish them continued success."}
{"text":"Most disgusting place I have ever eaten at.

Customers look and act like a bunch of animals, and the place is extremely filthy.

They make you get your own drinks and silverware.

The girl taking the orders is very rude.  

I'm ordered a well done sub, and got a luke warm piece of chicken in between 2 cold, uncooked pieces of stale italian bread.

The wedding soup is probably the most tasteless and watery I have had.

If you are a disgusting animal, please eat here.   If you are human, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was told this pizza was the same as old Musarras Tasty Pizza in Garfield Hts. Not even close, what a disappointment. Could not get waited on by lone employee, my son finally brought home what he thought would be a treat. What we got was a burned, dry, sauce less pizza with a hard tough crust. Tasty? Not even close"}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza in Cleveland! I have been going to this place since I have been little! I always get spinach and onion pizza and the salad.  If I am feeling really wild I get the fried mac and cheese bites .  Also,  it is always fun eating there and picking out a pop from the huge cooler with so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is this: two of my sisters were in a very heated disagreement for several hours because one of them threw away the leftovers from Tasty Pizza without considering that the other may have wanted to eat it.  Said pizza had been sitting out in a hotel room unrefrigerated for 14 hours.  This did not deter the scorned sister one bit from desiring to devour it.  

Also, they have a very impressive, serve-yourself beer fridge.  Well, the fridge itself isn't that impressive, but the quality and variety of beers within it are."}
{"text":"I ducked in here to grab a pizza when visiting a friend who lives in Lyndhurst.  I loved it!

It's like going back in time at Tasty Pizza, and that's what I liked about it.  This is a classic, \"old-school\", neighborhood pizza place - good people, simple menu, quality ingredients, etc.  Their selection of toppings is ample and thus has something for everyone.  The price was a little on the high side, but that's to be expected from a non-chain like Tasty's.  Totally worth it!

The location is pretty low-key, on the end in a nondescript strip mall, with limited parking.  They have a surprising amount of space, though.  

I went in on a Wednesday and they had my pizza done in about 20 minutes.

I'd go back."}
