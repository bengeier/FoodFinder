{"text":"Hit or miss- is either really good or way off. I keep going back in hopes that it's a good time, but more often than not my order shows up screwed up or cold, but every now and again they get it right and the pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"It's about time an East of Chicago opened up in Solon, it's my favorite pizza franchise.  I ordered carry out from there today and was more than satisfied.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  My food was ready in no time, and tasted as great as one can expect from East of Chicago.  Pizza Excellence"}
{"text":"I visited your location this evening (order 131913) i attempted to use the coupon for $4.99 Apple pops as advertised. I was informed that there is no applepops that exist and was then told that an apple petezoni would be a good replacement.  I was then charged  $7.49 instead of the $4.99 I was offered on the phone.   Why are applepops offered in a coupon but yet the store does not honor the product?"}
{"text":"WORST customer service! Messed up my order and got yelled at and hung up on twice when I called to have it corrected. Never did get it fixed! Will never buy from here again!"}
{"text":"Gave them another shot after a long time and it still disappointed. I had the babysitter order to make it easy on him and my kids have fun with dinner. Sheet pizza was burnt and crispy. He asked for the sauce on the side on the boneless wings and unfortunately they didn't listen. My daughter wouldn't touch them all soaked in sauce. Side salad was TINY, I know it's meant to be small but give me a break its lettuce. Not a pizza place I can feel confident ordering from again."}
{"text":"Ordered Taco specialty pizza  and a pepperoni with extra  sauce , Pepperoni was good taste and look was right , Taco not so much no cheese ,and taste was not the usual flavor, disappointed, as we get it because my Granddaughter loves  TACO pizza . We order regularly ,the last time we got it ,it was the best ever ... I called to let them know that I was not happy ,young man could care less. told him there was no cheese ,he told me they measure the correct amt.  WRONG YOUNG WIPPER SNAPPER , I THINK I MAY TAKE THE 1/2 BACK JUST TO PROVE HIM WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh is probably the best way to describe this pizza. I ordered extra sauce and didn't get it. Wasnt bad but probably won't get it again."}
{"text":"Seriously thee BEST pizza place. They actually thoroughly cook their dough, they have amazing bacon and they put a lot of cheese. The bacon is so crumbly and crispy it's to die for. I absolutely love this place and I try to go here as often as possible. It blows Pizza Hut and other places out of the park. Keep doing what your doing East of Chicago  your amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza for \"Chain American\" as long as it's the hand tossed crust....owners need to drop the attitude about coupons...always getting pissed when you have and questioning you about the expiration dates. The older lady working there doesn't do this...just the snobby guys. One time I was nearly read the riot act over the phone when I ordered a Chicago Deep Dish...I was instructed by the gentlemen that they have no such pizza and hinted that I wanted The Authentic Pan Pizza and to never ask for a deep dish again...well excuse me good sir.  Get over yourselves....you don't know how to make one anyway...a wall of paper thin lace crust vertically raised on a regular pizza crust does NOT a deep dish pizza make. Your franchisor makes you accept coupons...live with it or start your own shop...you have to treat the customers better or you lose them...I kn ow I stopped going there even if it was just down the road."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken bacon pizza is awesome. The bread sticks are so good as well I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give it zero if I could.  I am still on hold 27 minutes later.   I guess when u hire kids to take calls make deliveries and not CARE at all then u should not get orders for your pizza.   I would be so embarrassed if this was my company and out someone on hold for over 30 minutes.  I will never call or try and place an order with u guys again. We h mace too many good options and I was just trying to see if your pizza was any good but I will never know and I will never care"}
{"text":"Glad I didn't listen to the previous review.  The service could not have been faster or friendlier.   Oh, the pizza is good too."}
{"text":"My parents live close by and we all love their food! We always get either a sandwich or calzone  (they call them fold overs) Never had any issues with quality. And I actually LOVE their marinara dipping sauce...."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, nothing great.  Again, with the multitude of local pizza places in Medina, probably will not make it back to this place; however, it is close by, so may give it another chance. We ordered pizza and mozzarella sticks the only time we were here.  The taste of the pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut pizza, both the dough and sauce.  The food was ready on time and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Although the first review wasn't pleasant I didn't have any problems with this place. Fast delivery, cooked perfectly and the pizza wasnt burnt on the top or dry. It's nothing special but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I used to order pizza from this place all the time when I worked in the area but haven't tried them in a few years. So, realizing different locations are owned by different people, and knowing I currently DON'T care for the one closest to my home, I thought I would try the Strongsville location to see if it has held up. This Strongsville E.O.C.P. often places coupons in local publications. I found one for a medium, two-item pizza for $8.00, so I ordered one with mushrooms and pepperoni.   Out of the box, the medium pizza was 11 1/2 inches across, with approximately a 3/4 inch edge of crust. Fairly standard and acceptable in my estimation. The thin crust was just about the way I like it, crisp and golden on the bottom and soft and chewy, even the edge. The entire pie was about one inch thick. The sauce tasted good, with a slight tang or acidity to it. On another positive note, the mushrooms seemed to be fresh and not out-of-the-can by the way they cooked (baked) up. I thought the pie could have spent another 2-3 minutes in the oven to cook up the pepperoni and bubble up and slightly brown the cheese. But then again that might have resulted in a tougher, hard crust. So, even the next day, whether eating the leftovers cold or after heating in the microwave, the crust was still just as good.  Overall I tip my hat to The East Of Chicago Pizza in Strongsville, they seem to still be doing a credible job. Since northeast Ohio has some of the best independent pizza places you can find anywhere in the country (I know, I've tried many of them during my travels.), I usually don't buy pizza from the national chains. For this location I don't mind making an exception."}
{"text":"Ordered a taco pizza tonight.  It took 4 tries to get the girl to understand that we wanted black olves on half and onions on the opposite half.  Finally had to tell her to just forget the onions.  She told me it would be ready in 20 minutes.   Got there to pick it up.  No one came to the counter to help us.  Someone about 12 feet away asked if we had an order and for the name.   They looked.  Someone asked what number I had called.  It was the correct one.  They continued to look.  One person said it had a few minutes to go.  No problem.  From the back of the store a girl yelled \"Was yours the 1/2 black olives?\"  Yes.   She then came up front and started making a pizza.  I asked if that was mine and she said yes, that it would be ready in six minutes.  (Really?? If we wanted to eat it raw!)  We said no.  Someone yelled \"Sorry about that\" as we walked out.    Called Pape Johns and ordered.  Got there to pick it up--the order was correct (onlyhad to tell them once) and ready when we got there.   Needless to say, won't be visiting East of Chicago again.    Tried to contact them on the website, but kept getting the message \"invalid characters\" when I tried to submit my complaint"}
{"text":"I'm a relatively regular customer (at minimum six times a year), and usually my experience has been pretty decent, pizza is always good, and service is always good and timely. But today, 12/14/17, it was pretty horrible. It took over an hour and a half to get our order that should have been between 45 to 60 minutes. I called an hour and 20 into our wait time, the manager was rude and even hung up on me after a lame excuse as to why it was late. Then when we did get it, it was ice cold. The taco salad I ordered had nothing to do with tacos. It was all lettuce and chips, that's it!!!!! And my salsa.....packaged up almost a week ago!!!!! WTH?!?  I don't believe that the \"customer is always right\", but this has been the absolute WORST example of care and customer service I have ever been witness to. I will not be returning and I will be suggesting to all I know that go either. I added a photo of my well salad along with my old salsa. Hopefully it gets approved, but you might notice that it's like I said, all lettuce and nothing else for a well mixed salad. Shameful!!!"}
{"text":"Ok. Gave this place 2 trys. The second by accident. 1st time the pepperoni pizza was normal. Nothing great. Like a little ceasers $5 pizza. But, the tower pizza was not like the tower I have gotten at many other east of Chicago's. It was skimpy on topping and very light on the cheese.  Called them back and the owner said she would send a coupon but she never did.  Then , my wife randomly stops there to bring home dinner , orders her large steak sub with NO mayo and gets it SLATHERED on anyway. Stopped up 2 days later to complain in person and the owner had a nasty attitude and would not refund the money or offer any solution. She even acted like our orders were not even in the computer. Accusing me of lying To get money!!! Have.. What a joke.    I wouldn't waste any money here!!! Go to SOMOSKYS or SOPRANOS. They have great food with great customer service.    ;)"}
{"text":"This is the only East of Chicago in the area and I'm sad to say they may not be here much longer. I order two Medium pizzas that were slightly undercooked. The problem was the kitchen, it smelled absolutely terrible like a dumpster. There were 6 employees there two two working on pizzas and boxes. I think the other four could have worked all day cleaning. It was gross!"}
{"text":"Pizza at its worst !!! Burnt and something odd about the sauce. Owner needs get back to civilian life and wife needs to accept criticism.  It did no good to tell them I wasn't pleased with my meal , they bragged about all their civic merits but it does nothing for the food. While I was waiting I watched them run outside and almost tackle some nerd going into the comic place next door for parking in one of the pizza shop spaces . Nice neighbors ... I am sure the other owners on this little strip love them . Far to many local pizza shops in the area , stay away from this one !"}
{"text":"I find it disgusting that their marketing plan is make them look Meruican on the backs of our servicemen and woman.  its pretty tacky.  then when you walk in the door to pick up your cardbord stuffed with bad cheese canned vegetable  pizza you are shook down and forced to donate to whatever cause they are pushing. When you say politely \"no thank you\" you are lectured on how terrible you are for not giving to one of their causes.  Maybe they should concentrate on their food over judging every patron who walks in the door!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Employees are very nice as are the owners! The taco pizza is delicious! We also got a square sausage pizza which was just as good!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience and will never spend a dime at East of Chicago Pizza. I attempted to place an online order, but got an error message. I tried several more times. I tried one last time and got the message that I had to order a minimum of $8. Interestingly enough, you could clearly see my order of $31.17 on your form.   I decided to call the store to place an order. I told them of the trouble I had and the guy was completely unphased. I placed my order and mentioned that there was a $1 coupon online and would they honor it.....as I had already told them, I TRIED to place an online order several times. I stayed on the line while the worker talked to his manager. He came back on the phone and said no, they would not honor the coupon. I reminded him of my issues when attempting an online order. He said he was sorry and I told him that this was horrible customer service and that I would be voicing my displeasure online. I have since done so with no response from East of Chicago.   This was a ridiculous move for a business that is so new to our city of Solon, OH. From the responses I got on Facebook, I don't see a long future for your Solon franchise."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time. Food was good.... For being commercially made.  Brownie bites didn't have any Oreos.... ??They were just plain. Would have been nice with a chocolately glaze on top.   I know these ppl do a wonderful work in the community..... I just don't like frozen dough and chain pizza. I wish Emidios would get it together.  So, as a finalization to my review -- good food for what your buying. I just like \"real\" dough made from flour and yeast..etc.  if this is the kind of pizza you like, you'll get a good meal!!!"}
{"text":"That's funny, my review was filtered even though it was an honest customer review. How the heck does this work? Are reviews bought or influenced? Anyway, 2 thumbs down. The place is gross."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Excellent food!  Delivery driver, very kind!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the Italian sub here.  We live in Portland, Oregon and have tried every possible place to find a similar or better sub.  They do not exist.  East of Chicago is a must stop every time we come back home."}
{"text":"Not even close to Chicago style pizza. I should know, I used to live there!  This pizza was sauce with more sauce and we couldn't even find the meat!!!  Total rip off.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Also it was cold when we got it. They don't even have a real pizza oven!"}
{"text":"First and last experience at this place. We ordered fiesta Nachos for 4. I went in to pick it up and it felt like there was nothing in there. I opened it up and it looked like they had taken the nachos you get (same amount) at Taco Bell for $2.50. I should've said something there but the guy who made the nachos was the only one there and yeah he's totally going to understand and make right what he did wrong. And when I called when I got home to complain, I learned the guy who made the nachos was (at the time...) the manager.   He told me he made them to the specifications (LIE) by corporate. And he was rude. No salsa, 1 jalapeño, a few bits of cheese no onion. I had to call corporate to complain and showed them the photo of the nachos I was given. And they agreed it was not done appropriately. I have to wonder how many more people they've ripped off."}
{"text":"Amazing Product for the price.  Truly a bargain for this quality of pizza."}
{"text":"Always get fast service from this location. We really like their pizza and our guests always rave about it.  They sometimes have a long wait for delivery though so we just end up carrying out but we can usually get an order in 20 mins"}
{"text":"Garlic bread is awesome! We had the Chicago Deep Dish and it was great. Staff was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Wow I fail to see why people actually like this place.  Let's say Pizza Hut and Godfather's Pizza were first cousins.  If they decided to have  a kid, that kid would be a greasy/semi-retard by the name East of Chicago.  Avoid this place at all costs.  It's really that bad.  Their thin crust sucks and their pan sucks.  I'm not giving them a third date.  I don't care how many coupons or deals they offer me.  It's always a raw deal when it's East of Chicago."}
{"text":"From my co-worker  who wanted to share his pizza ordering experience (he's not a yelper):  \"I called the local store back and told them of the error. I was immediately lectured on how this was my fault and the order was repeated and I should have listened better when it was repeated. I was completely taken back that I was now being blamed for the incorrect order. A business that actually cares about their customers business would have apologized for the mix up and offered to replace the pizza. I am not asking for anything other than what I ordered. The young lady did eventually offer replace the pizza but somewhat reluctantly. She then told me to make sure she got back the entire wrong pizza like I was trying to pull a scam on her. She never offered an apology. As a manager in the customer care business I would be completely embarrassed if one of my employees talked to one of my customers like that.\"  OK folks. You've been warned."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is delicious! Not authentic, but definitely worth ordering! I got mine with sausage, mushroom, and onions. I'd recommend that to start. I also got their wings. They were small and not very meaty. I'll pass on those next time. But the pizza is excellent!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am back home I am sure to make this one of my first stops, wings and pizza always hit the spot!"}
{"text":"The best pizza around.  Whenever we order from this East of Chicago location, the food is exactly as requested, delivery fast, and hot.  Love this EOC basically.  The Tower is our favorite.  Sometimes we get nachos too."}
{"text":"Just ask for extra crispy wings here and I got burnt wings, with sauce not even on them. Looks like whoever made them either didn't care or was angry because of how I ordered them. I will just think twice before ordering here again."}
{"text":"Great deep dish!  Good service and delivery. Price is reasonable.  I always get the veggie deep dish and they don't skimp on toppings."}
{"text":"We used to get pizza somewhere else for work but heard so much great stories about this place that we had to order it from here. It was the last day of the the month and it is the most stressful day for everyone so to make matters less stressful, our bosses ordered pizzas for us.   It was the BEST pizza place around the area. We ordered a few supremes, tacos, and plan pepperoni. Very generous on the toppings, perfect sauce, and the crust was just right. The actual meat of the bread was soft and the bottom wasn't like cardboard rock hard. Nice slice of pizza to take a bite from.   Only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because I haven't been there to eat so next time I'm going in to try."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to have the pizza because if you order online it doesn't go through(it's 2015 east of Chicago get with it). I tried calling in but the specials online do not apply if you try to call in to the store(makes sense right?). The lady in the phone was extremely rude, didn't care at all about anything and got a well deserved *click*. I love east of Chicago pizza and this was the first time I've tried to order from this particular store, better luck next time I guess."}
{"text":"Grand opening special $13.99 for large specialty pizza. My taco pizza could have used more cheese!  Meat was really well seasoned, I opted for beef over chicken.  Yes they give option here.   For a place recently opened its was really busy with pickup orders. There was a twenty five minutes wait and one hour for delivery at 7pm on Saturday. Menu is two pages worth and has variety. There are ten sizes and types of pizza. There have good product but do seem to skimp on cheese on the pizzas I saw about five. If you think cheese should cover the sauce underneath, you'll be disappointed.   Grand opening specials include 2 foot long sub for $12.99 and 3 topping large for $10.99 and they will be good until end of August. This is only pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"The first time ordering here there was no issue. The second time we got a taco pizza. Ended up sharting. The third, and last time I ordered 3 topping pizza. It tasted off, like they cooked it with a dirty sock in the oven. I had leftovers and the only time I did not shart was when eaten with digestive aid. And yes, the place smells like a dumpster."}
{"text":"13:40. Called to get a piazza delivered there done delivering. How can a place that delivers be done. On top of the there 3.5 miles away. The store closer at 1.5 miles away don't deliver here. EAST OF CHICAGO PIZZA YOU NEED TOO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"1.5 miles away from my office in  Brunswick yet they don't deliver that far. I have to order from the Strongsville location 3.5 miles away and  they were done delivering at 2:30. time to break out the crayons and draw new lines on the map."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ chicken pizza here over the weekend, it was very good. The thick crust is about an inch and they were very generous with the toppings. Quality ingredients. The employees/owners were very friendly and seemed to know everyone in the shop in a small town/Gilmore Girls kind of way.  There are two tables where you can either wait for the pizza or indulge right away. I look forward to trying more from this establishment."}
{"text":"Actually had some really good pizza tonight: thin, very crispy, with good pepperoni and sausage. This actually is one of my favorite pizza places that is located \"east of Chicago\" (number 5 or 6 maybe?). However, because I have had so much great pizza to \"the West\", I just can't give this place four stars ... three and half maybe (but then, I can't do that, now can I?). So, let me just say, for a regional chain ... this pizza is A-OK!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of EoC.  I always try to give places another chance every few years.  Every time I give EoC a chance I am disappointed.  I know some people love their pizza.  So give it a try, but there are better choices in the area."}
{"text":"I grew up in Warren, Oh with the best places, IMO, for pizza. I have found some pizza here and there that are ok, but probably my favorite is the taco pizza from East of Chicago. I love their crust so any pizza would be great.   Here's where it gets even better- their service. I called to order the specialty taco and a pepperoni for my sons bday party. The guy gave me crazy coupons to apply to my order. When I got there, he have me cups, plates & napkins so we can eat at the park.   The finale is that this location offers Velvet ice cream. We did in impulse buy and bought Buckeye- 56 oz for $4.99. Here's where they get carried away- they deliver ice cream! Who doesn't like that?   All around easy, pleasant & delicious!"}
{"text":"Just ordered Thin Crust Tower pizza. Delivery was early and pizza was most excellent! Crispy, perfect!"}
{"text":"It's a pizza chain, the pizza tastes like chain pizza.  If you like Pizza Hut, Dominos, or Papa Johns, this is probably going to be a good fit for you, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Medium deep dish for about $13 so the price isn't too bad. If you're looking for authentic pizza or pizza that doesn't have that chain taste, you might want to drive up the street to another place.  No problems ordering online. I picked up around 8pm on a week night, the staff was friendly and courteous.  They do deep dish and pan crust which is a plus, but I just don't have the stomach for chain pizza and never feel well after. For that reason, I personally won't be going back, but I'd say give it a shot.  I heard good word of mouth reviews from others."}
{"text":"I did not go in for pizza, but we had a large all topping pizza delivered at a hotel we were staying at. They told us it would take 30 minutes, but it definitely was much faster than that. What a plus! The pizza is so, so good! They didn't skimp on the toppings and they were neatly piled on instead of just dropped all over the dough. My favorite part was the crust because it was a great combination of chewy with just the right amount of crunch as well. I'm impressed. The price wasn't overwhelming like other places I have tried. Fast delivery, great price, tasty product. Huge fan! I'm bummed we don't have one of these by my house!"}
{"text":"I've given them a few tries since my intial bad experience, and they've completely turned it around.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Food is ready fast.  The subs and wings here are particularly good."}
{"text":"Order taker is too confused/distracted to take a pizza order.  Had to convince them that their coupons that they sent in the mail were real, and then proceeded to be so unfamiliar with their own menu, that placing an order just became impossible.  Order from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service! The pizza tastes great and so much better than most pizza places. Their delivery services are a little slow, but usually the pizza is ready by the time you get there. I usually call ahead of time and they are so sweet and always tell me about the specials.  Def, would recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"The girl that took my order today was so patient with my specialty order today.  Thanks for not being in a hurry."}
{"text":"Yesterday, we ordered four pizzas from East of Chicago for delivery. Fourty-five minutes later, the pizzas were delivered. They were hot, fresh, and tasty. We ordered two cheese, a veggie, and a pepperoni. I ate the veggie pizza and it was delicious. It had diced tomatoes, banana pepper rings, and something else that I don't remember. The pizza was on par with Marco's and Papa John's, which I like.  I'm glad we tried it because we'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Good service! Good pizza! Love love love! The insiders are nice and friendly every time I pick up my order. I love how it's always hot and melted. And just plain delicious! I would more than recommend this place to people! I hope they keep up the good work and keep the good time! They got a good thing going!"}
{"text":"The hand toss pizza is where it's at! The best pizza I've had in a while that wasn't from here; I can't believe they are a chain. They have been very consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered some poor excuse for a pizza called \"the tower\" I'm not kidding when I say I ate 1/2 a slice and wouldn't even feed the rest of this garbage to my dog. It was HORRID!!!! Soggy crust, pizza sauce that was so sweet it tasted like kool aid, and enough green olives stink up my house for an hour after we took this abomination outside to ward off vampires. More chain restaurant bs, I know better, so I partly blame myself for bothering.   A nickels worth of free advice...Stay as far east of this place as humanly possible to avoid a pizza you could rival with slices of wonder bread, American cheese and prego."}
{"text":"Five stars for being geographically accurate. Four stars for the pie. Three for small azz portions(puny wings). Average out to four. Good night."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 sheet pizzas for the kids before the winter formal. Delivered right on time. Pizza was nothing to write home about. The deep dish pizzas are much better!"}
{"text":"I ordered online, that was very smooth. Not all locations offer online, Stow location did. I drove over 30 miles from Cleveland to get this pizza and wings. Staff was friendly. I remember East Of Chicago pizza that was in Macedonia Ohio 19 years ago, and this just isn't the same as I remember; crust about the same, less meat toppings, less cheese. Reminds me of a $5 Georgio Pizza. Wings were small, price of wings reflects the price, wings didn't really have much of a sauce taste, due to lack of sauce, but my wife enjoyed the wings.   I been waiting years to try East Of Chicago pizza again, disappointed"}
