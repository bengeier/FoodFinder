{"text":"Ale asylum was the perfect spot to visit before catching our flight. Located about four minutes from the airport, the venue has a large parking lot and variety of indoor seating. We sat at the bar because we were in a bit of a rush. The bar staff was great at recommending taps off of their menu and also provided us with various samples to ensure we picked a drink we liked. Although we did not order food, the couple next to us order multiple appetizers that smelt and looked delicious. We will definitely be going back to take a beer tour or try some of the other menu options!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy visitng the Ale Asylum with friends for causal drinks.  Love the beer and have never been disapointed by the food.  That is the main point of going out, there, right??  Well, this last Friday night was some what of a different story.  Everything was fine, except for our server!  We were sitting on the bar side of the tasting room, at a large table, and after I got my first beer, I asked if I should pay now-- just out of convience to the guy so he didnt have to run 8 seperate tabs.  He replied in a VERY condescending tone \"Um... this is called table service.  Im running a tab for the table.\"  Oh. Excuse me. Being in the service industry myself, I just let that one go.  A while later, my friends and I ordered another beer, they ordered darker beers and I ordered the lighter style (which I might add, is just as tasty as the more hearty styles).  Upon returning with the beer-- the \"friendly\" server proceeded to tell us (in the same condescending tone)  that I ordered the beer for \"People that dont like beer\".  Is it just me, or should a server not bash the product he is selling--especially at the place the product is made???  Its been a week and i am still confused by this guy. He either had it out for me, has no respect for his tipping customers or just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.     I will be back to the Ale Asylum for sure, but will steer clear of this guy and his tables, unless I feel the need for a little bash to my self esteem."}
{"text":"Best. Brew pub. Ever. The new space rocks! Great patio area. Oh yeah...the great beer doesn't hurt either.  :)"}
{"text":"The beer is awesome! The food... Not so much. I enjoyed the fish tacos featuring Korean BBQ tilapia with a corn salsa and pickled onions. My husband had the blackened chicken sandwich. He had to check if it had been cooked through due to the rubber consistency. The flavors were good but the chicken although cooked was inedible. I will say the salsa and guacamole were very tasty and fresh. I would go back for the beer and just appetizers next time. The atmosphere and service were good with a good vibe all around."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for three years and haven't made it out here until my visit this evening. The ONLY reason I'm saying average is because the beer is good (maybe not $6 good) and my sandwich was good. That evens out for the intolerably low quality service that my friend and I received. Our waiter on the patio was slow, slapped the metal menus down on the table, and asked us what we wanted. I said to my friend, \"let's go in and check out the bar. I'm sure the bartender will be better.\" He literally walked up and said \"the signs lit up are what we got. Know what you want?\" Not a greeting, not a suggestion, not an offer to explain the different beers. We ordered our beer and he literally slammed the pints onto the sticky bar, and some of the beer spilled out.   I'll literally never come back. Objectively terrible service."}
{"text":"The food was wholly underwhelming, from the appetizers to the main dish bland and tasteless all around.  The service was wonderful, attentive, and prompt, and their drink selection was allright."}
{"text":"Wondering what happened to Ale Asylum?  Went to dinner recently and was not very impressed.  What happened to that amazing sesame tofu salad they used to have?  The current food lacks any sufficient flavor. Not sure the cooks season anything at all?  I had the burger that was smothered in A1 sauce...sort of a let down.  On the side I got the quinoa cucumber salad...absolutely no flavor what-so-ever.  The person I ate with got the cold tuna tacos and Mac n Cheese...bland.  The service was quite good but the food needs major work.  Also, why no Pilsner?"}
{"text":"Wow. When I first came here, back when it opened, the beer was great (it's always been), but the food was only so-so. There were pizzas, I think, and some sample plates. Not anymore. They upped their game, big time! Went and had the burger, and the gf had the Turkey Sandwich. Both were out of the park; in fact, that was the best Turkey sandwich I've ever had. Hands down. Way to step up Ale Asylum; I no longer just go here for good beer; now there's great food as well. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped Sunday evening 8/21/16 for a quick tap.  Young woman running the bar - no greeting, no smile - just \"what'll you have.\"  No welcoming vibes from her. Hubby is picky about size of his beer - wants a pint & no less so he asks her about the size that their Dubbel comes in - is it a pint? She says \"Yes.\"  He orders, it comes in a smaller glass - 12 oz.  He asks again, is this a pint?  She says \"Approximately.\"   Okay, so we go ahead, drink our beers, and then we can hear her relaying this snippet of a conversation at the end of the bar w/a co-worker.  Loudly.  Using many f-bombs.  Apparently we pissed her off by asking the size question. She stopped when we looked at her, but she continued to be rude and vulgar as she waited on folks up and down the bar, utilizing the f-bomb and complaining that it had been a long day.    We paid for our beers -- $13.00 for two taps, BTW -- and left.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this place. The bartender lady was very unfriendly and she broke 2 glasses as I was sitting there. Aggressive. The pour was horrible and the beer was flat. And then my food came out made wrong and the excuse was they were out of ingredients but they didn't bother to mention that when I ordered. And then they charge you for dressing for your salad. Haha. This place sucks"}
{"text":"Okay, this review is service related and is not a reflection on the beer they brew at the Ale Asylum.  I actually love the beer.    The service at the Ale Asylum is some of the worst I have ever experienced...any where.  Out of five servers working on a busy Saturday evening, three acted like customers were annoying them to order anything.  Even after the rush died down, one bartender in particular would stand at the spickets across the room and flail his arms at the few customers remaining as if to say, \"hurry up and order already!\"  This experience was not limited to me, there were others in my group that had the same impression.  One female server was actually mocking various people as she walked behind them, in plain view of other customers!  This was all before 8:00 p.m.    The bar is basically located in warehouse next to an airport and has a terrible internal traffic flow when crowded.  If you are over 25, save yourself the aggrivation of being treated as if you are blessed to be served and buy their beer in a local store."}
{"text":"The beer is excellent, but there are a few drawbacks to visiting the brewery.   1. There is no flight options, just pint or half-pint options of beer. It is my belief that breweries and flights are like peas and carrots (whatever FGump meant by that)  2. You can't purchase mix-n-match 6 packs. I don't understand the logic behind this.   3. The food is average. You are running a brewery, not a restaurant, so focus on what is best and brew and serve great beer.   4. It is rather dark in spots of the venue, not a huge negative, but good napping ambiance.    As a whole, staff is friendly and beer is great. They have Madison classics (Nut Brown and Ambergeddon) and also hop-tastic beers (Hopalicious and Jackson double ipa).   Visit, enjoy the beer, avoid the food, and ask for a flight even though it's not available."}
{"text":"The beer is very well done. There's a good variety that will appeal to a lot of different tastes.  The wine selection seems limited, but I can't blame them seeing as this is a beer place.   The decor is nice. It is a bit dark and loud, but very casual and relaxing.  The food more or less feels like an afterthought. This is a place you come to for their beer. The food is a nice addition but it definitely tastes better when you're drinking their beer.  The pizza is just a step above digiorno. It isn't bad, but it is kind of underwhelming. The pizza is outsourced but claim it is never frozen so I am okay with this.  The hummus plate comes with three hummus flavors and crudite along with pita triangles. This is good stuff. The Korean style lettuce wraps were pretty good as well.   Ultimately, come here for the beer. Grab an appetizer or three. Get a six pack to take home (or a growler) and have a good time here."}
{"text":"Awesome beers, the fish tacos were also very good. Unfortunately didn't take the tour but would go back again if I was ever around madison. The staff were extremely friendly and personable, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a few hours to kill on Sunday so we stopped by Ale Asylum for a couple beers. Off the bat, we were pretty disappointed to see there were no tvs anywhere. Since the place just opened, I asked the bartender if they were planning to get any and he replied with a pretty snooty attitude that this was a tasting room for a brewery, \"not a bar\" - like they were somehow above bars by not having football on (on a Sunday in Wisconsin... wtf?)  The manager also concurred that this place was somehow better without tvs, implying that we should be more interested in conversing with them than sporting events.  He then informed us there were hundreds of other bars in the immediate vicinity where we could do that, to which I gladly chugged my Hopilicious, ate my pizza (which was ok) and bounced.  The beer is good, but it's nothing you can't get anywhere else in Madison.  The food is edible but nothing to go out of the way for.  Unless I was specifically going for a brewery tour, there are many better places to grab a drink, enjoy a game, and not have to deal with the uppity staff."}
{"text":"Executive summery: Go!  This is everything I want in a bar or in Ale Asylums verbage a 'tap room'. Here's a break down of each star.  First star: The beer. Each  is an excellent exampe of it's style. While you may not like every style none will let you down. Second star: The vibe. Good chill music on rotation. Not too loud not too lame. Always a good crowd.  Third star: Hand in hand with the second... no TVs. This isn't a sports bar. If you come here be prepared to engage real live people. Fourth star: Free pool. Only 1 table but it's a beauty. Star five: The beer. God I love the beer."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden winner.  I'm going to award it the mighty 5-stars under the assumption you go on a brewery tour like I did.  Having been on a brewery and winery tours I can easily say this was far and away the best tour I've ever taken, nothing else even comes close.    The guy giving the tour was as he admitted not the usual fellow who gives them but he said he was starting to give more and more and hopefully for you he does.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember his name at the moment he is one of the brewmaster, a short little guy and a hell of a nice guy and great at making the tour interesting and keeping things really loose.  If you haven't been on brewery tours before, they can somewhat boring after a while, unless you are really and I mean really passionate about it.  It's a lot of tanks and containers.  While Ale Asylum has these elements the fact that we got to walk in between the tanks, get up there and see and smell bubbling yeast, the bottling machine, really walk among the facility was a kind of closeness I've never had before.    Additionally, the tour comes with free drinks, what isn't amazing about that?  In order to even enter the brewery area, everyone by guide order HAD to have a drink in hand.    The beer itself is very flavorful, as someone who also writes the occasional beer review too, the various styles of beer they have are all quite robust in their flavor with strong bodies and a good but not overpowering finish.  Their porter has a nice coffee roast to it, the summer ale is refreshing and light, and their IPA is a mother of a IPA, great if you like a really hoppy one.  Overall, none of their styles is tremendously different from its designation, the porter tastes like porter, the wheat ale like wheat ale, the snozberries like snozberries but all of them are really great representation of their respective type.  I was fortunate enough to also get to snack on a pizza which had a surprising amount of spice to it, a nice treat.  Much better than typical bar food and pizza that could hold its on.  This tour was great if you haven't been on one before and want to this is the place to do it.  There were folks on our tour who were actually on their second tour of duty.  I can't testify to how it is in the evening but it's more classy and cleanly presented inside than most bars which again sets the AA apart.  It's a nice looking place inside, with a nice staff, and some nice beverages and eats.  Yeah, a visit to the Ale Asylum...NICE!"}
{"text":"Such a great tap room!  I love the setup of the place, its big and spread out with a few rooms and a smaller up stairs room with a bar and great places to sit.  The Food was fantastic, we had the cheese steak sandwich, it was Kobe beef with sauteed peppers and onions on a pretzel bun. Also had chips and salsa with guacamole to snack on.  They have around 12 beers on tap, 7 of them being IPA's and a variety for just about everyone.  They are all listed under cool looking neon lights behind the bar,  as well as a descriptive menu on the tables.  The servers were all very knowledgeable of the beers on tap as well as beer in general.  I had the oatmeal stout, and it was perfect.  I also tired the triple Belgium and the blonde.  Loved them all.  This is the best taproom I have been in, I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is more for eating than drinking. That being said, they do have pizzas and sandwiches, and the pizzas are personal-sized and have a lot of interesting toppings. The beer is FANTASTIC. Hopalicious is one of my all-time favorites."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out...  We sat at the bar, ordered a beer which was good & and looked at the menu. I ordered the buffalo flatbread, husband had the Cuban and cold soup and our friend had two tacos that were tiny and way overpriced. The atmosphere was cold and dark, not friendly staff (that drank on the job in front of the guests) working in the hospitality industry for years found this very inappropriate and very unprofessional. Bartender had no sense of humor! Boo I'm disappointed and really wished I liked it here."}
{"text":"Holy crap. This is the biggest group of jerks I've ever come across in one establishment. From the owners to the bartenders, it is a-holes all the way down. Or perhaps that is their schtick and I'm just not getting it?  I won't get into the long story here, but I once was a longtime loyal customer. When I had an issue with service I was ignored or disrespected on three levels of management. I got on yelp to see if my experience was unique--it looks like people tend to agree with me.  Regrettably, I must say that their beer is good.  Hoppalicious and Ambergeddon are both tasty beers, but I won't be buying any. The ease with which they s*** on their customers makes me wonder about the sanitation at their brewery."}
{"text":"This is a food only review.  Friends have mentioned they like the food here, so I figured it would be similar to other brewpup style food in Madison. This was not even close. In a town that has very good sandwiches/burgers/bar food, there's really no excuse for being terrible.   We had the cuban sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich. The bread was soggy, and not with tasty flavorful juices. The pork on both sandwiches had had any flavor cooked right out of it. The only redeeming part of the pulled pork sandwich was the bbq sauce, of which there was too little.   This place seems to be trying too hard to be \"hip\" (something it is failing at by a good 5 years) and not trying hard enough to have food worth eating."}
{"text":"Best beer brewer in Madison. Bar layout needs to change as it has gotten so popular. Also some of the long time staff is cocky which is annoying."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here the first time. The atmosphere was great, the seating was comfortable, and the bathrooms were clean. I had the bedlam cheese steak and the asylum side salad. The bun was great, the meat had a great texture, but that's where the goodness ends. The sauce was flavorless with a gritty texture. To try to give the sandwich some help I ordered a bit of ranch dressing. It was oily, flavorless, and separated. The salsa and vegetables were also bland and tasted watery. I would go back again, but I will eat before I come or proceed with great caution."}
{"text":"we visited ale asylum for the first time this past weekend, im a huge fan of their brews and decided to check out the menu.  the menu is small which we actually prefer(smaller menu=better crafted food) I had the chix avocado wrap while my girlfriend was between the spicy black bean burger and the pulled bbq pork sandwich.  my wrap was very tasty and different from what you might think of a chix salad wrap as no mayo is used.  my gf was happy she went with the black bean burger as recommend by our waitress. we will definitely be back for the beers and food."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time. Mary was awesome behind the bar, food was amazing, and the beer was great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped over to the Ale Asylum on a Saturday afternoon. It was a game day, but they have no TV's there so it didn't get crowded until afterward. The space is open and airy and their beers are top notch. Our servers were very friendly but once the game was over and the crowds surged in the service was a tad slow. The food was OK, but it's a brew pub and I didn't expect a gourmet meal anyway. The only complaint I had was the obnoxious amount of douchebag parents-about-town who had their enormous baby carriers and bags of Cheerios and spit-rags clogging up the dining area. This place is about beer, and the other patrons don't want to hear your bitch-ass crotchfruit screeching and whining while you try to ignore them over a pint. Leave your shitty children at home. This isn't Chuck E Cheese. Cheers to the Ale Asylum!"}
{"text":"I visited the new location when I was in town on business.  I liked the vibe, hospitality, and food.  However, I found the beer not especially remarkable.  I wanted to like it more than I did.  Ambergeddon and Hopalicious are OK, but there is tough competition among craft breweries these days.  But because I liked the place, I intend to go back and sample other of their beers.  I hope to find my niche.  Don't let my individual pallate discourage you from going...please go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here since they moved to their new location, give it a try again.  It's worth visiting now even if you're not a serious beer fan. Good sandwiches and salads. The only real drawback is the noise level."}
{"text":"I am happy they had a nice selection, I had grand cru and a imperial stout- something quite heavy, but well balanced. The service and customers were friendly & helpful and the pizzas looked incredible. Parking was a little hard to come by on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and pizza -- NO televisions, which is good  update -- no longer serve the same pizza, but beer is still best in town"}
{"text":"The Ale Asylum. Did the brewery tour last summer, it was really good!  Very casual and laid back.  Our guide was knowledgeable and entertaining. The place is a little out of the way, which is a good thing in my opinion. If it were downtown, it would have a much different vibe. The food is not bad, but a little spendy for what it is.  Service has always been good to me there. Not sure I'd call it a dinner destination, but it's awesome for lunch"}
{"text":"Firstly, I was a huge fan of Ale Asylum's beer offerings long before I discovered their brewery is only about 10 minutes from my home. The impression that you get as you pull into the parking lot almost sets a false impression of what is to be seen inside. The brewery's current location (apparently they're moving next summer) shares a large building with other businesses, and the outer appearance gave me the impression that the inside would look like some sort of industrial park. When I entered, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the setup on the inside seemed to accomodate to a variety of bargoers.  They have a traditional bar area, some tables nestled in for appetizers, a lounge area with large couches and leather chairs, and a few tables set up for those who prefer to stand. A great aspect was the fact that they offer free pool at their pool table. While this may appear to the more fickle of pool players who don't want to pay $1.50 per game (in my case, a game that I am just under mediocre at), but because there is only one table patrons would play 2 vs. 2 against complete strangers. This inspired some to have open dialog with people they would not have otherwise spoken to. I find this appealing, and slightly endearing. After all, to me, the point of going out to a bar is to interact with people.  As you would expect, their beer offerings are out of this world. The sampler is a great way to show how diverse the Ale Asylum beer selection is. It is also great to get into the tap room because there is at least one draft that they only offer at the brewery itself. The only complaint (and it's a slight one) is that in the 3-4 times that I've been there, it is sometimes difficult to get consistent service from the staff. On one occasion, we hadn't seen our server in about half an hour. We went to look, and found her at the bar drinking. Evidently her shift had ended, but she did not let us know so that we knew to flag down her replacement for our drinks. This, however, is a very minor complaint.  Overall I cannot recommend this establishment enough. As bars go, their music selection, beer offerings, and atmosphere appeal to a large variety of patrons. I'll continue to go to Ale Asylum, and can't wait to see what the future brings with the new location!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner just to drink, so this review is based on beer and service and not at all about their food which I didn't try. Large variety of beer.  I tried 3 kinds and all 3 were delicious!!!!!! Service: The male host at the door was nice.  I told him we just wanted to sit at the bar.  A bartender ho hum greets us and asks for our ID's.  We show him and then tell him we need a minute to look at the beer selection.  Another bartender then comes over and says he needs to see our ID's.  OKKKKKKK dude I'm 32, it's not like I'm hovering on the edge of being 'barely legal'. My husband spilled his just poured beer (sorry!!!!!!) which I mopped up with some towels and the original bartender gave him a new one without a fuss (thank yoU!!!!!!!!!!)   I enjoyed the employees unique looks.  It's nice to know I'm not the only heavily tattooed woman in town."}
{"text":"We stopped by asylum for a flight of beer. The service was great and very helpful. The appearance of the facility is urban and sleek; it has a great atmosphere. They have a very traditional craft beer selection with IPA's, Belgians, stouts, and other ales. No fruit beers, however several have lovely fruit aromas. Overall, we are very pleased with this brewery and would love to return for a full tour."}
{"text":"Why two stars and not four?  The answer is the most rude and downright threatening server I've ever encountered!   SO and I and other family members have been here many times and things have always been great, great that is until snarky-shouldn't-have-a-job-invaded-my-SO's-personal space with a thinly-veiled threat to spit in our food-desperately-in-need-of-a-shave-and-roundhouse kick to the head server showed up on the scene the other night.  As I said, my significant other and I have been here enough to know the place and the menu.  We ordered their amazing walnut and feta pizza to share and two beers.  The sever got pissy telling us the pizza was not large enough for the two of us, was meant for one person, etc, etc (read: \"Order something else so my tip is bigger.\")  We assured him we were well aware if the size of the pizza and it would be just fine, thanks.  He stalked away.  Oh, but only after I asked him about one of the beers and he irritatingly just pointed at the beer menu and said. \"It's THAT.\"    SO asked for a lemon (he puts it in his beer.). When Sir Snarksalot comes by and sees the lemon in the beer he stops and begins to basically attempt to emasculate SO for putting lemon in his beer, stating, if he knew he was using it for his beer he'd never have given it to him. ( As an aside, SO could have wiped the floor with this guy were he not such a damn Zen master, as he's a martial arts instructor...after what happened next, I really wish he had.)   SO told Sir Snarksalot, \"With every one of your snarky comments your tip is just getting smaller.\"  This is when the server leaned threateningly into SO's space and said, \"And YOU should know you never tell a server you're giving them a bad tip until after you get your food.\"   SO immediately got up to go ask for a different server and I seriously sat there looking for cameras as I was convinced for several minutes I was either being Punk'd or was on \"What Would You Do.\". I kid you not: that's how bad it was.  The hostess apologized profusely and seated us elsewhere and eventually the general manager found us and apologized profusely, too.  What I found interesting, though, was she said they had had similar complaints about this guy before and he'd been talked to before!  So...why is he still working there?  You can't tell me there aren't dozens of far better servers waiting to take his place.  The very next night my coworkers had a gathering there after work.  I was regaling them with the horror story of the night before and, who should walk by?  Of course, Sir Snarksalot!    I was aghast he still had a job there.  I have to say I'm pretty disappointed the place allows for such horrible treatment of loyal customers to go on without consequence.    If you go, great beer, great food, but apparently you should now come prepared to ask your server to \"take this outside\" when they treat you like crap and threaten you."}
{"text":"Went to the new place on Saturday.  Kind of swanky looking on the inside and warm.  Beer was great, I LOVE Hopalicious!  Our group of 8 ended up getting a nice spot upstairs around the couches.  Staff was great, everything was great.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I go to MATC and the Ale Asylum is in walking distance. A few classmates and I decided to go there for lunch once instead of boring cafeteria food at MATC. BEST idea ever.  Turns out... we can get a way better meal at Ale Asylum for the same price as a crappy defrosted cheeseburger from the cafeteria. It was great. I had the pulled pork sammich. It was delicious. Definitely looking forward to going there more often next semester."}
{"text":"Poor service, bland food, no TVs to watch game. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Had a very poor experience here. We waiting a very long time for our server to take our order, we got our food and mine shouldn't have even left the kitchen. .my whole sandwich was super burned which she took back and was put on a better toasted bun. I took a few bites and it was like someone poured a bottle of salt on my sandwich, very over seasoned. I left it hoping the server would ask me why I didn't eat more or if I wanted a box... but instead she just took it away. Never said sorry for the meal and I know it wasn't her fault but I was just turned off by the service and food overall. .."}
{"text":"The brewery is on an open site next to the airport with lots of room for the restaurant. We walked in during lunch but the place was not crowded as it's hard to get there by foot. So the atmosphere was more business like and i noticed a lot of lunch time client chose to abstain though i do not believe it's because of the beer.  The beers are delicious especially the fruity heffeweisen.  The IPA that I chose, and there were many more, was full bodied with Cascade hops (I interpret that as being from Oregon) and not high on the bitterness scale."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to the airport.  Was warmly greeted and sat at the bar.  I had the Napalm Bunny and the Velveteen Habit.  Both were very tasty beers and were completely amazing.  Ordered the dry-rub wings and they were POW amazing.  This is a great place to stop by either coming to or leaving from MSN.  This has my highest recommendation of Restaurants that DO NOT SUCK.  Do yourself a favor and come to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"A-OK really sums up this place, as there are some really good and not-so-good things about Ale Asylum that average out to Ok. I'd go back, but not sure it will be a regular hangout.  A couple of thoughts-  Yes, the beer is seasonal and they're going to run out. Our waiter did a good job of letting us know what was/was not an option. Love the creative beer names.  The food- pizzas are pre-made by Falbo's and so are not customizable. But, if you like them as they come from the freezer, they're not half bad. The spicy sausage and Buffalo chicken were our favorites. The walnut-goat cheese pizza had a tomato based sauce, which did not complement the toppings at all. A much better choice would have been either a light pesto, a cream sauce or, even better, just olive oil and garlic.  There is a short but functional wine list for non-beer fans, and spirits are also available. So, if you're here with a group, pretty much everyone can find something to drink.  The place is cavernous, and so a little bare and cold. There is seating upstairs that looks much more cozy and overlooks the brewing area and the main bar, I'd rather have been up there. The main level is pretty loud, even when fairly empty. A bonus for two, yes, two outdoor patios."}
{"text":"Grade A food with amazing choice of in house beers on tap. The menu has fewer choices than that of other restaurants but they do what they do very well. I would recommend this to anyone near the east side looking for a good beer and bite to eat."}
{"text":"Traveling through town and found this brewery.  They had a good selection of beer and I really enjoyed the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This is by far the best tour I have ever been on! Our tour guide really got into what exactly is happening to the beer as it is being made. It didn't hurt that you got to take a beer with you as you took the tour either! ;) The food at the bar is really good too! I highly recommend Ale Asylum, insanely good beer and tour!"}
{"text":"The beer is indeed very good here and the bartenders are all good nice as well but you'd be surprised to know that they serve the absolute best pizza in Madison.  Next time you just want some pizza and a brew I'd highly recommend the BBQ Chicken with an Ambergeddon Ale.  You can also play darts :)"}
{"text":"Unfurtanetly we had a bad experience, the place is not kid friendly, people that comes here even if they see your kid they will walk them over. I had a fat guy seeing my kid and still walked by her pushing with his fat leg making her fall to the ground. I drove from Milwaukee, not free beer, even we had a decent tour ( although my cousin had to stay with the kids- first time for us no kids allow in a brewer my tour in Wisconsin) then this. NOT COMING BACK"}
{"text":"Nothing to say but GO HERE FOR BEER AND FOOD!  Why?  1.  Best beer in town with the biggest selection out of any microbrew in Madison. 2.  Food is great and the price isn't steep.  Don't ask for fries with your burger because they don't have them, but the chips and salsa are a good replacement. 3.  The staff is great and they always assist with anything that's needed. 4.  Music is always awesome.   I've been going here for 10 years and this has always been my microbrew choice in Madison."}
{"text":"If you're here for a happy hour,the best spot is the upstairs patio. Doug is THE BEST!!!!! Our work party loved his amazing level of service and solid sense of humor! The peach and avacado caprese is tops!"}
{"text":"I've had Ale Asylum beer and tastings but never made it into their tasting room - still haven't because this was the first time I stepped foot on their ground and I couldn't even go in due to them being closed for their Ferment Dissent Festival.  I will say that just the impression of their outside was a tad bit off-putting. The parking lot was too small for the festival, we managed to find parking but our friends had to park in the overflow spot at Great Lakes which was about half a mile away. Then you had to walk on the sidewalk to get to the festival and get hit with the revolting, putrid scum pond that's neon green in color. On a windy day like the festival? Yeah that pond can really ruin your senses.   To the beer from our favorite to the least favorite:  Off Switch - a double IPA, is well balanced and not overly hoppy in aroma or flavor. Pours smooth with a slight dry finish.  Spawn Series #14 - IPA, dank A$$ beer! Fell in love with this at the Middleton Beer Festival as it was the only booth we kept going back to over and over again. Frothy and caramel in color,  pours smooth, and crisp tasting.  Tears of my Enemies - APA, we usually don't favor the APAs since they tend to have less ABV. However, this is one of our favorites. Has more body than your typical APAs, refreshing, with a zip.  Hush Money - IPA, so everyone's consensus when we opened this was that the first notes were of burnt, Pizza Hut pepperoni. I mean that's totes what a legitimate beer connoisseur would say amirite? But seriously, this was an off-putting scent, and overly hoppy."}
{"text":"Ale asylum is a great spot that was easy to get to and seemed to be visited by travelers, locals, and the after work crew alike.  I had the Hopalicous and the Teipel Nova, both great beers.  Had a cup of beer cheese soup that was just a amazing.  Being in Wisconsin and at a brewery,  you do the math...  Plus with the added Kielbasa...  But I digress...  Definitely worth checking out if your in the area.  Great solo or if your bringing the folks from work with you."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some business associates during my recent travel in Madison.  Sadly, we did not have beer with our meals, so this review is strictly based on the restaurant/food at this place.  We were seated by a large window that overlooked the brewery, so we got to watch the beers on the conveyor belt go by Laverne and Shirley style while we ate.  Everyone at our table ordered the soup of the day, Beer Cheese soup with Kielbasa sausage.  I have to say that was the real highlight of the meal.  The soup was a great consistency and you could taste the beer - but I could have done without the Kielbasa in it.  I ordered the steak salad as my meal.  It was okay, but the steak was well done and was more than a little tough.    It would probably have been a different experience and better meal overall if I would have had an icy cold beer to wash it down."}
{"text":"They deserve five stars, but would also get it by default for being the only place on this side of town I will eat at. Thanks for having that special touch that I cherish in my dining and drinking experience."}
{"text":"Good beer. Incredibly poor service. Seemed like they weren't servers - maybe disgruntled brewers. Anyway, me and a friend found (different types!!) of hairs in our food. Nobody said anything about it except that they would figure it out. They did take the entree off the tab, but that's just not nearly enough."}
{"text":"Ale Asylum gets my vote!  I visited Madison on a business trip this past week and I didn't know my way around at all. I found out about this place thanks to Yelp and decided to check it out.  The location was a little different from what I expected but because they're brewing their owns beers, I guess it makes sense they're in sort of an industrial warehouse. Form what I can tell their beers are popular too because they were loading kegs by the dozen onto racks for shipping. Pretty cool to watch!  I sat down in the sun on their nice, spacious patio and was immediately helped by the wait staff. I asked for recommendations and the waitress seemed to really know the menu well. I selected a beer (which was really really tasty) and then ordered a pizza.   Another review I read mentioned that the pizza was \"not great...gooey..\" but that must have been a bad day! This pizza was awesome! The crust was perfect - a little crunchy but not hard. In fact, what I liked best was that the pizzas were unique. I tried the pulled-pork, rosemary and cheese pizza. It was really, REALLY good!  I definitely recommend this little spot for anyone who wants a refreshing beer and a good pizza. They also have a cheese plate and deli sandwiches.   The bill was shockingly cheap too! I expected it to be about 2x more than it was.. another bonus to eating here I guess!"}
{"text":"My brother is a huge fan of this place, and I can now see why. Although their place is huge and a bit chaotic, their beer is fantastic. Their Belgian IPA is one of, if not the best of its style I've had from the US - a perfect blend of Belgian notes with fresh crisp IPA. And their Double IPA is also quite stellar. I cannot wait to return and try more brews - definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a pre-Valentines day lunch on a Friday. We started with the Madtown Hummus plate. The jalepenos were perfect blended in the hummus, not overpowering but you knew they were there. It was a nice creamy blend very easy for dipping. My wife loved it so much she requested a second scoop. The chef, JR came out and delivered it personally. My wife is vegetarian and it so happens that JR is a vegan, so they had a lot to talk about. JR did an awesome job with the presentations and it felt strange to see such a fantastic display at what is essentially a taproom bar. The kalamata olives were generous, which is not often the case. My wife ordered the spicy peanut salad with Tofu. She was delighted with the crisp fresh lettuce assortment. I ordered the pulled BBQ pork which was hot, not overspiced and the pork was very tasty. The pretzel bun was delicious and really made the sandwich, I ate it with a fork it was so heaped. A good thing! I would suggest a small 1 ounce side of warm BBQ sauce with it since the sauce was so tangy and yummy. The beer is always good and my wife had her usual Demento. I explored the latest options, the huMMMane and the Velveteen Habit. No complaints. Nice to see the charitable donation from the huMMMane sales to support the Badger Honor Flight. Being a pilot, I am really behind this endeavor. Nice work! We will be back. P.S. If you are a dark beer fan, the Contorter Porter is delicious."}
{"text":"Go for the beer. Eat beforehand. I took the hotel shuttle so I would not drive buzzed. If I had taken the rental car, I would have eaten elsewhere. The menu is short and uninspired. Service was so-so. I don't see why so many reviews mention the decor; it's nothing special. Very causal but nothing to go out of your way for. Hidden treasure? I don't think so. The beer was great."}
{"text":"Great beer! Excellent bartender Mary. She makes a terrific Bloody Mary (full bar a unique feature at a brewery taproom). Beer samplers very reasonable (6/6oz pours $15). Catfish Po Boy great flavor. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This was one of those cool brewery hangouts that I really enjoy. The place had a feel where you could just chill and drink all day. I can't comment on location for locals, but having just flown in town it was pretty awesome. Right near the airport. The building itself is quite massive. Still, it's the beer that is great. I tried 2-3 different beers and each was potent but full of it's own nice flavor. This place is a must to check out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and a beer. Beers are delicious and a good price. We had a pizza which was tasty. The ambiance is a bit stale and a little overloaded on the merchandise for a local Brewery. We were hoping for something a bit more low key and creative."}
{"text":"Wait staff was rude each time an order was placed. When we got up from the table and then ordered at the bar they were condescending and had an attitude. They didn't bother to come to the table to wait on a large group. Get out of the customer service business now"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: comfortable bar/restaurant, hoppy beer.  Ale Asylum is a really nice restaurant and bar space: it's obvious they've sunk a lot of money into the building and the brewing equipment. We didn't try the food, but it looked like pretty standard step-above-bar fare. It's all very comfortable.  We tried a sampler, 6 beers for $15. They're big samples, so make sure to share. All of their beers are pretty hoppy, but that's the trend nowadays. My favorite is Ambergeddon, mostly because the malt battles the hops enough to make it tasty.  Ale Asylum is a powerhouse in Madison, and Wisconsin at large. Their location is a nice respite on the near north side of town."}
{"text":"I don't like beer, like at all-so thankfully they have a few assortment of wines I was able to drink. I always take a sip of my boyfriends dark beer-the big slick and it was pretty good considering I don't have a taste for beer. As an appetizer we had the cheese plate..there were 8 of us dining so there weren't many pita slices or veggies to go around but a surplus of cheese..so I'd suggest getting 2 if you're in a big party because it's realistically good for 4-6 people. For our table the most popular entree was the pesto chicken sandwich..pan-fried chicken breast with red peppers, greens, gooey goat cheese and a vibrant pesto sauce on a brioche bun. Every bite was full of flavor. On the side I chose the chips and Guac. The Guac was nothing special but when I tried it the salsa, it was very tasty. Not too spicy for those with a mild tongue but still has enough flavor for a great salsa. For being known as brewery first, restaurant second. They definitely surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"Dont go for food. This place excels at some key points but drops the ball in other areas. The good...atmosphere, beer, and the service. The bad... the seafood tacos were the worst food I have tried in a long time. Reminds me of a bad college dinner that was put together with the only things available. Really, buffalo sauce on shrimp tacos. Overcooked shrimp. Store bought tortillas that were overly perportioned to the small filling. They didn't even add cabbage. Embarrassing. The menu shows that they are thinking outside the box, but it's a brew pub. Excell at the basics before branching out.  I can't even get a burger here."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my Dad for a quick beer after dropping my wife at the airport. As we entered we were greeted by an excitable fella who enthusiastically invited us to join him for a brewery tour. The tour was $5 and it included a beer in the bar and a tasting during the tour. The brewery itself is an impressive operation, and you know how the beer tastes. If you go on a Sunday I recommend taking the tour.  As for the place itself. Yes, it's large, and the atmosphere is as \"restaurant/bar packed into a warehouse\" as it looks, but the people were friendly and the seating in the upstairs lounge was super comfy. If you have time, check out the Ale Asylum for yourself."}
{"text":"This is a solid tap room. Great waitstaff. Solid food choices. It is tough not to like this place. The beer choices are outstanding. I had the hot ham and havarti with the claim chowder and bacon soup. Wow. Just wow.  Definitely worth it. The garlic spread is straight fire. Nom nom delicious.   Also the flight... six 6oz pours... hello! Thank you Wisconsin.   And to top it off they have 3XL dry goods."}
{"text":"This was a stop for a couple cold ones. Parking was easy. It's upscale industrial looking on the inside. Nice crowd. Food must be ok because it was flying out of the kitchen. I had something dark from the tap that was really good. This is a nice place to hang out with friends. It wasn't to loud so you could talk to people. Crowd was mixed so it appeals to all ages."}
{"text":"Review is for the beer. Stopped in during happy hour waiting for my flight and decided to go with a sampler set. Six cups, six ounces each for $15. Generous amount and great hoppy beers. Friendly staff and the food does look tasty. Nice looking tap room and ambience. A must stop if you're by Madison."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place, great beer and food and the staff is fantastic. Totally recommend this to anyone in the area who appreciates craft beer and food."}
{"text":"Great beer, obviously. Nice place too. Could have better vegetarian options on the menu though."}
{"text":"Beers were excellent and the flight was more than I could hope.  Plenty of beer choices and large flights.  Food was great.  I even took a couple of six packs home.  If I were to open a brew pub then this is what it would look like."}
{"text":"Ale Asylum just knows what it is doing.  Go here for the beer, stay for the surprisingly good food.  I generally don't expect good food from a brewery, but after they moved to the new location they really stepped it up in the food department.  The menu isn't extensive, but it is good.  It's a perfect excuse to sit a little while longer and have another brew.     I fault it for being a bit too loud at times, especially late evenings on Friday night or weekends.  I must be getting old.  And the last time I was there the waiter didn't seem to know what was going on and was a bit rude.  This was an oddity though as usually the staff is good.    That being said, I was and am not discouraged and will be going back."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed overall with the beers here.  Being one of the larger breweries in the area, I was sad to see that at least 1/4 of the beers had some residual diacetyl (butterscotch, buttery flavor) from fermentation. The levels were on the low side, but that shouldn't happen in a brewery like this.  That being said, their selection was good and the beers without flaws were really good.  The food was very good as well.  I'm still planning on going back the next time I'm in Madison to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Oh, Ale Asylum, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:  1. The beer here is fantastic.  And high in alcohol content.  Bonus.  You can try nice sized samples for a couple of bucks.  Perfect for taste sharing.  Or not. 2. The food is great too.  It's a small menu, but it's a quality one.  I mean, you're in Wisconsin so you know there's at the very least good sausage and cheese on there. 3. The brewpub is just cool looking.  Even their menus make me feel cool. 4. They've got an awesome outdoor patio.  There's nothing to look at, really, but it's big and open and has good service.   5. Pretty much everything Ale Asylum sells has something metal on it.  Rock on. 6. You can get glasses, apparel, and beer to go at the bar.  Boom."}
{"text":"Great stop whilst on Madison beer run from Chicago. Food was excellent, company of fellow beer enthusiasts was amazing. Fellow nearby bought us Action Jackson to take home!! Great beer, great service. Prices reasonable-great sample pours!! A great destination-try Trixies liquor store for local favs. Then head over to Karben4."}
{"text":"It's a great place if you want to grab some drinks with friends and relax outside. The bartenders seem to know their drinks well, and can give suggestions if you have a specific taste in mind. The food is okay, nothing too crazy or over the top."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a letdown in the food department if you're a vegan. I brought my partner here because she was super hungry, pressed on time and it's close to my home. She had a hard time finding anything plant based without tofu, (surprise, some vegans don't like tofu,) so she settled for a plate of tortilla chips with a black bean dip they served cold. Pretty sad.   I had the mexican flatbread, (veg option) which was alright.  Beers are okay. I think I'd still come here for drinks but I wouldn't bring anyone here that's looking for vegan food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always wanted to try this place. We finally stopped on our way through Madison on the way back to Milwaukee area from a camping trip. We were starving after having worked up an appetite hiking all morning. We were told to sit where we would like, so we chose a table on the patio. We sat for 10 minutes. Now, I used to be a waitress so a 10 minute wait wouldn't always bother me. What bothered me was that FOUR different waitresses walked past multiple times without acknowledging that we were even sitting there. No one brought us menus, no one told us they would be right with us, they didn't seem to be busy. One of the servers was whistling and clearing off his tables. So, we left. I'm seeing all these reviews that are ranting and raving about this place, and I'm really bummed I didn't get to try it out. I wasn't about to stick around if the service was going to be as terrible as it seemed it was going to be."}
{"text":"So I stopped in here after work with a few co-workers. One of the guys has been pimping this place pretty hard and after a pretty irritating night, we decided to stop in here before heading home.  I tried two beers and sampled a bit of a third. Tripel Nova, Pantheon Brown Ale, and a bit of their pilot Phantasm Autumn Ale.  Tripels are my second favorite kind of beer, right after stouts. I was feeling something light and sweet so seeing the Tripel Nova on the board made my heart flutter (well, not really, but still). This beer is deceptively strong--9.8% ABV, and if you're like me and not a frequent drinker you're gonna feel it. It's got a really floral, berry-ey taste to it.  I tried the Pantheon on the suggestion of one of the people I was here with. It was more flavorful than I expected from the aroma. It's fairly malty with a slightly sweet, almost cola-ey flavor. It was really smooth and didn't have any carbonation burn to it. I'd recommend this to someone who says they don't like beer.  The Phantasm was given to us in a pitcher by another party that was leaving. I only tried a little bit but my impression was that it was really aromatic with notes of citrus and pine.  As far as the menu goes..this is definitely the weakest part. They serve pizzas, but they're basically a step up from frozen grocery store pizzas. Still decent though."}
{"text":"8/17/13 took in the upstairs balcony with friends.  It's the Ale.  What more needs to be said?!?!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and daily deals.  Beer is great in my opinion.  Stop here before spending any time/money buying any food/drink at Madison airport. You'll enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and great service compared to the overpriced and under serviced attitude of MSN Dane."}
{"text":"Had 2 Belgian beers that were on tap. Pork nachos were tasty. Great service."}
{"text":"You get an invitation for a barbeque from Judas Priest, but once you arrive, you find out it's actually Kenny Loggin's house.  It throws you off for a minute, but then hey, no big deal. Good times.   I was a little surprised by Ale Asylum's setup.  Their beer angles for an edgy image.  But their brewery is so clean, so smooth.  What I liked most about Ale Asylum was their flights of beer, which included hefty sampler glasses of all their drafts. Usually you get 3-4 ounces in a taster, but these guys had to be about 6-8 ounces.  Also, their beer is more distinct than most breweries, and each type has a particular flavor that sets it apart  from others within its respective style.  For example, at our table we had multiple people who typically hate Belgians, but they still managed to like the Belgians here.  Ambergeddon, Big Slick Stout and Mercy were especially excellent.  I put their beer in the same league as Three Floyd's, and they're the best I've tasted from the Madison area.  Also, an important point in light of other comments: our server was really eager to provide prompt and continuous service.  She didn't appear to mind at all our ongoing and pathetic game of Euchre.  The pizzas were pretty good, but the beer is obviously the main event here.  Lastly, if you take a cab here, be ready to guide the cabbie to the location, since it's a tough place to find at night, especially if you're unfamiliar with the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Solid brewery and I have been to many hundreds of breweries. Prior reviews said that the food is standard and I have to disagree. Real quality stuff coming from the kitchen and the flight I had was on point. Lots of folks coming in and buying cases of brews which apparently is a real good deal also. -Cheers!"}
{"text":"1/2/2016 - Decided to pop by for dinner. They have updated/revamped their food menu. It's not quite so vegan friendly any longer. They were accommodating though which I give them a huge thumbs up for. So I was supposedly given a vegan gyro and I swear the sauce was cheese. I don't think I would order food until they revamp the menu again. Well, the salsa was still really good. I suffered the rest of the night with awful stomach pains, which is why I swear their was a diary sauce on my \"vegan gyro\". I miss the tofu peanut salad and the Danny burger. Please bring it back. So my once favorite place has now made it to the list of may not visit again for a long long time.   Previous review: Finally made it back a few times to grab a cold one and to try their menu. The peanut salad with tofu is so addicting! I love it! The hummus plate was inventive, I would order the salad in a heartbeat over the hummus plate. The vegetarian burger is a favorite of my man and the pizza was ok, not his favorite and he would order the burger over that hands down. Always, the beer is really good, would like a few more options that aren't IPA...love Unshadowed. Definitely becoming my favorite place to go these days. The staff is friendly and wonderful."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the brewery tour. Our host was Dean (the owner I think) and it was extremely informative. It was really interesting to hear his perspective on where they are going as a company.   The food is also really good, and the beer of course delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Service was great, place was clean, and staff was very friendly.  Beer was very good, but I knew that going in.  Food was the surprise.  I had a sandwich which was good and chips and salsa was a great side item.  Mom had a steak salad and she leapt say how good it was.  Bad points no music and a small table, but I will be bak often."}
{"text":"I just didn't like any of the beers.  We got the sampler and they were all really not very flavorful or good.  I wanted to like it, because microbreweries rock, but I didn't."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and having lunch here. I dined here with five other people and we all unanimously thought that the food was not good at all. I had the mahi mahi tacos and they were overcooked. Two of us had a side of mac and cheese, and being a connoisseur, I was not satisfied at all by it. I will say that their ale is very good! I did not have a drink myself, but I tried three types that other people were drinking and they were good. I would not recommend eating here but do recommend drinking if you're up for some beer!"}
{"text":"Ale Asylum is in an unassuming industrial park type of building, but I don't really care because I wasn't planning to hang out in the parking lot.  Entering the Asylum you first encounter the bar.  It is a nice combination of wood and metal.  The stools are comfortable and there is a chair rail.  My wife was pleased that there were hooks for her purse too.  The complete lack of TVs was a pleasant surprise too.  The food prep area is the right side of the bar.  So if you sit on that side you will find yourself observing sandwich making and frozen pizza baking.   The food menu is very limited.  It consists of 4 sandwiches and about 10 specialty frozen pizzas made by a local business.  I had a tasty ham and havarti sandwich, some garlic, cheese sticks that were actually a pizza crust with cheese and tomato dipping sauce.  I also had the chicken enchilada soup.  The fresh baked cookies was good for my sweet tooth also.  The food was OK, but definitely not the reason to come to the Ale Asylum.  I prefer a limited menu to none at all though.  I like to eat while I am spending a day getting beered.  I tend to avoid places without food.  So getting to the beer...  I ordered the sampler which included all 10 of the beers that were on tap.  Hopalicious--American Pale Ale, surprisingly smooth and hoppy Tripel Nova-Belgium Tripel Ale Bedlam-Belgium-style IPA, true to style and tasty Ambergeddon-West Coast Amber Big Slick Stout- Oatmeal Stout Bamboozleator--Doppelbock Sticky McDoogle-Scotch Ale Gold Digger-Blonde Ale Madtown Nutbrown- Nutbrown Ale with a hint of malty sweetness Hatha-Weizen-German Wheat, with some nice banana hints  The 6oz sample sizes were generous, but in line with the $2 per sample price.  All of the beers were good.  I could have done without the Gold Digger as it was a typical yellow beer, but still better than a macro brew. My favorites  were Hopalicious, Bedlam, Bamboozleator, and even the Hatha-Weizen.  One interesting thing to note is that all of the beers were very smooth drinking and I was surprised to find that the alcohol content was higher that my tongue was guessing. The staff of Ale Asylum was friendly and accommodating.  Sometimes they seemed a little too involved with some of the customers that were regulars.  Maybe I am just jealous that I couldn't be a regular.  Throughout the day that I spent at a Ale Asylum, I covered the different areas of the bar.  I started by sitting at the bar.  During the late afternoon we sat on the patio and listened to the woosh of traffic going by.  Luckily there was a fence that blocked it from view though.  Later on after it started raining, we moved to the leather couches in the lounge area.  I am a pathetic pool player but we bounced a few balls around the the vintage table with the leather pockets.  I finally ended the day back at the bar.  There are growlers and some six packs available for takeout, but remember that Wisconsin has some crazy law that prevents them from selling it after 9PM.  I had already had my fair share of the beers over the course of the day, so I didn't need to take any with me.  Overall, I enjoyed my time at the Ale Asylum.  Good beer, good atmosphere.  I would definitely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Breweries are hard to review because there are so many different factors to consider and classifications to rate. so i will do my best. First of all, location. I would semi say its out of the way, BUT since I travel a good amount of work...this place is awesome. Let me just grab a quick, cheap beer before my flight and i'm good. which is exactly what i did before i dropped my friends off at the airport and helped their flying experience.   Next the food, beer, and price: we went during happy hour so the prices were awesome. $6 bucks for mac and cheese and some chips and guac, which was all we needed to satisfy our stomach and then $3 pints on top of that! We ordered hopilicious, bedlam, and Rictus Grin. All were great. My friend commented that while she doesn't like IPA's or hops usually, hopilicious was great. So it is a definite must try since it is considered a pale ale.   Lastly, the service. I think that also the way yelp rates things it kinda hard. I wish we could give half stars total because the service is what really caught me off guard. it was pretty horrible. and granted it was happy hour, but it was happy hour on a tuesday at 3:30pm. There weren't that many people and we waited about 10 minutes after sitting down before getting menus and then another 15 before getting water and our order. But hey, it is a brewery and most aren't known for their service so i'll give them a pass. However all in all, this place is great. If i could give half stars it would be a 3.5 rather than a 4, but i'm rounding up because i'm feeling nice today and a good beer can salvage alot.   happy drinking!"}
{"text":"Went to Ale Asylum last night at It. Was. Amazing. First off, the restaurant is really cozy for a brewery--my friend and I got a small table and it felt more like we were in a pub. Great lighting, great atmosphere. Ordered the Gold Digger beer and it was great. The food was absolutely delicious. Actually some of the best pub type food I've had in Madison. Ordered The Danny burger, a veggie burger that comes with chips and salsa on the side, and the Caprese appetizer. The veggie burger is certainly the best I've had in Madison. So flavorful, not mushy or falling apart, and topped with sprouts on a delicious bun. The caprese app was also delicious and had amazing pesto on the side. Service was good, laid back but attentive. Wish I lived close enough for this to be my regular."}
{"text":"Ale Asylum is a low key brewery that's perfect for a quiet night out with your BF or a small group of friends. We showed up around 10pm on a Saturday night, and although the patio was already closed, there was plenty of indoor seating.   Not being a huge beer fan myself, I was happy to see a couple of cider options, of which the berry cider was perfection. We also ordered food, and when I tell you the OG flatbread was superb, I 100% mean it. It was crispy, garlicky, cheesy and greasy in all the right ways. I finished half and literally had to stop myself from tackling the rest since I was stuffed. This was something I wish every brewery served.   Service was a little slow, but he comped our appetizer since he completely forgot about it, and thus served it AFTER the entrees. No big deal to me, especially since they were so responsive. Overall, I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"We've been with Ale Asylum since the beginning, in their original location. It has been great to watch them grow over the years, and conveniently move even closer to our house! I love that we have some of the best beer right in our own neighborhood. We have a rule in our house that we have to walk or bike there (or snowshoe, as may be the case) since we live so close.  The beer is fantastic. I've long been a big fan of their porter, smooth with a nice chocolate flavor. I haven't met a beer there I didn't like, though. They also stock a full bar and decent wine.  I also enjoy their food. They rotate their menu and have some good salads. They've had a great roasted vegetable salad during winter and I recently had a really good steak salad. The fish tacos are great as well. I like how they incorporate their beer as salad dressing ingredients and in the hummus.   Pizza is a standby and always a winner.   Note there is no TV, so not a place to hang out during a game. I appreciate that it's a tap room and not a rowdy sports bar.   I also have to give a shout out to their brand management. All the beer names and logos are clever and they've stuck to their brand over the years."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Ale Asylum on a recent trip north to Madison. As is the case with many brewpubs, this one can be found in a commercial/light industrial park in a nondescript building. No bother because I'm only interested in what's inside. I would have thought they might have had some more interesting house varieties (not available in bottles), but I found all the standards only so I opted for the very trusty Hopalicious. The outdoor patio was inviting this early-summer evening with attentive waitstaff keeping us well-hopped. Shot a piss-poor game of pool inside, but it was nice to have something to do besides sit on our hineys and inhale beer.  We didn't have the chance to try any of the food offerings, but the pizza everyone seemed to be enjoying looked pretty fantastic.  Can't wait to get back, but hope they might consider introducing a few more daring or rare varieties to those who seek out their brewpub."}
{"text":"Headed here after a big race and was looking to enjoy a brew and a great meal. Overall we had a great experience both as adults as well as with our kids. I was a bit disappointed there were no options for kids, but made due just fine.   I ordered a cheesesteak and was very happy with the sandwich. I find it odd that you have to pay extra for fries (chips and salsa are the default side). One thing I was really disappointed with is that they were out of their own beers. That seems ridiculous to me... am I wrong here? If I'm at a brewery I would assume that they could supply their own beer. On top of it, their beer list is done with little business cards in a sleeve. If they're out of a beer, why not take it out until it's restocked?   The environment was great and our waiter was attentive. Our drinks that were in stock stayed full and condiments were brought without asking.   Hoping I can come back here the next time I'm in the area and gather some redemption on their beer list."}
{"text":"I went during the afternoon when they were not too busy. It is a new environment with plenty of parking.  I had a bowl of chili which was very good along with a sampling of their beers.  The service was attentive and I will return."}
{"text":"Ale asylum has my vote for best brewery in Madison. Flights are generous. Never disappointed with the rotating selection. They offer pints and half pints. Atmosphere is cool inside (lots of tables too) and there's also a patio area outside when the weather is nice. Food is surprisingly good too- with emphasis on local ingredients. Noticed you get the best service when seated and eating at the bar, but that's no aurpr"}
{"text":"Two words ...GOLD DIGGER!  Go get ya some.    Took the day off to sneak behind the cheddar curtain to check out some Wisco beers in Mad town.  I've been to a few breweries but this is the first one where I had a hard time choosing a favorite one.    We did have the chips and salsa with a side of guac.  Wait.what salsa, didn't even touch it.  The guac was fresh and fantastic.    The bartender was friendly had an awesome sense of humor and made the time we spent there even more enjoyable.      I love the bar area, didn't see the dining room but the bar was slick and clean.    Extra bonus points for having a very cool selection of shirts with slick designs.    Well done guys, well done.  See ya soon."}
{"text":"I decided to do a small brewery tour of Madison WI and this was one of the spots on my list of places to check out.  I had met the head brewery at a function about a year ago and really wanted to check the place out.  It was very different than I had expected, I was expecting a normal small, micro brew in a warehouse. This place is really big and definitely not an old warehouse.  They do serve food, and they had about a dozen of their beers on tap when we arrived.  I went with the beer Unshadowed and really loved it, I loved it so much I got a six pack to go.  I also tried a couple of beers that my friend had and they were all really good.  I did not have any of the food, but from what I saw it looked great.  One note too... they actually offer pitchers of beer here, which I've never really seen at a micro brew.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area, cool space and great beers."}
{"text":"Very good microbrewed beers (the bartender and waitress, on two different visits, were great at explaining how the different brews were different and what was good about them) and excellent little gourmet pizzas.   The noise level can get high, but is IS a bar."}
{"text":"First time here so we tried the PB & WTF? appetizer. House made peanut butter, nann bread, onions, pickles, bacon, and tomato jam. Sounds weird but you use all that to build little sandwiches. All 3 of us were skeptical but really liked it. Three of us split 2 of these appetizers. The shrimp tacos were pretty good but my wife just loved the chicken salad sandwich. The bartenders know what they're talking about and they'll let you sample beers before you buy. I liked the place. Three entrees, 2 apps and 3 big beers were $63. Without beers and apps would have only been $30. Nice outdoor 2 level patio also."}
{"text":"Really good beer, unique setting, great food, close to work.  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Good food and beer, horrible service. I think the bartender left. I've been waiting for almost 30 minutes for my bill."}
{"text":"Ugh this is a hard pill to swallow to only give 3 stars. I love hopalicious. I love the layout and design of this place but seriously the food is a total joke. Maybe I'm just spoiled and used to breweries with good food and a chef. Please check Ale Asylum out for drinks and brews but I'd definitely go elsewhere for food.   Nice bar. Friendly bartenders. Nice vibe"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to a resort in Wisconsin Dells. Great beer. Awesome staff. Really good food. Worth going outa your way to check out."}
{"text":"Great draft selection. Very good service.  Only disappointing part of the evening was the OG flat bread that was drowning in cheese.  Understandable, we're in America's dairy land."}
{"text":"The Ale Asylum makes me want to move to Madison.  Seriously.    It's no secret that I am a snob about many things food and beverage related.  There I said it :P  Is it wrong to like high quality things in life?  Sure, I could drink some shitty Miller Lite, but why would I when the Ale Asylum serves up amazing brews?  I went here a few weeks back and immediately was drawn to their beer flights.  Forgive me, as the 9 \"samples\" (at least 6 oz pours) left my memory delightfully fuzzy. And might I add, this flight was less than $20!!   Quality beer at an affordable price.  I likey.  There were two very friendly bartenders, always making sure we were doing okay (how could we not be?!) :)  I got to watch one of them pull some pork for various dishes--looked so delicious.  Next time I need to try a pizza or something.    They do offer brewery tours once a week.  I think that'd be really fun because the people we encountered were so nice and seem truly passionate about their craft."}
{"text":"Food was great had the duck bites which they can improve on. I would suggest trim the duck fat more since they are using bacon and to help reduce time. Par bake the bacon still soft nut almost done that will reduce time by 40% and maybe a better plating and some sauce that stick well as well. The beer flights were great the diablo wow it is wicked good."}
{"text":"Hey, I live on the North side, and I know they are popular, but every time I stop by I feel like Charlie Brown who just had the ball pulled away again.  They never have enough wait staff.  The menu is limited, unless you like pizza.  All of the beer is over-hopped, so unless you love IPA, you are SOL.  There are few other options outside of a bottle of cider.  If you like waiting for hoppy beer, and eating one of a few items on the menu, this place is for you."}
{"text":"The beer selection was good. The only beer not available at the time was the double IPA. Very nice facility. I split 6 tasters with a friend. The tasters are very large for a taster. All beers were good, the wheat beer (unshadowed)  and the tripel (Tripel Nova) were my favorites and gave a 4/5 stars on utappd.   Outdoor seating is a nice option. I didn't eat but they do have food options. I will go back next time I'm in Madison.   My true rating would be 3.5 but rounded up to a 4 because the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"A great sustainable green business model. Awesome people working here. Cool people drinking here. Someplace where the lunatics can take over and enjoy the awesomeness of beer. Sunday $5 brewery tours can't be beat. Always an amazing Belgian or two ready to be poured down your throat or a fallback favorite waiting in the wings. All craft, no crap. West side? Take a ride!"}
{"text":"This brewery by airport is pretty popular and has much better beer than the place that everyone seems to go to downtown. The bar area is large and there is a nice outside patio for good weather days. The staff is super nice and accomodating and will let you taste beers if you are unsure of what you want to drink. They do have a taster special and that's the way to go if it is your first time here. I ate here but the food was nothing special - it's acceptable if you are just having a snack while drinking.  Pro tip: you can buy their signature beer by the case. Apparently people love it as I saw quite a few people just stopping in to get beer."}
{"text":"The beer was pretty good (not great) and the place was nice. They serve some of the beer way too cold.  The place is big and has a pool table in the back and dart boards in the front. They must make a good amount of beer- their production facility is decently sized.  Pizzas look good... I will go back sometime to try 'em.  Happy hour is (I think) 3-7 and $3 pints."}
{"text":"My attitude about Ale Asylum was a little bit skewed as I walked into their bar on Saturday.  When I first heard they were opening a new location I was very excited, but when I saw the ginormous building going up on Packers Avenue, my excitement peaked to giddiness.  Sadly, Ale Asylum missed the mark on a few key upgrades that were missing at the old location.  Ale Asylum may have become their own worst enemy.  With their beers available in bottle or on tap at many popular Madison restaurants, they needed to make their new location something really special.  Though the new building and in-house beer are special, the food and service are lacking.  They really needed to step up their menu.  When I heard a few months back they were hiring a kitchen manager, visions of a delicious and sinister version of the Great Dane menu danced through my head.   Unfortunately, all I got was a large font, one page menu of salads and sandwiches.  Yes, they have pizza too, but it is all pre-made by Falbos Brothers and brought into the kitchen to be cooked later.  Meh.  I'll pass  Drinking their spectacular beer usually makes me hungry for a yummy treat, so I went ahead and ordered their fish tacos.  Sadly, the only side available without paying more was chips and salsa.  Really?  Chips and salsa?  That's the bare minimum I would expect from the low-quality fare at Pedros.   I upgraded to the side salad for an extra dollar, and got spring mix with two pale slices of tomato, diced red onions, and shredded cheese straight from the bag.  Again, meh.      The tacos were light and delicious, but lacked some seasoning.  I would definitely order them again if I found myself there again.  The roasted beet salad was also plentifully sprinkled with cheese and beets, but sparsely dressed with their vinagrette.  I shared my dressing from my salad, which made my co-diner's experience more enjoyable.   Another note:  We were there around noon, and the bartenders were drinking pretty consistently the entire time we were there (about 2 1/2 hours).  Very unprofessional...but it seemed like managers were around, so I guess they aren't very concerned about that.  Overall:  Sorry Ale Asylum.  I would rather go to a better restaurant that serves your beer than your own brewery.  I'll consider coming back if I hear through the grapevine about a kitchen and staff upgrade."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, what more could you ask for. I had the catch of the day fish tacos. Two words...blueberry salsa! Yum! My husband and I had a flight each to try all the brews AA had to offer. My husband had the fish fry. Another two words...spicy tarter sauce (I guess that's three). Nothing was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the new Ale Asylum and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Every beer I tasted was great and the food was amazing.  It's a great place to meet up with friends and unwind after a long day at work.  Lots of parking and conveniently located.  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week  with a friend for a quick beer before my flight. The staff was very friendly and recommended a few of the beers to us. We tried 2 of the beers that we'd never had before and were both really happy with what we got. The prices were also very reasonable (~$4 for a pint). I loved the ambiance - it's very open and spacious yet comforting at the same time. We didn't try any of the food, but I definitely want to come back so I'll have to try it then!"}
{"text":"Good service and they have a beer selection that isn't just IPAs. We ended up getting 2 growlers and a 6 pack actually. Then we had a lunch that was very filling and yummy. I'd say it was worth the detour on our way home from Chicago."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch, especially if you have a layover and some time to kill because it's so close to the airport.  They brew their own beer which is quite tasty. I tried the Belgium tripel and the stout, both delicious. They ran out of the Porter but have seasonal beers.  The service was very friendly and timely which was impressive for being at the sit down table around the corner from the bar. Our waitress was great.  The food was impressive. I wasn't expecting much from a brewery but they had a good variety and the food was delicious. I had a pulled pork sandwich with a pretzel bun, a tiny cup of coleslaw, and a plate of tortilla chips with salsa. The pineapple juice was decent and was better than just a mixer juice for the bar.  The pesto sandwich was also very good with an excellent sauce and fresh grilled veggies with chicken.  The cheese sticks looked quite filling for an appetizer and the salads looked delicious. I enjoyed the atmosphere, food and beer here."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday afternoon with some friends for a pint and ended up spending a couple of hours there with some pitchers.  The bartender was nice and the music was great.  The beer was amazing.  I had the pizza which was not great, a little gooey and not great crust.  I know they do sandwiches, but they don't offer them on Sundays for some reason.  The patio has a terrible view of the Fed Ex building and a gas station, but the interior is comfy and inviting."}
{"text":"Pros:  Great beer (obviously) Innovative food menu to compliment the brewery's offerings  Tons of seating and super hip interior Patio in the summer (close to the Mallards' ballpark, so great if you're looking for a place to hang after a game)  Cons: LOUD  Overall, I love Ale Asylum, both restaurant and beer. This is a stand out bar in its area - there isn't a ton of competition right near the airport. Also a great place to impress your out-of-town friends and relatives."}
{"text":"Great variety of brews to choose from. I prefer the ales but whatever you choose it will be very good. Cuban sandwich is also and great bite to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped here for happy hour (mon thru fri between 3-6 pm for $1 off pints and $2 off pitchers.) before my flight. Awesome decor. Very tasty hefeweizen. Food menu is limited. Enjoyed the goat cheese salad, shrimp ceviche, gazpacho. Sat at the bar and thought the service was fast, efficient."}
{"text":"The seating situation is crazy.  The host kicked us out of an open chair but refused to seat us somewhere else.    Good beer, poor customer channeling.  The branding is great for a microbrew, but something clearly needs to be done to make the dining experience better."}
{"text":"When flying in to Madison or just passing on the way somewhere in Madison I have wanted to try Ale Asylum.  So last evening our family who live here are making me dizzy discussing the crazy traffic and the Friday Fish Fry madness both on the roads and in the cafes (quite breathlessly I must say) when I whisper \"how about ale asylum\"...really softly under my breath...  Close to the house, no Fish Fry panicked early arrival needed, and a simple menu while sitting outdoors. Boom. I'm golden.  I had the Mad City Nutbrown and a Pantheon. Very nice! Our Madisonites order and swill so fast I have no idea what they drank. Oh well. They must fortify for summer before the beer pipes freeze and they are stuck with wine club deliveries for 7 months I guess. I have no idea being from the West Coast.  The meat pizza and the special- Hawaiian with horseradish mustard sauce were pretty nice.  Service was attentive and I liked the friendly nature of the place.  This place must be something special for they have their own zippy important looking driveway en route to the airport- a little tricky to leave but easy to get in.  Big parking lot sufficient to be able to skirt the beer stunned Madisonians wandering out clueless into the cars...  Prices are reasonable- once again you can take a bazillion Madisonites out to brunch or lunch or drinks or dinner for under $48 when the same services in LA would run you $150....  Secret for LA folks: flying out here plus food/drink bills is so economical- don't let your Madisonians travel to LA- promise you will meet them here and you can still afford to eat.  Just keep emphasizing that this lovely city has all one could ever need and it should work.  No seriously- my husband still tells the story from 2012 of a Madison bar tab we had of just $7.50 for drinks for 3 people and he gesticulates and his eyes bug out. I love Madison (when not sleeping in my boots under a dog or two)."}
{"text":"Decent beers served in typically disappointing brew pub style. what is it with brew-pubs? Great in theory, but in reality the food and service never live up to the beer. This one is like a motor-sport themed Chili's. If that sounds awesome to you, have at it, rawkers.   Someone *probably* associated with the place, a user named Bill T with no reviews just one \"tip\" about how the Ale Asylum is not the Great Dane (?) and is not \"cookie cutter\" because the servers have \"their own personality\" (or something)  just sent me a rude personal message after I gave a less than adoring review. Surprisingly that failed to improve my opinion of your mediocre pizza or service."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to make it over to the new location--pretty awesome!  For what it's worth, I think they are, without a doubt, the best brewery in the entire state.  Cool digs, free pool and great beer. They had a one-off on tap when I went--a very drinkable session beer which (I think) was classified as a Belgian pale ale. It was nice, had subtle hints of coriander and orange, and was totally delicious. Ballistic was the standout--you know, because IPAs are where they shine.  I will absolutely go back for food. Until then--Ale Asylum's brews will continue to remain in my fridge."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The beer is always good, the food is tasty, there are plenty of servers, and it's conveniently located.  I also like it because it is HUGE.  Even on a busy night you can easily find a table.  They have a massive capacity and are great for groups."}
{"text":"Came here for the beer and decided to get a bite to eat. WOW was my burger perfect! It was a bacon cheese burger with a Sriracha ketchup and some type of aioli. Asked for pink and was cooked perfect. I'm always afraid to order burgers because so often they come out overcooked or dry. Our sever was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the beer selection. I tried a Belgian IPA and the session IPA and love them both."}
{"text":"Seriously great beer.  I did the sampler while I was there.  There was not a single beer I didn't like, and the servings were much bigger than on the usual sampler.  Madtown Nutbrown, Diablo and the banana-y Hefeweissen were delicious. Very limited food selection."}
{"text":"Great burger, best I've had in awhile, alot of beer selection, fast service, no fries or cheese curds but everything else is good"}
{"text":"Went to Ale Asylum back in March during a brewery crawl with my boyfriend and it quickly became one of our favorite breweries! We each ordered a flight of beer; there were so many beers on tap we couldn't even taste them all in two flights! One thing though, before ordering, we wish we would've known that the flights would be the biggest ones we've ever seen!! We are used to flights having either 2 or 3 ounces in each pour with 5 or 6 pours. At Ale Asylum they treat you GOOD and give you 6 pours of 6 ounces each! Please let me state that I am not complaining about the size of the pours! But knowing this, we probably would have started off with one flight and ordered a second later if we still wanted one. Since this was already our second brewery for the day and we were running on no breakfast or lunch, it took us a while to drink them all, so the second flight started to get a little warm. Totally our own fault, not Ale Asylum's. At this point we desperately needed food and since it was my first trip to Wisconsin we ordered the Wisconsin Bread Cheese appetizer. The \"bread cheese\" on the appetizer menu is very misleading because there is no bread. It's 6 little triangles of cheese  (about the size of a laughing cow cheese package) served with jam, honey, and almonds. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but at this point we really needed some carbs and were hoping the \"bread cheese\" would suffice this. If you order this, and I do recommend it, I would also order something with some substance like a pizza. At one point a bartender dropped a 6 pack of beer right in front of us and my boyfriend joked, \"that beer is for free now, right?\" The lady looked up at us and said \"heck yeah it is\" and gave us the five bottles that didn't break for FREE! We told her we were kidding and she insisted we take them because they couldn't be sold after they've been dropped, so they would be garbage anyway. So nice! Later the same bartender gave me a small sample of a Bloody Mary she was making for another customer because I told her it looked delicious. Seriously, one of the best Bloody Mary's EVER! If I hadn't already had a flight of beer I would have ordered one. This place is awesome. The flights are huge, the staff is amazing, and the beer is good! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The service was just ok.  I know that the later it gets, the earlier a server wants to get out of there.  But honestly, it was 8 pm and our server asked us if we wanted our check like three times.  We were drinking.  Our tab was over $70.00.  What the heck.  Now the food is surprisingly delicious.  I ordered the chimmichurri (sp?) steak salad. Naturally GF.  I love not having to modify!!!  It had nice flavors, was cooked well and was actually filling.  Dinner salads are kind of a toss up.    For a beer place, the wine selection is pretty good.  I kind of wish, the wine was a little cheaper.  It is just Wollersheim.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.  OH! And it is right near the airport!  Always better than eating fast food before or after a pick up or drop off."}
{"text":"Food was great, bloody mary and long island were awesome. Yeah I ordered a bloody mary and long island at a beer place... deal with it."}
{"text":"You probably know Ale Asylum because of Hopalicious, Madison's (and much of Wisconsin's, and now Illinois') favorite Pale Ale (an American Pale Ale, but no one will give you a hard time if you call it an IPA).  It's worth it to pay a visit to the home of this and the other great Ale Asylum beers.  You'll get a nice variety - they're a pretty diverse ale brewery - and the chance to have some beers that are only available on-site.  These used to be referred to as the \"Asylum Limited\" series, but now they're giving them each their own name, so if you want to try a limited release and you don't know their beer list like the back of your hand (you don't??), just ask your server about the Limited.  I'll be (somewhat) brief on the beers, because the best way to experience these is to drink them, not read reviews ;)  They have a really broad range of ales: I've brought a lot of people here with varied tastes, and everyone has been happy.  On the hoppy side, there's the aforementioned \"official beer of Madison,\" but be sure to look for Ballistic, and, if you're not driving, operating heavy machinery, or about to make an important decision, get a Satisfaction Jacksin if they have it.  For dark beer fans, Contorter Porter (used to be called Disporterly Conduct in the old days) and Big Slick Stout are great representatives of their styles.  The various Belgian styles are all done very well and worthy of your attention.  This is the second facility they've operated in their relatively short life so far, and it's massive.  There's a large, high-ceilinged main bar area (this can get a bit loud - not a bad thing, just something to know), a quieter, more restaurant-y dining area, and a separate bar area upstairs.  When the weather is nice, the place to be is outside on the patio!  While the menu isn't extensive, there's something for everyone with a nice list of pizzas (made for them by Falbo Brothers) ranging from traditional to unique, soups, salads, and sandwiches.  Unlike a lot of brewpubs, they don't operate a fryer, so have some chips and salsa with your sandwich, or go healthy and get the greens.  You are having beer, remember!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a beer and some food.  The beer was good enough, but the food was just okay.  I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and a cup of their soup of the day which comes with beer bread.  All were okay, but I did really like the smell of the beer bread.  It didn't taste especially beery, but had a nice smell to it.  The sandwich was pretty standard, not bad, but not great.  I'd stop back in, seems like a fun enough place.  One thing I did notice is that all their pizzas are just frozen pizzas, and that actually makes up a large part of their menu.  If they worked on their food more, that would be awesome, but I can understand if that's not their primary goal."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and food! Saturday night, no wait, not because it's bad but because it's massive! We sat on the large and beautiful patio. Fresh flowers, super clean, truly wonderful! The beers are great. I had the big slick stout, smooth and chocolaty, with hints of coffee. My husband had the unshadowed, more of a wheat beer, fruity, light and refershing. The menu doesn't have many options but it was diverse. There is something for everyone and it's spectacular! I had the Buffalo Chicken. They marinate the chicken in their beer, slather it in buffalo sauce and blue cheese something, fresh greens and an amazing bun. So delicious! My husband had the BBQ pulled pork and immediately smiled with the first bite. The sauce was tangy and sweet, again delicious! Served with chips and salsa. The salsa was also delicious. Our chips were slightly stale but I still hoovered them.   Service was good, she was polite but no overly friendly. We had everythìng that we needed but did find ourselves waiting a while for our check after our meal. Nothing major, but we were tired and ready to go home, even laid the card out on the table. She didn't take the card but left to print our bill before taking the card, despite me trying to hand it to her. Again, not a big deal but we were tired and eager to get home.  We will be back and I would still recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The beer? Killer. The food... Meh. The pizza, while local (Falbo Bros), is pretty pedestrian... Although the pulled pork got rave reviews from my party. Go for the beer... The rest is gravy."}
{"text":"Went there for a tour on a Thursday - based in Internet and website info.  Got there and tours were only on Sundays.  Cool windows gave us a peek at the process, so - okay...  Had a couple of great beers.  Food was very good and priced nicely for the quality.  Service was spotty, borderline bad(ish).   Heavily tatted Hipster staff was a little haughty with us, we were older than most patrons.  Asked for a little extra salsa (very good) for the chips and was surprised to see it brought out as a side and charged $1.50.  That did not set well.  Overall recommended, good beer garden, if a little noisy from the traffic, but would return, given the right set of circumstances."}
{"text":"More a review for the product itself, since I haven't stepped foot onto the actual premises (yet). I'm sure that'll change next time or two I head out to Mad-town to visit one Mister Corey D...  Review! Ale Asylum! Wisconsin beer!  ... you betcha it is, and it's flippin' tasty, to boot.  In all honesty, I wasn't a super-fan at the beginning. I think the first brew I tasted was the Ambergeddon, and I was sort of one the fence about the whole thing.  Enter: Satisfaction Jacksin. Game over. Double IPA for the win. I mean, I do love double IPAs as a rule of thumb, but this one is up there. It's in the top ten, and that's a big deal. It's really good.  Follow: Contorter Porter + Madtown Nutbrown = delightful and drinkable darker brews for fall and winter months. (I'm a seasonal drinker, what can I say?)  Can't wait to visit the brewery itself, take a tour, and get even better acquainted w/ the Ale Asylum family of suds!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after visiting The Great Dane brewery. It's not near as relaxed and cool as the Great Dane was. The staff was pretentious and rude and the beer was just okay. We drank our beer and moved on, no need to waste any more time than necessary in this place."}
{"text":"The beer: Awesome. These guys are a staple in Madison and I loved visiting them at their old place. I like that they throw a new \"Limited Asylum\" beer into the mix once in a while as I enjoy trying new things.  The (newish) Digs: Cool building/atmosphere and nice patio space.  The Food: Basic menu leaves something lacking. I thought the menu was going to improve since they opened, but unfortunately this was not the case. I have had the pulled pork and the beef sandwich. The chips and fresh salsa are amazing.  Lots of bike parking!"}
{"text":"My group agreed. This was our favorite stop on our trip to Madison. Sunday starting at 12 running every hour (until 4 or 5?) Pay five dollars for a pint and a tour of the brewery. Such a delight and the best/friendliest/most intimate tour in Madison. Took us incredibly close to show us equipment, fun stories and thoughtful/passionate/generous tour guide (possibly the owner?). Unique aesthetic. Beer holds up too!"}
{"text":"They had 9 beers on tap and we chose to do the beer flight which included all of them in a generous size sample.  It was 18.00 for the flight which comes out to only 2.00 per sample which is a pretty good deal.  We had never purchased their beer before and we were pleasantly surprised.  We really enjoyed the gold digger blonde ale, hatha-weizzen, mad town nut brown, and bedlam.  They have a nice bar area with a couple tables and also bench seating area.  They have shirts, pint glasses, hats, etc for sale.  A t-shirt cost us 18.00.  I also noticed some hard liquor choices available at the bar.  They are expanding this fall of 2012 to a new location.  The plan looked really nice with a great upper and lower outdoor patio area.  We will definitely have to make another trip to ale asylum in order to see the new place."}
{"text":"Great beer.  If you love IPAs this is your place.  Satisfaction Jackson may be my all time favorite beer. Watch the  ABV  because many of the beers are potent.   Great food: their kitchen used to be limited to pizza and apps but they recently added a more extensive menu with creative sammies.  Several good vegetarian and vegan options as well.   Fun atmosphere - but no TVs.  If you are hoping to watch the game here better BYOD to stream it over the  free WiFi."}
{"text":"Ale Asylum runs a very informative tour which includes a pint of your-choice beer and a smaller sample about halfway through - all for $5.   You have to buy tour tickets in person. We showed up at 2:40 on Sunday, paid our $5 and were touring by 3:00. I called ahead of time to make sure there were spots available.   It wasn't the most fun brewery tour I've ever been on (Lakefront in Milwaukee) or the most in-depth and personal (Capital in Middleton) but I'm glad I went and I am happy to support local breweries. I'm sure I'll be back to hang out in the tasting room."}
{"text":"Not really my type of atmosphere but the beers and food are great and so was the staff there. thats why im giving it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've been left with mixed feelings about eating here again. The food,  what there is of it is undeniably well prepared and imaginative. What it is not, in any way, is  generous for the price.  This is a bar after all,  not Alinea or some NY mecca of haute cuisine. I say that because beer and its filling properties will constitute the large part of what is a satisfying meal here.  Alone,  the pizzas and entrees  will fall short. My wife and I decided to split a salad that was described as having beef as its protein source and a pizza. Now I knew from having eaten here before that pizza is a relative term. Here it is a thin cracker crust, no more than 8 ounces , very well done but still a $12  menu item that is really an appetizer in size so we were counting on the salad to round out the meal. What we got with our very fresh baby spinach, dressing on the side, dried cranberries and cubes of roasted squash etc.( A very nice idea I should add) were 3 slices of beef (medallions) with a sprinkling of melty Parmesan cheese which were approximately 1 1/2 \" long and about an inch wide with a thickness about 1/4\" thick.   This is on a $12 salad. Since we split it,  when the waitress brought the pizza and asked us about the salad,  I commented that 3 pieces of meat between two people is a problem. I was informed that the salad was designed for one diner.  One diner the size of a squirrel might have been dissatisfied let alone,  one human. You could feel the chill come over her as her first thought her tip was in jeopardy instead of thinking of providing us with some satisfaction.  So we know what we're talking about here , I made a salad for myself the next day with some grilled chicken breast and for the hell of it cut 3 slices of meat approximating the sizes of the 3 slices of beef I'd seen the day before and put them on my digital scale. I was thinking maybe it'll be 2 ounces. It came to an 1 1/4 ounces.   Restaurants are not in the food business. they are in the hospitality business so when the patron points out that they think they're getting a gun stuck in their ribs,  an appropriate response isn't to wise off.    I realize protein is an ongoing issue for restaurants and their bottom line. Why else would high end places be coming up with dishes that emulate meat ? When one considers steaks of charred roasted cauliflower, confit of carrots etc. the answer is, \"meat costs more than vegetables,  dummy.\"  None-the-less when you're located in a suburban area of Madison, Wisconsin,  your overhead isn't a New York overhead. Though I've enjoyed the place I'm up in the air about ever going back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and horrible service both times. My first visit with my boyfriend and his friends we ended up spending over 125, easily. We were there two and a half hours. Not because of hanging out but because they kept walking past our table.   The second time the dude kept looking at us then started helping other tables. I was done. I'll never go back to this place."}
{"text":"After an initial service issue was resolved our experience greatly improved. The waitress brought me a great flight of beers that I thought were great and even my wife enjoyed 4 of the 6 beers (she's not a beer drinker). The Spinach/Artichoke Dip could use a little more cheese in it but it was still very good as we wiped out the dip far before we wiped out the chips. She ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger which was FANTASTIC with plenty of cheese and bacon and a very tasty beer reduction sauce and caramelized onions.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich with two types of Wisconsin cheese on grilled sourdough. It was the perfect duo to split between us and each of us ordered the bacon clam chowder soup as a side which was delicious and I will be attempting to replicate at home."}
{"text":"What a difference a month makes. A month ago I left a bad review after a culmination of several visits/experiences - Ale Asylum's response to my concerns were swift and immediate - I received contact from Hathaway and Jillian. They took time to listen and even referred me to Otto, co-owner, who asked me to visit with him. Their collective concern was genuine and meaningful. I was impressed and grateful that my comments and concerns were invited and respected. Yesterday we stopped for a mid-afternoon sandwich, served at the bar. The welcoming and charismatic attitude was infectious from the start. It was nice to see staff and patrons enjoying themselves, the great beer, and excellent food - served with enthusiasm and genuine interest. Kudo's to Hathaway, Jillian, Otto and everyone at Ale Asylum - the beer you create is something Madison and Wisconsin can be proud of, your food has always been creative and tasty, and yesterday your staff made visiting Ale Asylum fun again. Thank you. I look forward to visiting again soon. Take a few minutes to visit Aly Asylum and enjoy the experience - I believe you will. Ask about the new brewery tour."}
{"text":"If you're in town and have a rental car, this place is an excellent stop prior to your trip home. It's super close to the airport so you can drink in peace without feeling like you're going to miss your flight after you get stuck in traffic.   I got a sampler, which has six of their beers for $15. It sounds pricey, but the samples are huge (6oz I think). Personally, I'd rather have smaller samples so that the last one wasn't completely warm by the time I got around to drinking it, but it's not my brewery. :)  The beer was good, not the best I had in Madison, but all very hoppy. I think this backfired a bit, making their beers seem a bit one-note, but they were good beers overall.   The place was hectic and busy, and seemed a bit understaffed for the crowd. But our bartender did a good job of managing it and was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The beer here is great.   We also ordered lunch.   We were assured that we would have enough time to eat.  The food service was slow....  but the food was great.  My friend got the Philly cheese steak sandwich and I got the pad Thai chicken sandwich.   I haven't been able to stop thinking about that sandwich since I had it.  I am not local, would like the recipe so I can have again.  Brewery itself wasn't too spectacular."}
{"text":"First off, I am giving this review three stars instead of the two stars I REALLY want to give, just because it is related to service and food only--not the beer. This is a brewery, so beer is their #1 concern(as it should be) and it shows.   I don't drink beer, but the others that were with me do, and said it was good. The beer is four stars, but everything else is two stars at best.  The service was horrid, and the food was mediocre. We were seated outside, and they were understaffed because they had \"technically closed the deck for the season\", as our server told us. It took forever to be able to order once we were ready, and we waited somewhere between 30-40 minutes after we were done eating just to be able to get the check and LEAVE. We went inside to flag someone down to get boxes, and she said she'd bring them--and didn't. So, one of us went inside to get them.  I ordered the beet salad. The menu lists \"spring mix, roasted beets, roasted corn, chopped onions, and pistachios...lemon juice and olive oil, topped with goat cheese'\" I got no pistachios, or nuts of any kind. They added mandarin oranges, and the greens were SO overdressed that the salad was soggy within five minutes. Seriously? If your menu states specifics, I expect THOSE things on my salad. For $12, I expect accuracy, and not a limp salad that i just push around the plate. I would have said something to our waitress--if I had ever seen her. Two others got the pizza, and it wasn't horrible, but not something we'd order again.   Bottom line: I won't be back, but might send people here for post dinner beers."}
{"text":"Good beers, decent atmosphere, skip the food.   (+/-) The atmosphere screams motorcycle bar with lots of steel and metal work.   (+) The beer was great. We sidled on up to the bar and did a flight (nice big pours (+)), but the food was lackluster (-). The shrimp ceviche was disappointing and service was pretty average, but this place beats Great Dane hands down for more creative and interesting brews."}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping in at Ale Asylum.  My initial plan was just to top off a growler but decided to stay for lunch.  I had my baby in tow and did not have a problem having her with me while we ate lunch.  It is very obvious there is a local crowd of regulars during lunch.  Mary was tending bar and was just what I expected growing up in a small town where the barkeep knows everyone and has no filter.  We had great conversation and excellent food.  I had the Asylum burger and my friend had the Cuban. My burger was advertised as 1/3 pound but I would guess it was pushing 1/2.  It was huge and delicious.  I enjoyed the chips and salsa.  The salsa was on the thin side but had good heat.  I was told the Cuban was delicious as well.  The beer was outstanding too.  I would have had a flight if I was not in charge of a baby for the day.  The only downside is that they did not have a changing table for the baby.  I understand their clientele is usually Over 21 years old not under 21 months but on the flip side it is a restaurant.  In the end I will come back drink more of their beer and eat more of their food."}
{"text":"I have been slowly, but surely, falling in love with Ale Asylum. Their beer is always great. I've tried at least 3/4 of their normal selection over the past few years and a good chunk of their special brews. They all vary on the goodness scale, but that's probably due to personal taste. I've never once had anything I didn't enjoy drinking.  The tour is pretty good as well. Not quite as good as some of the Milwaukee tours I've been on, but they're pretty hard to compete with. The tour guide I had was fun and informative. I would definitely recommend it if you have an interest in seeing what goes on in the brewery area or learning about how beer is made.  Now, here's where they won me. My friends would drag me here every now and again for various reasons. I was always pretty average or even disappointed (I'm looking at you, catfish poboy) on the food. That is, until I tried their burger. Holy crap, I could never praise that burger enough. I will go on for the rest of my life knowing that I've had the best burger of my life at the age of 25. If I ever move I will tell the tales of how I'll never have the best burger of my life again. Or I'll make sure to visit Madison just for this burger. I have no idea how they do it or what's so different, but I don't care. You could tell me this burger was made of kittens and I'd still be a monster and eat it. It's really that good. I'm not sure if it's the chef or the recipe, but I always go in at night on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday. Don't ever change the recipe. And if it is just the cook, give that person a raise.  Go in. Order a burger. Order a beer. Rejoice in your perfect life choices. Repeat."}
{"text":"If you are there and the daily special involves pork belly...ignore the menu. Have that. Today, for Thaco Thursday,  they knocked it out of the park! Well done Adam and crew!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Love the beer, hate this place. Went there for a friend's birthday and a really nice (not ale asylum) beer was given to her as a gift. They confiscated it! It was unopened, and was going to stay unopened. They didn't ask us to take it to the car or anything, they just took it! They also wouldn't let us eat home made birthday cupcakes. They seriously need to lighten up. They are in my opinion one of the best breweries in Wisconsin and they treated us terribly."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant space, really decent food, and cool shiny brewing equipment. Bonus option: brewery tour!  There is an upstairs lounge area with lots of cozy seating, a bar, and you still have access to the full menu.  I've only stopped in a couple of times, but I can definitely recommend their tacos and the tempeh pita. Yum!  I categorically hate all beer, but friends have said that their beer is very good and they offer a wide selection so you can never get bored even if you are a regular."}
{"text":"Had an awesome bartender, the beer is good (lots of variety), and they also have pilot batches you can try! It's also really nice that it is close to the airport, so you can get your friends a beer when they first come into town or right before they leave!"}
{"text":"I love their beers. I had their brown, porter and stout... all excellent. The food was really good too, especially considering that they have not really been in the serious food business for a while. I feel like I should give them 5 stars because they are not trying to do too much, but their menu is still a little limited. In the end, how can one not like a place that makes a point to let us know that all of their beers are vegan."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by all of these negative reviews. We stopped by for some beer and dinner after we landed across the road in Madison.  It was setup with the seat yourself option that night so we took a tour around both floors to see what this place was all about. The place is huge and there are different vibes depending where you sit. The upstairs has a smaller bar with a couple tables. It seemed quieter and a little classier up there. The downstairs has a huge bar area with pin ball and high tops as well as a nicer dining room.  We opted for the downstairs bar so we could interact with the bartenders and learn more about what they had to offer.  I enjoyed the Contorter Porter and Madtown Nutbrown. I also had the Asylum Burger which I thought was great. Everything comes with chips and salsa unless you pay an extra dollar for other sides.  One of the owners was actually at the bar and we struck up a conversation with him. It was very interesting to learn his style of brewing and how they create the different flavors we were tasting.  I'd definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Unbelievably awesome place. Beer is good, but the atmosphere and layout is amazing."}
{"text":"Decent late night ears. The menu is modest but decent. The hot beef sandwich was good. I also ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup. The soup was clearly house made and loaded with chicken. Actually more chicken than noodles. Companions had hummus plate and chips and salsa. Both were generous portions and looked pretty good."}
{"text":"The concrete walls are the coolest part of this place. In a close second is the service. Coming in at third, sadly, is the beer.  Full disclosure: neither hubs nor I are lovers of IPA. This brewery offers mostly IPA which leaves our options scarce.   There's not an option on the menu for flights so we asked our waitress and she confirmed they do have them! Shew! 6 good sized beers for $15, it's pretty fair. You get a sheet to fill out with your choices and out they come.  The brown ale is really the only one I remember trying that I actually would've ordered more of. Everything else was either meh or gross. I shadowed was straight up disgusting.   We called ahead to make sure it's a toddler approved establishment and they said yes but they only have 2 high chairs. For a place that has a decent dining area, you'd think they'd be more accommodating to families. I guess I'm just spoiled by my local breweries.   AA, you have potential if you mix up the menu better and throw some family friendly options around. Probably will skip you for now, though."}
{"text":"Delicious beers, great tour! A good variety of unfiltered and pure ales. Have not tried the food, but would like to next time."}
{"text":"Strong showing of Belgian-style ales in a pleasant atmosphere. These are definitely their strengths, but other beers are well done as well.  Their house-made salsa is a plus, but the extra charge for more salsa is a little bit of a downer, particularly when they give you so many chips that it is supremely obvious that the dip they give you is not enough. That's a bit disingenuous."}
{"text":"Ale Asylum was our backup choice for lunch when the first place was closed due to a kitchen fire.  Well let me say that in hindsight I am not disappointed we had to go here.  I enjoyed a flight of beers with my husband.  The Hopalicious is one of my favorites!   For lunch I had the spicy peanut salad with chicken.  The flavors were great and I felt like I got a good portion!  Plus it evened out the beer I was drinking nicely.  The flavors in the salad were good although I could have gone for more \"spice\" in my spicy peanut sauce!   The tasting room was pretty empty while we were here.  We came with a big group and had no problem getting a table and our server was great!"}
{"text":"If this is an asylum, lock me up and throw away the key. As cheesy as that sounds, let me tell you that this place is completely legit. On our trip to some Wisconsin breweries, this was the second one that we went to. I had a sample flight and had one or two of the choice drinks in there. It was incredible and I think \"Why isn't this as as world renowned as the 3 Floyds hype?\" It is unknown if I ever return but if I had the power of teleportation I would visit on a weekly basis. My hat goes off to the staff and brewmasters at Ale Asylum."}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews for this place I'd be a fool not to bookmark and plan a future visit!  I did just that and once again Yelp community I thank you for another recommendation because this place was great.  There were a few things that I didn't completely dig but all in all I had a great experience.    I went here on St. Patrick's Day and for some reason I didn't think that would be a problem.  Get this however, it wasn't.  After being somewhat disappointed that this place was more of a restaurant and less of an actual full on brewery with tours we went to the front to get a table.  Even though this place was packed we were seated right away.  As I walked to the table I remarked to the hostess how busy they were and she noted that for a Saturday they were actually pretty light.  I made a mental note to not try this place on a Saturday lest my idea of this place change.  Anyway, we were seated and greeted almost immediately by our waitress.  She was nice, tatted and fit with the cool decor of the place.   We started our meals off with the nachos and I ordered a light wheat beer.  The beer was actually really good.  My disappointment however was with our appetizer.  First I think the nachos with the salsa were $4 or so which of course isn't bad.  They also bring a huge portion of nachos which was great!  What they don't do is provide nearly enough salsa.  I mean it was tiny.  It was so tiny that we would have needed at least 4 more to finish the nachos off.  And of course when we wanted additional salsa there was an additional charge of $3 which is damn near the price of the nacho basket.  It seems kind of sneaky to me.  If you want me to eat less nachos don't bring so many.  If you want me to pay more for nachos just increase the price. Don't seduce me with a large nacho basket with salsa that isn't enough for a quarter of the basket.    My other gripe with this place is that when they brought my side salad which by the way was really good they didn't even ask me what type of dressing I wanted.  I am not sure if it is because they only have one type of dressing or if she forgot to ask but either way I ended up with ranch even though I would have preferred Italian.  With the salad dressing it was the same issue with as I had with the salsa.  The little black condiment container they use was only half full yet I had a pretty decently sized side salad.  There seems to be someone in the back who is somewhat stingy with the condiments.    It sucks that this place had those types of issues because it really marred what could have been an excellent dining experience.  With all that said however the fish tacos that I had were top notch!  They were perfectly seasoned and the tortilla was nice and warm.  The man ordered some kind of flatbread burger that he really enjoyed.   He did however have the same gripes that I had though his major gripe was that he considered the portion size to be a little on the small side. I think restaurant portions are getting out of control anyway so I had no beef with the portion size.    Would I go here again?  That is a great question.  I think so.  I really enjoyed my dish and loved the beer.  I would however stay away from the nachos and see if I could somehow finagle my waitress to provide a full serving of the Italian dressing."}
{"text":"Top three high/lowlights  1) good microbrews 2) gluten free options available 3) inexpensive  Went to Ale Asylum for lunch on a Saturday and was seated right away. I can't drink beer but Ale Asylum brews are well known in Madison and get great reviews. Our server was really nice and got me a gluten free menu right away. Unlike some places, the gluten free menu shows you not only which items are already gluten free but also how you can make substitutions to other items to make them gluten free. I ended up getting the ham sandwich on gluten free bread with a cup of the soup of the day (split pea). My friend got the pulled pork sandwich and a salad. We both thought our meals were good but nothing super special or note-worthy. Overall, I think Ale Asylum is a great place to meet up with people for a drink and apps but maybe look elsewhere if you are looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"First time here as I was back home for the holidays. I must say, I'm impressed with all of the breweries that have been opening up in the Midwest.   Ale asylum is good stuff. Went there last Friday and enjoyed a couple different brews. Namely, the blonde (not really my thing, but well crafted none the less.), and the demento, a pale ale with a firm taste, but really smooth. It's always nice to enjoy something that isn't an IPA, especially since here in California it has been the rage for what seems like forever.   Next time I'm in town I'll have to give the stout a try."}
{"text":"I guess I keep in mind that this is primarily a brewery, not a restaurant, so I think the food is outstanding.  Smallish menu, but the pizzas and salads are really tasty.  Beer is great!  (OK, Sticky McDougal is off-style, since they use belgian yeast in this scotch ale, and it tastes like it.  Why? Why? Why?)  Tasters are freely given and decently sized, and bartenders actually know details about the beers (ingredients, style differences, etc)."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of visits to this place over the last couple weeks, and I'm decently pleased.  I think the staff is what really sold it to me above anything else.  The bartenders have been consistent, on top of what they do, and have remembered us each time (which may or may not be for bad reasons).  The menu isn't anything out of this world, but it hits all the marks you'd expect at a brewery, such as pizza, sandwiches, etc, but oddly, no burger (although I might've just missed it somehow).  The pizza was fair, and the cheesesteak and seafood tacos were really good, but I'm not a fan of the salsa (needs more umph).  I'm curious about the duck poppers and the PB WTF, but I keep ending up there with the pickiest of eaters, so I'll just have to ignore them at some point.  A nice perk is that they have a full bar.  God knows that not everyone is a beer drinker, so this keeps them viable as an after work option.  You'd think that everyone in the military likes beer, but you'd be sadly mistaken...and disappointed.  On the note of beers, AA has a solid selection of brews and the pricing is pretty decent for the selection.  Between ambiance, the staff and the beer, they've replaced the Great Dane as my bring-people-to-a-brewery place.  Especially given the ease of parking out this way instead of downtown."}
{"text":"Beer- You can't go wrong here.  If you like beer, they have something for you.  However, if you don't  know exactly what you want, it can be difficult to get them to help.  They are beer experts, not everyone is.  When I've brought people who don't know what to order and they ask for suggestions some of the answers fly right over their heads.  Food- Pizzas are the best thing to get here.  I've tried several other menu items and they have been... ok.  Besides, what's better than pizza when drinking beer?  Atmosphere- Very fitting for a brewery.  Always busy.  Large bar which is nice because I typically want to belly up to one when I'm in a beer mood.  Easy to find and tons of parking."}
{"text":"This place is insane. I'm really sorry we didn't do the actual tour now after spending the day drinking here. The beer is all great and the service was fun. The food looked good but we decided to eat elsewhere. If you are anywhere near this area this is absolutely a brewery worth making the trip to!"}
{"text":"this is by far my favorite local beer. the location of the brewery/restaurant is a bit weird, but the place itself is pretty solid... cool decor, friendly bartenders and (duh) great beer. the menu is small but everything is yummy.  i am anxiously awaiting the return of their tripel nova."}
{"text":"Yeah it's okay. If you have extra time cause a flight  is delayed, it makes sense. So so food, so so service. Definitely not my first choice."}
{"text":"Great beer and better service! If you're lucky you can catch Mary behind the bar. Always friendly, and quick with a beautiful smile. No tvs is a plus."}
{"text":"I have now been here two consecutive times with fantastic service!  Friendly and knowledgeable.  If it keeps coming, so will the stars.  Hopefully they got rid of the other life-hating bar manager.  Thanks for stepping up the service Ale Asylum!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to like this place.  Wood fire pizza and tasty craft beer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries period. Both good and beer address great, service is excellent as well. You could try all the beer on the menu at any given time and not find a bad one."}
{"text":"This place had pretty decent food and there beer was fantastic but our server last night was one of the worst servers Iv ever had. I was honestly scared to order anything else being afraid he'd do something to my food / drink, he acted so annoyed when I asked for beer suggestions and generally gave off the most hostile vibes while talking to us, will most definitely never be back"}
{"text":"So beer is my thing. I'm a west coast guy who loves big, west coast IPA that are dry, bitter and filled with glorious hops. This place is probably the best in southern Wisconsin so hence the 4 stars. They have 4 different IPAs and a double that is good. Super close to airport and makes it an easy place to wait for the person you are picking up and grab a quick beer. The food is good too."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a beer and an appetizer! It's a little pricey but it's worth the taste and atmosphere. My favorite appetizer is the duck appetizer! Forgot what it's called but it's spicy and super yummy! I also got a flight of beer and they have a variety of good tasting beers from light to dark, and hoppy. Love the outdoor seating too but wish I could have had my flight outside instead of inside, that's the only thing that sucks."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but delicious experiences at Ale Asylum.  Scrumptious pizzas, sandwiches (good cheese!), and most importantly, BEER!  So many to choose from!  Try them all (and be sure to hire a cab to take you home)!  Why go to McD's or The Sports Pub nearby when you get something so much better just across the street?  They also have a great pool table, comfy sitting areas, a nice smoking patio... and cute bartenders!"}
{"text":"I never went to the old Ale Asylum, but have been a fan of their beers for a long time. Hopalicious is one of my go-to beers, and Ambergeddon is another fantastic beer.  I headed out to the brewery two weeks ago with a friend of mine I haven't seen in a while. I happened to have the specialty brew when I was there which was the Blood Red Ale. I also happened to have three of them. Believe it or not but this wasn't my first beer, but you'd have thought it was after drinking those in a small window of time.  The brewery/tasting room has their neat art/beer designs up on the wall. The bartenders are quick and courteous. While I did not eat when I was there, I did notice (before those beers took effect that is) their waitstaff seemed to move quick as well. The way the kitchen is set up is a bit awkward, as you can see into as you walk in. The back portion of the dining room also has an awkward amount of open space that needs \"something\" back there.   All in all, I had an incredibly enjoyable evening (not sure I had to reiterate that part) and will be back. I am just not a fan of the haul it is for me to get out there, and if I plan on those three beers again, I am going to need to make more friends that don't love beer as much as I do."}
{"text":"From the outside AA looks like one of those modern church-cities.  You know, an over-sized joint large enough to land a jumbo jet in.  OKay..AA isn't that big..but it's much bigger than the average bear (or brewery).   Inside, the space isn't quite as evident.  There's a main bar area and a separate restaurant area on the first floor.  Additional seating is available upstairs.  We sat in the main bar area as it's kid friendly.  After hiking Devil's Lake for 7+ miles, we were hungry and thirsty.  I had a long drive home and could only allow a half glass so I went with the Contorter Porter.  This was delicious and I badly wanted to inhale the thing, but take driving seriously, and we had two hours ahead of us.  Turning my attention to food, my son and I both had the bacon cheeseburger.  I ghosted the thing in double quick time given my hunger.  Did the same with the mashed potatoes.  As a side note, next to our table was a very cool photo of some Air Force planes that were sponsored by AA.  Each pilot signed the photo and there's a letter of thanks to AA for their support.  Ironically, on our way out of AA, we passed the airport and these same planes fired up their engines and took off right before our eyes.  Just a cool moment, and unique timing I guess.   I'll look up AA again when I'm in the neighborhood.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"For a brew pub they seem very fond of order. I met friends who were biking here and the host was quite concerned we not congregate by the door. There was a free table by the door, but it only had 6 seats and it was a party of about 11, and they didn't want some of us standing. It's a bit strange to have a brew pub to commit to being sit-down service. They do have an upstairs outdoor patio, so we were able to enjoy the late afternoon sun, only slightly marred by a couple of smokers. They didn't have staff service on the upstairs patio yet, but you could go inside to the small bar and order food. Trouble is, they were \"changing over the menu next week,\" so they were out of at least half the menu options, including, I kid you not, the bread and cheese plate. Chips and salsa/guac were about all that was left besides fried mozzarella sticks and a strange peanut butter 'dipping' plate. I passed on the remainder of the options, which might not have been a bad idea, as my friend thought the pulled pork was dry. Another friend liked the fish tacos but with a jalapeno aoili, I had to pass. Beer was okay--I tried a small glass of the Ambergeddon which did indeed have a bitter aftertaste (as described). The Bamboozelator was delicious."}
{"text":"Always good food, beer and service here.  Chips and Guacamole are a great starter and then we had the cheese bread.  Sad they didn't have Contorter Porter on tap as its one of my favorites, but with so many other options it's easy to pick something else.  Sat out on the patio and had a nice evening."}
{"text":"Interesting place to grab a beer and enjoy the ambience of the brewery.   You can view the process of making beer through the windows in certain spots of the place.    Names of the beers are pretty cool.   Big serving of food dishes. Typical bar food."}
{"text":"Ale Asylum has some solid beer choices with a nice range of styles in the taproom. The tour is a nice interactive tour. Menu looks good though have not eaten there yet. May go again for a tour, will definitely be back again for the taproom. Love the decor of the entire place."}
{"text":"Beer Ipa and seasonal Ipa. Black bean burger just ok. Wish their patio was dog friendly, or at the least, fenced differently so you could leash dog on outside of fence.  Friendly service. Inside is cool too. All new!!"}
{"text":"Great craft beers.  Try the havartti  and ham sandwich, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for the $5 brewery tour and was not disappointed. The price included a full, pint-sized sample of any tap beer and a 45 minute (that actually ended up being 60 minutes) guided tour.   The tour went through the entire brewing process and we were able to walk through the brewery while it was in production. We sampled beer that was brewed 5 days ago and then beer that was brewed 14 days ago so that we were able to understand and taste the difference.   The tour guide ended up being one of the owners and it was evident that he is very knowledgeable in the brewing process. He encouraged questions and thoroughly answered each one."}
{"text":"Although I had a less than satisfactory visit here during the summer, my latest visit has fully redeemed them :-)  I recently attended the Gail Ambrosius 10th anniversary chocolate and beer pairing event with a couple of friends. Oh. My. Goodness. First of all, the entire event was free, and the chocolates and beer sample pours were varied and plentiful. If you got there early enough, you could mention the secret code words, and Gail herself handed you a ticket good for a free pint of your choice, as well. There was even a door prize drawing. Wow. Fantastic!  It was very well attended, and a bit warm, but given the cold snap we've had, that was welcome. I'd never been to the upstairs before, and it's really nice up there. Comfy red couches, tables, and big windows, and quieter. A perfect place to sit and chat and sip. And I found a new favorite Ale Asylum brew, Ballistic IPA. Bright and citrusy, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Really weird industrial park location.  Maybe it's easy to get to if you're familiar with Madison public transit, but I'm not, and it seemed a bit boonies.  ANYWAY, if you're not an alcoholic looking to get trashed this shouldn't be a problem... it's not exactly far from anything, just not exactly near much either.  Except a meat testing facility.  More on that later.  Must give kudos for being an independent brewery.  Beers were solid, but not outstanding.  Food choices were not many (4 options, of which 2 were depleted).  I liked the pizza we ordered but my boyfriend wondered if it was a frozen Tostinos.  But it's about the beer, not the food.  They have couches.  I like couches.  They have a free pool table, I like free AND pool tables.  They have a patio.  I like drinking my beer outside, except when it's in a cloud of smoke and accompanied by wafts of what our waitress told us was a smell coming from the meat testing plant next door.  GROSS!  What the hell is that about?  I've got a high tolerance for the unsanitary and am far more comfortable at a dive than a high class joint, but that wigged me out a bit.    Moral of the story: good, not great beer.  Stay inside, or get your beer to go."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty terrible so keep that in mind when deciding whether not to dine here. We ordered beers and flights & chips and guacamole when the server got distracted for a minute. She left and came back. We told her never mind on the chips as we realize we can get them as a side with our meal and she told us we couldn't take it back even though it was just ordered a minute before.  The duck poppers were ok, the chips and guacamole were meh, The adult grilled cheese sandwich was good and the Mac n cheese was good. The food was pretty hit and miss.  Our waitress continually picked up our plates before we were done eating and even took half a beer off the table when my friends snatched it back from her. She also had BO.  Everyone liked the beer."}
{"text":"Awesome place to begin your visit to Madison, located just as you exit the airport. They have tons of seating, both inside and on a large outdoor patio. The food menu has lots of yummy choices, either for appetizers or entrées. This visit, we shared a spinach dip plate, which was tasty.   As for the beer, we'll I don't think you can go wrong with any choice. Just to be sure, I did a flight, which consisted of a choice of six beers served in generous sized (looked to be 6 oz) tasting glasses. While Hopalicious is their signature beer, everything else was really good too."}
{"text":"We finally got the chance to tour the facilities, and I must say I am impressed with the current scale of production!   The tour is $5 a head and includes a free pint of any beer on tap and a free tasting. The single beer available for tasting is really at the discretion of the tour guide, although I had hoped to be able to sample a full flight of their beers on tap and wouldn't have minded paying a little extra for that. They did let us sample what the Happy Ending tasted like before and after conditioning though, definitely an interesting, and educational, juxtaposition.  I liked that the tour took us through the entirety of the brewing facility, allowing us to get up close and personal with the brewing vats, malt hanger, and the likes - I've been on a number of other tours where we weren't really allowed to walk around the equipment and see them up close, and I felt like that really cut down on the experience.   Finally, our tour guide was fantastic! He did a great job of explaining the brewing process, and was awesome about fielding questions from the audience. Unfortunately, we did have a few obnoxious members in our tour group that made the experience less enjoyable, and I would have liked to see the tour guide regulate the loud side conversations a little better. Oh well.  Ale Asylum is such a great place to spend a few hours on the weekends - I can't wait to be back to try their menu!!"}
{"text":"Came here immediately after landing. I was bummed out by their flight selection bc they had about 15-20 different drafts on the list but more than 50% were crossed out bc they were considered seasonal. Nevertheless, the ones I chose were good and HUGE. Service was good and the atmosphere was laid back."}
{"text":"A whole lot of hoppalicious has been drank by this guy right here.  The food was never something I really went to Ale Asylum for, but it is pretty tasty if you need something to soak up the booze.  Great seating, and nice big bar area, as well as big tables to hang out with relatively large groups."}
{"text":"I love local brews and spent a Saturday with my dear friend checking out a few breweries around the area. Ale Asylum was my least favorite, mostly because the beer is \"beer beer\" it's boozy, hoppy, and packs a serious \"thwap\" to your insides. I'd come back if I had friends who wanted to check it out, but wouldn't necessarily come back on my own volition."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars I would, I mean I really would. It is just that good! (Is anyone as excited as me about the completion of their renovations?)   This place has some of the best beer on the planet, you may not find that your particular beverage of choice is on tap, but just like food, beer is seasonal. For me it is all about their belgians...strong, tasty, and ultimately dangerously tasty. For those who simply can't decide where to begin, they have sampler platters available.   Also, they have some of the most hard-working bartenders I have ever seen here! They must have type caffeine+ blood because they just don't stop. Don't hesistate to ask a kind question, they will let you know everything about that beverage while simultaneously pouring you a sample and straightening your tie.   They also offer some good, simple dishes here at very reasonable prices. Pizzas are great because they are so shareable and always have such fresh and unusual ingredients, although they offer soup and sandwiches as well...  With beer this good you could serve it to me in a leaky basement and I would still give this place five stars! (Of course their facilities are impeccably clean and lovely!) Drink beer here; this is all you really need to know."}
{"text":"This is an updated review.  Last time I walked out after not being waited on.  This time the service was quick and friendly.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and they serve chips and salsa as the side.  I have never seen this before, but I will roll with the punches.  The burger was great!  Very large patty and very tasty.  The salsa was very good with a medium thick tomato base.  The only disappointment was the chips.  They were cheap and tasted like something from a bag.  Too bad, because the salsa was so good. Overall the food was very good.  However, towards the end of my visit the waitress disappeared and I had to wait to close out my ticket.  My ticket before tip was $14.00."}
{"text":"I'm happy that America has made a name for itself in the brew world with their brand of crazy-hoppy IPAs.   Unfortunately, IPAs are usually too bitter for my pallet, and my distaste for them has made me question my patriotism.  It has also kept me from venturing to the West, land of the IPA, more than once a year.   Thankfully, Ale Asylums IPAs have taught me a thing or two about IPA appreciation.  Somehow, their IPAs have all the hoppyness without any of the grapefruit-esque bitters.  I don't know how they do it, but I'm all aboard their train. choo chooo"}
{"text":"Great beer, forgettable food. Terrific beer sampler. The food is pub style food and isn't bad but not worth going for without the beer"}
{"text":"Beer was good and the food was really good. We had duck popppers, quinoa burger, wings, bacon cheeseburger, pulled pork sandwich, artichoke dip. Nice building and plenty of space"}
{"text":"I like you Ale Asylum, I do. (Sorry it took me so long to tell the world).  I just returned from Woodman's with some bottles which reminded me I have yet to write a review for your space.   First of all, it's HUUUUUUUUUGE! 43,000 square feet I believe. And I've heard they have the ability to expand with demands to well over 100,000 square feet - nuts! While they weren't yet brewing/bottling when I was there, it was still cool to walk the floor and eye over the incredible machinery that blankets the space. Strategically placed windows mean you can see a part of the operation from almost anywhere in the tasting room and tables and chairs are laid out in a way that makes the place feel open and airy (which it is).   Now let's get one thing straight here fellow Madisonians. It's a tasting room, it's not a restaurant, it's not a bar, it's not a nightclub, it's not a lounge, it's a tasting room. I'm bemused by reviews that single out the food as not being so great... just go there and drink! If you're looking for some fierce food head to one of the bajillion restaurants that serve Ale Asylum on tap. The place is for trying taps, chatting with co-workers, letting your hair down... I don't think it was built with the intention that it was going to win culinary awards with a cornucopia of food options for every palate.   I dig the Ale Asylum orange paint that's long given them a hip edge, there's a cool commissioned mural on one wall and outside when it's warm are awesome planters that were made locally with reclaimed wood.   All in all, it's a great place to chill after work or er, uhm when you should be at work!"}
{"text":"Ale Asylum is a unique stop near the airport. I tried a beer or two and wasn't super impressed (tasted soapy to me), but the food was pretty good. I ordered shrimp tacos and they were great with their cheese sauce. I would possibly go back again to give this place a second try, since it seems to be a favorite of some locals."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a couple beers and an appetizer. The 12 oz. Curl was a quality choice; however, all four of our beverages came far warmer than you would expect. As for the eats, the Smoked Pork Quesadilla was just average - by no means bad but not memorable.  The outdoor seating is a big plus, which keeps it a solid three-star location. I know it's 4-star on most visits. We'll be back soon to see if that's the case."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer connoisseur by any means, but this place definitely has some unique brews. I tried the 10% Triple Nova and the Ambergeddon and both were fantastic. I didn't give this place a 5 only because I was there for a short time and I don't feel I'm an expert on this style bar, but if you're looking for good beer this is definitely a place to stop."}
{"text":"I organized a meetup at the Ale Asylum, and just as a heads up, they do not accept reservations.  This means they don't care if you have a group, they will do nothing in preparation.  We had to put tables together for ourselves, and since there was no host, we had to direct people to our table. Service was good, and I was amazed that our waiter managed to get everyone served, even as they came in staggered.   The food...the food was not good.  It would have been one thing if my food wasn't good, but every person at the table shrugged their shoulders and said, \"Meh'.  Burgers are served pink or no pink, which apparently means raw or done.  I upgraded for an extra $1 to get bean dip, and it had no flavor at all.  None.  We got the pepperoni and salami flatbread pizza to share, and it had no salami. It's a beer place, and I don't drink beer, yet I had 2 cider ale's that I enjoyed.  It's a good place for meeting a couple people for drinks.  But eat first!"}
{"text":"The Big Slick Stout is great.  I had the Cuban along with others who had the pulled pork, pizza, and ham and cheese and everyone liked every bite.  The wait staff was very friendly and informative about the menu and the area.  A great place to take family, friends and or clients."}
{"text":"I finally visited the Ale Asylum's new location! I met friends for a drink and dinner. I am always a fan of Ale Asylum's beers - Hopalicious & Mad Town Nut Brown are my favorites.  I was pleasantly surprised with the food. Our group had fish tacos, a southwest salad, and a pulled pork sandwich and there wasn't a bite on any of the plates at the end of the meal!   Ale Asylum is a great place for happy hour & snack/dinner for sure!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ale Asylum for years now, and with the new menu change I'd like to recommend some options to people.  Spinich Artichoke Dip is TO DIE FOR! They serve it with this rosemary bread that is out of this world.   The adult grilled cheese is also on this heaven bread, and it is delicious without being too filling.  Staff is always super friendly and attentive, I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Ale Asylum beers for quite a while, but finally made the trip into the brewery after a group of a dozen people all coming in from out of town deemed in the best place to meet.   It is a big building that is easy to get to and has plenty of parking. Granted, it was 1:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, but we pretty much had the run of the place the whole time we were there. I think they had 15 of their different beers listed up on their wall above the bar, with a few more options on a special menu. It was cheaper to order pitchers than pints, and we went through quite a few of those. Their standards are top notch, including their Madtown Nutbrown, Hopalicious, and Bedlam, but I also got to try quite a few that I haven't seen elsewhere, including some seasonal and even some experimental batches. At least when I was there, the focus seemed to be strongly towards pale ales, but they certainly had something for everybody. I don't remember the exact numbers, but their flights were much more expensive and came with much more beer than I wanted for a flight to use as a sampler.  The food menu wasn't big, but everything sounded great. They had a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and a decent variety of pizzas. They also had a few special offerings that were listed on a board up front. I got the spicy BBQ chicken pizza, which was more than enough for 1 person. The crust is super thin but very crispy, and the ingredients on top were delicious. The rest of the food also got good reviews, and the price point is pretty much just on par with what you would expect.  Our waitress was fantastic, and kept up with our large table without any issues. She was also very helpful in making recommendations about beer or food. We made things difficult at the end of lunch by splitting up checks in a weird order, but that was no problem for them either, and was very convenient for our large group all ordering lunch and pitchers.   I will definitely be back here the next time I am in Madison, and hope to be able to catch them for a tour of the brewery."}
{"text":"I am not a hophead.  You can count the number of beers i drink in a year on both hands.  This place combines the Teutonic quality and thoroughness typical in Wisconsin with the MadTown coolness.  Great beer--great food nice place good service.  Was there as the Badgers were moving into Final Four--good news--no TV"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, easy parking.  This restaurant will appeal to anyone who enjoys hearty food and wants to experience a local brew, maybe even a flight of 12 different local brews.   Prices are reasonable (June 2018) with most dishes priced around $11-$13. Beer is at the upper pricing end at around $5-$7 per drink.   The atmosphere at lunchtime was very relaxed. We were able to seat ourselves and a waiter was around to help us quickly with menus. Even though there are not a whole lot of choices on the menu, deciding what to order may be quite a challenge as all the food sounds delicious.  When my food was served, it was a meal for someone who is hungry. The walleye po boy sandwich had great flavor and everyone was very satisfied with their meals.  I ordered the Dumb and Dunkel which was excellent and highly recommended. If you enjoy a smooth beer, this is for you.  You can't go wrong if you eat here."}
{"text":"This is more of a college hangout setting. It is VERY LOUD. I have gone here a couple times to experience the decor. You can see where the beer is being made too which is kinda cool. The food is just okay. The Staff is freindly."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend last weekend and loved it, tried the beer flight of 6. Not really into dark beer so I stuck to the light ones which were nice. I liked their Gold Digger. We plan to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"A few of the great things about living in Madison are the huge selection of fantastic local beers and amazing restaurants. Ale Asylum has definitely found a winning combination in their new building - serving up some of the best beer in the country and offering a great selection of delicious sandwiches, pizza, and snacks to go with it.   It's loud, busy, and rather insane some nights - but definitely worth it for the ridiculous selection of their own beer they offer on tap.   Few things make a long, hard, week come to an end better than a fresh pint of Mad Town Nut Brown and that is ultimately what will keep me coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"Great idea. Great product. Too busy to function. I felt like an afterthought. Then a fly got in my drink and the bartender got mad when I asked for another. I politely explained that I just didn't feel comfortable drinking it and she replied \"it's protien, it's not going to kill you\"   Sorry I don't drink bugs.   Save ur money. This place is all for show."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at Ale Asylum on a rainy Saturday afternoon with some friends and family. The two beers I ordered were refreshing, light, and crisp--exactly what I was looking for in an afternoon beer but nothing to write home about. I knocked off one star because the food was not impressive at all. I tried the Thai shrimp salad wrap and some of my friend's catfish po'boy. Sorry to say it but I was disappointed. The shrimp was chewy and didn't taste very fresh, I hardly ate it. And the po'boy was blah, forgettable. I was sad to see they don't serve fried cheese curds, boo!!!!! They also have a sad selection of sides...no fries?! What in the world!? Tortilla chips are your only option unless you upgrade to soup or a side salad. I don't think I'll be passing by here again anytime soon, but I wouldn't mind picking up a 6-pack of Demento (btw they have cool & fun beer names) if they have it bottled or canned anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Cool. All good. Good beer and cool place to hangout.    Try any of the hoppy beers or my fave, the Heff. Then sit outside for some sun or inside to get a view of the brewery in progress.    We didn't eat but menu seems good.  We did however try the pecan smokeys which are chocolates made with beer wort and chocolate made with beer wart, dark chocolate, and sprinkled with pecans.   Service is good but be ready for an onslaught of hoppy beers."}
{"text":"If there was a 6 star option I would rate Ale Asylum as such. Although I have not been able to get to the newer location, I still know that it is worth going to. the following will be based on the original location and the beers. Mostly the beers. The former location was not really huge, but was arm and inviting. A semi formal bar and an impinger. You know, that thing that cooks pizzas and sandwiches on a conveyer belt. food options weren't the best, but I was not there for the food. I could have been there for the free pool on the table though.  On Saturdays they had tours. I have a friend that frequents Wisconsin often and when I hear tale that she is going back, I salivate. I get giddy and my hopes soar for the greatness that I shall receive upon her return. My fave: Hopalicious. Simply put a hop centric ale with a floral, pine bouquet that is just fantastic   Ambergeddon: The phrase \"My Amber beat up your IPA\" had me intrigued and I really like the malt forward clean hop finsh. the color, as the name suggests is a nice reddish gold.  MadTown Nut Brown: Really mellow, semi malty. Hazelnut undertones. Better than Newcastle, Thirdstone, etc...  Contorter Porter: Not my style, but akin to Anchor Porter in terms of quality  Ballistic IPA: This is a newer brew and while good, is more like Rampant IPA and seems thrown together to satiate the thirst for west coast IPA.   Satisfaction Jackson: Double IPA. Delicious and perfectly balanced malt and hop. I would love to grab cases of this any time I go through  Tripel Nova: 10%ABV. You are limited to only 2 glasses of this if you visit. It is dangerously good. Just try it!  Bedlam IPA: Pretty perfect in terms of what you are looking for. Just enough malt, but a lot of hop. I love it.  The labels for Ale Asylum were designed to be cool enough that if you got them tattooed on you they would still be appreciated. I would never put a Bud Light Lime tatt on me, but if I was more inclined for a beer motif, Ale Asylum would have no problem going on my skin. Labels don't make great beer, though Ale Asylum does."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch pizza that had unique flavors and was baked to perfection. Unique thin crust that was their special recipe. Friendly wait staff, great experience."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer.  I recommend the Mad Town Nut Brown.  Service is good and they have a good selection of food to choose from which is a plus from some other breweries.   Highly recommend this place. Stop while in town."}
{"text":"Been here one time for beer sampling...was neat and friendly place ....good selection of beers ..like to go back again."}
{"text":"Came to the Ale Asylum on a weekday for lunch and a drink. There were plenty of places to sit, and I ordered a beer and a cheeseburger. The burger comes with chips and salsa, which was different, and I think I would rather of just had french fries as a side like most places offer. The burger was great and I had no complaints. They offer a large variety of their own brews and have brewery tours on Sundays. They have a large outdoor patio that gets pretty busy in the summer months. Overall happy with my lunch here and will definitely come back for food or just drinks."}
{"text":"Lotsa great beers to choose from, and plenty of space to sit, one of Madison's biggest breweries, sadly didn't get to try any of the food but oh well. I tried the Babadook beer (amazing title btw) as well as the hopalicious and the hashalicious. My friend got the Dr Vennum and I tried, also good. The board with all their beers is pretty big and lit up. The servers were nice. If I'm ever back in Madison I would definitely go back. Located pretty much in the heart of the downtown area"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was blown away. The service here (both our waitress and the bartender) were so great...good conversation and suggestions along with speedy service and even bringing us an extra table because they thought we might need more room. My friends greatly enjoyed a very generous tasting of 6 different beers and really loved almost all of them. I enjoyed a cider with my meal. For a starter I got a bowl of the soup of the day which was jalapeno bacon clam chowder which had incredible flavor and was hearty with plenty of clams to be enjoyed. For my meal I went with another special (tilapia fish tacos) and was very impressed with the seasoned, blackened flavorful fish with a wonderful avocado sauce to accompany the taco. However I have to say my favorite part of the meal was hands-down the chips and salsa that came with my meal. I am a sucker for chips and salsa and the salsa they serve is unlike anything I've had with a slightly smoky flavor it is so enjoyable and super addictive. I will be sure to be back when I visit Madison again."}
{"text":"First of all, all the beer is vegan!  Winning! The beer flights are huge, so make sure you have someone to share with. There a a couple vegan food options on the menu too! Though I wasn't too hungry so I stuck to house made guac and salsa. It was awesome! Make sure to ask to sit in Doug's section. Super nice, fun guy. Awesome server."}
{"text":"Just opened new facility is AWESOME.  First of all, I love beer. They have it all: plenty of different kinds to try and all brewed in house.  Second of all, the food is pretty good too (although we weren't planning on going for the food). They have tons of vegetarian options and it's much tastier than the sparse offerings at other breweries.  The atmosphere is awesome and is perfect for a mid-day treat or a Friday night out.  Overall, I highly recommend stopping if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"i had to kill some time near madison's airport so decided to stop by the ale asylum to enjoy the beautiful july evening outdoors with a summery beverage. the tripel nova, a belgian-style tripel, was the perfect brew with its bouquet of spice and hint of sweet citrus flavors.  this was the perfect thing to do to set me in the right mood to welcome back two teenagers home after a couple weeks of being without them. (seriously though, i love 'em and have missed them but will miss the peaceful evenings at home with just my lovely wife."}
{"text":"A regular stop on our way to Madison to visit our daughter.  Ballistic IPA is a solid IPA, available in six packs or growlers."}
{"text":"The Ale Asylum has many of the things one would be looking for in a local brewery/taproom:  - Quality regular and seasonal brews (usually 8-10 on tap at any given time) - Very friendly bartenders and staff - A comfortable bar and lounge area with pool, couches, etc. - A cozy patio with an abundance of hops encompassing the deck and walls  Other than the somewhat isolated location (though that will be changing soon) and forgettable food (the focus here is on the beer, which is just fine) there's really not much that could be improved upon.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stop here every time I fly into madison for some good beer. Had time to sample some grub today and it was amazing.  The menu consists of your normal items;  burger,  steak sandwich,  pizza,  etc but the name is the only thing it has in common with other pubs.  Not your typical pub grub by any means. Had a salad special that blew me away and followed it up with a pizza like I've never had before. Just awesome. Don't know what 5 star chef they kidnapped and locked in the kitchen but he/she is doing a great job."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I would like to say that our waitress, Jordan, was amazing! Had a great time there in part because of her happy attitude and her patience with our slow progression. We just wanted to relax and have some good beer, and she was great with that. If management is listening - Jordan is a star!  Okay, so the beer was really good. I am a pretty picky beer drinker, I'll be honest. So I usually only find a few beers at each place that I like, while my husband will like most of the menu. I tried three beers up front and liked all three immensely. I LOVE mixing beers, so typically I will order a mixed pint of the mixture that tastes best, but this time I liked the individual beers so much, I simply got two half pours plus an empty glass. That way I could drink each beer individually and have the mix as well. It was delightful!  (I mixed the nut brown with the contorter porter - it was amazing!)  We ordered a bit of food - my man had the beer cheese soup and I got the chimichurri chicken salad. His soup was delicious. My salad was also very good. It had a TON of chicken on it, and I ha been expecting more greenery, so I was surprised. I think it needs one more element to be perfect - maybe more tomatoes, maybe a light vinaigrette on the spinach, maybe pickled carrots - I don't know but it is missing something.  Next time we go to Madison I will definitely come back to try the grilled wings - I was SO tempted this time, kinda wish I had.   My man had a massive flight of six beers - seriously healthy pours, and he loved all the beers he tried. Plus we had an aged imperial stout that was really good. Apparently right now they are tapping one aged beer a week but when it's gone, it's gone. We got one of the last glasses of this one - it would be fun to go each week and try the new release.  Overall, I'd be a regular if we lived locally. For now, if we visit Madison, we are pretty likely to show up there. Four solid stars with an extra one for Jordan. Go, Drink, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place with wonderful beer. The menu is decent if not spectacular."}
{"text":"Beer has been decent in my visits, but have only eaten here one time because of the poor quality that time.  (Had bruschetta) Service at the bar is hit and miss, mostly aloof and inattentive.  With so many great places nearby, can you afford to put off customers?"}
{"text":"Really nice space and atmosphere. They have a nice beer selection of their own beer. They also sometimes have beer they are testing out that you can try. My husband loves the beer, Bedlam is probably his favorite. Its nice that you can try a lot of their beers and then go buy them at the grocery store!  We've also had dinner once here and it was really tasty. It was with a large group and I remember service being good. The lighting is a little dark and that bothered some people in our group but not me. They have a nice selection of sandwiches. They also have salads and a couple soups.   They have a good size bar and there is also bar seating at some high top tables. Service is pretty good and we are always checked on frequently."}
{"text":"Beer was great! customer service sucked!!! We did like the Wisconsin bread cheese appetizer to die for and great combination"}
{"text":"Located right off the airport, this is a great first stop after a day's worth of flying!   Our flight was delayed and we didn't get in until 10 PM. Lucky for us, it was the weekend and Ale Asylum still serves their pizzas until Midnight! The thin crust made with brown ale was appreciated. We tried one with goat cheese and one with BBQ chicken. Both were good. There was also a pizza-like order of garlic bread that made me happy.  The beers are good. They ranged from decent to above average, but they were good to just sit back and enjoy. My favorite was the Triplel Nova (which they served in a pretty big tulip glass.) The Hopalicious is solid. We tried the limited release Phantasm, but wasn't a huge fan. The Ambergeddon was a little better. I would like it if they had a better selection of darks. They only make a few and none were available during our visits.  We swung by on the way back to the airport, and were able to get a couple of the Korean shrimp lettuce wraps and a chicken sandwich. Not sure what made the wraps Korean, but they were tasty. So was the sandwich. I appreciate that they have tasty food that is reasonably priced--an unusual combination at breweries. Great service here. This time we were on a time crunch and they went out of their way to accommodate."}
{"text":"My friends and will go here again for sure.  The food was very tasty and the service was pretty good.  Not a very large menu, but enough for everyone to find something.  I was a little turned off by all of the upcharges for what one would think would be included (example, it was $1.50 more charge to have the wrap versus a huge salad)  Definitely a place to take your friends!"}
{"text":"Good beer, so i am told by my boyfriend, as I don't drink beer, but he loves their beer, especially Diablo!  I think they make an excellent old fashioned.   We eat here quite a bit and I have always enjoyed their food.  We just discovered their fish fry and have went the last 3 weeks for it!  It's really good!  Not greasy at all, lightly breaded, and very tasty.  They just switched out from having a great potato casserole side dish.  Now they have french fries!  Both were excellent!  The fries had the dry rub on them, which is the same as is put on their wings.  Wings are also good! I recommend coming here!  We like to eat outside when it's nice out and do like the patio here.   Friendly servers too.  Nice to have in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch date with my wife one day. Sampled a few pints of their beers. The beers that we tried were all great. The staff were very nice and did a really good job of explaining the different brews that they offered.   As for our lunch it was bit of a miss. For an appetizer we ordered the chips and salsa and guac sauce. I went with the Citrus Salmon salad and my wife ordered the Hot Turkey and muenster. The chips all tasted like they were burnt from over cooking and the guacamole tomatillo salsa that they served was not good at all. As far as my entree is concerned the salmon had no flavor to it and the citrus spinach salad it was on was just as flavorless. My wife enjoyed her sandwich but stated that it was nothing special.   All in all the beer was quite enjoyable, the food not so much.   I would definitely try them again but would steer away from those menu items."}
{"text":"We found the beer to be average- nothing really standing out from the crowd but certainly not horrible. The food, however, WAS horrible. OG flatbread \"pepperoni, fresh basil, truffle oil\" was flavorless, lacking fresh basil (see pic) and drowning in bland sauce. With so many other breweries in the area, we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"If I were rating their beers alone, I'd probably give them a 5-star rating, but their new facility in tandem with their tendency to inundate their line-up with hoppy beers drops them to a 4-star rating.  The new brewing facility is located outside of town, making it slightly unaccessible and it has a vulgar, suburban novelty to it.  The food is equally suburban.  The increased footprint means that they have room to expand, which I am happy about because their beers are generally right on the mark."}
{"text":"I went with a flight of non-IPA drafts. Sure, some may say that I missed out on some good beers, but I would say that Ale Asylum has some pretty solid non-IPAs.  I totally suggest a flight when you are trying a brewery for the first time. Why not sample all the beers?   I think they have a good location, just have your Uber swing by to grab a beer before you fly out of Madison. It's brilliant. The grunge vibe is warming and great for just hanging with your friends. I dig it."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get over to the new brewery and the recent snow storm afforded me the perfect opportunity. Why? Because my S.U. was flying into Madison and was stuck getting de-iced on the runway in Chicago. I figured, hang at the Ale Asylum brewery, bring my laptop because they have WIFI (the airport doesn't) and wait it out with a pint of Hopalicious.  What a spot! Open and airy, nice wood. Several different areas. You could get lost in this place. I had heard that I shouldn't expect much of the food but I had a more than decent pulled pork sandwich and a fresh pint of Hopalicious. They have a wall behind the bar with sign for each beer that they brew. If it's lit up, they have it.  The place was pretty quiet  for a Thursday night, there was a snow storm after all. I was told that it's usually packed on Thirsty Thursday. While I considered having a second pint, I didn't. Not because a second flight would have caused me to drive too slowly and swerve around on the road, the snow and road conditions made everyone drive like they'd had a few too many, but I saw on the flight tracker that the S.U. was in the air and due in 15 minutes.  A great space and an awesome place to wait for the call that says, \"We just landed, meet you out front\"."}
