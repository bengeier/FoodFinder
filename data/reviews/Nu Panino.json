{"text":"I really don't understand. I walk in for a Veal sandwich with onions and a can or pop. And it costed me $16. I find that very pricey and I was not impressed with the sandwich - especially the bread."}
{"text":"Unbelievable sandwiches !!!!! MUST TRY! My husband and I were in the area and felt like something different. We have never been here before and were pleasantly surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive $10 for one sandwich.  Charging for hot peppers now.  Last time I'm going there it's not that good"}
{"text":"Great Italian sandwiches. I usually get the chicken with cheese and mushrooms. The tomato sauce could use a bit more tang or zest (personal preference) but its still a great sandwich. I've also heard that their pasta's are really good. Try the vodka sauce, it's been getting some great comments from friends.  It's a nice and clean place. The owners are nice and friendly as well - of course they are because they're Italians!"}
