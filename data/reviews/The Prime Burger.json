{"text":"Prime burger is  great when you want to fill your stomach with a big heavy greasy delicious meal.  All the burgers I can confirm are good but I haven't tried anything else here yet.  The fries are great too which I find many burger spots ignore. They are big and crispy.. can't go wrong. This place reminds me of a Markham Johnny's.  The guys who work there are very friendly.  Heads up in advance they only take cash but that being said it's inexpensive.  In fact it's even crossed my mind that it's a tad under priced.. I'm not complaining though."}
{"text":"Haha...I used to go here about 2-3 times a week before I went on a health kick.  Haven't been back in a while, but happy to poke my head in to this place when I can....  Someone below has me laughing about Burly men.  Yes, this is a lunch time checkin and you get common people who like a good burger!    Reason this place gets a 5 Star is I believe they have the best Halibut Fish Sandwitch in Toronto...and I love Halibut.  As someone says before, fries come out fluffy and the fish comes out just right.  Ask for Tarter sauce and you GET tarter sauce...like 3 full packages.   They want you to enjoy.  They have about 5 indoor tables, and about 4 outdoor benches for the summer.  Pleasant owner, and newspapers if you feel like putting your head down.  Good office lunchtime getaway.....  Enjoy     UPDATE - The Place closes Dec 21st after 41 years of operation!   If you like the place go your last time to pay homage :)"}
{"text":"Giant, incredibly delicious burgers. Giant, crispy onion rings.  Fries are so-so.  You can tell the place because it always has a semi parked on the side street, and a truck pulling a digger or other construction-type apparatus in the parking lot. The place is frequented by large burly men in safety vests and hard hats. Hard men who have spent their lives squinting into the sun and working their calloused hands to the bone. Men who know that a good burger doesn't come topped with an avocado salsa or a sharp camembert.  This place is a small takeaway with about five 2-seaters inside and a few picnic tables outside. Know what you want before lining up, the service is relatively quick and they like to keep the line moving. Unless you have a gigantic appetite, share the onion rings."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the banquet burger, poutine and of course onion rings! Banquet burger is dressed with a belt of bacon and a skirt of cheddar cheese. It is incredibly delicious! The hot gravy melts the curds to perfection. Last but not least onion rings! The onion rings are battered in bread crumbs (it is heavy). But nonetheless, it is great food and the price is not overly expensive but it is very fair. You get exactly what you pay for. The owner/chef is very nice to all his customers.    Overall, my experience there has almost-always been great!"}
{"text":"Elaine K. said there would be large BURLY men, but I didn't see none.  What I saw was a few university students and some young punk which everyone that came here were men or soon-to-be men.  The reason was that I didn't visit during lunch hour, but rather after work hours.  A Burger Joint amidst a busy Woodbine avenue where many Office/Manufacturing/Businesses/Highway 407 always cause a bit of road congestion.  I guess that's a PRIME spot for a Burger place.  The person at the helm answers my question as to what a Banquet Burger(Cheese, Bacon $9.30) is and I went for the combo(Fries, Fountain Drink).  This owner is quite friendly and personable as he states this place existed 40 years ago.  As he put Patties(Frozen variety) on the grill, I looked over the Menu board where they have Souvlaki as well aside from Burger($3.50), Cheese Burger, Bacon Burger, Banquet Burger and combos of those selections.  Asked if I wanted Poutine, I declined.  I chose to sit outside on the Picnic tables rather than the small 2-seaters indoors along the windows.  The Burger was GOOD sized and a Bun that looks to be made just for this Burger.  Sliced processed Cheese melted just slightly and the Burger Meat was A-OK.    As stated earlier, I could taste the frozen meat taste if you just try the Meat Patty on it's own but most people will eat the Burger as a whole and enjoy it.  The Fries were nicely cooked as well, crispy outside fluffy inside."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and when i get good service i tend to be bias i am sorry i like good service.  the food was really good too.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Great burger joint and they really give you your moneys worth. Everything is huge including the onion rings. Some of them were literally the size of the palm of my hand. Really crispy but oily as well. Felt like I was drinking oil at times and one of the rare times I didn't finish onion rings. Good at first but gets boring if you have to finish them yourself. I recommend sharing the onion rings. Its just too much oil for one person to handle."}
{"text":"Family run business. Very friendly and nice family. Ready to help you get whatever type of burger you want. Very truck stop sort of location where everything is greasy but good. Don't try to hold a diet in this place. Simple but direct menu selection."}
{"text":"I really don't believe I wolfed down the Banquet Burger in record speed.. good thing I am alone. ..sitting outside on the picnic table... hoping no one will see me.  The Banquet Burger ($4.55) has processed cheese and 2 crispy bacons. I don't eat bacons much.. (not because they don't taste good, but the fattening factor). The buns here are really toasted on the grill and give it a certain lightless and  texture to it. Though the patty is the frozen type it was charchoal grilled to perfection not dried out at all... hmmmm 3 stars  All the older gents that worked here are so super nice! So eager to please and joking with me + 1 star  I just love burger joints that run by independents that has so much character and old world charms instead of those faceless franchise one with teens working there!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for quick burger eats but you're just so tired of Harvey's, McDonald's, Wendy's... etc.. I mean, you can eat those ANYWHERE, right?  This is why The Prime Burger is YOUR NEXT DESTINATION!   It's a pretty rundown, diner place. Probably not where you want to take your princess girlfriend!   The patties are juicy and thick, and everything was soooo good. I had the chicken burger and my two guy friends each had the beef. Onion rings and fries were quite large! And it was SOO filling that even my guy friends couldn't finish theirs!  I paid $30 for the three of us (combo -with drink and fries), the service is pretty awesome (down-to-earth owners). There are 4 tables inside and 3 picnic tables outside. We sat outside and watched the LARGE pick-up trucks pull in and out of this place to grab takeout! We didn't see BMW's here (haha!), they're probably stuck at Pmall."}
