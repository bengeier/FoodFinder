{"text":"I am Filipino.  Recently moved to Calgary from the U.S. and so haven't tried many Filipino restaurants.  I've been to seven seas and I like this place more.  Only problem is that it's only take out and it's on the other side of town from where I live.

The food was great.  I had pork adobo, pancit canton, bistek, caldereta, and lechon kawali."}
{"text":"I've never been here but I heard good things.  This place is a no-nonsense Filipino take-out place with a small selection of dry goods.

I was wanting to make Lechon Paksiw and so I needed some lechon (BBQ pork) meat.  $13 for a container of lechon a bit pricey but I think that's about standard as there's only a few places that you can get this pre-made anyways.

The lady was nice and helpful, there was a bit of a mis-communication as to what I wanted (pieces cut smaller) but it was probably a lost-in-translation moment.  It wasn't a big deal as when I took the meat home it took 3 minutes to cut them up smaller myself.

They have a good assortment of hot dishes for take out only.  The store is tidy and clean.  You can see they take pride in their store. I will definately be back here again."}
{"text":"Oooh yes.  Amazingly good comfort food right here.  Fan of empanadas? Get them here.  You will not be disappointed.  The filling is too tasty and the dough is one of the best I've tasted!

As I went around lunch time, there was menudo, afritada, adobo, lumpias and some bbq ready.  There's a combo meal available (two entrees + rice), so that was perfect for me.  The afritada and empandas were the perfect combination.

There's also a menu on the wall behind the register, but I'm assuming you should call that order in ahead of time.  There's absolutely no tables to eat at in here (as the name suggests), but I saw some people sitting on the curb a couple doors over eating away.  

This is also half grocery store, so you can shop while you pick up food.  Multi-tasking, ftw!"}
{"text":"It is so worth it! So affordable and delicious. It makes me feel I'm home while eating the meals I bought. 
You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So it use to be Lolita and now Lola,s... Lola in Tagalog means grandmom.
The people are the same...I love their BBQ...yummy...typical Filipino way of BBQ..
The dinuguan is soooo good too.
I just find it a little $$ but if its seldom...its OK to splurge...its almost home cook meal..
Its only take out...no dining in..I find the bento is good price...sorry used Japanese term..if u get rice and 2 sides...pretty good deal.
I gave it 3 stars because sometimes the turon is so hard...its deep fried wrap banana this is one of the snacks we have back home...
But if you like BBQ...can't go wrong specially the pork...yummy"}
