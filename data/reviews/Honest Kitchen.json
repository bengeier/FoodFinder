{"text":"Must try the giant lobsters and roasted squab . I also love the green bass, they cook it just right and doesn't cost a fortune."}
{"text":"Although the prices were a bit on the high side, the quality of food, presentation, service, and atmosphere more than made up for it.  The owner chatted with many of the customers (New owners?...restaurant has been around for years)

I ordered a Lobster E-Mein dish...for $13.99 ~ not bad

{"text":"Newish restaurant that opened up next to the ever popular Maple Yip.  Probably a lot of spill over customers when maple yip is full.  Staff here is very friendly, meals come w/ free soup and dessert.  Some of the best wok hay in the GTA.  The salty egg battered deep fried bitter melon was fantastic tasty morsels.  Veggie with mushrooms in wine essence sauce was light and delicate.  Stir fried lobster was a bit too sweet and overcooked.  Fried chicken had nice crispy skin.  Beef tenderloin w/ onions and mushroom was very tender.  Overall a good value meal.  Could improve on the seafood though.  Apparently some very good roast pigeon which we'll try on our next visit."}
{"text":"I believe this spot used to be Kenny's Noodles. Now it's your standard Cantonese restaurant... plastic sheets on the tables, Chinese writing on the walls, old banquet chairs, the works.

The service was pretty good and the food was pretty good, too. The sea cucumber in the sea cucumber, mushroom and snow pea leaves dish seemed a little undercooked, but everything else in the dish was great. The deep fried oysters on broccoli were excellent, if you ate them while they were still crispy. They poured the sauce right on the oysters, so you pretty much have to eat them right away. 

The lobster was pretty good, but not amazing. It was gigantic, which seems to be the only size you can get them in these days. We had our's cooked with the tail cooked separately, and everything else cooked with some yee mein noodles, which was pretty great. My brother complained that the noodles didn't soak up enough of the lobster flavour, but he's a great deal pickier than I am.

The squab was overcooked, and at $7.99 each, probably not that great of a deal.

We also ordered fried pork with thousand island dressing which looked gross and tasted just-ok.

The whole meal cost $140 including tax and tip, which fed 6 adults and then some.

I don't think I would go back here on my own, but I'll probably end up here again with my family again, which I will totally be okay with."}
{"text":"Very nice well lit and decorated Cantonese restaurant. Highly recommend it for solid Chinese food. What really gets me here is the fact that your throat isn't dying for water because of the saltiness and other things that typical Cantonese restaurants give you.

I don't know if it's the lack of MSG or just salt, but it makes the food that much better and healthier. It is a family business so it isn't as greasy or oily as other Congee places. And you can tell the dishes are made from a chef that cares about quality ingredients and standards. The restaurant got a lot of pictures to showcase their dishes and are at really affordable prices (especially at lunch). I highly recommend any dish with King Oyster mushrooms - they are the best I've ever tried). They also have amazing seafood like lobster and steamed fish. You get free soup and really authentic canto desserts like sweet pumpkin soup with every table. 

They're service is very genuine as the staff is very humble and patient. They're not going to have a fit when you ask them about their dishes etc etc while ordering. (I'm talking about you Maple Yip)

The restaurant is neighbours with the well known Maple Yip and the fact that they're still adequately busy goes to show the family is doing something right with the place.

The only thing I can see for improvement is consistency. Usually, when it gets busy they have a hard time keeping up with their normal quality and service. But on the other hand, that usually happens to a lot of other Chinese restaurants. I guess the new owners + staff are still learning from experience which is normal and doesn't bother me because it'll always be above average than what I get in Markham or down the street.

Two thumbs up. Hope this place becomes a staple in Scarborough.

4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Honest Kitchen has a new Chinese name.  The old Chinese name was a direct translation of \"honest\"; the new Chinese name means \"fish villa\".  I don't know the reason of name change, especially that the English name remains unchanged.

We dined here tonight.  The food tasted okay and the portion was okay.  The service speed was okay.  The waiter and waitresses were friendly.  The prices were okay.

Here you go: an OK."}
{"text":"I have been to Honest Kitchen a few time for both lunch and dinner. 

Not easy to open next to Maple Yip and serves similar Cantonese dishes at similar pricing. 

So how are the dishes? All the ones I tried were all quite good but nothing really memorable. I do enjoy their Deep Fried Ginger and Garlic Tiger Shrimp quite a bit though.

Will I be back? Maybe? Especially if Maple Yip is crazily busy.... 

Lunch Special though is decent, $5.95 with over 30 different items to choose from!"}
