{"text":"The service is fast and I definitely like for what I get.  Its a great alternative when you need something to fill you up quickly without spending so much.  Not only that, but It tastes fresh and is of good quality.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. And pretty cheap. For $7.00 you get a decent bowl of rice and choice of meat. Or you can get half rice half veggies. Both really good. The \"magic sauce\" (teriyaki) is fantastic. Meat is not dry and has a great grilled flavor. 

Service is great and they are very fast. 5 minutes and you will have your food. I hope they open more of them in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love Flame Broiler. But this one is a bit harder to enjoy. Food was not as good as I usually get. But my biggest beef was the music - it was so loud that it was hard to hear the woman behind the counter as I was ordering. I said the music was really loud. She just smiled at me. Maybe she couldn't hear me? 

I may return but won't eat in again."}
{"text":"I had the chicken with brown rice and vegetables in a regular bowl. I liked it but I thought it was too much next time I'm going to get the mini bowl. My husband had the tofu bowl he thought it was okay. I liked the teriyaki sauce my husband did not. We might be back."}
{"text":"This rating for this particular location being well above average.  In the category of casual fast dining you can tell food is fresh prepared with high quality veggies and meat!  And the the Asian guy with slight male pattern baldness is the best in customer service."}
{"text":"OK I have seen places like this popping up all over town, but this one is really fresh and tasty, a sparse menu but that is the Idea, choose your protein, starch, veggies then sause, simple but very tasty"}
{"text":"I guess you could say I'm a regular at Flame Broiler. I have never had a bad experience here and always get exactly what I ordered. I dine here weekly and some of the cashiers know my order when I walk through the door. I always get the chicken bowl, it is quick delicious and healthy for you as well. The employees are always friendly and I can order my food and get out within minutes. I will always recommend Flame Broiler for a good quick healthy meal in Tempe."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's quickly becoming our go-to spot for an easy healthy dinner during the work week for us.  The menu is remarkably simple as you're getting some form of a protein bowl: either beef, chicken, tofu or some combination along with rice and grilled vegetables.  But as someone who aspires to eat healthy this is pretty much what I make at home whenever I have the time to do so but it's rarely as delicious and never this inexpensive (we get two full bowls for about $13).  The first time they rang up my total I actually commented, \"That's it?\"  He offered to charge me more if I wanted.

Everything is good so far but our favorite has to be the steak bowl with their \"magic sauce\" which is basically sweet soy sauce.  Delicious, fast, inexpensive, incredibly healthy and very easy to get to off of the 95 on my way home.  We are quickly becoming regulars here."}
{"text":"I frequent this business regularly. The food is always fresh, prepared quickly and tasty. I enjoy the casual conversation that the staff provides during my visits. Unfortunately today it seemed like a new manager that I haven't met before was doing some corrective counseling with a employee. While I believe corrective counseling is necessary I do not believe it should be done in front of customers. I found this extremely unprofessional and the owner should review policy and procedures with management to ensure a positive customer experience. I will continue to visit this this restaurant and support them as I am very happy with all other aspects of their business."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. Its \"Happy Meals \" for adults! My favorite item is the grilled chicken over rice, with the delicious cabbage salad, and sweet orange (where do they keep finding these??) slices for dessert. The dressing for the salad is to-die-for and sweet sauce for the chicken &rice is beyond words.

This is the best fast food option ever!!! And if you're super lucky, you'll be helped by either Lina or Joseph (or BOTH!!) - they are just the icing on the cake  (or maybe in this case, on the orange -lol) 

You've really gotta give this place a try - my only complaint, is we need more of them here!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, my family loves this place! Only bummer is there is only 1 in Vegas currently!"}
{"text":"So my roommate pushed me to try this after my workout... I was not disappointed. The food was delectable and so happy to find a healthier option for fast food.... Wish there was a closer location to me in Henderson . That being said, jay hooked it up and I was full without feeling guilty... If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely come back. It's nice to know some companies produce a good product without GMO's or high sodium seasonings contrary to my goals"}
{"text":"It is obvious the owners Mike and Brian really enjoy what they do. They have graciously donated 2 orders for our companies'  volunteer outreach program . They genuinely care about giving back to our community. The quality, flavor, and variety of combinations are first rate along with the customer service. I've contracted with them on several occasions to cater our team celebrations. My team mates truly enjoy Flame Broiler as it is a healthy option!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. Chicken lacked flavor and very dry.  Veges were bland. For $10 I can cook a better and tastier meal than this anytime. Count me out next time."}
{"text":"Love good, quick teriyaki, this doesn't disappoint! Chicken, beef & tofu, i get half and half chicken & beef with the veggies. There's a sauce station to get your own sauce, place is clean, staff is very friendly, quick service."}
{"text":"Simple menu and not a lot to choose from. It was our first time here and it was explained to us how it works. The food was tasty and the sauces were pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. ASU has needed a teriyaki bowl style place nearby and this fits the bill! The food is fast, fresh, and delicious, and also reasonably priced. The flavors are simple but executed well, and the fact that it is also healthy is a welcome bonus."}
{"text":"Gave this place 5 stars beacuz the food is great, fresh and healthy! The way that Jeff explained how the menu works was very  uncomplicated and not mention the atmosphere is very relaxing. Its everything I needed especially now that the wife wants me to eat healthier. 
 Jeff, Lee and Cat are great! They make you feel like you've known each other for a long time and they take the time out to make aure everything is going great with your order. Keep up the great job guys and I'll tell everyone I know about you!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fairly close to my work so I decided try it for lunch a couple weeks ago. It's great! I've already been back 4-5 times. It's a great option when you need something fast and something a lot healthier. I also love the fact that they have options for brown rice or just meat and veggies when you're going for that low carb diet."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and quality you can count on every visit! I was skeptical at first because I love my teriyaki but the bowls are always fresh and satisfying especially for the price, keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken bowl with the vegetables. The vegetables consisted of carrots, broccoli, and cabbage. The cashier/server was really nice. The chicken was moist, but had some toasted parts to it, which I know some people like. The vegetables seemed to be parboiled, which is healthy. I liked mixing the hot sauce with the magic sauce and it made the meal taste more flavorful. The white and brown rice was the right texture.  Overall healthy but nothing really special."}
{"text":"Flame broiler is awesome food and the employees at this location are just an added bonus. Joseph, Lee, and Cat are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, especially for the $7 or so I spent. This particular location is next to the ASU campus and there were quite a few college students enjoying lunch. I am defiantly going there again for a quick and quality meal."}
{"text":"I like the food. It was made quickly even though it was lunch time. Could have had a little more meat in my bowl."}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, healthy, delicious. What more could you possible want in a restaurant. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I have never heard of the Flame Broiler up until recently. I never knew there was such a cult following from California!

Overall, I really liked this place. The staff was very friendly and educated right from the beginning.

I had the steak and chicken plate. Was a very good size for the money. The brown rice was cooked perfectly. The cole slaw and dressing was excellent. 

One of my kids had the steak bowl. She enjoyed it very much. 

My other daughter had the veggie plate. I would have liked to have seen another vegetable or 2 personally in the veggie bowl. Possibly a squash, a red bell pepper, or something else added to it.

Another plus was that 3 Vitamin Water choices were on the fountain drinks! Thank you so much! Many of us out there have given up on soda. This was much welcomed.

Other than seeing more vegetables added to a veggie bowl, I was hoping to see either a salmon or a shrimp bowl. The menu is VERY small. My daughter is a vegetarian that will eat seafood. It would be nice for her to pick up another protein when we go out for dinner.

Overall, a solid 4 stars. We will go back."}
{"text":"Really good fresh food. I got the chicken and rice. Simple but delicious. Will be returning in the future for sure. A couple different sauce options."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a great go to for healthy food. There's only one in town and I drive to it when I grave it because it's worth it. It's simple and the menu is small. It's either chicken, beef or tofu and it's all flame broiled with the option of brown rice and veggies! The green onions give it a great taste. Be sure to get their stamp card!"}
{"text":"Quick service and good food. One of my favorites for lunch or post gym. I usually get the beef and the sauces are good too"}
{"text":"My bf and I come here a couple times a week. The food is fresh is healthy and the staff is AMAZING! I think the customer service is what brings us back. Everytime we come Joseph is always smiles and always makes us feel so welcome! The staff here is awesome! If it's your first time. I recommend the beef bowl with choice of either brown or white rice. You also have options of adding veggies or green onion which I think adds crunch and more goodies. They also have self sauces. Try the magic sauce !"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, amazing food. If you're looking to begin or continue your healthy journey this is the perfect place to come! Everything tastes fresh, the employee that was there was extremely nice, she stayed open to give us service. I'll be coming here more regularly. Hope you guys stay open a little later in the near future!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Was looking to try something new to try, decided to go for the chicken bowl with veggies. Must try the magic sauce its amazing on the chicken, the staff was friendly and and fast with getting the food ready love Kat and Joseph always on there A game try it out if you want somethibg fresh and healthy"}
{"text":"I wanted some grilled chicken, so my coworker recommended this place. I am definitely going back! Their chicken was delicious, and the rice and veggies were good. The sauces they have are really tasty! Customer service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Loved this pace!!! Been want into try it, I called my order in and it was ready when I got there. I do think they were a little skimpy on filling the bowl but it still filled me up and was plenty.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise to find this restaurant.  I came in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty, easy to order, and they had quick and friendly service. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"So good! I've seen Flame Broilers all over California and I've always wanted to try it and today was the day. So much better than Teriyaki Madness and Samurai Sam's."}
{"text":"Sigh. Sad. Panda. 

I had been checking the menu out online for a while as I was hoping to convince Hubs to want to try this place out with me. He kept declining as he needs more than a rice bowl for a meal. 

We ended up going there when we decided to do separate meals. I was really hopeful based on the menu pictures and the fact that they label themselves as a Korean place. I'm sorry, but there was nothing \"Korean\" about my meal. 

I ordered the small rice bowl, half and half. I wanted to try both meats. The service was friendly and efficient, and nothing super involved since it is a fast food place. I got my drink and sat down, waited just a few minutes it seemed for my meal to be ready. 

There were mixed veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli), but not very many. It felt like an afterthought or a garnish more than an addition to the meal. 

And, hate to say it, but the meat (both the beef and chicken) was SOOOOOO DRRRYYYY. I HAD to use their extra sauce, and it honestly changed the taste of the entire thing. Hubs wouldn't even try it because he took one look at the bowl and knew my meat would be too dry. 

Maybe it was just an off day, as other reviewers seem to have had good experiences - but I was seriously choking down the food, even with their \"Magic Sauce\", which was really not impressive (and definitely not Korean)."}
{"text":"Just a few simple ingredients, but quality ones make this place a great choice for a healthy dinner. The normal bowl is about $5.65, but it's about a $1.50 more for the ole white meat upgrade which is totally worthy. These are grilled chunks of white meat marinated in that magic sauce (teryiaki). Rice was white style and there was some cabbage mostly and carrots. It is hard to jam everything into that bowl, but there was tons of chicken as well. It was 530 calories. Extra star for the mellow yellow on tap, a personal favorite and make sure you try to throw that ping pong ball into the \"cup in the sky\" for a free bowl (I came close). Just a friendly vibe as is the case with most places around ASU and finally no complaints on this end!"}
{"text":"Quality Food = Quality Life! That's the motto at Flame Broiler, offering up simple, healthy bowls and plates with protein, rice, and veggies. While the fare is light on flavor, it's heavy on the nutrition and the location is smartly placed down the street from LVAC. 

Chicken-veggie bowl with brown rice (no surcharge!) is an ample portion for a low price ($7), kick it up with Magic Sauce (teriyaki) or Hot Sauce from the self-serve condiment station. The protein portion is larger than expected, making up about half of the bowl itself- they don't overdo the filler here!

Service is friendly, location is clean. There is limited parking out front (usually taken by customers for the adjacent Starbucks), but there's an additional lot to the right. Some out door dining tables available.

NOTE: The hours are a bit odd, they close at 7PM on weekdays, which is absurdly early IMO. Check times before you go."}
{"text":"If you are in to healthy fast food this is the place for you and it is awesome to have more truly healthy fast food options. That being said the food is nothing special IMO. Hubby and I both had the tofu; he had veggies and rice, me veggies only. All of the food was simply bland and just boring. Not bad, not good, just boring. The Magic sauce would probably add some good flavor, but certainly takes away from the healthy value. The hot sauces were the saving grace."}
{"text":"In LA, We are spoiled because plenty of locations but now finally one is open in Vegas for our casino runs.  For those not familiar, simple straight forward grilled meats with simple sides and rice.  This location is new but it seems to carry the tradition well.  Just like back in LA."}
{"text":"What a shithole of a place to eat. This place needs to be shut down immediately. Not only were all the workers outside smoking but I got severe raw fucking chicken. Disgusting. SHUT IT DOWN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Flame Broiler is the best place to get a rice bowl, and the service is always fast. The rice bowls are healthy and delicious and the manager is always kind when I walk in."}
{"text":"So this was our first time trying this place. I had seen the reviews on Yelp, and was craving something different and the chicken looked so good. ... I personally got a half and half plate with the angus beef and the chicken. It was really delicious, the chicken was a tad dry but that's why they give u plenty of teriyaki sauce on the side. But brother in laws order was wrong, they didn't put his onions on the side so I took away a star for that. Other than that pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a welcome dinner destination after practice with my swim team in the nearby Student Recreation Center of ASU.  The place is small, clean, and basic; service is fast. Simple menu and tasty, healthy food at a good price. My favorite is \"The Works\" - beef, chicken, veggies, and rice, topped with green onion; I jazz it up a bit with sriacha because I like this kind of food spicy."}
{"text":"I love this place.  When you walk on your third visit and they remember your order, you know you've find a friendly place to eat lunch.

I recently went back to work in this neighborhood and this was a new find since I was here last.  I prefer to eat healthy and The Flame Broiler gives me lots of healthy choices.  

I usually eat the grilled chicken with brown rice.  The chicken always has a nice char.  There is a choice of sauces.  I choose the Magic Sauce and the Hot Hot Sauce but there is also a Hot Sauce to try.  I have had the Angus beef, also.  It was good, but I love the chicken. They also offer a vegetable with any bowl. I really need to eat more vegetables, but I have yet to try that. 

I recommend this place as a great lunch if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I order through uber eats a lot because I have a desk job and we are not allowed to leave. So what I really enjoyed about flame broiler is that they actually took the time to read the \"special request\" section. Often times I don't want the rice and want all veggies. (Carbs are the devil.) And they subtracted the rice and gave me all veggies like I requested. I know this maynot seem like a big deal but try doing the same at yet teriyaki maddess. They NEVER get it right. My order is always wrong at teriyaki maddness. So flame brolier has officially won me over:) plus the food is good!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here. Customer service, not really. But I'll get to that later.

I've been here twice and enjoyed the food both times. I ordered the small beef bowl once, and the portion is perfect. I ordered the regular beef and vegetable bowl the second time and loved it as well. I went for the regular size because I was particularly hungry but probably could've still settled for the small.

The only downfall was the guy who took our order. He was probably the most unpleasant person I've come across at any fast food place, and I've been to many. He barely spoke and didn't acknowledge us at all when we would say thanks. And barely pointed to the water cups when I asked if I could have some water. Oh well. The food was at least good."}
{"text":"Super fresh and taste great. Vegetables are very fresh. Chicken and steak tastes great. Service is very good"}
{"text":"It has not taste and  it's pre cooked ... the sauces are good though but a bit pricey for stale food... nothing fresh....I have been here 2 times hoping for different outcome...naaah I'll pass"}
{"text":"Waaahhh! This place has closed... So sad. I literally ate here like 2-3 times a week, just because it was fast and healthy. Usually after the gym. It kind of ticks me off though that they didn't seem to let anyone know they were closing. I just drove up expecting to get my chicken bowl, and instead, there were huge signs on the door that said 'Place For Lease' and all the lights were off. I was just there about a week or so prior! :(

I have no idea if they just moved locations or what. It doesn't say anything on their website. But for now, this location is closed. Worst news of the year (for me anyway)!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here today and I'll def be back! I'm greeted with very friendly customer service which is always a great start. The place is super clean as well which I love. The food was a huge portion for the price, I got the chicken and angus beef plate for $9.xx. It came with half an orange, coleslaw, and rice. Lots of meat as well, I had enough left over to make a small meal for later. Also, don't skip out on the hot sauce and magic sauce on the condiment counter. Both sauces definitely elevate the meal. 

I'll be coming back with my family!!"}
{"text":"Healthy, cheap, and delicious. What else could you ask for. I've been coming here for the past 4 years I've been at ASU and have always been more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a piece of CA in NV. The food always tastes fresh and never dry. The location kind of sucks as parking is a pain in the @ss but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We are so glad one of our beloved Korean healthy fast food chain from California finally opened their first location in Las Vegas! Don't come here expecting anything crazy or gourmet, but do come here expecting a healthy fast food alternative that offers wholesome grilled teriyaki chicken rice bowls or grilled angus steak rice bowls free of frying, skin, MSG, trans-fat, dairy, and HFCS. They also have options that include steamed veggies, tofu and brown rice for the health advocate.

The food is grilled fresh to order and also the sauce bar they have is very unique. They allow you to take control of your seasonings! They offer \"magic sauce\" which is their version of teriyaki sauce, the \"hot sauce\" is like a frank's red vinegar hot sauce, the \"hot hot sauce\" is a green kick in mouth of spicy deliciousness and is super flavorful. Don't even try dabbling in the hot hot if you can't hang with spice since that bad boy creeps up on you! I'm a spice lover though, so I go for lots of it! I love drizzling a little of everything into my bowl and ask them to top me off with extra green onions and mix it up well - that's the perfect rice bowl packed with flavor! 

I've tried other teriyaki bowl spots and I'm always bored since they typically over salt or over sauce the heck out of their food and it doesn't taste that healthy. I like the fact that you can control the sauce/sugar/salt in your bowl here with their convenient DIY sauce bar. Plus the steamed veggies here are never lime green and the protein is not unidentifiable like Yoshinoya. Why are they still open? Yuck. 

The prices are competitive and a great deal; you can snag a tasty grilled white meat chicken rice bowl for under $5 for a mini bowl or under $7 for a regular bowl and none of their bowls or plates are over $10! That's what I like to call cheap eats.

I'm glad they are here! I'll be the one here front and center on those busy days where I need some help meal prepping for a healthy and satisfying protein filled week! 

PRO TIP: they are still trying to establish business, so that's why the hours are not set in stone yet. Once they take off running and build better business that's when they will shift their hours to open later. When in doubt, just call!"}
{"text":"Always Always excellent. Service is great, food is fresh and good. I go there at least once a week. I'm addicted"}
{"text":"Haven't even eaten my food yet. In fact it's been about 30 seconds since I left the front counter. So impressed by the customer service I had to leave a positive review. 

I didn't catch his name but the gentleman at the counter was exceptional! Such a pleasure and I haven't even dug in yet."}
{"text":"Second time I go in and the food is good ! Place is clean inside and great customer service . My food was ready pretty quick . I order the bowl with half chicken half beef with white rice . Their sauces are good too! I got the magic and triple hot sauce . Will be back"}
{"text":"This was an average teriyaki bowl place. The prices are fair but when it comes to the food, it was pretty bland wo adding the sauces. There is a condiment section tho with different teriyaki and hot sauces that you can mix in your bowl or have on the side. I actually like this option better than other places that add too much sauce or too little. I usually get the angus beef with chicken and white rice. They have other options too including tofu."}
{"text":"Good food. Be careful with the triple hot sauce. Good but hot. Good customer service- make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Based out of Southern California, Flame Broiler is one the few chains that are consistent from restaurant to restaurant. Located just off of Rainbow and east of the 95 freeway in between Starbucks and Dollar Loan Center, it's very easy to get to.

The menu is very simple. You got your choice of chicken or beef teriyaki with brown or white rice. You can also get veggies with it and there are three sizes (mini bowl, regular bowl, and plate).

I usually get the Chicken Plate ($7.90) with brown rice. You get all white meat marinated chicken cut into pieces and grilled. It is served on top of the brown rice I chose (for no extra charge) and you have the option of having chopped green onion sprinkled on top. Comes with a cabbage salad and half of a sliced orange. The difference between this plate and a works plate is that the works plate is half chicken/beef and you get veggies with it.

All entrees do not come with any sauce because they leave it up to you so you can put what kind of sauce (whether its the \"magic' sauce which is teriyaki, hot sauce, or the green sauce which is basically jalapeno flavored hot sauce) and how much. For dine in I just put my plate under the sauce dispenser and pump away. For you take out peeps, you can either put your sauce on before and put the cover back on or just get the sauces in the little to go cups they provide. If you refer to my tip, you can ask for bigger cups instead of using those dinky ones.

Service is pretty good. You order at the counter and they cook your food from scratch and then call your name and order so you can come pick it up from where you ordered.

For now business hours are monday thru friday 10:30 am to 7 pm. Saturday 11 am to 6 pm. Closed sundays. They will stay open longer once word gets around and they start getting more business. 

In closing, I would rather go to this teriyaki chain than those other two (Teriyaki Madness and Samurai Sam's) because the quality, taste, and prices are way better. Here's to hoping that they open more locations through out the greater Las Vegas and Henderson area. Cant forget about my peeps in Hendertucky! If you are ever in the Seattle area, go check out my favorite teriyaki place of all time, Toshio's Teriyaki off of Rainier Ave just off the I-90 freeway.

{"text":"I enjoy stopping in after the gym, the team know me there joseph & lee are always friendly know my order and give great conversation"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. It is not a real fancy place but the food is great. Usually I don't sit in but do take out. Service is great as well, always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is literally the best. The customer service is exceptional. I come in at least once a week and I never walk into anything but smiles. The food is great. Its inexpensive, fast, and healthy. What more do you need? The hot sauce is so damn good. Its a nice change from just eating sriracha with my chicken and veggies.  Love that theres an option for a mini bowl too because i can actually finish my meal. Its right down the street from my gym and near the freeway so the location is perfect. Another thing id like to add is that i have never once been served hard rice or been told that they ran out of rice, or steak or that its going to take 20mins to cook cuz they just put it on the grill like they do to me at Teriyaki Boy. So yeah, eat here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is kind of generic. My son said he felt like it was a restaurant in his video game. The food was very tasty and fresh. Don't know if I'd come back though. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the atmosphere , the customer service was good, food was good"}
{"text":"I grew up in Southern California so I've eaten at a ton of Flame Broilers. Saw they finally got one here & was super excited! Had my husband drive pretty far which really wouldn't be an issue because we're willing to drive for good food. My main issue is this isn't a \"new\" restaurant for me so I had expectations. We ordered two beef bowls with rice & no green onions plus two drinks for $20. When we opened them up to add sauce we were surprised to see how low in the bowl the food was when normally it is touching the lid. Both were about half full! There was a VERY big difference in the amount of meat as well - way less. I still love the food but the value at this location was ridiculous. Also definitely warmer in the eating area than you'd want."}
{"text":"No MSG, no dairy, no skin, and no fried food. Clean healthy delish food with some charr."}
{"text":"simple, delicious choices that make getting a solid meal quick and tasty. Employees are always nice and accommodating! 5/5!"}
{"text":"The Flame Broiler is a great little spot to get some simple clean food within a reasonable budget. It's one of the only healthy fast food spots where the food is actually really good and good for you! Its super simple to order, you pretty much just decide if you want chicken, beef, tofu or a mix of two. Then you add your choice of veggies, brown rice or white rice. Honestly its really good and convenient being near the freeway. Joseph was our cashier/server and he was amazing! He welcomed us and made sure we understood the menu as well as joked around with us and talked about new and upcoming movies. Overall I love it here and I will def stop by any time I am nearby and hungry!"}
{"text":"It's quick, tasty, healthy and affordable what more do you really need to know?

Oh so you want to know about the food well it's pretty much rice and meat but done the right way. This is chicken or beef chopped up and put on top of either brown or white rice, I always go brown since it's better for you. The mixture is topped off with some magic sauce which is Korean BBQ sauce which is a lot like teriyaki sauce. You can also get veggies too but I rarely do.

I usually get the combo plate which adds a little salad with some tasty sesame dressing and an orange. I think the price is about $9 OTD and is enough food for at least one meal if not a meal and little snack later.

They also have a punch card program so you can earn free meals too."}
{"text":"I love Flame Broiler for all the right reasons--MEAT and RICE.  This place is delish.  I love the options of fish and poultry as well.  I'm so glad Vegas has this place in town!"}
{"text":"I LIKE THIS PLACE! First time in here and the food is good and decent price. The only thing I dont like about it is that its really slow when we came in (about one customer) and ALL tables are dirty well except for ONE!!! I dont think its that hard to wipe tables and such. I hope your kitchen is clean at least. The person that took our order was very nice and pleasant to talk to (only guy that was working).


Food is good nothing special about it. I really like how they have different variety of sauce though. Id give it another chance."}
{"text":"Love coming to this restaurant l, the place is always clean and amazing customer service from Jeff. I always end up getting a chicken bowl with white meat and less rice more veggie working on getting my gains for summer time. And I always try to bring a friend with me from the gym since I want to see this little shop get busy. Keep up the good work Jeff and Ling Ling."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty!!!  Really nice people and the food is amazing at a great price.  One bowl satisfied me for two meals!  Great environment if you choose to eat in and they are quick if you need a fast take-out lunch."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! I had ordered from them on Uber eats before so I knew the food was delicious and healthy, but I was driving by and finally went in the restaurant. The people are even better!"}
{"text":"Probably the only \"fast food\" I wouldn't mind eating on a regular basis. Flame Broiler is the perfect spot for a quick lunch or post-workout meal. Their bowls are simple (choose from mini, regular or, plate), but their food is consistently good. The grilled chicken is always so juicy and tender with a nice char, and their angus beef is also flavored pretty well with that kalbi-like marinade. They even offer organic tofu as a protein now. You also can't forget about their sauces, especially the green and red hot sauces! The staff is always so nice and friendly as well. You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place changed my life. 10/10 would recommend. One time, i ate this 7 days straight!"}
{"text":"Employees were not trained to open the doors on time.

Website says they open at 1030. Sign posted says they open at 1100. Sat and waited outside till 1115 before I took off to go eat at the Thai place across the street.

Don't bother eating here. If they can't be bothered to open on time, they don't need your business."}
{"text":"okay i love that they are now open on sunday!

food has NOT gone down. price is little much but for the quality ill take it! 
great amount and amazing right after a good work out."}
{"text":"Good, clean food. And fast. Great staff. No complaints. I always get the chicken w/white rice. Plenty of hot sauce options"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the wife and daughter. The beef plate and beef bowls were really good. BBQ seasoning on the beef reminded me of home(Hawaii). The hot sauce added a lot of flavor. Worth coming back."}
{"text":"Our family discovered this fast food during our frequent trips to California. Since then, we're an avid fan. And we were so happy to discover that we have one here in Vegas. This is our third time visiting this location at Rainbow near 95 freeway, and guess what... 3 times in a row we're disappointed. The bowl with the meat and veggies has a lot of burnt sugar/meat mixed in it. Looks like they don't know how to clean their grill before they put the next batch. Their portion is so small compared to the different location we tried in California. And worst of all... during our third visit. The guy who took our order in the register is also the one who prepared our food behind the counter. We did not hear any sizzling sound on the grill to tell us that they are freshly cooking our food. Obviously it was long been sitting there on the counter. To add it up, it was not hot.. even the rice and veggies. It was Sunday and we were so hungry that we just let it pass. My husband gathered all the burnt food and showed it to the guy who took/prepared our food. The guy took the container with the burnt food and just say\"thank you \" REALLY????\" That's all you can say. My daughter acting like the adult one just told us not to make a scene and just put it into writing. Being an obedient parent, that is why I'm writing this comment right now. I hope management can read this to make some changes and make this branch a good one like the others."}
{"text":"The food was average almost like cafeteria type food. The place was incredibly dirty to the point where I was tempted to see if they've ever had any health code violations. It's also pricey. Not going back......."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was great:)
Got the chicken bowl with rice and veggies 
Jeff who took our order had great customer service, Coming back for sure !"}
{"text":"I come out to Vegas on business, i accidentally stumbled upon this place looking for a Starbucks. 
Oh my goodnessssss as soon as you  walk in the staff is very friendly! You have an option between a bowl or plate. It come with 5 oz of a protein of your choice. I stay on the strip and drive out here on purpose to eat from here. It is so delectable I can't even begin to describe! It's very healthy and fresh! All the protein is grilled and so soft to eat. I usually get a bowl with white rice, double chicken, and veggies! If you are wanting something yummy and healthy, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! And good food! They charge extra for veggies or brown rice like many other locations. The portions were a good size and everything was flavorful and hot. Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Good Food. Sometimes carrots are a little under cooked not soft. 
Clean Environment. 
Good service if you order in the store. **** DO NOT CALL IN IF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL ORDER ****
Parking is not good during busy hours. Parking is good in the evening. 

Not that great when you call in your order. Because of my schedule I call in advance almost all the time. On multiple occasions, I called my families order in advance (3 orders). This Flame Broiler (Warner and Priest) can never get it right. **2 chicken bowls both with white rice, veggies and avocado and 1 plate with white rice and chicken ONLY. This should not be hard to get right, but it seems to be I here. Because EVERYTIME (at least 5 different occasions) the staff here gets it wrong. Defeats the purpose of calling in advance because we wait to have it fixed. The staff seems like they need to get it together, most of the time they seem confused or unsure what their next steps are to get orders completed.

We are thinking of trying to cooking it at home and saving 30 bucks."}
{"text":"Super clean, they sorta look like they just opened. Staff was really nice and food was fresh."}
{"text":"Who says chains are bad?  Especially when you are looking for something sweet and salty and hot off the grill without all of the unnecessary calories?  Please, I'm saving those for the pork belly pastrami at Citizen Public House - I can't crush it at lunch.

A big ol' bowl of brown rice, toothsome chicken and beef, scallions, broccoli, cabbage and carrots and I'm in heaven.  You could get extra meat, but you'd be gilding the lily.  You could pile on the extra \"special\" sauce or the sriracha, but it's not necessary - the bowl is full of flavor and all for a song in terms of price.  Plus, the folks that work there have the assembly line down pat - you are in and out and onto the next adventure with a belly full of goodness.  Lunch happiness :)"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this little hidden gem. It's nothing over the top or a huge menu, but healthy, simple and very tasty - and fair prices. Great if you want something healthy on the go. I got a chicken/beef combo bowl with brown rice and veggies and it was very filling. My bf got the bigger plate option. Great selection of sauces to kick it up for more flavor or heat. 

I agree with previous reviews that Stephen who was working the night we came in was very friendly, engaging and treated us so well. He gave us a stamp card for us to come back. Customer service goes a long way and he is top notch. He mentioned he can always have food ready if we need to call ahead too - a nice offering for those busy nights. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this cute little place.
A good choice for a fast, fresh bite to eat. 
I always get the tofu bowl with avocado; husband loves the half chicken / half beef bowl.
Both the website and posted menus explain the (few) choices and what to expect quite well.
Restaurant is very clean; service is nice although not always speedy. 
They have a punch card for when you decide you need to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This specific Flame Broiler is amazing! The customer service is outstanding! They are fast friendly with a welcoming vibe. The very nice lady gave me a stamp card and I had no idea they gave cards the last time to her surprise, she took my card and stamped at least 3-4 spots lol bless her huge generous heart! Their food is cooked to a perfect tender chicken and beef! I really appreciate this specific Flame Broiler and highly suggest ALL to come out here!"}
{"text":"A little oasis of healthy food fast in a desert of choices near the business office in this little corner of the world...
...As far as the food.  A lot of places have broiled or grilled meat and rice bowls. This is one of them. If you are trying to be \"better\"  it beats the #SubWay across the street.  If you want more flavor go to the noodle place across the street."}
{"text":"Good food and good concept but the two times I've the staff doesn't have their stuff together at all.  

I ordered the half (Angus steak) and half (chicken) with white meat chicken to go.  Then the guy asked if I wanted brown or white rice.  I said white rice.  My roomie ordered the same thing.  

Then I noticed I had no vegetables in my bowl and said I wanted them in there, he apologized and said he thought he heard me say all rice.

When we got back home, I had all chicken in my bowl just like my roomie.  

The staff needs to pay better attention too customers and get their stuff together or we won't be making many more trips back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places i have chosen to eat at since i moved too vegas.It is a family atmosphere and the staff is great! They treated me like a brother and still continue to do so till this day. I am very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant during a Weight Watcher's meeting.  I decided I would try it out after attending church today.  I entered the place and was amazed at the helpful counter staff.  He immediately asked if it was my first time there and if I had any questions.  I told him I just wanted a 5 oz chicken bowl with no rice.  He asked if I wanted veggies and I said yes.  He then went on to tell me that the chicken (all white meat) was marinated in their Magic Sauce (basically a sweet soy sauce).  The meal came out in about 4 minutes and I watched the cook put the chicken on the grill.

They have posted on their wall: No Skin, No Dairy, No Trans Fat, No Frying.  Sounds alright to me.  I got my bowl and added a little of their Triple Hot Sauce (basically Sriracha with a little more kick).  I then sat down and started to figure out the points this was going to cost me on Weight Watchers.  I realized it was just the cost of the chicken (5 oz, grilled chicken, = 3 SP).  I looked at my bowl, which was filled with great veggies and wonderful tasting chicken, and realized I can come here for dinner on days when I have to stay at school late.  It's just around the corner.  WooHoo...no more McDonald Drive Thru.

For the Weight Watcher community, this is the holy grail of restaurants."}
{"text":"Expectations were low; I admit I was tempted to turn my nose up. I mean come on, it's an evil chain. Still, the food is decent and the prices are something to consider. I left satisfied and willing to admit I'd come back. I wouldn't describe it as \"fabulous\" like another reviewer, but it has a place in my book."}
{"text":"Saw this place opened  up next to the  starbucks place that I frequent  and decided to give it a try. The place was clean and the staff were very nice. I tried the half and half bowl  ( half beef half chicken) my husband ordered the chicken veggie bowl. The food was  delicious  The meats were seasoned well and the vegetables  cooked just right. Also you they are not stingy with the sauces unlike  the other teriyaki  places close by. The magic sauce, hot sauce, and the green sauce were yummy. A must try! And don't forget to ask for the stamp card to earn a bowl. This is definitely  one of my go to places.  I just wished they stay open a little  later and open on Sundays.

Edit: Now open on Sundays."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. Owner is a great guy and his staff is amazing. They know tons of the regulars by name and the food is always made fast and fresh. If you are looking for one of the best places in town to get a rice bowl with chicken, beef, or tofo. This is the place!!"}
{"text":"We recommend not ordering the vegetables. Instead just get the protein and rice. Otherwise it's a good place to get a rice bowl."}
{"text":"Flame Broiler may be a basic franchise, but it serves its purpose quite well! I enjoy the strip mall that this is set in, next to great locals like Delhi Palace, Blue Nile Cafe, Pho Nhat and Oliveo Grill. I think that my stomach is typically full and happy when eating at any of these establishments. 

I went in with little expectation, and ordered \"The Works\" which comes with veggies (cabbage, green onions, zucchini and broccoli), chicken and beef. Imagine my happy surprise upon receiving a sukiyaki-style beef! Tokyo Express fans, get your chopsticks out, because it tastes nearly the same as theirs. So, for its no frills and straight forward approach to making some good rice bowls, they really do succeed and it makes a great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Healthy fast food at affordable price. This franchise serves based on their motto \"Quality Food=Quality Life\" Although I don't make healthy choices when it comes to what I eat, this place has made me realized that healthy food can also be tasty!

Fast and great service here. I decided to get half and half of beef and chicken. I got their small size which was only around $5 but still very filling. Nice that everything here is free of frying, skin, MSG, trans-fat and dairy. They also have a sauce station where you can get magic sauce and/or hot sauce. I liked the fact that I was able to put sauce in my bowl to my liking because some places will drench everything in sauce. I don't like getting sauce-bombed because it kills my taste buds.

I frequently visit Subway across the street whenever I want something light to eat so it's great to have a place like Flame Broiler that serves light/great quality meal at a very affordable price. I'm a fan :-)"}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, and cheap. Great post work out meal with clean protein and veggies, love it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for take out and each time I have, I've enjoyed my food and experience very much. The staff is very kind and will make conversations with you as you wait for your food so you're not just awkwardly standing there. I enjoy that. I've gotten both the meat and chicken, both which were great. I love a good chicken bowl & this definitely satisfies. Especially adding the onions and their spicy sauce =)
Service is always fast and it always tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"We went here for a quick and easy dinner. It was exactly that. The food is good, but nothing special. I had to he Angus beef bowl with rice and green onions. The beef was well cooked, but lacked flavor. I put the \"secret sauce\" (which was basically a teriyaki sauce) on and it did give it more flavor. My boyfriend had the half chicken/half Angus bowl, which he enjoyed. He liked the tang of the hot sauce. All in all, it was about what we expected, decent food, seven quickly, at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Somewhat healthy alternative to your typical fast food lunch. 

Ill keep it short and sweet. Its another meat, rice, veg bowl spot that is a decent price point and actually not bad at all. I like the fact that you can choose all veg instead of rice, and that they have the two white/brown rice options to choose from. Stay light on their \"Magic Sauce\" if you want to remain healthy, as its obviously filled with sugar to add that crack flavor to your normally healthy meal. If you want a quick meal, on the cheap, and healthy, swing through but i wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Wish they had more locations in las vegas. Healthy, tasty and the price is not bad. They even make brown rice taste good. Plus the service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"So far I can only give it one star only because they seem to have a bad vibe upon coming  in here. Group of mean queens stared as I walked in, second  time  seeing the one gentleman by himself at the register. I asked him some questions about the restaurant like how long you've been here what do you serve etc. honestly wasn't wowed yet and definitely was viewed by the people as some type of nuisance. Also with all these five stars I think it maybe because of the price of things. I haven't tried the food yet but definitely wasn't welcome to try."}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be the last time. Excellent Food and super friendly staff.  I recommend the half and half bowl."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It has good service and the food is always good I can't get over quick. If you decide to stop by I recommend going with the half and half chicken and angus beef steak with white rice bomb! And good if you're trying to get gains also"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place. I usually eat at Samurai Sam's, but I decided to give them a try. The price was good and the portion size was decent.  I didn't like the flavor of the sauce, but overall it was alright. The service was good and fast. I may visit again, but it will not be a first choice."}
{"text":"This small place is certainly tasty, I wanted to get a rice bowl for sure... I asked the lady at the counter what was the most popular dish if I'd never been here & she was very nice and helpful in helping us order. I got the Works Bowl which has beef and chicken along with veggies. You have a choice of white or brown rice and then green onions or not. The Brown rice is a bit extra, but what's healthier and cheaper? That doesn't exist. The \"magic sauce\" is delicious, even though it's just sweet teriyaki sauce. & they have the tea stand with 4 different types of Teas. My favorite! Look for coupons before you go in, great place to satisfy a rice fix and save a few bucks!"}
{"text":"this is super near usbut never knew how good this place is. good food, great portions and clean pkace. definitely, we will be back here. choice of menu is simple, chicken, beef , half half and organic rice bowl meals. the staff is friendly and personable."}
{"text":"This is a healthy, fast service, Asian fusion concept. I remember this from my ASU days, with a location at University/Rural that closed a few years back. I'm excited that this chain is back in Tempe.

I ordered the Organic Tofu bowl. The tofu was firm and moist, but not soggy. The brown rice was good and soaked up the sauce well. The steamed veggies are standard. 

My friend ordered the Chicken Plate. She said the chicken was charred well and wasn't dry. 

We sampled the Magic sauce which was sweet and smoky like a good teriyaki. They also have a hot sauce which reminds me of franks red hot. 

All in all the location was clean, fast, and served up a good healthy meal after my workout at LifeTime Fitness. I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is great, healthy , affordable,  and is delicious! Give it a try. Taste exactly like it does in California.  Only had the chicken but 5 stars for sure especially since you can get you own sauce and not limited to a certain amount like some other places."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally did today and glad I did! 
Had the half and half bowl. (Chicken and beef) the meats were season well and the veggies were crisp. The magic sauce (teriyaki) was really great. 
I was greeted when I walked in and the gentleman asked if I've been there before. I told him no and he took the time to explain the menu and different options. He was very friendly and helpful. 
I only gave it a 4 star before yes it was good it wasn't 'over the moon' amazing. I'd definitely recommend it and I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Flame Broiler is so Delicious and also a great healthy choice!  We were so glad to see they came to Vegas.  This new location did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"So this is my first time here and I gave it 5 stars based on its \"fast food\" classification. My server Joseph was so friendly and made my grilled tofu bowl so delicious! It was my first time trying it and SO glad that I did."}
{"text":"Omg this is terrible the people are cool but the food has no flavors it's cut too thin to retain flavor and out of the chicken or beef sadly the chicken has more flavor and the sauces aren't really that good either wasted my time on this spot for sure"}
{"text":"Tasty, fast, healthy, great service. Last night we were looking for something fast and healthy. We weren't disappointed! They boast a simple menu that was easy to follow and have a variety of sauces to top your protein/rice/veggie bowls. Two thumbs up for their Magic Sauce! Their chicken was cooked beautifully, my husband said the steak was good, too. Stop in for a quick, inexpensive, healthy bite."}
{"text":"This place has pretty delicious healthy food. I work a few hundred feet away so I was pretty excited to see a new restaurant open up. The menu is extremely simple, which is great because i prefer restaurants who focus on high quality ingredients instead of overwhelmingly long menus. Just rice bowls with meet and veggies. Your choice of chicken or steak. Their sauce bar is awesome, get the green stuff."}
{"text":"Finally there is a location in Las Vegas!!! Highly recommended. Joseph is awesome. Food is phenomenal. Magic sauce is to die for. Nutritional & affordable.. 95/Rainbow"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite fast food place. Especially because it's on the healthier side with the brown rice and vegetables. Meat is so tasty! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail for this place, and I'm happy I visited! The food is great and fresh. The veggies are still firm and not covered in oil like some other places. If it's your thing to cover your food in sauces that cool. They have plenty to choose from. But the meat is seasoned well enough to me that it wasn't necessary. Just took a few jalapeños to go, and I was set. I will definitely visit again and recommend."}
{"text":"Fast food rice bowls at a reasonable price.  There are limited options (Basically, choose chicken, beef, or short rib with or without veggies), but the food is fast, fresh, and flavorful.  You have the option of adding green onions to your meal, and there are \"magic\" sauces to the side to add to your bowl or plate.  The original \"magic\" sauce is a teriyaki-like sauce which is nice in that it's not overly sweet like some sauces can get, and the \"magic hot sauce\" is a Louisiana-style hot sauce.  The veggies are simply steamed, and the meat is grilled which gives it that nice slightly smoky flavor.  This is a good option for those that are looking for a quick meal that is healthier than most fast food places."}
{"text":"I usually stop at Flame Broiler when I don't have much time for a lunch break. The service is pretty quick, I also like the fact that you can call in your order ahead of time. I also come when I need to shed a few  pounds to fit in my Freak'em dress;) I always get the mini angus beef bowl with brown rice. Always clean and nice customer service...no complaints"}
{"text":"I used to live in San Diego and there was a lot of these Flame broilers around I love it for a quick lunch fast good add your own Magic sauce and hot sauce The magic sauce is like a thick teriyaki sauce love that stuff you can get it a lower carb version with no rice all vegetables and meat so glad they open one here in Tempe"}
{"text":"Homie was cooking tofu with the same spatula as the chicken while it was raw.  Back and forth. No thanks. They should train their cooks better.  I ended up leaving after having paid for my lunch. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Never wrote a review but i felt like i had to with this place. I called in and asked for beef bowl and half and half bowl for pickup. I got the beef but the second bowl was only chicken, not exactly what i wanted when i got home. Food portions was not even with rice and its a bit dry. Whichever lady that feels like she doesnt need to be at the register when taking phone orders needs to pay attention when placing it after. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"I order from this place all the time! Ubereats brought me to this place. I tried it once and fell in love with it, it's great for vegetarian and people trying to eat healthy.

The place it self is very small I over heard someone say that it was the only one in Vegas so no sure if it's true.  It's clean and good atmosphere.

I usually order the tofu with extra veggies and brown rice. Their magic sauce is great for the tofu, and veggies are still crunchy and delicious. They offer 3 sizes small, regular and a plate as far as cost is concerned it's very inexpensive and a good value for what you pay. 

The service was very nice the employee there was very nice and provided good recommendations.

Definitely try it if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Very friendly and helpful and easy to talk too. Gives a lot of tips.

Very simple menu. Choices are angus, chicken or tofu. Size are mini, regular bowl or plate 

Reasonable prices and food comes out quick!"}
{"text":"Super healthy, fast service, and a great deal since you can easily get two meals out of the plate. Now offers organic tofu, too. 

Really, it should not be as healthy as it is for as good as it tastes. Very easy choice when you're pressed for time, too."}
{"text":"If you want something healthy and basic that tastes good, this is your place.  They have an easy menu to choose from , white/brown rice, veggies, and meat. They have a couple extra toppings  you can add (green onions, avocado...). You choose how much of everything you want based on different sized bowls or a plate.  They serve it plain and have flavors you can put on top yourself, which is nice. My husband and I both enjoyed this and will be back. Hubby was in heaven. Great healthy quick place to eat. Polite employees too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a mini chicken bowl and a drink for about $5 so I figured I would give it a try. The restaurant was very clean, but had those bright white fluorescent bulbs that do not make me want to stay somewhere for long. It's probably much better in the daytime and since this location is located by a business park I'm sure they are a lot more customers at lunch. Since the only other customers were already eating, I was greeted immediately by a very friendly woman with an excellent doggie tattoo. She quickly put my bowl together (went with brown rice, veggies, dark meat chicken, and green onions) and I was all set to go in probably 4 minutes total. 

I packed up a few to go cups of each of the sauces and took it home to eat. Let me tell you. This is some absolutely acceptable food. Not anything special, super limited menu, uninspired sauces. But it's fine. It tastes fresh, it's a very healthy option, and is an excellent value even without a coupon. 

I would absolutely eat here again. Never because I'm craving it, but because it's a great choice for a quick, healthy, cheap meal. I would definitely get the mini bowl too. I have a good appetite and it's a struggle just to finish the chicken and the veggies. Lots of rice will not be eaten tonight. 

Anyway, final notes: the kitchen was very clean and you can easily see every station back there. It was also nice to see someone in the back actually prepping the fresh vegetables. And again, the lady who prepared my bowl tonight was very excellent."}
{"text":"Still loving this place! So so good. Simple yet delicious food. Everything is so fresh & tasty, and cooked so perfectly. And the sauces...omg. Magic sauce=magic. The hot sauce is amazing. It's just so awesome to have somewhere that cooks REAL food as opposed to all the processed food around. The staff is really nice too, they're just the best. Please don't ever leave me Flamebroiler, this is a very codependent relationship we have here. Lol"}
{"text":"I'm originally from California and I would eat flame broiler about every week. So I'm soooo happy that they finally opened one in Tempe!!!! This place is super clean and their food quality is on point! I def recommend people to try this spot. Very simple, clean, and healthy food! Yesssss!!!"}
{"text":"Flame broiler is awesome! The food is very filling and you can pig out and not feel guilty. Don't get me wrong I love greasy unhealthy food as much as the next person, but this is a great alternative without sacrificing the flavor. I have seen these pop up all around California and finally got to try it out here in Arizona. The skin on meat is my favorite part of any meal, so it left me a bit hesitant about this place since part of their selling point is that they do not serve food with skin (the most unhealthy, fattening part). I was worried the meat would be dry and flavorless, but boy was I wrong! I've been training to get that super fit wedding body so I thought it was the appropriate time to give this place a try after our regular Tempe Town Lake run. The staff is super nice and we conversed with her for a while talking about what's new in Tempe and the food was out in a flash! I got a powerade and the mixed bowl that consisted of chicken and beef with some amazing sauce (that I added extra of) and of course i had to add some sriracha! It was shown that the whole bowl was about 600 calories so I was surprised that I was full by the time I got halfway, so I had a lunch for the next day! Made me feel good being full since it seems like I burned more running than I ate for dinner! I plan on coming back many times over and try out other items!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place for a minute, so I finally ordered from Postmates. It only took 20 mins to get it. HA-LAH-LER. 

And oh boy, is this place yummy. I got the chicken and beef plate. SO much food for $10. 
This is great fast food if you're looking for heathier options. 

I will DEFINITELY be back to this joint."}
{"text":"We had some lunch here today, first time dinning here. The assistant manager (I didn't catch his name ) was SO kind, friendly, and helpful that it made our visit from good to- wow, amazing. Thank you very much! The food was also delicious and healthy. Couldn't ask for a better lunch experience."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time last night. This place is absolutely delicious.  My favorite part was given the choose between a mini bowl and bigger sizes. I had weight loss surgery and I hate when I am forced purchase a big plate when I won't even be able to eat half.   This is now my favorite place! And well the food is so yummy and healthy! Its a win win situation for me!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time and I loved it! I got the chicken bowl with brown rice with extra vegetables. I used UberEATS to order for delivery since I was at work. I will for sure buy some more! Everything was perfect about it, especially the price! I recommend anyone that is craving for a chicken bowl to try this out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and it was delicious. It was fresh, hot and it was a great portion. I love that they have brown rice for an option. The green sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty good rice veggie meat bowl at a decent price, but Beware the triple hot sauce is a creeper! Not spicy till halfway through my bowl and Bam! Firemouth! Good quick healthy lunch stop"}
{"text":"This location stood out to me after searching for a quick bite. As described it's a fast food, healthy Koreanish joint. We stopped by on a Saturday in the late afternoon and the place was empty but very clean. The food counter layout is similar to chipotle where you order and they add toppings. 

The menu is very simple with options of beef, chicken, half as half, and tofu. You can pick white or brown rice and top it off with veggies of your choice. After ordering, you can find a table and self serve soft drinks (not included in meal). They have a sauce/pepper stationary in the center starting with mild to hot. The fire sauce was not hot at all. 

The food is flavorful with some sauces of your choice of course, light and healthy. If you're looking for a quick and delicious lunch, this is the place. And not to mention, it's pretty healthy with a fresh avocado on top! 

Goodbye Tempe!"}
{"text":"I heard that this was a popular place outside of Vegas but wasn't familliar with it so waited awhile before stopping by.  Glad we finally tried it.  Went around 1pm during week.  Was surprised we were the only customers and were a little concerned we messed up going there.  It looked clean and smelled good so we  ordered.  It was delicious.  Very fresh. The self service sauces are great, try them all.  As we were finishing the manager came by and gave us another complimentary bowl to take with us for later.  Probably an order for someone else that was mistakenly made wrong.  I was happy to have it and thought it was a sweet gesture toward us new customers.  The smallest sized bowl was perfect size for lunch and so affordable.  Try this place out if you like teriyaki bowls, it's really good."}
{"text":"After the gym, my sister wanted to come here. I've never heard of this place before and the selling point was \"there's a Starbucks right next door\"...ok, whatever.

It's, like Chipotle but better in terms or quantity and quality of the food you get. You pick your base (veggie, rice or brown rice), protein (chicken, tofu, beef or half and half) and you can have add-ons for extra $. They have different kinds of sauces: magic sauce is teriyaki sauce, spicy, and like spicy x3. 

I got the half chicken, half Beef Bowl with brown rice. For the sauce, I mixed magic sauce with spicy x3 sauce. I like the charred flavor you get from the proteins. I was pleasantly surprised.

The selling point was their stellar employee, Stephen. Customer service at its finest. He was polite, friendly and helpful to every single person that walked in. He truly likes helping people, even to the lady with an attitude that walked in late and didn't like what was on the menu. #byefelicia"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not very good either.
My husband and I went because we got a coupon in the mail and since we're new in town, thought we'd check it out since it's right down the street from where we live. The location is alright, to very easily seen from the street but easy to get to. We didn't really know what to expect going in, but the place is clean, the staff is nice, and all around it's an aesthetically pleasing place to grab a quick bite. The food itself is just really blah and we were hungry again within the hour. We grabbed the all of the sauces, including their \"Magic\" sauce (it tastes like a knockoff Hoisin sauce) which definitely helped with the taste of the food but not much. I guess we're just not meant for the extra healthy hipster food. My husband is Thai so we eat a lot of Asian cuisine and this stuff just definitely tastes inauthentic and bland. 
We probably won't be going back, but if you're into this sort of stuff, it's probably okay.

Once again, no issues with the staff or the facility, just the food itself isn't very good."}
{"text":"THE FLAME BROILER HAS COME BACK!.... To TEMPE!

We've missed them so much over the years from when we lived in CA, now theyre here and it's a great time to be alive.

Flame broiled chicken on a bed of rice (and maybe veggies as well). Topped with green onions, some tangy, brewed light bodied soy teriyaki, and maybe a splash of hot sauce or two. 

Like most teriyaki bowl places, they have terrible drink options for someone trying to be healthy. And while competitors may offer more options, they do a better job of focusing on quality since theyre chicken is so much better."}
{"text":"This joint isn't bad but don't come here expecting Chinese Food, it's fusion....the healthy kind. This place is best for lunch. I first came here during its first month open for business. Wasn't impressed...but I came here at the time for Chinese cuisine. The chicken is now what I believe to marinated and is tender. The Beef is still a bit dry and tough, but chicken is what most will get. The best bet is to just get the bowl. There's no need to get the plate. The salad is more like a coleslaw and the fruit is an orange. The Triple-Hot sauce is the way to go....I'm proud they just didn't leave a bottle of Sriracha and made their own mix. Even if it may just be a mixture of off the shelf sauces. The magic sauce is their way of satisfying soy sauce but much thicker which I prefer."}
{"text":"The tables are almost always dirty, and the chatty guy who looks like Al Roker is too busy talking about drinking at his pool instead of cleaning them. He made a snide comment about my appearance when I first had my order taken, and I don't appreciate mean queens. I have eaten a lot of flame broilers in so cal where I am from, and this is the worst."}
{"text":"I got the bowl with half and half. The chicken was good but beef was dry and burnt. Good for a quick bite and friendly service."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after seeing the sign driving north on the 95 freeway.  I learned there are a ton (171) of Flame Broilers mainly all over Southern California.  Very happy that Vegas has a location; can say that I ate at the only Flame Broiler in the state. 

I decided to for lunch midweek around noon; was surprised that there were only two other customers eating; probably because location is fairly new.  Decided on the Chicken and Rice Bowl which had a nice amount of deliciously flame grilled chicken on a bed of white or brown rice (I did brown) with a mixture of veggies.  This was seriously tasty!  I opted for some of the Magic Sauce (teriyaki) to drizzle on; makes it taste really great.  I know they say there isn't MSG in the grilled meats, but think the Magic Sauce had some in it as I'm sensitive, and my stomach did some serious rumbling (my MSG reaction) for a few hours after eating.

But overall, a great experience and will be back for sure.  Plus, it's close to my house.  Another bonus."}
{"text":"I have always ate here in California and was super excited to find one In Arizona !!!! The food is always amazing ! Now they give u the option to add avocado  for 1.50! It's so delicious I definitely recommend this place for a great bowl. Get the half and half"}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday for a try. I definitely was NOT disappointed. I ordered the mini chicken bowl. There was rice, cabbage, veggies and the chicken on top. Next time I am in town, I am definitely going back! 

Don't forget to get a punch card!"}
{"text":"Always love this place...healthier option that has large portions...Half is definitely plenty but I end up eating the whole combo plate anyways =O yummm"}
{"text":"Not sure why you advertise white meat chicken on the menu and you can't fulfill the order at 6 pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I'm guessing flame boiler is popular in California, and they opened their first location here in Las Vegas. Gave this place a try from recommendations. It's located next to Starbucks in a business area. Ordered the Half & Half regular bowl with steak and chicken with just white rice. They do have sizes from small,Regular, and plate size. The meat had that smokey taste when I took my first bite. It was also not dry and really juicy as well. I give the meat an 8 out of 10 rate. The rice was just a little squishy. 

Definetly love their sauce options. My Personal favorite is the \"Magic Sauce\" which pertains to Teriyaki sauce. The cleaniness of the dining area Should be maintain for it being slow. Other wise no complaints in eating here food was good."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's so healthy and delicious especially with the magic sauce. The staff is also so nice, warm, and welcoming. They're awesome"}
{"text":"Love this place! Healthy food and great taste. For those tracking their macronutrients I suggest eating here for a pre/post workout meal."}
{"text":"Extremely nice cashier. I always a enjoy a meal here when I'm missing one when I meal prep. Cashier new instantly sparked a friendly conversation. Made a mistake on my order had to change it midway, workers did not mind and were extremely friendly about it. Great location!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have ordered from this place. I was craving a rice bowl of some sort and wanted something of quality meat. You can't go wrong with flame grilled meat!! Let me teeeelll you!!! I ordered the half and half chicken and beef. If you can't decide on one get both is my motto lol. I am soooo beyond happy with my decision to order from here. This will now be my go to spot for chicken beef bowl. Yummy yummy."}
{"text":"The new location is opening up on priest and Warner!"}
{"text":"Well other than serving a little slow, the food was awesome.  It's probably the most healthy alternative out there. The flavor was great and there are several spices you can choose from. I had the beef and chicken, my wife had white meat.  We were very pleased."}
{"text":"First time, became a fan! I had the half and half mini bowl ( chicken and beef ) it was sooo good. I love their magic sauce, too. I'm dragging my fellows for a lunch there tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"It was not what I expected the food was like something you would order off the swanns truck. It was not nasty but not something I would remember or have a craving for. I can say been there tried it... Eehhh"}
{"text":"I never really write reviews but, I wanted to post a quick note.  When you walk in the place it's quite unpreposessing, however, the customer service is very pleasant.  The gentleman behind the counter is all smiles while being politely efficient.  The food choices are simple but tasty with nice textures.  I agree completely with some of the previous reviews.  Perfect for a quick lunch or post work out meal.  Quite well done.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Got excited and stopped here thinking it was like the Flame Broiler from Cali. Not the case - same menu but they give you such a small amt of rice and veggies and also make you get your own magic sauce. Come on!! 

Food does not taste the same ad what I am used to. I'll skip it in the future and save my trips to FB for when we visit Orange County."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  It's better than teriyaki madness. The chicken isn't dry either which is a big plus for me. The green hot sauce is very tasty."}
{"text":"Their menu is very simple but the food is tasty. Basically you can choose from three sizes, small bowl, large bowl or plate, filled with a steamed veggie blend, white or brown rice (or no rice) and your choice of chicken or beef. The protein choice and size determines the price. The bowl is a little plain on its own but you can always add more teriyaki sauce and some hot sauce (they have 3 heat levels). It is a great option for a fast food meal that is pretty healthy."}
{"text":"As Teriyaki bowl places to go, they dont come better!  THe half and half beef/chicken combo plate was money!  The sauces were really tasty too.  I like how you can control how much teriyaki sauce goes on your food.  The ingredients were fresh and of high quality and you could taste that in the food.  I chose this place out of convenience since I work right next to the restaurant, but I will for sure be coming back."}
