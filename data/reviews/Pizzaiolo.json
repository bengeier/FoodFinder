{"text":"We ordered delivery from this location and it was okay. But not amazing.   I think their queen street location is better, or maybe we hit them on the wrong day. The fredo pizza is normally covered with thinly sliced potato and a nice level of rosemary and other spices, this time around, it was rather sparse.   Considering they said an hour for delivery, and we were only 6 minutes away (if you walk), I would have expected they'd have enough time to actually cook the potatoes properly. I wish we had just picked it up, maybe it would have been better.   They have three vegan pizza's on the menu and an extensive combination of other types as well. So I'd start the Pizziolo experience at a different location if you want something especially good.   That said, my slightly undercooked potato pizza was still better flavour-wise than the Pizza Pizza in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This location was my first foray into the Pizzaiolo chain since moving to Toronto.  We went to this location at 3am on a Saturday night and asked for half a fredo (with potatoes, rosemary and oregano)  and half a vittoria (tomatos, zucchini, red peppers). They didn't even blink, no problem, done. When we got it, it was packed with toppings, hot and delicious. Everything seemed cooked to perfection.   Afterwards service was a bit off, I tried to buy a drink, and stood at the counter, drink in hand while the server talked on the phone... for about five minutes. Then I put the drink back in the fridge and sat down to finish my pizza.   On the plus side, the variety of pizza they offer is nice, they have vegan and vegetarian pizza available by the slice (amongst others), and they are open super late."}
{"text":"No more trudging downtown to get a oily slice of potato rosemary (The Fredo) pizza for me, finally, a new Pizzaiolo up north and in my neighbourhood.  This location is clean, and at 4pm, completely empty except for the reasonably friendly dudes working there. They had a special deal going on for a free beverage with purchase for their grand opening (which is now over) but honored my request anyway. Free soda is always a plus.   Pizza was decent. One half of the GIANT slice was perfect, the other half was more than half of my daily requirement of olive oil. Crispy tasty crust, maybe verging on too crispy, but it was still within tolerance levels. Also, I'm happy that they actually had a vegan pizza available, which is more than I can say for half of the downtown locations I've been to after 7pm.   I'd come here again and I hope business picks up because that area has been lacking in quick tasty (vegan or otherwise) food options."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this excuse of a pizza shop. Ordered a vegetarian pizza only to be delivered a meat pizza. When I rang to complain and request another be delivered the staff advised \"that was my order\" and that they wouldn't be sending another pizza. My previous two times ordering here the pizza came late & cold. My own fault for going back. Stay away from this stink house!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my new fave pizza place!  Delicious pizza.. great whole wheat thin crust.  If you're in a rush and need something awesome, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo at 346 Bloor St is an Annex hot-spot. It is difficult to go about your business at Spadina and Bloor without being distracted by the wonderful smells coming from this 'hole-in-the-wall' pizzeria.   ***LIFE HACK*** Order a party-size pepperoni and add free rosemary, fresh chopped garlic, and oregano. WHILE YOU'RE WAITING, go to PIZZA PIZZA at Bathurst for dipping sauce -- WE ALL KNOW THAT SHIT IS DOPE"}
{"text":"hands down my favorite Pizza place.  The pizza is fresh, great variety of toppings, and it isn't greesy. My favorite is the primavera!  Yum yum! And you can't beat $5.99 for a slice and a drink!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza, even the border crust is delicious! Nice selection to choose from, easy to order, friendly staff, reasonable prices, relaxed atmosphere. Ideal for a tasty quick lunch, dinner or late night snack."}
{"text":"Terrible, we used to have good service ad delicious pizza from them but the last few times we have ordered it has taken TWO hours for our pizza to arrive and we live just 2 blocks away!! This resulted in the pizza being cold and tasting terrible. Go to the yonge street location instead (too bad yonge street doesn't deliver)."}
{"text":"I've not given a 1 star review before and I have to say that I've had delivery from this restaurant at least 12 times before.  After my last delivery experience, I feel I have no choice but to give a 1 star review (please note I did not review for the most part the mostly positive experiences I had with Pizzaiolo).   I don't know if there's been a management change but we ordered a pizza August 6 - a Sunday night.   We knew that the pizza takes upto an hour to receive and we ordered anyway.   We live a 7 minute walk away from the store and if we had known it would have taken so long, we would have gone and picked it up.  However, we ordered online at 8:14pm and waited.  At 9:14pm we called the store, the employee told us that the pizza had already left and that his driver wasn't answering the phone so there was nothing he could do.  Okay - fair enough.  By 9:44pm I called back and again, the employee said there was nothing he could do.  Finally, at 9:54pm. a very brow-beaten delivery guy showed up with the last pizza in his bag.  I mentioned that it had taken 90 minutes and he informed me of how busy he was and how tired he was.   I paid him and as usual tipped him and took the pizza inside.  I moved 5 feet and opened the pizza box and saw that the delivery guy hadn't even bothered to hold the pizza up straight and the pizza had slid to one end.  As well, the pizza was overcooked but at the same time, stone cold.   I ran after the delivery guy to give the pizza back to him but somehow he had disappeared in the 20 seconds it took me to figure out this was crap.   I called back the store and the same employee answered and seemed pissed at his lot in life and offered me the owner's cellphone # and suggested I text a picture to the owner of my sad, inedible pizza.  Otherwise. as he had previously stated, there was nothing he could do.  I did text the owner  and never received a response.  I also emailed Pizzaiolo's customer service email  and also did not receive a response.  This will be my last Pizzaiolo purchase - I'd rather eat the cardboard at Pizza Pizza than put up with the disdain that Pizzaiolo showed me.  They are going the way of Amato Pizza."}
{"text":"My default pizza delivery option.  A little expensive but pretty good."}
{"text":"We get pizza delivered and have settled on our favourite. We've tried a few different ones, some ok, some bad, some delicious. The crust/dough is really good. We noticed that large pizzas taste better than the extra-large ones .. weird. In any case, this is our favourite pizza place."}
{"text":"The selection is incredible. Meat lover? Sure. Veggie lover? No problem.  My issue with the place is that as of late, the pizza is a little stale. It seems as though the pizza has been sitting out for who knows how long. The quick toss into the oven doesn't seem to help much."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few locations and this one is actually right across the street from where I live. At least 3 times I've been there and they're either not open or no pizza is ready? I can't even say I've seen what their hours of operations are either. If I want a slice of pizza at 2 or 3 in the afternoon,... I expect the store to be open and for there to be pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is so good! Perfect thickness with crispy bottom and gooey cheese. Staff were super friendly too."}
{"text":"When first opened, the pizza was great! Last couple of times has been very inconsistent, one time seemed like it wasn't fully cooked. Today was the last time I or my family will be eating from here! Pizza delivered today was RAW!! Dough was completely uncooked. To eat it we had to cook it AGAIN in our own oven! Just ridiculous! If I wanted to make my own pizza in my oven I wouldn't of ordered from here!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza delivery choice for Bloor West Village. Their site is very convenient for online orders--our food usually arrives faster than their estimate (and has never been late). You can request asap delivery or order for a specific time in advance. The pizza itself is good, classic, thin-crust pizza, and we've never regretted any of the toppings. If you go in person, they have various slices available to heat up in the oven for you, and the slices are big. The employees at this location are friendly. One time they put on the wrong toppings, and when we picked up our order, they gave that pizza to us for free."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here but tried to get in tonight and they closed an hour early! So went to McDonald's. Why does that early close happen?"}
{"text":"Dear Pizzaiolioio (as my boyfriend and I so fondly call you),  Of all the T.O. pizza I've tried, you are by far the best. Your crust is fluffy and flavourful, your sauce is rich and oh-so-tomatoey, and your topping choices! They deserve a whole epic paragraph of their own!  With 15 vegetable toppings (including rare specialties such as broccoli, zucchini, and yukon gold potatoes!), seven meat toppings (in addition to the usual suspects, delicious sopressata makes an appearance on the menu), six cheese choices (gorgonzola and ricotta are the highlights), six sauce options (the fancy ones are fun, but the original Pizzaiolo tomato sauce rocks my world), AND three herb additions (fresh garlic, oregano, or rosemary!), you really have everything a girl could ever ask for. I've tried many of your gourmet pizza options and have been extremely pleased by them all.  Moving on from the toppings, let's talk about your wonderful John and Adelaide location. I visited you recently before attending a movie at the Scotiabank Theatre across the street (The best part of The Hangover was Bradley Cooper, mmm mmm.), and it was the perfect quick, delicious, and cheap meal. For $5.99 I had a slice of Soprano pizza (Sopressata, Sundried Tomatoes, Gorgonzola Cheese, Mozzarella and your Famous Pizzaiolo Tomato Sauce) and a can of Coke. For $5.99! Tax included! My favourite part about this location, however, is your adorable little patio up front. How lovely it was to sit outside on a warm mid-August evening enjoying delicious pizza and a refreshing soda! Your patio definitely makes this your best location.  Pizzaiolioio, I'll visit you again soon. I simply can't stay away.  Love always, Suzie G.  P.S. When are you going to open an east end location that's close enough to my apartment so that I can order delivery? The Danforth is in need of your delicious eats!  P.P.S. My roomie just reminded me that you are also a licensed establishment that sells beer! You may be a chain, but you're way cooler than Pizza Pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over a year, ever since I started working nearby.  Over the past 3 months (I'm writing this as of August 2014) I've noticed a distinct downturn in quality and service.  I primarily eat the vegan slices, and lately there have been less and less toppings on the vegan slices. It's already lacking meat AND cheese, so you think they could at least put a decent amount of veggies onto it. But the past few months there have been more and more barren patches on the slices, and the past two weeks the Whole Wheat Diana V was little more than toast with a few spinach leaves on top. This is really disappointing.   Also, lately whenever I go in the guy behind the counter has either been texting or talking on his blue-tooth cellphone - and doesn't even stop as he takes my order and rings me up! He just juts his chin at me to prompt me to show him which slice I want, and then mutters the total at the register...all the while talking on his phone, or reading/writing his texts.   I get that this isn't 4-star dining - but maybe a little bit of professionalism would be in order. I've worked my fair share of food service and retail jobs, and phones were simply never allowed on the floor for this very reason.   It's a shame that they are being so ridiculously stingy with their vegan options. I literally have been eating there every weekday for over a year, but I've been finding other options lately. It's no longer worth it."}
{"text":"Best place to get a pizza in the village. Affordable and so delicious. They are open late which is great for a pit stop on the way home. The staff there is always super friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. If you're looking for a great slice i would recommend the Canadian. Check these guys out next time you're craving a pizza in the village"}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE The actual pizza at pizzaiolo. But I HATE the service. We called to order one large party with pepperoni and half pineapple. 30 mins later we get a call asking if pineapple on the whole thing is ok...ummm no. They said they'd give us another medium size pizza no charge. The pizzas arrived almost an hour after ordering. The pineapple one wasn't cut and was tough and chewy (obviously kept warm while we waited for the other to be made). Consistently rude service over the phone."}
{"text":"My wife had a bad interaction with getting a pizza delivered. The guy added an extra $5 to the bill, then handed the machine to her to add a tip. She added a tip then while the guy was trying to run away without giving her the bill she called him back and asked for the bill. He immediately said, \"is it the extra $5\" before she had said anything about the problem. He gave her the $5 back. The guy was not a kid he was a grown man possibly East Indian in his 50s. I am of East Indian decent myself so it is even more disappointing. He clearly knew he was overcharging but only admitted he had overcharged when he thought he had been caught.  My wife called the store, the manager just defended the guy.  I notice some other posts as well about dishonesty with this location on Lakeshore.  We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"This location is a new addition to the neighbourhood.  I have to say I was pretty excited when I saw that they were opening up.  Definitely a welcome addition to Leslieville.  The pizza is pretty standard and on par with all the other Pizzaiolo locations I have eaten at.    They have a really good walk-in special for a 2 topping XL pizza for $18.  The nice thing is that it's actually a true extra large and you get a TON of 'zza for your money.  Took about 20 minutes for my walk-in order to prepared and the end result was very tasty.  They're good competition for the average (at best) Pizza Pizza down the street.  I only wish they had a deep dish offering."}
{"text":"Ordered a large and medium received two mediums. Took over an hour although quite close to my home, and arrived cold and not nearly as good as from the store on King West. Unfortunately this is the store that delivers to me so I won't be ordering from this franchise again!"}
{"text":"The pizza doesn't taste bad. It's expensive for a slice. The reason I wouldn't go back is because the older man that takes the cash is rude. He makes you feel like you're an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful! Sometimes the white pizzas can be a bit dry, I stick with the tomato based ones"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing and service on line and by phone receives an A+. Love the thin crust Sicilian.  Extra Bonus - it is peanut free"}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA EVER. I ordered at 9 and the pizza didn't come until 10:30! It was cold and disgusting and tasted like gross cardboard. NEVER AGAIN. Don't order from here. THE WORST PIZZA EXPERIENCE IN TORONTO."}
{"text":"Oh what a survivor you are! First you survived the utter dominance of Amato's on the same block, then the fire, Pizzaiolo can persevere on Queen Street like Cher through a bad break up. Frankly, it's not my favourite, but at 4am, where else are you gonna go? The club kid infested Pizza Pizza? Never."}
{"text":"Great gourmet pizza. I usually get a slice to go and they plenty of options at the window. I prefer the Sicilian as it has bacon. The slice is a quarter of the pizza and they reheat it in the oven before putting it on a paper plate. The pizza is thin and just crispy enough and always delicious. In a pinch, you've got seriously good pizza for about $4. They also have a fancy selection of pop, including Pellegrino."}
{"text":"I was really happy with my experience going here the other day.   There was a lot of selection of slices and they do warm it up before they give it to you.   With a pop it comes to $6.  It does get quite busy but that only means there is a good turnover on the pizzas they have previously prepared.     The pizza slices are decent sized,  thin and crispy.  Their large pizza is fairly expensive though - equivalent in price to 4 slices of pizza I believe.  HSBC is across the street in case you want to give directions to your friends."}
{"text":"This place is loved by my nephew, but after eating for five years at Martini's in Vancouver, this place is just average 'za to me.  Our party had Pepperoni, a Vegetarian and one with a mixture from their menu and it's only ok. It reminded me of Double Double Pizza and didn't feel like it was cooked in a legit pizza oven. It's definitely got that Pizza Hut oven taste to it.  To me, this is rock 'n roll pizza. It's up to the lover of it ! This would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very mediocre and and way over priced. The staff have no enthusiasm or energy and it takes way too long for food. I came in looking for a quick bite and my crusts were burnt, the pizza was so oily the napkin it was on was soaked,  it was a dirty bathroom and storage and the atmosphere  was just downright depressing. I defenintly don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Pizzaiolo location! We have been going to, and ordering from, this location since they started offering vegan pizzas! It is much nicer insider than your average pizza joint, and they have a huge variety of options (including VEGAN pizza!) They always have our order ready in 20 minutes, and the staff are always super nice and accommodating. Last weekend I asked if they make vegan calzones, and I was told they'd never done it before but were willing to give it a try. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! If I were rating them based solely on the calzones, they would be given 5 stars. The only reason they are only getting 4 stars is because their pizza is not \"as good as it gets\". However, I do think that their pizza is very good compared to other fast food pizza places. Overall, a great location! If you're vegan, consider requesting a calzone, and maybe they'll add it to their official menu!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've ever had.  Went with the whole wheat crust, spinach, tomatoes, ricotta cheese, made with olive oil.  You can a decent size slice, or go with a whole pizza. They got a 2 topping take-out special going on these days too."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here! I usually get the Spinotta (spinach, tomatoes, and feta cheese). It's so good, especially if you ask them to put some tomato sauce on top (which the older man at this location is happy to do).   They have a lot of good vegetarian pizzas (and even some vegan as well). The Bianca is tasty, and so is just plain cheese. This location even has a liquor license, and I enjoyed a Smirnoff Ice the other day."}
{"text":"Alright so me and my girl had a really bad experience here. We stopped by for a couple slices after work, our bill came to about $9.00, she payed with a $50 bill. It wasn't until we got home that she realized he gave her only $11.00 back (as if she had paid with a $20). So we drive back and told him what had happened, and he said that he couldn't give us the correct change because he didn't know if it was true. He said we would have to wait for the next day for the manager to come in and check the cameras and balance the till. (He later said that HE was a manager... Not sure what was true). He even said he would deliver the money to us and give us a free pizza. And this went on for about 15 minutes. In my experience working in the customer service industry, we give the customer the correct change, and if we make a mistake, we fix it as soon as it comes to our attention. But this guy was making us feel like we were trying to scam him or something.  So we end up coming back the next day, the other manager is there, apologizes profusely, and says that the he has had issues with this other manager (or employee or whatever he is), and gives us our money back. Then I mention the free pizza we were offered and he says that that guy had no authority to offer that, and the owner doesn't offer us ANYTHING (despite the fact that we were short changed $30 and had to drive back and forth two times in order to get our money). Finally he caves and gives me (get this)...one slice of cheese pizza...  Won't ever be going back to this Pizzaiolo, and that's for sure."}
{"text":"Complete disorganization behind the counter. I ordered the pepperoni slice and waited in line to pay. Once i paid, i had to stand off to the side and wait for them to take my slice out of the oven. When it finally came out the guy called out the pepperoni slice and i went to grab it, but he gave it to the woman paying who grabbed it before i could say anything and then the cashier looked up at me and asked me what slice i got. I told him Peppeoni, and he rung it into the cash register. I had to tell him that i had already paid and he had rung me thru about 2 minutes ago and the previous lady pretty much took my slice. After way too much time and hassle, i finally got my slice. I like the brand, but i will hesitate to visit this location again. This place needs much better management."}
{"text":"The selection on the night we went was great--they even had slices of the vegan pizza available!  The slices are huge, so they're kind of hard to eat.  I don't know if you need to explicitly ask for your slices to be cut in half or if the girl behind the counter just forgot.  Regardless, the slices are large enough to make it difficult to eat, but they're tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"I love this Pizzaiolo. My boyfriend visited me in Toronto on two different occasions in the summer where we traipsed around Trinity Bellwoods Park & picked up a large Meat Lover pie (yes, on both occasions. It was THAT good) to enjoy at one of the park's picnic benches underneath the shade of their gorgeously abundant & tall trees. It is an experience I will cherish for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the pizza and service at the Adelaide store and if it wasn't for them, my experience at the York Mills store would ensure I never went to any of them again.  Last night, I ordered three pizzas, a 13 inch gluten free (horrible - tasted like nothing), a medium honalulu and a large vegetarian. On the latter two, I asked for olive oil and garlic. First of all.. 68 bucks plus tip! So of course, I expected quality.  The large pizza was completely covered in the kind of garlic you buy in a jar. I love garlic but I found the amount unbearable. Garlic was all that we could taste and after a half a slice, I started to feel sick. There was at least a tablespoon on every slice!!! It was not possible to scrape it off because garlic is sticky when warmed. The honalulu had only a tiny sprinkling... So clearly this was a mistake!  My partner called the store and attempted to politely explain the situation, expecting, since the store was closing, a credit for the one pizza we couldn't eat. The person who took the call cut him off three times, saying \"yes I made that pizza myself and there was nothing wrong with it\". My partner very calmly said, \" I understand sir and thank you for making it for us, but we cannot eat it because there is way too much garlic on it\". The man said \"there's nothing wrong with it\" and then hung up on him!!   I learned from this that this store does not care to ensure their customers are satisfied and does not have a complaint resolution process.   Never again!"}
{"text":"2 hours for pizza delivery. Unacceptable. Really doesn't matter how good the pizza is if it takes 2 hours to arrive! Never again."}
{"text":"My new favourite spot for pizza slices.  If you're a vegetarian, it's very exciting to go to a pizza slice spot and see meat-free slices available that do not consist of the standard: tomatoes, mushroom, green pepper - so boring!   Pizzaiolo alwayas has wonderful vegetarian and vegan pizzas available with premium toppings like zucchini and roasted red peppers! They're always loaded with lots of toppings and a very flavourful, tomato sauce. Love the crust as well - it's a bit thinner than most pizza places, and it's always nice and crisp."}
{"text":"It's better to order rather than buy a slice that's been sitting in the display cabinet for x  hours, a lot of the slice options and ingredients are very creative but  the pizza slices become to hard and inedible once it sits for more the 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Tried to order online, but the program said it didn't deliver to my area (a block away).  I ended up calling and having the pizza delivered.  I ordered half Bianca and half meat lover's.  The pizza toppings and crust had good flavor, but the crust was rather greasy.  Pizza crust was crisp and not soggy as indicated by another reviewer.  Not bad when you're craving pizza and don't want to leave your room."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, I've been living a few blocks away for many years now and this is our choice of pizza for whenever it's needed. The only gripes come from picky eaters who aren't into pizzas with \"weird\" ingredients. The crust sauce and ingredients used are always delicious and although the atmosphere detracts from the feel as it's a little shabby, not many people eat in there so I don't find it a problem."}
{"text":"Decided to switch up usual Friday pizza night by trying a new restaurant.  Ordered 3 different large pizzas and they all received rave reviews from the adults and kids.  Unique and tasty combinations that put the usual chains to shame.  They were all great cold the next day except the potato pizza which was a little mealy and starchy  A word of warning regarding ordering via the app. We ordered and discovered we were just out of the delivery zone.  The app stated 20 minutes for pick up so we arrived a few minutes past this time.  Another 20 minutes later the pizza was finally ready.  I must admit I was super pissed when the young girl handed me the pizzas without any acknowledgement of the delay.  The pizza was worth five stars but the service drops it to four stars.  It would have been three stars if I had written the review that night. Next time I am calling in my order and asking for the specific pick up time."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo definitely beats all the other pizza places I've been too! When stepping into this place, there was an overwhelming smell of yummy pizza. This place is nothing fancy inside- few messy tables with old Italian family pictures and portraits of Sophia Loren. There is a nice display of pizza; prices are not listed.  Besides a variety of pizza, Pizzaiolo offers: baked calzone, chicken wings (baked), dipping sauces, salads, breads and more. The pizza here was surprisingly good- really fresh, toppings were quality and the crust was thin and crispy. Apparently the cheese and dough are never frozen; you can really taste the difference! For a 'large' pizza we paid around $19 (10 slices). The large here is not that large though.  The staff is friendly and efficient and the pizza is good. I would definitely return again and take-out rather than staying in, since the tables and floors were not clean."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this location for it's chain pizza... selection is always hit an miss and the execution of the pizza's equally as poor.  I do quite enjoy the Gianni Ola from other locations - just never from this spot."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo is a go-to place when you need a slice right now but you want something a little fancier than your Pizza Pizza.  Open late and offering dozens of choices of pies by the slice, this place certainly hits the spot when you're looking for a non-PP slice in the Annex.    The staff is friendly and the service is fast, and the place is generally very spic and span.  On a rare occasion you will find there is only one person working and the tables might not be cleared as promptly. Overall though, the service is good.  There is even a cute collage on the wall from one of the staff member's kids about \"My Daddy's Job\" which describes her father's job making pizzas.  Adorable.  The pizza is great, my favorite varieties are the potato-rosemary white pizza, the \"Godfather\" slice which is a deep dish slice featuring what seems like a hundred different types of meat, the veggie artichoke slice and of course, the capicola/gorgonzola slice, which is both spicy and tangy in one bite.  My recommendation when you go is to try something new, as there are so many slices to choose from to just stick to plain pepperoni or cheese, neither of which are super memorable there anyway.  Get some crazy toppings and enjoy!  I've never actually ordered a whole pie there to go, so I can't speak to their takeout/delivery service at all."}
{"text":"Good sized slice. Pizza tasted great. Very reasonable price and good selection.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"We walked in and ordered 3 medium pizza's, different styles total $57 worth. The toppings were super thin, so disappointing should have gone back to the king street location I had picked up an awesome slice from."}
{"text":"Over the past year the quality of their pizza has fallen substantially (specifically this location). Their pizzas used to be great. However, now seem to all come doughy and undercooked with very little cheese. Its as if they are being frugal with their cheese stocks to make an extra buck. I just ordered a Bomba and it had less cheese than a plain cheese single topping pizza should have. Not impressed and won't be ordering from there again. But will still go to other locations"}
{"text":"It is the best pizza I have ever tried in Toronto. It is healthy (gluten-free), tasty (with a lot of cheese) and the portion is big. I wish there were one near where I live so that I could enjoy it more often.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great delicious gourmet pizza. A must have in Toronto. They have a wide variety and they're all delicious. My favorites are Spinotta and Bianca. They have a variety in whole wheat dough too which is always a treat. $4 for a slice but worth every penny, and very fulfilling!"}
{"text":"I mean.. my Friend and I specifically drive from Ajax, Ontario to Toronto for this pizza.. I would indulge in a Classic Cheese Slice (Sofia) so simple yet so flavorful & Friend would get any veggie slice. Never would we leave displeased. I'd have it again and again if I could. Unfortunately there isn't a location in Durham *hint hint*"}
{"text":"Gave this place two tries, and got burned on both.  My latest order (tonight) - placed an order online for pickup - I get the pizza and bring it home and it was not what I ordered (it was missing pepperoni and some of the ingredients were meant for half of the pizza). I quickly called them back and the person on the phone was rude and said \"well, this is what was in the system so deal with it\". That is not how you run a business.  The first time I went was at night after the bar and they actually ripped off my friend by trying to charge him more than the pizza was worth (he was about to pay but luckily I caught it). Thought it was just a bad apple there but apparently this is how that business operates.  Pizzaiolo, you've now joined Pizza Pizza on the list of places I will never visit again. For anyone thinking of ordering here, think twice."}
{"text":"This place is near my work and I came in on a whim after craving some pizza.  They have a small patio area and it always seems full so I figured it was worth a try.  It was ok, nothing outstanding, though nothing awful.  The slices are a decent size for the price, and there are some different combinations.  For example, I ordered the soprano pizza which had a salami type meat as well as sundried tomatoes, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheese.  Turns out I really like blue cheese on my pizza.    It won't make it into my regular rotation of lunch stops, but I can see why people like it. I'll be back on the odd occasion, though. I guess for a place touting \"gourmet\" pizza, I was just expecting more."}
{"text":"Love Pizzaiolo as it is, but Daniel -- the owner of this location -- really does a great job here."}
{"text":"Ok this is by far the best pizza joint in town. I always order the Capone, and it's perfect. Would recommend this to anyone that like gourmet pizza."}
{"text":"When we tried a few times it was ok but now it's just another pizza place. I think the problem is the cooks that are hired. The ingredients are getting non existent. Will not be ordering in the future!"}
{"text":"This was the third time we had attempted to order from here for delivery but nothing ever showed up. That is just poor business and not one I would suggest anybody supports. When we had called back after an hour and fifteen minutes to get a status update they said the food was out for delivery. When calling again at nearly 2 hours they said that they never received our order. I highly encourage you do not give business to this place, it is a disgrace."}
{"text":"This review is completely based on what I'm looking for at 2am after a few (*ahem* a lot of) drinks.  One slice costs $4.20, a little steep if you ask me. The crust is too thick for my liking. I'm looking for a pizza that's heavy on the toppings, but Pizzaiolo is just average.  Next time I'm searching for late night 'za I'm heading back to the king of drunk pizza - Big Slice."}
{"text":"Situated to the west of the main Harbourfront drag, just on the corner of Rees and Queens Quay, this location of the gourmet pizza chain has been open for about a year and a half. It's the newest member in the Harbourfront triumvirate of pizza places, along with Mamma's Pizza across the street and Pizza Pizza closer to the heart of the tourist area.  I usually pop in to grab a full pizza for dinner, so I'm not one for individual pieces, but the slice selection is wide-ranging and fresh, presented in a pleasing manner. The chain has grown on their reputation for fresh ingredients and gourmet-style toppings, so it's not unusual to find potatoes and artichokes next to the more traditional pepperoni and mushrooms. From what I can tell, the pizzas are started in a deep dish pan, and finished directly on the floor of the oven. It makes for a very crisp crust and greasy-in-a-good-way top. You can order one of their specials (my favorite is the \"Gianni Ola\" - pepperoni, bacon & mushroom with a liberal sprinkling of oregano), or create your own from a wide list of toppings.  The restaurant itself is small, with enough seating for 6 to 8 people. Like most take-out pizza joints, it's not the type of place a group of friends would be looking to roost for the night. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, more-so than the average fast food place, IMO. The top-40 radio can be a little loud at times, but if you're just waiting around for your pizza, it's no big deal. It gets a little busy when there's an event going on at the Dome, as it's right down the street from the stadium and across from one of the main parking lots in the neighborhood, but more often than not it's pretty quiet, and service is very prompt.  Definitely my number one choice for pizza in the Harbourfront area."}
{"text":"Bleh.  Maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring Pizza Pizza, but three dollars more expensive.  I'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high.   Judge me all you like, but I'll head back to Pizza Pizza next time."}
{"text":"I'm super picky. There IS a pizza place right round the corner where we live but it smelled fishy,literally.   I picked this place because they had the make your own pizza option. We got a simple pepperoni. Absolutely happy there was a garlic option and it was FREE.   Delivery was faster than the 55 min the site said and thats awesome. Pizza was a tiny bit less warm then I usually get but it's cold as hell outside & we got delivery so yea.   When my husband was bringing it up to our apartment he said people were saying \"ohhh Pizzaiolo\", When people are saying yum out of no where because it's that good,I'll take their word."}
{"text":"They have the worst employees at this location. Rude and lazy. If I owned this location I would fire everyone and pay more attention. As this area gets more popular they could have a gold mine on their hands, but are way too stupid to figure that out."}
{"text":"The search for good delivery pizza in our Annex neighbourhood was ongoing in my family, now that Pizza Gigi has become increasingly more inconsistent. Last night we ordered from Pizzaiolo - a large Mafioso pizza - and it was excellent. Fresh, tasty ingredients, fine crust, everything you'd want in a pizza. We ordered online and the process was seamless. This is now our new pizzeria."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo pizza is very tasty but the people that run this location have NO idea about customer service.  They messed up big time on our order about 2 years ago - actually came to our house, took back a pizza with wrong ingredients, then came back about an hour later (2 hours since we ordered) with a pizza that obviously was the same one with ingredients scraped off!  They offer no $ compensation.  Didn't seem to matter that we ordered 2 xlarge pizza's every Friday for years.    We finally decided to try them again tonight but got a wrong pizza again. We called and driver came back and took back the pizza (! Other shops would let you keep it) but didnt have a replacement (!!!)  Then the shop calls and says another pizza is on the way.  After a half an hour I call back and they say it is in the oven (!!!!).  I asked if there was going to be compensation, waited on hold a while and then was told the manager can offer 10% off my next order (!!!!!!!).   It's now been an hour and still no pizza."}
{"text":"I hate to admit is but i usually order from them about once a week.  I order a pizza, it came with mushrooms.  I don't like or want mushrooms. I send email to \"Customer Service\" but was told to call the store direct.  They can't help.  Tried twice, and you can't leave a message.   Who ever is responding to \"customer service\" email is useless!    Given the cost of that pizza,   there goes $20 down the garbage shut.  AVOID AT ALL COST.    Can't recover from a simple error!  My business is going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium Sicilian here recently? And the owner delivered the pizza to my cat, since parking is limited in the area. He made me aware that the pizza was (slightly) overdone, and offered to make a free replacement then or another time in the future. I came in shortly afterward and got another (delicious) medium for free. I was satisfied with the good customer service and tasty pizza, so I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"They do vegan cheeeeeeeesee noooow praise Cheesus. sorry.  Anyway, I'm not much of a pizza person but I love theirs. My meat-eating roommates also say that the pizza they've had here is the best they've had. My dad eats here every time he's in the city. They do seem to be confused about a few things, didn't charge me one time for vegan cheese on a slice and then charged me the next time, but not a big deal, just confusing."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, pretty good pizza!  It is the best \"chain-restaurant\" pizza I've had in Ontario.  Since moving nearby, we've picked-up pizza (and had delivery) many times.  It's always been enjoyed by all our family & friends.  - Crust isn't too thin or thick (leaning towards thin, which I like). - Crust is buttery & crispy. - Many options availability - including veg & vegan! - Delicious tomato sauce.  - Pleasant customer service. - Huge calzones!  We have our favourite small independent pizza place-- but, when we want to feed a crowd or just in the mood for fast pizza, this is our pick!  (Try the potato pizza - my fav!)"}
{"text":"Pizza is much better then pizza pizza next door although it is more expensive. Sometime the pizza taste old and like they been sitting their for along time. However if you get a good slice or a fresh one the pizza is pretty good. If you around closing they sell their boxes for 5$ which is a great deal.  Would def choose this over pizza pizza next door."}
{"text":"A few Cali pizza places come close but nothing compares to you Pizzaiolo ;)"}
{"text":"They really messed up and I will never give them my business again  I was happy to see a Pizzaiolo in my neighborhood because I had eaten elsewhere and really liked it.  So for my daughter's birthday party I ordered from this location, I placed the order for several pizzas and indicated arrival time should be 6pm.  At 5pm the pizza was at my door! I called the store and was told that they would happily take the pizza back and return at 6pm like they were supposed to.  I CLEARLY indicated that I did not wish to have re-heated pizzas and that unless the pizzas worth over 100 dollars were made fresh I wanted my order cancelled.  The lady on the phone assured me they would be freshly baked.    So at 6:20 the pizzas arrived-note the time delay!! The pizzas were awful!! They were burnt and cold! I called the store and the lady apologized and said she wasn't sure what else I expected from them? Then I emailed my experience because when you order online they send an email asking for feedback.  Shortly after I sent the email someone responded claiming to be the owner, so I thought 'at least someone was taking this seriously'.  He promised to follow up and rectify this, but needless to say he NEVER did!   I really wanted to support this location but I will NEVER order from them! And the party I was hosting was with several families in the neighborhood who were also completely turned off."}
{"text":"I regularly visit this Pizzaiolo location, which is just around the corner from Spadina Station. This chain has the best ready-to-eat selection of any pizza place I've ever been to, including nine vegetarian and three vegan options, which you won't find anywhere else.   I have had slices of the Casino, Primavera, Whole Wheat Spinotta, Whole Wheat Veggie, and Fredo pizzas (all vegetarian and described on Pizzaiolo's website). All of them are consistently good. The Primavera and Veggie are sort of 'standard vegetarian' pizzas, similar to what you would find elsewhere. The Casino and Spinotta are my favourites, though sometimes the Spinotta can be a bit dry. The Fredo is good but, because it is one of the vegan options and made with just dough, Yukon Gold potatoes, olive oil, rosemary and oregano, it seems more suited to be a nice side bread than a full meal to me. The dough for all of the pizzas is good, I like the tomato sauce on those that have it, and the rest of the ingredients are always fresh and good quality.  All slices are the same price. I get the slice and drink deal, which comes to $5.99 with tax. A 'slice' is really two slices, and is enough for a satisfying meal. My only complaint is that the drinks that are available with the deal are all Coke products, and the other options cost extra.  There is a counter along the wall with four or five chairs where you can sit and eat.  My main motivation for writing this review is that I really like the staff at this location. Everyone is always very friendly, and every once in a while I get a free drink because I am a regular. I have also seen the owners provide homeless people with free food on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had bar none. Their dough is best and sooo soft. Been to different locations but this is my favorite."}
{"text":"I walked by this pizzaiolo for years, always going to the Pizzaiolo on wellesley or just north of bloor but i decided to give this one a try.   Worst f@$&ing idea: godfather pizza was still cold and because of that, the dough tasted raw.."}
{"text":"I used to like this location but after ordering the other day we will never go back. The pizzas showed up after 1 h (I live next door) and they were doughy and raw. I then called them to complain and they compensated us with two new extra large pizzas for free. These showed up after yet another hour and still the dough was raw. Sorry but will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Will never go back. Rude service and only had 4 pizzas left to choose from. Felt like I was in line for food at a prison the way they were speaking to their customers."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 0 star. I just ordered 2 pizzas one Bomba and the other one veggie lover. I paid $42 for 2 medium pizzas so with this price I was expecting something decent.while the 4 cheese one (bomba) was not bad the veggie lover which had spinach, mushroom pepper and tomato was a disaster the whole thing tasted and felt like it was drenched in water. When I called and spoke with the manager he says oh ya that sometimes happens with our veggie pizza ,can I do anything for u, I was like can u send me another one and with annoyed voice he goes ok but please return the pizza to the driver, I said sure  (as if I was gonna eat that trash). Then I said can u please maybe send all cheese one since I don't want the same thing happening he goes no we can't change the order, what an idiot! He wants to send another one of the same pizza he admitted they can't make it properly .at this point I was so angry i juust thanked and hung up the phone.now pizza is in trash, waste of money and time and I'm still hungry.DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Shockingly good pizza.   I mean, okay, despite the fact that they forgot our order and we ended up waiting for an hour and a half for 2 pizzas to be delivered down the street, I have to say, all was almost forgiven as I sunk my teeth into the thin, soupy slices of meatlovers and veggie pizzas. Succulent slices of sausage, crisp pepperoni and golden ham made for the best meat slice I've had in a while. Our veggie option came with soft, thin slices of red pepper and tomatoes. With slices so thin, you can easily scarf four. As if that's something to be proud of.  I'm gonna get skewered for this one, but my gosh, it reminded me of pizza from the South of France. Helluva lot cheaper than Terroni, and, well, almost a shorter wait."}
{"text":"Despite the fact the actual food was good, the service ruined the entire experience. Ordered for pick up and was told it would take 20 minutes. Arrived 15 minutes later to an empty location that was clearly not busy only to be told they hadn't started it yet and that it would be 10 minutes. Actually took over 20 minutes of waiting there to end up with the food. During that got to hear the nonsensical and inappropriate talk happening behind the counter which included a discussion of the girls cold sores (needless to say, appetite was killed). All that and yet no apology/discount/freebie for the wait, the ineptitude or the rudeness.   Not going back and I hope the owner wises up and get rid of those two."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery online. An hour later it still hadn't arrived so I called to check on it. Without even asking what order it was the guy immediately told me that it was out for delivery. When I asked him how he could tell given I hadn't even given him the order number or address he put me on hold. He then came back on the phone, asked me what I wanted again and then told me the same thing as if we hadn't just spoken.   Needless to say it's the last time I am ordering from this location."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent, but a head's up: if you're looking order deliver prepare to wait as long as an hour and a half for the driver to show up with your pie. That's not an exaggeration. When I called to ask what was going on with my delivery, they not only didn't apologize for my wait, but told me that I had not been promised a time. If you like cold pizza, this is the pizza shop for you."}
{"text":"Disappointing ! Tried this place instead of my regular place on a recommendation ........ Ordered my pizza with extra cheese and asked for the cheese on top.......didn't happen and there was very little cheese on it.  Don't you  just hate it when you give specific instructions and they don't do it! I worked in a pizza place in my teen years and know this can be done,  When I called and expressed my disappointment it was like oh well! I will not be ordering from here again .waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Lately the Pizzaiolo franchise locations have been popping up like wildfire. Noticed this location passing by the Yonge and Sheppard area  The chain they pride themselves as offering gourmet pizzas and they usually do have a good selection of ready made pizzas available if you wanted to pick up a slice.   So one day I was passing by the area and stopped in for a slice. To my surprise they offered a deep dish pizza. Wow in Toronto??! Oh the fond memories of Chicago deep dish. It was not exactly Chicago deep dish but was the closest thing you'd get at a Toronto Pizza chain.   It was amazing though, a ton of cheese, three kinds of meat (sausage, peperoni, bacon) pan crust about 1\" thick, it's the stuff pizza dreams are made of.  They call it the Godfather. haha   Let me tell you a story..   It was New Years Eve and I had fond memories of my deep dish slice I had here at the North York Pizzaiolo a couple weeks so I for NYE I decided to order entire pizza.   When I arrived, I let the fellas working the oven know I was here to pickup a Godfather. There eyes widened and shortly after came a smoking burnt pizza.  Oops!  They left the pizza in the oven too long and burnt it. Boo!!  Anways the manager was there and he quickly apologized . He said if I had 15mins to spare he'd make another one for me at no charge. I was really pressed for time and wanted to stop in and go. I didn't even put money in the  parking meter out front.  As I was contemplating the decision... he gave me money for parking. So I went to the car to put it into the meter.   When I got back, he suggested if I was interested in getting their already cooked Godfather pizza they had (for the slices). I said sure, since it was all already to go. He also threw in 4 cans of pop. I thanked him for his generosity.   The manager said that this rarely happens and if it does happen they go over and beyond to make it right.  Really swell guy and great customer service here."}
{"text":"The Godfather deep dish pizza we ordered for delivery was meh.   It was a lot better when I had it at the North York (Yonge & Sheppard) Pizzaiolo location.   With franchise chains, the ingredients are all the same so at least that's consistent but the pizza depends on highly on who's making the pizza that night.   The pizza looked competely amateurish, I'm attaching a photo to this review. It was also poked and proded. I could see some large stick marks.    Didn't have much confidence when ordered from the get go as I had never seen it out on display at this location. But we were was hopeful unfortunately though it disappointed."}
{"text":"Their pizza is a nice change from some of the other traditional places out there not saying it's the greatest but it's decent for what it is. High quality toppings and delicious crust. Good fast service from this location will order again from them real soon"}
{"text":"Went in, sign said \"Open\", wanted a slice they had no pizza, no slices. WTF? So why are you open?"}
{"text":"Still ordering here after several years with tons of options in the 'hood. They're doing something right. Not super awesome little Italy pizza, but perfect Friday after work and school o crap what's for dinner pizza."}
{"text":"This is one of my lunchtime favourites. Yonge and St. Clair has some decent places for lunch and this one is probably my most regular. You can get in and out quickly, and have a decent, and pretty large sized, slice of very fresh pizza. If you go in the busy period of lunch, the pizza is even fresher as it's they are baking quickly to keep up with the crowds.  I usually take my slices to go, but it's actually quite relaxing to sit in their chairs in the back and actually eat it there."}
{"text":"First time I've been at to a Pizzaiolo but I'd heard that the prices were a little more expensive than other chain fast foods, like Pizza Pizza. I bought a slice of pizza and can of pop for $5.99 (including tax) but the slice was  quite large (a quarter of a whole pizza). I think they only sell pizza but there was a good variety, all with names like \"the Godfather\", \"the Soprano\", etc. Each kind of pizza had different ingredients on it and it all looked so delicious! The pizza itself was okay, nothing special.  And I'm not a huge fan of greasy pizza. However, I did like the fact that it is also located directly across the street from the Toronto Reference Library, so you can always grab a slice during a study break! And there is a lot of seating in the back and it's pretty secluded."}
{"text":"Even if you don't like pizza, you might like this restaurant. I think it is the best restaurant that sells low price pizza for good quallity. There are a lot of different kinds of pizza in the restaurant.  Especially, the Toni Pepperoni pizza is always popular. You can always get ready-to-eat pizzas, so you don't have to wait. Don't hesitate. Just come and taste fantastic pizzas."}
{"text":"Web ordered online at 5:30 and its 7:15 and still no pizza. Just put a frozen pizza in the oven. You guys get zero stars and a terrible rating.  The guy who answered the phone says all pizzas are out it should be here. No better explanation. No pizza. First and only attempt to try ur pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the pizza was fine, but last Friday I bought a pie that was burnt on the bottom and seriously lacking sauce and cheese. I was hugely disappointed. What's worse is that I listed a complaint on the company website the very next day and never got a response back.  Nothing worse than bad customer service AND an inconsistent product.  Usually I say support local, but I would give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Ordered two slices, the creamy garlic dip and a pop. It was not worth my money.  The pizza was cold because he didn't put one of them in the oven to heat it up. He said it just came out of the oven. The other one that went into the oven was cold as well. I believe thee is something wrong with his oven.  Garlic dip was tasteless.  I saw the other guy use his bare fingers to pick up toppings that fell off onto the side back onto the pizza and served it to another guest."}
{"text":"Even though it's part of a chain and caters to everyone from the lunch crowd to the post-club-and-bar set I, for one, am happy to be a regular at this location.   Because I work close by - **and** on weekends - Pizzaiolo is quick and convenient when I need dinner and/or somewhere to sit and decompress/kill time for a half-hour before meeting up with friends.  The number of meat and veggie options is, in my opinion, more than enough to choose from (my favourite, hands down, is the Capone), and the slices are generous - for me, one slice (which is usually sliced into two huge halves) leaves me stuffed.  And the price is reasonable - at $4.19 per slice, it's probably a bit more expensive than, say, Pizza Pizza, but it's not astronomical. And if you're like me and have those nights when you DON'T want to spend a lot of money on a meal, this'll do.  Between this and the courteous staff, I really have no complaints."}
{"text":"The pizza is cooked and sliced and then reheated to order in a large stone oven. The selection is non-traditional, with a couple of vegan options and whole wheat crusts. The slice is about 1/4 of a large pizza, for $5, which seems like a decent price. The room seats about 15, with a large tv showing the news or a view of Yonge street."}
{"text":"Under $5 for a slice of gourmet pizza is an amazing deal considering pizza pizza is about the same price and it will not come close to the quality or taste of pizzaiolo.  Definitely a good budget lunch option for downtown!"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Pizzaiolo Cuisine: Pizza Location: Financial District Address: 1 Toronto Street Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 2 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  *Big portions *Big Seating area *Delivery Avail *Special: Any Slice+Any Drink for $5.30 +tax  If you ever walk around Downtown Toronto, I guarantee you have passed by at least one Pizzaiolo. I've tried Mama's Pizza? just around the corner and I really did not enjoy it so I was a little hesistant to try this place. This place can't be missed with it's bright green store sign and once you walk in, it's very clean and bright inside the restaurant.  There were 2 people working behind the counter, one girl at the cashier and and a guy in the kitchen area. I never expect spectacular service at Pizza joints like this, but it's always nice when someone greets and acknowledges you are there. Obviously that didn't happen here (and my family was the only people there!) but I guess I shouldn't complain when I am paying $3 for a slice of pizza.   Ordered: CANADIANO - I paid $5.30+tax for this which includes this giant slice plus a drink. It's so big they cut it for you in half. There are lots of options catering to meat lovers, vegetarians and whatever suits you. They heat this up for you when you make your choice but it doesn't take very long. I really enjoyed this :)  Ordered: CHICKEN PESTO - This was my mom's choice and I took a bite of it. This was also very good but kind of dry. I think it would taste good with some ranch sauce on top or hot sauce.  SUMMARY: I love this place and it's worth every penny! :)"}
{"text":"Had the regular slices, they were nice. Light crispy crust, good toppings, non-rubbery cheese - a hit. Next time, not quite as good, but I got the deep dish. I should have stuck to the original. But all in all, good place to get a quick slice over the usual fare. Recommended."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best pizza I have ever had! I don't eat beef or pork on pizza and they have a wide selection of vegetarian pizzas. I've tried many of them and all did not disappoint. The slices are HUGE, so make sure you come here hungry."}
{"text":"Chain pizza. In my world, this the moral equivalent to the cruelest forms of BDSM play....\"Yes Mistress, I will gladly accept your cheesy breadstix. Oh no! Not the stuffed crust!!!! - Silence - you'll take two 1 toppings pies and you'll like it!!\".    Ok, back to the review; was dragged in here kicking and screaming (no-I do NOT prefer it that way) with a group and was pleasantly surprised by the pizza.  Nearly endless variety, fresh and tasty high quality ingredients atop a slightly chewy non-traditional but ultimately compelling crust.  Bonus points for multiple compelling veggie options.  Also, in a first for Toronto - a whole wheat crust whose primary ingredient is NOT recycled phone books.  What? It's fiber-y...  On the downside; The endless parade of homeless hitting up diners for food and money can be a turn off to some, although considering the neighborhood, my fellow diners and I preferred to look it as the extended disco remix of street theatre.    WARNING: If you are from New York THIS IS NOT PIZZA.  This has been a public service message from the Canadian Committee to Prevent Excessive Nasal Whining."}
{"text":"I craved plain pizza. I didn't know I would be getting the king of cheese pizza: mozzarella, feta and blue cheese.  YUM.   But dayum, they need to find a better warming system for their slices. Or a warming system at all. The gourmet-style pizzas could be gorgeous but they just sit there for I don't know how long. Then the thirty seconds in the oven does little. Yes, the crust should have bite to it but not the whole pizza! I want the flavours with the gooey cheese!    Potential."}
{"text":"Just average.  Used to be gourmet pizza and now have mediocre ingredients, toppings, etc. Lacking sauce and cheese. Saw the cash register guy picking up mushrooms with his hands and dropping them back in the pail, maybe breaking them up? Maybe just playing with them? Either way, disgusting."}
{"text":"Don't order takeout from here...we wanted 1 simple pizza tonight and we ordered online. Two minutes later this location called to confirm the order and said it would take 50 minutes. 1.5 hours later I called back to see where our order was and they said they had a glitch in the system and couldn't process it...when I asked why they didn't call me they said they didn't have my number...but yet they had called me earlier. Doesn't make sense...we are very disappointed and won't be ordering from this establishment again."}
{"text":"You can cut a medium pizza into as many postage-stamp-sized slices as you want, but that won't make it a large.   Pizzaiolo has some of the best pizza slices in the city, but I am never ordering delivery from them again. The delivery menu says a medium pizza has 8 slices, and a large 10. So we ordered a large for almost $25. Turns out the slices are tiny - barely a few bites. By any normal pizza standard, this is a six-slice pizza. For 25 bucks. I don't think so.   And to boot, the pizza came undercooked. Nowhere on the menu does it say that you have to finish baking it in your own oven."}
{"text":"I've loved Pizzaiolo pizza ever since I was 14 and one opened up near our high school and I totally had a crush on the manager there. It's hands down the best pizza chain period and probably better than alot of restaurant pizzas. I wish I could steal the recipe for their dough, I swear there's crack in it, it's so good. And you can't really beat the price.  But this particular location, on Jan 2, had a dude with an Aussie accent working the cash who was, I swear to god, the happiest, most friendly pizza store dude I have ever come across in my life. Like, he just made everyone's day a million times better by virtue of just being there and saying hi to people. I hope he finds great success in life because he deserves it.  Anyway, buy their pizza. It's fantastic. :)"}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo tries to separate itself from Pizza Pizza by offering more \"gourmet\" options. I had the Thai chicken. A huge slice of pie with veggies, chicken and a sweet thai sauce. The first gentleman placed my slice into the oven to reheat it and before I even took off my jacket it was on a plate and served. I tested it and, obviously, it was still cold. When I went up to the counter, the other worker, incredibly nice, knew before I said anything. She took my pizza, popped it back in, and then made a face to let me know this wasn't the first time. We smiled at the shared moment. As for the food itself, the Thai sauce was too plentiful and too sweet. It seemed to overpower the rest of the ingredients, even the bread. How does sauce overpower bread!?!?! I have had other slices here in the past and they have always been delicious. I don't expect anything less the next time 'cause I'm sure to return"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Pizzaiolo for a quick take out slice. If you go during peak lunch hours (11am to 2pm) you can choose from over 10 pizzas, all generously loaded with toppings. For 3.99, you get a quarter of an extra large pizza. It's actually cheaper to buy slices than to buy a whole pizza. Toppings are a bit chunky. This is great for mushrooms, but tomatoes sometimes fall off."}
{"text":"Quite simply the worst idea for pizza delivery. Spoke with an unbelievably rude lady - all I could catch was her name started with \"SH\". I was stunned and still can't believe the way she talked to me!  There's several really good pizza places south of eglinton on Yonge that will without question, have better customer service than pizzaiolo.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nazi Server won't let you sit and eat ten minutes before closing. Why?  Listen, I'm a big guy and I can eat one scrawny slice in five flat. I don't linger. Telling me I can't stay when the big hand on the clock says the place is open for ten minutes is ludicrous. Saying this rudely without reason. And I'd already paid. And the pizza definitely wasn't good enough to be worth coming back, making this definitely the worst Pizzaiolo in Toronto for service if not for food as well.  So let's forget this little sociopathic wannabe-dictator, and give this location a pass because it doesn't deserve our business."}
{"text":"A good piping hot gooey-crunchy slice if you hit the timing just right, which is a little before dinner hour. They are a very small, tight-budgeted operation and they sure act like it.  Somewhat limited operating hours, and often very, very limited slice selection - if they sell out of the Gianni Ola and Sicilian after six or seven PM, they will not re-bake and replace those pies - not if there are a few uninteresting veggie pies lurking in the display case. They are a bit stingy that way, trying to sell off every old scrap and I'd stop by there more often if this were not the case. I also remember when they opened the toppings were less cheap, seem to recall real sopressata, better sausage or pepperoni, maybe other cheeses - things they later decided were too much cost but made a better slice I'd pay slightly more for. We get the budget version now.  So I recommend going pre-dinner hour, or take your chances. And of all Pizzaiola stores I like their crust the best, they don't seem to skimp on the olive oil the way other stores do, which makes for a bland cardboard crust."}
{"text":"GOOD Pizzaiolo store for the Hawaiian and the sopressata and gorgonzola pizza - if he slices are fresh, which off hours can be a risk anywhere. Manly points for decent edibility and reasonable value in an Ontario city with really low expectations in food standards. You could cook an oven mitt to taste better than a lot of Toronto Takeout."}
{"text":"Their pizza tastes pretty good. However, I'm going to give them 3 stars because they are way too stingy on their toppings. When you order a large \"Create Your Own\" pizza and choose various toppings including chicken and bacon, you will literally get like 3 to 4 pieces of the meats. Seriously, 3~4 pieces of meat chunks on a large pizza?!"}
{"text":"Never have had an issue with delivery, the pizza  always has arrived when advised by the individual taking my order. Pizza always tastes great. Recommend requesting the order well done, maybe just a personal preference though."}
{"text":"I love love Pizzaiolo!  After a night out, I crave their pizza with their wonderful toppings.  I am a fan of their spinach/tomato type topping pizza slices.  They even have pizza for vegans, how awesome is that.  This location is on the main King West strip, it is has ample seating for those that want to stick around.  The service was over-top, I accidentally dropped my half my slice of pizza on the floor and they gave me another slice for my troubles.  I was not expecting that.  Make Pizzaiolo your pizza stop!"}
{"text":"I just want to update my review.  The pizza you order in the restaurant is good but the quality of the delivery pizza is not the same. It's a lot soggier and they put on way too many toppings - plus they often forget the sauce you order with the pizza. I recommend their pizza only if you plan to go into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Skip the Chicago Style Pizza they offer. It's more dough and crust and nothing else, not more of the good stuff the way everyone knows it to be."}
{"text":"Good pizza if they bother to serve you. The place is just not organized. The whole restaurant is the line and the waiting area. They need to have people line up in front of the pizza counter who haven't ordered. I just left after 4 people who came in after me ordered from the flustered old guy behind the counter. It shouldn't take me 10 minutes to order a slice when I'm, I thought, 2nd in line. Customer lost.  EDIT: Changed from 1 star to 3.  I've been there since, and I think they read my review. They put a hastily scribbled sign up telling people to line up in front of the glass display, as you would at, say, a pizza place.   Pizzaiolo is the best of the chain pizza joints in Toronto, and I'm happy they're back on the menu."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks after opening. Bought a couple of pizzas - regular and deep dish. Regular pizza was OK. Deep dish was NOT a deep dish, it was 2 pounds of dough with some sauce, cheese and pepperoni, etc. floating on top. They have no clue about the meaning of deep dish pizza .. someone should send them to Chicago for a real treat. May as well call this chain Pizza Pizza - at an inflated price. Here is what the owner emailed me regarding \"deep dish\" (2 weeks after I sent him an email):   \"I would like to apologize for not getting back to you sooner. At Pizzaiolo this is the way we do it and I'm sorry if it caused any confusion. This is what we Consider a deep dish at Pizzaiolo because when we make it in our pan its a minimum of twice as thick as our regular dough and we prefer to call it \"deep dish\" as opposed to \" thick crust \".  OK - don't call it what it is - try and fool everybody - you seriously think we are all stupid?  I went back a couple of weeks later for a regular pizza again ... Terrible this time. Quality control is not in their vocabulary."}
{"text":"The slices are great but their made-to-order pizzas are a real treat. Fresh ingredients and tasty dough make Pizzaiolo my go-to place for pizza, every time."}
{"text":"I have eaten at various pizzaiolo locations before, so when I was ordering for delivery I figure I'd give them a try. When the delivery person showed up after about 45 minutes, she had forgotten to bring our salad, so she had to go back and get it. The pizza was OK, and when she returned another 45 minutes later with the salad, it was very basic. I was surprised that due to their error and poor service they never offered us any gift cards or reimbursement. I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Before even talking about my lunch here, I need to give a huge shout out to the gentleman who was working the counter at lunch here today. I had come in and ordered a slice, and asked him how much it would be for the slice and a bottle of pop after tax. He told me the price, and I explained that I had forgotten my wallet at home today, but that I had just over $8 in change in my jacket pocket, and I wanted to make sure I could pay for what I ordered before opening the pop. As I approached the cash register, loonies, toonies, and quarters in hand, he stated he was giving me my meal on the house. Said he wanted to make sure that if I needed a few bucks on hand before I got home I'd have it. Talk about customer service!  Now for the food. I ordered the Capone slice (chicken, red pepper, Parmesan cheese, and garlic I believe). It was delicious! I was actually sad when it was finished. Lots of toppings, perfectly cooked, and with a glass bottle of Coke to go with it, it was pretty much the perfect meal.  Today's meal was obviously good value for the money, but even if I'd had to pay for it, it would have been a good deal. Their slices are quite large, and any of them is $4.25. No need to pay extra for \"specialty\" slices or anything like that.  I would have been back for the food anyway, but the kindness I was shown today will have me coming back even sooner."}
{"text":"This place is really good price performance. Better quality and tastier than Pizza pizza or Pizza Nova but cheaper than magic oven. They also make fresh gluten free crust for those of us whose are allergic/sensitive."}
{"text":"Tried the \"Gianni Ola\" and the \"Mafioso\", both were absolutely delicious! You could tell how fresh the pizza dough and ingredients are! A little pricy, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a pepperoni slice from this place! The ambience is causal, like any other location. Same with the service. But it's a great grab and go place and is very close to King station."}
{"text":"I like their pizza and it's good. After ordering, I sat on the counter, and a gentleman wearing a black baseball cap behind the counter blew his nose.  Then he scratched his crotch.  He then proceeded to serve a customer their pizza.  All without WASHING his DAMN hands first!!! Never eating here again if he's still working here."}
{"text":"After a busy successful week, my family decided to grab some take-out and treat ourselves. My brother has been talking about this place day and night so we decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did because it was the best pizza I've had in a long time.  We ordered a party size pizza of the following: (Highly recommend the Capone)  Capone - Oven-Roasted Chicken Breast, Fresh Mushrooms, Parmigiano Cheese, Pesto Sauce, Roasted Red Peppers and Mozzarella Cheese. + Soprano - Gorgonzola Cheese, Sopressata, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Mozzarella Cheese and Pizzaiolo Tomato Sauce.  I was hoping there would be some leftovers for tomorrow but... we easily finished all of it...  I really enjoyed tonights dinner. Well worth the 30$.   P.S: This is not a fancy \"dine in\" pizzeria."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite before heading to the art gallery nearby. It's convenient and fast. I ordered a Canadian slice $3.99. They warmed it up and it was satisfying. Fast checkin/checkout. There is seating if you wanted to dine in. Most of the tables and seating were dirty and it did not look like any servers were wiping them down after the customers. We sat down in booth, they had sports playing on the screens. The washrooms is a single stall, run down as well."}
{"text":"A good take out pizza should be a little bit greasy, but not too greasy. It should have good crust and the toppings should taste delicious. This pizza joint meets that criteria to a T.   We ordered take-out from their fairly extensive menu. While on the phone ordering we asked a few times if they charge for delivery. Rather than give a straight answer they just kept skirting the question.  Ladies and gents, the answer is yes, they do charge for take-out (we found out when we paid the delivery guy). Oh well, for $2.50 no big deal.  The pizza was ready and delivered quickly and the pizza itself is delicious, maybe even more so cold the next day."}
{"text":"I was highly impressed with the quality coming from a chain restaurant.  I love it so much, i ended up going 2xs on vacation and almost went a third time (stopped for self control lol) I highly recommend this  place for a newbie."}
{"text":"Average pizza. Ordered pizza to take out. Waited and then they said there is a $1 extra charge for the BOX! Still can't believe it!...   There are plenty other pizza options no need to go to this place that uses gimmicks to squeeze extra money from their patrons."}
{"text":"I like pizza. I mean I REALLY like pizza. And in all my years of pizza fandom, I have an opinion that pizza falls into two distinct categories;  1. Traditional Italian style with a dry, bready & blistered crust, flavourful yet often sparse tomato sauce, high quality toppings and traditional mozzarella cheese (think Terroni, Libretto, etc.)  2. Fast Food style with a modified, sometimes pre-formed, deep-fried tasting crust, less herby but plentiful tomato sauce, lesser quality toppings and an array of cheeses (think anywhere with chain locations).  Pizzaiolo clearly falls into category two. Yet it's different from its counterparts in the same category, (it's better).  I will often stick to pizza from only those places in category one, but some days, like the day I was having last Sunday, only group 2 za will do.  Perhaps it's because I arrived soon after they opened, but the slice-pies were beautifully displayed under glass and it looked like they were each meticulously crafted. All of the toppings were perfectly and evenly spread across each pizza almost as if they were counted per square inch. See the picture of the pepperoni slice I attached. Although their flyer clearly shows a man tossing dough, I'm under the belief that their crusts, at least the common regular crusts, are pre-formed. They were perfectly round and unblemished by char or bubbles. And I LOVE this style of crust. Like I stated earlier, it almost has a deep-fried taste.  Although they had at least 10 different typed of fresh slice-pies to taunt me, I ordered a classic pepperoni and a Godfather slice which is a deep-dish monstrosity housing about 14 types of meat. Both were very tasty and began working their magic on my hangover almost instantly. I could only manage half of each slice. They were big (a quarter of the pizza if I recall correctly). And here's the kicker. Each and every slice under the glass, no matter the toppings, is $3.99. It's kinda hard to beat that!  I'm glad I finally checked into Pizzaiolo. Sometimes you just gotta have that fast-food style of pizza! I'll be back. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good.   Reliable.  Cheap.  Some healthy options. Quick.  I think this is a decent quick pizza joint.  Nothing outstanding but does the job and much better than say a Pizza Pizza.  Every slice I've tried has been pretty decent but I do like the Spinotta and standard Pepperoni.    Hint: I've noticed it's a lot cheaper to buy by the slice as opposed to a whole pie."}
{"text":"I normally really enjoy Pizzaiolo but the slice I had today was super bland.  I had maybe 2 small bites that had sauce on it."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this Pizzaiolo (which will likely be the last time, as my company's moving to a new neighborhood) it was a miserable, rainy day and it seemed like everyone for 10 blocks had ordered in. I got my order, sat down at the bar overlooking the kitchen and just watched the cook work. He was deep in the weeds, with a multi-pie order coming in about once a minute. He was hypnotizing, putting together 3 or 4 at a time, over and over. By the time I'd finished my slice, he'd dug himself out and had the delivery guy going out with more bags than I'd ever seen.  The counter girls are lovely, friendly and super-efficient and the place is kept in good shape despite the sheer number of slovenly customers.  Oh, and the food's great too.  Best pizza place ever.  I'll miss it."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Ordered pizza from them first there was a rude woman who took my order second the delivery guy was rude was refusing to give me the pizza so I could inspect it because past orders were burnt.  NEVER GOING TO ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN !"}
{"text":"The delivery service took 2 hours to arrive, and that was after 3 calls from us wondering where our food was, one of which was them calling back 20 minutes after our initial call asking us to repeat our order. This location is only 10 minutes away too. The only plus side is that their pizza is good."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo was a great discovery after moving to Toronto. I have had pizzaiolo about three times by delivery and once in store.   In store was disappointing, I went around 9pm and the pizza was stale and covered in gross amounts of shaker spices that overwhelmed the slice.   On the other hand, I have LOVED the delivery experience. They are prompt, and I love that I can make my own pizza. I have found a winning combination with original crust, pesto sauce instead of tomato, mushrooms, green olives, red onions, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheese.   For more traditional pizza lovers, my boyfriend loves the Godfather deep dish- but beware, this is not truly a deep dish pizza.. When Pizzaiolo says deep dish, they really mean a thick fluffy crust.   Vegetarians and vegans alike can rejoice with plenty of options for us.. A win win for everyone."}
{"text":"Grand choix de pizzas vendue à la part ou entière. Comptez 38$ pour 2 pizzas larges suffisantes pour rassasier 6 personnes.  Great choice of pizzas sold by the slide or whole. You'll get 2 large pizzas for 38$, enough to satisfy 6 people."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here the other night; it's about a ten minute drive from my AirBnB, so nothing too crazy. Took about an hour to get to my place, which is a little disappointing, but my pizza was hot and the driver was nice.   I ordered a medium \"Canadiana\" pizza. I normally get these toppings, so it sounded pretty good. With tax, delivery fee, and tip, it came out to about $27. I do not think this pizza was worth $27. It was not any better than any normal, big chain restaurant pizza, except with Domino's at least you get a flavorful crust. Major disappointment.   I ate two slices and popped the thing in the fridge. My boss discovered it in the fridge the next day and eagerly heated up a few slices--needless to say, he did not come back to finish the thing off in normal fashion. Verdict: me no likey."}
{"text":"I can't remember how I found out that Pizzaiolo has vegan slices, but i'm going to just project a general thankful vibe out there for the fact! Not just one vegan slice - THREE! Take that and stuff it, Pizza Pizza.  There's a great healthy slice - the Diana (whole wheat, shrooms, spinach et al), a nice tomatoey slice - the Vittoria, and the fiendishly carby and impossible to resist Fredo - potato and rosemary heaven.  Grab a slice and a Brio and get on it, people. While you're there get me a Fredo, eh?"}
{"text":"Of the various locations of Pizzaiolo i've been to downtown, this one has the nicest surrounds and the absolute freshest and most delicious slices. Don't know why this is, but it's a notch above (the already good) rest.  Pro-tip for the one weekend a year that the Toronto Comics Art Festival is on at the Reference Library - this Pizzaiolo is where you want to go for your food breaks, for sure."}
{"text":"I pop in here when I am on my break volunteering at the AGO. It's usually the same guys working and they are really, really friendly and smiley. Other than that -- it's got all the same tasty Pizzaiolo varieties you would find at their other locations! But this one has chandeliers. Note the plural: seriously, there are like 10 chandeliers. Classy!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars - average chain pizza, decent service and late hours.  This location is opened really late. I often end up here well after 1am following a concert at the Toronto Opera House across the street. After a night of music & drinks, pizza hit's the spot nicely.... and it's quick (and cheap).  The main negative here is the selection. Not sure if it's because I tend to be here late in the evening but sometimes they only have 3 maybe 4 Pizza's available by the slice. Compared to other locations, there should be at least 10 choices available. One time they had no Pizza available with any type of meat! Great for veggie lovers but after a night of drinking.... I need some damn meat on my Pizza.  Service is generally quick and efficient. Lot's of seating, I always find a table even when it's busy.   I'm not looking for gourmet food at 2am but a little more variety would be nice. I will certainly be back after my next concert but hoping for some Meat Lovers pizza next time.  BK"}
{"text":"Honestly, great drunk night pizza. HUGE slices that are actually two slices. Sauce is extra which is annoying but I got the cheese and thought it was good."}
{"text":"Had their two topping pick up special today; have been to many pizzaiolos, found this one somewhat light on toppings unfortunately."}
{"text":"One word: disgusting. From the pizza, to the tables. No matter how hungry you are, just starve. It would be better."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  This location is in the entertainment district beside the Town Crier pub - one of my frequent drinking stops. Given it's proximity to all the pubs / bars in the area, it's a good place for a pre, post and / or pub crawl snack. You will see more than a few drunk folks binging on Pizza (makes for good entertainment sometimes).  Staff are always friendly and have patience with people who might have had one-too-many. Lot's of seating and they offer a limited selection of beer for sale.  I enjoy Pizzaiolo in general but this location always has a limited selection and is very stingy on toppings. They are generous with the cheese but your lucky to get more than a single piece of meat on a slice.  In the end, I don't recommend you come to this Pizzaiolo location as a destination, but  it serves a purpose if you need to fuel up during a night on the town.  BK"}
{"text":"Serious FAIL.  Alright here's the situation: 2 friends of mine came over, beer / pizza / move night. Anyhoo, they recommended this company.  So what the heck. for 2 x 12 slices pizzas \"gourmet\" it came out to whopping $63.00. But what the heck, I'm game, maybe it is really better pizza.  So ok fine. We ordered the chicekn pesto one and meat lovers. Order placed at 7:09pm. ...and the clock started. 8:09 rolled around...nothing. First phone call, whilst the chap was very polite and apologetic, noting they were exceptionally busy. Offer to throw in 2 cokes and 2 dips for free. Meh...ok...clock continues ticking.  8:39...no pizza, 2nd phone call: He literally left 8 minutes ago. He should be there any minute. Ok...8:55. Pizza delivered. Tomato sauce slightly too spicey for my liking but that's subjective.  The problem here, is this: Pizza has a very small window from being FRESH, to being VULACANIZED. So in all probability the pizza's sat on the top of oven, for well over 1.25 HRS. Which means, they can continued to cook (although they were trying to keep them warm), because its a heat source.  So what should have been a fresh interesting pizza, turned into rubberized frozen flavored disaster. NO refund was offered. NO time guarantee.  It is in-appropriate to expect someone to pay $68.00 (with tip) for rubberized pizza, and over 1.5 hr delay on a pizza that only takes 20 minutes to prep and cook, and simply say \"we're busy\".  The world is busy, that's not an excuse.    I can't say that I would ever order from these people again."}
{"text":"I generally like Pizzaiolo, but find that the quality varies from pie to pie and from location to location. This one at St Clair was decent and I was starving so I ordered two slices (actually ends up being 4 pieces) from two different pies. Damn you eyes for being bigger than my stomach!"}
{"text":"2 - 2.5 stars from me Good: Potato Pizza, but you need to add some fresh garlic or onions, otherwise it is much much too bland - just potato and a touch of rosemary, with no other seasoning and barely a hint of olive oil.  Meh: Most of the other pizzas, but bonus points for vegan options  Bad: Like, I mean really, really BADD:  The truly horrible Godfather \"Deep Dish\" pizza. This is NOTHING like Chicago pizza, NOTHING, trust me, ignore the other reviewer, I wish I had.   Their 'deep dish' is just a very thick doughy crust with sparse, typical pizza toppings, resulting in a horribly unbalanced, dry, bready doughball.  Trust me, I love real Chicago Deep Dish (Malnati's, Giordano's, Gino's, even Hamilton's C.P.K.) and this ain't even trying to be the same.  I even love sicilian style thick crust pizza, but the crust needs to be a tender foccacia style, not a chewy, doughy mess.   Trust me, just take a pass, and save your money."}
{"text":"Decent chain pizza place near my abode. Had a Soprano (mozzarella, gorgonzola, sin dried tomatoes, and sausage). Also had to have garlic sauce of dipping. Not a lot of ambiance here next to the strip club and very minimal seating, but good for a takeout slice."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees! I came after my psychiatrist appointment, and I was blown away by the quality.  I'm extremely picky when it comes to pizza, and Pizzaiolo always delivers - pun intended!!!! The toppings are fresh, they put just the right amount of cheese, and there is always parmesan in the shaker.  My only regret is not grabbing more. It's a nice little pizza joint, and the people who make it know what they're doing.  It's a great little place to stop for a bite. I look forward to my next few slices this coming wednesday!  5/5! Mmmm Mmmm good.  Other people who rated this place are too fussy."}
{"text":"Horrible! Ordered pizza while staying at the Sheraton hotel. Restaurant is less than half a mile away but the pizza was delivered roughly an hour and a half after ordering. I order drinks with the pizza, which they decided to delete from the order without letting me know. The pizza itself was cold and the crust was like cardboard. For $23.90, I received a cold pizza, which appears to be small even though I ordered a medium. I ordered extra cheese and I'm not even sure the basic amount is on this pizza. I can't even see it! Not sure what the positive reviews are based on but my experience was horrible. Never again. Orderer beware.."}
{"text":"I love pizza, it's my guilty pleasure so I only have it once a month. Today was the special day, despite paying $25 for a pizza it was the worst I've ever had!   How can you make bad pizza?!?.   Dough was undercook, too soft under the toppings. The spinach was undercook as well and the slices of sausage tasted like warmed up hot dog!   The cook kept on opening and peeking into the oven. Don't you have preset times for the pizzas ?!   My once a month pizza binge was wasted! Never again!"}
{"text":"They make gluten free pizza, the doughs are made in house and the sauce is yummy.  Tried soprano and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best pizza I have ever tasted. I haven't been able to get any other kind since trying this one. I had the \"Bomba,\" which is a 4-cheese pizza, and it was absolutely incredible. The pizza is very fresh, and I have never seen so many flavours that you could choose from. There aren't that many locations around compared to other pizza chains, but I hope they expand. This is what pizza should taste like."}
{"text":"I just ordered a pizza and was almost assaulted by their delivery person. Not only did he not come up to my unit, he called me from the lobby and insisted I come down to meet him, he got very rude to me when I left him a $5 tip instead of a $10 tip (my order was $23) He stormed out and slammed the front door of my building. He was also uttering some rude comments as he left.  Seriously this is what I have to deal with??!"}
{"text":"This is the story of how we TRIED to order Pizzaiolo.  We were hungry and thought that ordering from a place close by would be a better option, so having just received Pizzaiolo's flyer in our mailbox, we decided to give it a shot.  We called an ordered 2 medium pizzas and they told us it would be a 45 minute wait. Ok. We can deal with that. When an hour and a half had gone by and no one had come by with our pizzas we were a little frustrated. We called them back and after some confusion, one guy came to the phone and said... well yeah we have your pizzas here, but they're cold.  WTF?  I asked why they were cold and the guy said because we called you to make sure you wanted them and no one picked up. Um... I called YOU to order pizza, why would I NOT want them? When I checked my cell phone later, there was, indeed, a call, but no message. I wouldn't have picked up anyway if it wasn't a number I recognized and I never have my ringer on at home since I can't handle the e-mail alerts early in the am.  Guy: So... do you still want the pizzas? Me: Um... they're cold. Why would I want cold pizza? Guy: Well we can heat them up. Me: Why didn't you just bring the pizza when they were hot so we could have paid you for them and eaten them? Guy: Uh. Well we called you and you didn't answer, so we just thought the call was like, a joke or something. Me: A joke? But you MADE the pizzas. So why would you make them and not deliver them? Guy: Because you didn't pick up. Me: Um... this makes no sense. Guy: Well, do you want the pizzas? Me: Are they free for the inconvenience? Guy: No Me: Um.. no. Can I speak to your manager please Guy: I am the manager  By this time I am hungry and pissed off. My boyfriend is making weird faces and gesturing to me to just hang up. So I did, and we made dinner at home. And ate.    I ended up e-mailing customer service and some guy named Mario, major frustration artist (some businesses hire these people who just basically frustrate the %^&^ out of you until you go away). Mario kept on e-mailing me and reiterating what I said back to him with a question mark. In the end, Mario won. Too much time wasting for me."}
{"text":"Have picked up a slice at many Pizzaiolo locations without any issue. Until today.   Ordered 2 pizza's for our office. Told it would be ready in 25 minutes and when I went to pick them up, they hadn't been made yet. Girl behind the counter blames another employee for it. Strike 1. I wait. When it's ready I'm given 2 dipping sauces to compensate for their error. Strike 2. I take the pizza's up to a hungry boardroom of people who dig in only to barely eat it. Doughy, hardly any sauce, cheese not close to evenly distributed. Clearly they were made in a rush. Everyone was too hungry at this point for me to take the pizzas back. Half eaten slices on everyone's plate all went in the garbage.  After a terrible customer service experience and then awful pizza, I decide to call. Chat with the Manager Alda who explains that this is a small business and they don't do refunds. She would be more than happy to make us 2 new pizza's if we return the others. Well... too late for that. She then goes into a sob story about how all the people at this location work really hard and do the best that they can. It's a small business, she kept repeating.   To Pizzaiolo and Alda, I also work hard. My time is worth more than 2 dipping sauces. The money that I earn is to be spent where my business is valued. It is incorrect that my time and money should be wasted because you don't want to take responsibility for incompetence.  The $40 you would have refunded us (less than 1/2 in actual product cost) will cost you a significant amount in the long run as I have just sent a company wide email with the advice Alda provided. \"You should have ordered from Pizza Pizza'   Thank you Alda, we will most certainly not order from you ever again."}
{"text":"CHAOS AND INCOMPETANCE. I call to make an order by telephone because their crap website won't let me -- I apparently have an account but can't get in -- only to be put on hold... then asked for an address by someone who isn't listening... then asked to be put on hold again... and then I hung up. The people working at this location are idiots.  And so are the people who built their website."}
{"text":"Burnt calzone and requested silverware that we did not get... The delivery guy was nice that's about it."}
{"text":"I have been having pizza delivered for the past 3 years.  Last night's offering arrived 15 minutes late, the time before was half hour and when I rang they had forgotten us! Anyway, last night's Spinnotta arrived cold and dry. If this was the first time I was ordering from them, I wouldn't do it again, but it used to be so very good that I may give it another chance."}
{"text":"Great selection of slices at an expected downtown price. If you order a slice, they stick it in the oven for a little bit before serving it to you, so it's nice and hot when you eat it.   I've tried the Gianni Ola (bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, tomato sauce) and the Bianca (marinated artichokes , feta, garlic, olive oil, oregano, marinated zucchini, mozzarella).   I preferred the Gianni but the Bianca was a nice change of pace, albeit a bit acidic with the marinade. I feel like it could have been more balanced.  There is surprisingly quite a bit of seating for a small place, about 20 or so. I'm not sure if their air conditioning was broken or if this is normal for them, but there was virtually no AC at the front and the back felt cool. So if it's hot in there (which it tends to be), venture to the back.   The dipping sauce was a flop. I got the creamy garlic and it wasn't garlicky at all. The Pizza Pizza and Dominoes garlic dips are far superior - creamier and more garlicky.   Take a look at their menu online for all their options. All their pizzas are nut-free and they have vegetarian AND vegan options too, which is refreshing to see."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this place. For one the service people were some of the most impersonal people I've ever met. And secondly because the pizza was not really that great. I have no inclination to revisit this chain."}
{"text":"I've picked up an order from here before and it's hilarious. There's an impatient crusty guy who barked something at me in Hindi and asks if I understand what he said in English. I wouldn't recommend this location unless you want angry comfort food."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's near my apartment so if I feel like going for a stroll, five minutes and I'm there; if not, I just order one Godfather Pizza by their website. I had their pizzas delivered twice before actually went there to eat in.  As I said, my favourite so far is the Godfather, which contains lots of meats (bacon, sausage, pepperoni). The dough is heavenly good - seriously, it's hard for me to actually enjoy eating the border of the pizza as much as the rest of it - and by tasting the ingredients you know they are of high quality.  I also adore the Bomba, a kind of \"four cheese\" pizza. Delicious gorgonzola. I actually only had these two, and I'm eager to try others (Capone seems great).  If you're eating in, things are really basic, you order the pizza over the counter, pay, sit on the table and eat there. Nothing remotely fancy, recommended just for when you are passing by or if you really don't want to clean dishes or wait for the delivery guy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick slice and a drink. Quick service and good selection of pizza slices. Meat-lover's was very good - plenty of flavor but not greasy. I came during off-peak hours but there looks to be a decent amount of seating for busier times of day."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 times they have NOT had my \"godfather deep dish\" slice. Location is close to work but the staff are not overly friendly or personable. I only go if I'm eating on the run!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza for delivery while staying at the Hyatt.   Had the Godfatherp, it was pretty tasty but the bacon was somewhat scarce.   Delivery was pretty quick.   Would have done more stars but they didn't include a fork for my salad."}
{"text":"This is the first Pizzaiolo I've ever tried and the best (don't ask why!). The pizza is made to perfection and the variety is great! The Asian guy who works there (sorry, don't know his name) is super friendly! The place is my spot. No more pizza pizza or dominos for me!"}
{"text":"I have a permanent grudge against this location and refuse to go to it. I once made a huge order for a party that totalled $117 excluding tip. Upon payment, the delivery person mistyped it as $171, and I stupidly rang it through without double checking and then did a percentage based tip.  Mistake on my part, and as soon as I noticed (about 5 minutes after paying) I walked to the location and tried to resolve this error.   The manager refused to believe my story (even though I had the receipt in my hands) and said that I must've been wrong, that when I ordered everything online that I definitely ordered XL pizzas instead of L pizzas. I brought up my original email confirmation that said my total was $117 with L pizzas and he doubled down and said that when he called to confirm the order that morning, I had changed my mind (????) and wanted to upgrade the sizes of everything. I said fine, if he was so sure that I was the one that changed the order, to show me the total if everything in my order had been upgraded. He did it on the cash register, saw the total (which was well under $171 still) and still tried to argue that this was somehow all my fault.   What was a simple typing error that could've been easily reversed he turned into a 20-minute long screaming and huffing match. I've never felt that disrespected by a service provider before. After much badgering, he still didn't admit fault but said he'd give me a $20 gift card to go away, basically. As another reviewer has said, they're actually so rude that you feel offended, and I'm a pretty chill person. The pizza is tasty, but not worth it."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo is definitely one of my favorite lunch time spots. I've come across a few very dirty and gross Pizzaiolo locations, but this one is one of my go-to's.   Service here is fairly quick during the lunchtime rush, even though there's usually only 2 people working at the front of the store. The slices are always really big and they're super fresh once they've been heated back up. Service is pretty good here and the people are friendly.   Note: Try the Fredo... it's ahhhmazing. Who needs only one serving of carbs when you cane have two in one?! Pizza AND potatoes? Don't mind if I do :) You can also ask to add cheese on it if you need a little something extra to spice it up ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Took a little over half an hour for 4 pizzas. One of the pizzas that was delivered was wrong, and after calling back another delivery person brought the correct pizza on the house.  Despite the cold temperature outside, the pizzas were still fairly warm! Those insulated bags are pretty nice.  We got a Honolulu, a Vittoria, Gianni Ola, and Caponi. Flavours were pretty average, but it wasn't as greasy as some other pizzas. Crust was not too tough and quite easy to chew. Probably cause it's still warm.  Would be curious to see how the pizza shop itself looks like."}
{"text":"***Okay, the fact is this review is more of a 2.5 star review.***  They are on all grounds better and more varied than Pizza Pizza which although not disgusting, let's remember that for all intensive purposes Pizza Pizza is only marginally better than getting some street meat.   This Pizzaiolo's location is just 30 seconds south (if that much) from Yonge and Bloor and as such gets plenty of traffic which guarantees their slices to be fresh and not crusty-old which Pizza Pizza's almost always seem to be. Which is understandable as the nearby PP's main source of income, specially in the evening seems to be its delivery service, not serving fresh slices.  Pizzaiolo gets tons of Friday/Saturday drunken kids so if you trying to catch a bus or live nearby (like me) then expect it to be packed with rambunctious and tipsy UofT students and other late clubbers or bar- hoppers. Expect to seat on the 'bar' near the window unless you get lucky.  Even simple classics like Hawaiian or heavy meat slices are done well and for Canadian standards (as low as they are) are reasonable.   Furthermore some of their more deluxe/gourmet slices seem to be well thought out and again, are more creative than Pizza Pizza's which is reflected on their price. Which again is not saying much when the overall Toronto bar is set so low.   Just remember they might be alright, but you generally go there for the convenience or if you are in a hurry.   True Pizzaphiles go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is relatively large for a pizza joint, with lots of seating - but gets full during lunch hour.  They have a special - any slice + pop for 5.30 plus tax.  I had a slice of pepperoni pizza for 3.99 + tax = 4.19. It was huge, and you could taste the fresh toppings of pepperoni and cheese.  The crust was also crispy, and not bready like Pizza Pizza.  I would definitely come back to try other slices!  This place tends to be empty after 5pm, since everyone has gone home from work."}
{"text":"A pretty good pizza with a light, crispy crust.  I somehow convinced my coworkers to order Pizzaiolo with me, even though they like Panago a lot (what does this say about their tastes? I don't know, but cheeseless Panago is pretty awful). I wanted Pizzaiolo since they carry vegan pizzas and generally, places that have vegan pizzas on the menu will taste better than ones that let cheese do the heavy lifting. The consensus? The vegan pizza was amazing (Diana V) and the other pizza was not. They conceded that the crust was good, but their pizza was bland and the chicken was dry. I found that the vegan pizza was good, but was unevenly salted... some bites would be normal, and some bites would be really salty.   I'd order from these guys again, as I was pretty impressed, but it might be tough to get anyone else in on the order with me.  Delivery charge was $2.50"}
{"text":"Hands down best fast-food pizza around campus. A wide range of selection, perfect place for a quick grab."}
{"text":"ordered the deep dish...more like thick crust. 30 bucks for a pizza and i ended up with a loaf of bread with pizza toppings.. Do not insult my intelligence by bait and switching what you are advertising. Deep Dish and Thick Crust are 2 different things.   HATED EATING THERE!!!   Rude service...believe me ...I am a very generous yelper...i give 4 out of 5 stars everywhere i go....I am willing to compromise a bit of quality if the food is good....but horrible quality and horrible service...so disappointing  P.S- Your time and money means nothing to them. This location will be fine with their walk in clients, and have no concern for people ordering take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"We used to love the pizza from Pizzaiolo on Roncesvalles but the past two times the pizza was disgusting. Not cooked and lacking toppings. We won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Good pizza but some slices definitely came out a bit burnt on the bottom after being reheated."}
{"text":"I love that their pizza crust is thin and crispy! Good flavour and I'd like to try some other flavour in the future!"}
{"text":"Yay for vegan options! Great place to grab a bite to eat after the club. Pizza is made fresh, and you'll always see some interesting customers. Shoutout to chogyal for making bomb pizzas."}
{"text":"Went in at 6PM and asked which pizza is fresh and the guy said all of them were fresh. All of the slices looked old and dry, ended up getting a pepperoni slice and the total came up to $4.80!  The pizza was put in the oven and came out shortly afterwards. It was dry and had no flavour. Will not return to this place ever again."}
{"text":"So I said in my first review of this pizza franchise (of the King St W location) that I'll try the other vegan slices. And I did....  This past Friday, after rehearsal, my salsa partner and I wanted to grab a slice and see if we could make it to salsa dancing in Scaborough after. So we went to this Bloor Street location because it's close to the subway.... but sadly, we didn't make it to Salsa... I was very bummed after pizza. But before a VERY disappointed me, I was very excited to try Pizzaiolo's FREDO... the pizza that consists of thin slices of potato and a bunch of herbs -namely oregano and rosemary. When I first heard of this vegan pizza slice at the King W location (where I tried the whole wheat vegan Diana slice) I thought it was an amazing concept: pizza and chips (or \"fries\" for North Americans)... you can't go wrong with it! 2 for the price of 1. But in reality, the concept wasn't that amazing. It's a starch overdose: yukon potatoes on WHITE crust. My worst nightmare. The herbs really didn't do much for the pizza, it was actually very bland. Good thing the store had hot sauce and bbq sauce, which I used to spice up the boring pizza slice. The potato slices were not crisp like chips (or \"fries\") and I'm not sure if they were supposed to be crisp, but they were soft, like scallop potatoes.   I was disappointed that the Fredo didn't turn out to be as amazing as I thought it would be. It's still a cool concept though. I'll come back to Pizzaiolo for more pizza, I have one more of their vegan slices to try: the Vittoria. I'm sure this one would be as amazing as the Diana. I'll also come back here to try their DESSERT pizza... I asked the cashier who told me that there are 2 dessert pizzas, 1 is with Nutella and the other is with Peanut Butter, but they're both topped with fruit. YUMMY concept... I hope it's a yummy reality too.  One very sad note about this location: they do not have the whole wheat vegan Diana. I'm not sure if they ran out or if they just don't make it at this location, even though they should... it's a franchise after all... and everything should be the same! I really am not a big fan of franchises... the inconsistencies between locations disappoint me most of the time."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN EAT PIZZA IN TORONTO AGAIN!!!!!   Tonight was a crazy night, which consisted of being fitted for a fashion show, rehearsal, make-up and waiting eons backstage for the show to start at a King St. W lounge. Prior to all the madness at the lounge, the models and I took a dinner break near the lounge. We wanted pizza (YES, models eat carbs!) so the majority of us went to Pizza Pizza, which was 2 doors down from the lounge. I decided that I didn't want pizza from the pizza giant, so I asked a model to come with me across the street to Pizzaiolo... a pizza joint that I'd never been to and seemingly better than Pizza Pizza. I was secretly hoping that they might have/ make me a slice of cheeseless pizza (like my beloved 2001 Flavours in VanCity... I MISS YOU BC!).  To my surprise, they have THREE types of vegan, cheeseless pizza:  1. Whole Wheat Diana -mushrooms, spinach, herbed tomatoes, zucchini and olive oil  2. Fredo -yukon gold potatoes, olive oil, fresh rosemary and oregano  3. Vittoria -herbed tomatoes, zucchini, roasted red peppers and their famous Pizzaiolo Sauce  I chose the Diana ($4.19, taxes included) and it was awesome: The whole wheat crust was thin and had a good texture, quantity of the veggies (spinach in particular) was generous, and the quality of the veggies was superb. It was not bad for a re-heated pizza. It's definitely better than Cora's vegan pizza -which until today was my fave place for pizza in Toronto because of its 1 vegan pizza selection.   Although Pizzaiolo has certainly impressed me with having THREE regular vegan pizzas and has made me very happy, reheated pizza slices still does not beat a freshly baked pizza slice, made upon request, with all the veggie toppings I want... all just for me at $1.50. Oh, how I've miss you 2001 Flavours.... the reason why I only eat pizza in Vancouver. I LOVE BC!  **The Cavs were at the lounge I was modeling at tonight. I asked one of them if there was a game tonight and he said no, it's tomorrow. He also said they're gonna beat the Raps! How arrogant! I hope the Raptors school them tomorrow night! GOOOOO Raptors!"}
{"text":"This place is great for when you have a craving for junk food. The prices are pretty good and there's usually no line."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"artichoke\" pizza with chicken on June 21 2011 at 1600hrs.  Spoke to the delivery guy who called me \"sir\" when I'm a \"ma'am\", and basically didn't listen to the order.  Spoke to the pizza maker as well, about putting the artichokes on the pizza in good sized chunks.   I've ordered from the Yonge street locations many times and never had a problem, because they ask questions about the order.  What arrived at my door the first time was a artichoke pizza in red sauce with chicken.  I immediately called and spoke to the the person answering.  He proceeded to argue with me about the order, saying  all kinds of things.  In the end, he delivered the correct pizza - Bianca with chicken.  The guy on the phone happened to be the delivery guy as well.  Again another argument, saying that I didn't order chicken on the pizza, I didn't say Bianca...whatever.  I said I wanted an artichoke pizza on thin crust with chicken.  It was up to him to work out the details, not show up at my house and bring the second pizza and argue with me in front of my house!  The little guy must be the owner of that particular franchise, and English is definitely not his first language.  \"Luigi\" at customer service was of no use when I emailed him abou the complaint.  Too bad, they are not getting our business again."}
{"text":"Large \"Bianca\" thin crust pizza ordered from this location twice (while at work), and each time it was consistently greater than awesome.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Their slice deal isn't bad and depending on your appetite you could eek two lunches out of it.  I usually get the whole wheat meat.  The crust is thin, which is how I prefer my pizza.  Toppings are adequate, the meat tastes a step up from what you get served at pizza pizza.  A reasonably priced lunch option in the area."}
{"text":"Each time we go, there seems to be a problem. I went to buy lunch for my staff on Saturday, the gentleman that was working was making a pizza, so i had to wait until he was done.(which was fine). However most of the pizzas where not in the show cases but on counters everywhere. I ordered 3 slices and asked to have it in a pizza box. He told me it would not fit. I said it would. So he takes three slices and stacks them and shoves them into a small box, the lid could not shut so he squishes the pizzas. what a mess. i love picking my toppings off the bottom of a plate. then when it comes to pay he rings it threw the registrar and says it is $18.05. as i give him cash, i asked for the invoice , then jumped to get the calculator tried to pretend to do some calculations (because he over charged me). it was $15 and change.  so this place rips you off- squishes your pizza and some burns them."}
{"text":"The person who takes the orders is terrible. We repeated our order about 4 times and they still got it wrong. They failed to mention they didn't have the toppings for the particular pizza we ordered and just brought something else which we didn't want. Then when we called them back after they just said we were wrong about it.   Terrible service. No listening skills at all. The pizza was far from good to top it all off."}
{"text":"Our office often orders pizza from here, and its always consistently great, and much better than the standard fare of the big chains.  I was here as a walk-in as Mitzie's next door was closed for the week.  I had the whole wheat meat pizza, and a 600 ml bottle of soda for $7.  The portion size here is huge.  It was about a quarter of a pizza worth of huge.  My son would have been in pizza heaven.  Back to the pizza.  Great crust - thick and perfect, not too soft and not crunchy hard.  It held well in my hand.  The toppings and cheese were generously applied.  I walked out a happy customer, and asking myself, why haven't I been here before after a year of working in the area."}
{"text":"I must say that I have enjoyed the Pizzaiolo experience at many a location and for the most part have been more than satisfied with the quality of food and service. Their baked calzones are second to none and the side of marinara sauce served with them is a nice touch. I have however found that there does seem to be discernible differences between locations. I have found the Toronto St. Location to be about the best and the Annex location to be among the worst. I know that this has to do more with specific franchisees than anything else, but should be noted.   With that said I ventured into the Annex location a few days back to partake in their walk in special, which is an XL with two toppings for $16.99, I like that they can do half and half, so that instead of two set toppings you can try four. I loved the Sopressata which is an Italian cured dry salami and their sausage had the right amount of kick. Yet where they failed miserably was in the dough. I thoroughly enjoy the thin crust that I have associated with the majority of Pizzaiolo's, yet the Annex location was doughy beyond belief. It was almost as if everything I had ever come to know and love about Pizzaiolo didn't apply.  I will give this location another chance as it is right up the street from where I reside, but hope beyond hope that this was a one time flub. Annex redeem yourself, please don't sully the good Pizzaiolo name!"}
{"text":"They're pizza is great, any slice for the same price is a good concept I thoroughly enjoy the Sicilian."}
{"text":"good fluffy crust good topping but they are stingy with them . Can get a slice an a drink for 5.30. Not bad for an on the go slice joint"}
{"text":"I'm in the store alone. Not another soul ordering a pizza slice and they get my order wrong. I order a Hawaiian, and I get a random dry slice. She had one job! It seems as though they are intentionally trying to mess with you for fun. Customer service is horrible and some changes need to be made. Many people seem to have the same experience with her. Next time I won't be so polite.   The slice is a standard slice. I'll eat it."}
{"text":"So I heard that pizzaiolo has vegan pizza, they do, but it was quite disappointing.  It was a late night and i was hungry for a slice. The only vegan option that was available had zucchini and spinach for toppings. Now if you are going to serve vegan pizza then at least put some effort and use mock cheese, or maybe consider more palatable toppings. Regardless, the crust was not up to par.  But it's not like I had better options. I guess vegans can't be choosers."}
{"text":"My last night in Toronto and I just wanted something greasy and I got what I wanted. Don't get me wrong, some of the fancier pizza places around town are great, but I just wanted something that felt closer to home.  This place seems like a great after work/before bar or in between bars place for a quick slice.   Overall, the food was pretty good. Not out of this world, but I've had much worse. It got the job done.  Lot of toppings, came out hot. Wasn't much to the sauce, though."}
{"text":"Mmm..I love pizzaiolo! Its my go-to for a cheap lunch and their pizza always seem a bit healthier than pizza hut or pizza pizza. Its not as salty or oily and the crust is always soft and crispy. Definitely a fan but I hope they open more restaurants outside of downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas here tonight and got one and waited patiently for an hour for our second one.  Went up to ask what's up and they said nope, we only remember you ordering one and refused to give us our order.  We showed them our receipt and they refused to look at it, and we asked them to look it up on their POS and they also refused to.  It's unacceptable that they can refuse a pizza that we paid and still have the receipt for!  We stood our ground and eventually they gave us our pizza but REFUSED to cut it (how could we eat it?!).  They were clearly too stubborn to admit making a mistake and ended up purposely giving us a hard time.  Simple solution would have been to just look up the order and realize their mistake, but they couldn't do it.  Would NOT come here again."}
{"text":"We've ordered online for pickup a few times for a group of friends, and the pizza has been consistently good. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice pizza spot on Church Street that offers a variety of pizza options, especially those who are health conscious (wheat pizza). Nice dining area and ideal location adds points to the rating. Prices tend to be a bit more than other rivals in the area, but the quality of the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been ordering The Godfather once a week for a while now. Consistently awesome. It's labelled as deep dish, but it's more of a thick crust pie rather than Chicago style. Quick, friendly delivery."}
{"text":"New to this fast food strip, Pizzaiolo is an easy contender for best slice in the area. It's cleaner and bigger than the other pizza joints and for some reason has a lot of chandeliers making it slightly classier.  They've got a lot of vegan and vegetarian pizzas to choose from. They are also very good about using different slicers for vegan, vegetarian, fish and meat. This means no cross-contamination. At just over $4 for a slice it's an convenient choice for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Decided to try Pizzaolio (gourmet pizza) for lunch. The dough was burnt and yet raw, it was really saucy (even though I ordered it light), there was barely any cheese (after I paid 2$ for extra cheese). So for 25$, I got pizza worse than a 9.99 pizza pizza gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"$6 for a slice and a drink!  How can you possibly beat that?  The slices are HUGE!!!  And there are a dozen pizzas to choose from.  This is a perfect place for a quick cheap lunch.  There's also seating inside or on their patio."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza here. The slices seemed decently priced, and were better than Pizza Pizza, which has the tendency to taste like cardboard at times. The people were nice enough, and they had a good selection of different types of slices. The topics were intriguing, I have had better, but this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Nice, cheap pizza place. Pizza was hot with a nice crispy crust and fresh toppings. Only four stars because I'd like my pizza with more sauce and cheese so it doesn't taste dry. Overall a great lunch stop."}
{"text":"This is by far the best chain pizza for me.   The only reason I am giving it 4 insteda of 5 stars was a recent take out order which was worse than the usual slice I get. I purchased a medium pizza Sophia (what would be a Margherita in most pizza places - so cheese only). The pizza was more doughy and a bit drier that the slice version but it was still very good."}
{"text":"Pretty forgettable as far as pizza is concerned. I've had pizzas from a lot of behind the glass places in a lot of cities and the freshness and quality here is just not up to par. Pizza always seems to be hours out of the oven by the time it gets to me. This place could really benefit from having a better idea of what to make and went to make it. Too much cheese, not enough sauce, practically a cheese bread more often than not."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for a going away party from this place.  They delivered within 30 minutes (which shouldn't be hard considering our office is a 5 minute walk away), and ordered some party pizzas.  They are much better than Pizza Pizza.  Not salty and the crust doesn't feel doughy.  I really liked their veggie and chicken pizza, which had some kind of basil and pesto.    At this point, probably my fave pizza joint in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I walked in and stood at the cash for a minute or two while the employee didn't acknowledge me and continued on his phone call. I was the only one in the store. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I thought this was bland and flavorless, and that was the spicy pizza.  The slices are big though, so if you are looking to load up on empty carbs for a reasonable price, this place would be ok."}
{"text":"Great pizza with lots of fresh toppings to choose from.  Buy by the slice or get a whole pie.  Reasonably priced.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The best pizza. Thin crust, succulent, fresh - and the variety of vegatarian options are huge, far beyond standard green pepper-mushrooms- tons of cheese version that I had to eat at other places. Staff is very friendly and customer oriented.  This pizza is better than the ones you can order in the restaurants.. Most restaurants. I can recall only one that was comparable or better."}
{"text":"Good pizza not too oily. Good crust. Lots of choices. I love the pizza with potatoes.   It's one pizza that I love the most other than pizza hut."}
{"text":"They bill themselves as a gourmet Pizza place.  Not quite there, but they are \"gourmet\" compared to Pizza Pizza.  I went there for lunch on a weekday. For 4$ you get a decent sized slice of your choosing. They had about 10 different pizzas. I had some fancy veggie pizza and I it was delish.  It's just down the street from my work, so I will probably go back once every so often."}
{"text":"Got pizza from here for work. It was ok but not stellar. There was nothing resembling crispness to be found. It was quite soggy. There were abundant toppings. The one covered in meat tasted nice. The one covered in veggies wasn't as nice. There was too much spinach (spinach is really watery, never understood why people put it on pizza) and the green pepper pieces were gigantic (overpowering in my opinion). I found the pizza to be no better than the budget place around the corner from my apartment and the Pizzaiolo prices were double. I'd fully support the place if they lost the wannabe gourmet image and adopted lower prices, but in the meantime I won't rush back."}
{"text":"There are many places you can go to get pizza in this town, this place shouldn't be one of them.  Got a pizza for delivery (the driver was great) and it was burnt and greasy as hell...two absolute sins. What were they thinking when they sent this to me?! If you make a mistake and it comes out of the oven burnt, junk it and make another one! You are in the service industry, I shouldn't have to say this...but I guess I have to since they clearly don't care about your product or your customers. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago: I ordered a large pizza, Meat-lover, online with slight modification in the ingredients (Italian spicy sausage, regular sausage, pepperoni, and bacon).  I arrived at the establishment, the pizza was ready.  I checked the pizza to see whether I have the right pizza, to my surprise, I only saw two toppings on it: pepperoni and regular sausage.  I told that to who I think is the franchize owner, the older Italian looking guy.  Not only he didn't apologize for not having fulfilled his end of the transaction, he argued that I should pay for the 3-topping pizza.  The reason being the Spicy Italian Sausage and Regular Sausage are the same (the exact line of his argument: they all look the same).  No they don't: the Italian sausage looks thinner and longer whereas the regular sausage are the round ones (at least for the ones they use).  I didn't see the point in arguing and just paid for my \"3-toppings\" pizza and went on my way, vowing never to go back again."}
{"text":"The place is open late.  There is great variety as far as slices are concerned.  The restaurant is clean.  The pizza's pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Wanting a slice and the near by descendants pizza closed 1 hr early(?) so I came in. Very prompt friendly service AND they have scratch made sauce and dough. A bonus was they have fresh veggies including broccoli!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza chain in Toronto (and now the GTA). It's locally owned and their pizza crust and tomato sauce cannot be beat. A slice with a drink costs about $6 and the slice is a generous one. My favourites include the Gianni Ola and the Godfather (a deep-dish crust) but I have a few other go-to choices that I can't immediately remember. We just need a location in York Region and my life would be complete :)"}
{"text":"This was my favourite pizza place until a couple of months ago. The pizza used to be so high quality, and perfectly baked. But lately it has become hard, dry, overdone, and not worth twice the price of the other pizza chains. I don't know if it's just this location - I did notice entirely new staff as of late."}
{"text":"I I believe this branch opened just recently in August 2011. Similar to other Pizzaiolo, it has the variety of pizzas ready to go, I usually get the margharita which is quite good and they always warm it up for you. The typical combo is a slice and a pizza for $5 if I'm not mistaken.   It has a fair amount of seating and people usually eat quick so there's not much waiting.   I don't have any complaints but it's not Terroni/Buca pizza so it gets a 3 star A-ok.   Also there's a Goodlife and Moores in the same building if you needed to visit these 2 establishments as well."}
{"text":"I generally like the pizzas from Pizzaiolo and this store is no excepton. I must give it only 2 stars, though, due to the lack of disclosure of the new debit policy and the debit policy in general. AFTER ordering one slice for $4.25, and with no notice indicating otherwise, I was informed that I had to pay an extra 25cents for all debits under $5. I feel that's a ripoff. Remember that although many of the slices are healthy this is still a fast food restaurant and debit purchases should be expected. I've come here often and certanly given them my fair share of business. i just won't pay an extra 25cents for the privilege of using my bank card, ESPECIALLY when there was no notice on this. On the contrary, this storefront now has large signage on its doors advertising that they take Interac, as if that's such a huge deal."}
{"text":"given the option of Pizza Pizza or this place down the street, this place wins on crust alone if looking for a lunchtime slice.   $4.19 for a slice after tax if bought on its own."}
{"text":"I have been always a big fan of their pizza and plan to have a slice whenever close to one of their locations, I never ordered delivery before though and I wish I never did. Last night I had a guest and we planed on ordering a pizza. Sadly I decided to order from here instead of sticking to the usual place I use. The pizza arrived an hour after my order , knowing this location is maximum  6mins walk from my house. The house salad was literally iceberg lettuce , one slice of onion and 2 cherry tomatoes THATS IT. The big disappointment was the pizza. It was cold and not cold as in got cold from the time it came out of the oven to my house. It was cold when it left the store and been cold for a while, I can tell from the crust texture , the box humidity and the taste of the ingredients that were barely visible. all in all my experience with this delivery order was the ultimate disaster. and for the price of a salad and pizza I could have had an acceptable dinner in a restaurant. Almost $32.00 a small salad and a large pizza with 3 toppings from here is simply an insult to my intelligence"}
{"text":"I'm torn on Pizzaiolo (or, more particular, this Pizzaiolo).   It's good pizza.  The crust is very good, bordering on greatness.  The pie itself is well put together with plenty of toppings scattered with skill and attention to the \"perfect bite\", if you know what I mean.    They market it as gourmet.  Is it?  No.  It's better than most corner pizzerias., but it's far from gourmet.  The sauce is mediocre and sparse (I didn't taste it at all, honestly).  The cheese isn't a drawback per se, stringy and gooey, sure, but it lacks any real character beyond \"huh, well, that's cheese... I guess\".  I admit that I did genuinely enjoy my slices.  Probably 3.5 star considering the generally poor quality of pizza in TO.  So what's the problem?  Price.  The 'za isn't noticeably better than, say, Pizza Pizza (considerably better crust, inferior cheese and sauce).  I can't say the toppings are superior -- in fact, the broccoli tasted distinctly like frozen florets, though I'm probably wrong on that count.  There are fewer topping choices.  So that brings us back to the price, which is significantly more, and that's a deal breaker.  Would I order from them again?  Hm.  Maybe.  Not likely, however, given the other options available.  Which is a pity, 'cuz that crust is pretty excellent!  Hours of Operation: Monday to Thursday, 10am - 10pm  Friday to Sunday, 10am - 11pm"}
{"text":"What can I say?  Honest pizza store, well made pizza, tasted great.    Prices were slightly expensive, but what can you do, it's Toronto.  Had the Honolulu(Hawaiian counterpart... is that term copyrighted?) Was delicious.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm not proud to be an American. Restaurants like Pizzaiolo, however, remind me that my country isn't all bad.  The website says this location closes at 11 PM daily. We walked in at 9:25 and were informed that we were too late to order a custom pizza and would have to choose from the stale- and dry-looking pre-made slices at the counter. Turns out they actually close at 10 on Sundays. Maybe it's a San Francisco thing, but in my experience \"gourmet\" restaurants generally keep serving all menu options until they close. If, for some reason, a \"gourmet\" restaurant were to refuse to serve the majority of their food 35 minutes before closing (and over an hour and a half before their website says they close), I would expect, at the very least, an apology. I would also expect a \"gourmet\" restaurant to be more concerned with customer service than with avoiding throwing away a few stale slices at the end of the night. Pizzaiolo's staff evidently disagrees with this perspective.   We ordered three slices: the bianca, the primavera, and something with bacon, onions, and sausage. Supposedly the bianca had garlic on it; I would never have guessed so. The primavera was bland at best. The third slice was almost edible. As my friend pointed out, bacon tends to have that effect.  If, for some reason, you want to go here, the closing hours are (currently) as follows: 10 PM on Sunday and Monday, 11 PM on Tuesday through Thursday, and 3 AM on Friday and Saturday. Don't trust the take-out menu at the counter; it also claims the restaurant is open until 11 PM daily. Also, keep in mind that they are apparently unable to make a pizza in under 35 minutes.  Pizzaiolo staff: seriously, guys. It's 2010. Update your website."}
{"text":"Completely lost our order. Paid for a pizza and they argued that we did not even order the pizza; would not even look it up on the POS system to confirm the order. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"I had recently had Pizzaiolo pizza from a different location and was very impressed so I ordered a pizza online from this location and it was delivered within half an hour. The thin crust pizza was amazing, and I'm glad to see they offer both vegetarian and vegan options! The only down-side is their charging per topping in the make-your-own feature; even the basic toppings like peppers and mushrooms were an extra fee. Regardless, I'll definitely be ordering again to try different kinds because it was so good!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times when it's best you don't watch people make your pizza... Especially after the guy just took money from you! I say this because the pizza is pretty decent, but it's nothing I'd write home about!   Interesting enough, the pizza at their downtown location is much better!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker born and bred (with some \"Joisey\" thrown in), I have a very difficult time finding bagels and pizza worth eating, but Pizzaiolo is pretty good for the pizza.  At first I was surprised at how expensive one slice was, but then I found out they are really giving you 2 slices and calling it one. I have no idea how this got started, but it can be annoying. Can I order 1/2 a slice? Sometimes that's all I want! When I lived in NYC, sometimes I would order two slices - two different kinds - and I miss that flexibility. Here, if I were to order two slices for the variety, I would get entirely too much food and pay $10 for the pleasure.  So, while I like the pizza here, I need someone to share it with, so we can each have 2 different slices, but call it 1 slice. Are you still with me?  They have a lot of varieties, unfortunately, as I went there alone, I was only able to try one. It was called Soprano and had some sopressata and some gorgonzola cheese. A lot of their pizzas are named after Italian icons (The Godfather, Capone, etc). They had about 15 different types available today at lunch, including some without tomato sauce, whole wheat crust, etc.  This location of Pizzaiolo is pretty nice compared to most pizza places. It is quite big and there are lots of seats in the back, with big comfy chairs."}
{"text":"I  so mad right now. I ordered pizza 1.5 hours ago and called to find out where it was. They told me they did not make it! They said the could not find my phone number and that is why they did not call to say they were not going to make it, apparently we were too far, but we are only a few blocks away. I have no idea how a business can run like this. Unacceptable! All pizzaiolo restaurants seem to be poorly run and this was the last straw. Do not call here for delivery, you may not get a pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, burned and late. Terrible customer service, and has not shown up a couple times. Do not order here."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza and sometimes they don't even deliver the pizza when they say they do. Often times the pizza is done wrong, or soggy. This is the worst pizza place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I live about 1km away from this place yet it took over 1hr on a Sunday afternoon to get my pie, which cost $29 for a 3-topping large.  The pie was lukewarm and tasted bland. The crust was slightly undercooked, dry and tasted bland due to the lack of sauce and skimpy on the cheese.  The pie place is run by Indians...that figures.  It's a rip off and I think I am going to stick with Pizza Nova as far as chain pizzas are concerned.  It's unfortunate that I live in an area where there aren't any old school pizzerias and I am left with the horrors of mediocre chain pizzas."}
{"text":"Better than some pizza places such as pizza pizza or domino's but not as good as all of them. The thing is your paying more than all of them. toppings are great but pricey. I can think of 3 or 4 pizza chains that I prefer that are a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"You'd think pizza that came from a chain restaurant wouldn't be that good, but Pizzaiolo proves that's not always true. The pizza from this place is yummy, offering vegetarian, vegan and meat-lover options. Slices are generously sized, and around $4 each.  As a vegetarian, I order the vegetarian slices, which are topped with lots of vegetables, sauce, and cheese. The crust is chewy and nicely flavoured, but can be a bit greasy. The vegan slices, which don't have any vegan cheese on them, prove that you don't always need to have cheese on your pizza for it to taste delicious.The slices I recommend are:  1. Vittoria: tomatoes, roasted red peppers, zucchini  2.Whole Wheat Veggie: tomatoes, mushrooms, roasted red peppers  3. Primavera: tomatoes, roasted red peppers, grilled zucchini, olive oil parmigiano, mozzarella, oregano  4. Spinotta: spinach, tomatoes, ricotta, mozzarella, parmigiano, olive oil, oregano  In terms of atmosphere, I haven't been impressed with this location or other locations I've been to. I never feel welcomed when I visit here. The pizza wins over the people though, so I'll be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"I've really never understood why people are always raving about Pizzaiolo...every location is pretty much the same but that's not necessarily a good thing. No matter what I order, it always takes longer than it should and the pizza itself is always highly disappointing and ridiculously overpriced. At over fifty bucks for two large pizzas (four toppings each) I can go to pretty much any other chain and get better 'za for less. Or spend about the same at an independent joint and again, get better pizza.   So why do I keep coming back? The fact that they have gluten and dairy free pizza for my wife who has trouble with both. However, Pizza Nova now has the same options and their pizzas (both regular and fake cheese / gluten free) are considerably tastier and about ten bucks less. No Pizza Nova in this area (that I know of) but if I we can help it, we're really going to avoid Pizzaiolo in the future from now on."}
{"text":"It's not bad and probably deserves a borderline three stars rather than two but I'm going to knock it down for a few reasons. But I should probably back up and start at the beginning.  Pizzaiolo is one of those smaller chain places (about 25 locations in the GTA) that purports to be a \"premium\" or \"gourmet\" pizza parlour, basically so they can charge you more. Sure they offer a greater selection of cheeses and toppings than most places but then again so does Pizza Pizza. More options does not necessarily gourmet make.   The pizza itself is pretty tasty, quality dough (something that is often of overlooked importance) and the extensive toppings are uniformly good. Still, it does sometimes come out tasting a little cardboard-like, which is odd considering the fact that the dough really does appear to be of high quality. Something in the way it's cooked, the ovens? I don't know.  Anyways it's not awful by any stretch but when you're looking at twenty bucks for a three topping large then it does get to be a bit striking. I'd also avoid the deep dish...instead of being light, fluffy and buttery it just tastes like there's too much crust. AND it adds another $2.00 onto the price!  The folks at this particular location are quite friendly but on at least a couple of occasions I've ordered, been told that it would be twenty five minutes and was standing there looking at my watch forty minutes later. Not cool. If it's going to be forty minutes (for pick up no less) tell me it's going to be forty minutes. Don't make me stand around and wait. On the upside they were nice enough to give me free dipping sauce and the last couple of times this has been less of an issue so perhaps they've gotten their act together.   So I guess I'm docking them for the price / value and the timing issues. But even if I did give them three stars, why do I keep going back in spite of all the other chain and independent options in the area? It's the only take-out pizza that my fiancée can eat. They have a gluten free crust with fake cheese (Daiya) option. So if you or a loved one has both gluten and dairy sensitivities, it's one of your few options. She gets to have take-out pizza and I'm just sort of along for the ride."}
{"text":"We preferred this over dominos/pizza pizza exc, nice to be able to just get a slice too lots of variety. Vegan pizza slice was also good even though it looks a little different."}
{"text":"Quick service and lots of variety! Grabbed lunch their quickly when I was Downtown and saw tons of slices available, of all kinds! Got the Godfather! Giant slice worth 2 meals! Lots of toppings and tasted amazing! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Tried the on-line delivery service, all was clear, precise and as advertised. Pizza was excellent. Great dough, sauce and generous on the toppings. Freindly, polite service to boot."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo has really good pizza at a really low cost! They always have great grab and go slices available as well as full size pizzas read to be bought. Their delivery service is great and fast as well. I frequent Pizzaiolo for their fast service, good prices, and delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Pizzaiolo location in Toronto by far. I have tried 4 other locations and for some reason the pizza in this location just tastes the best! The pepperoni is crispy and has just the right amount of flavor too it. They do not go overboard with the sauce which I have found problematic at other Pizzaiolo locations. The service is quick and efficient seeing as they do get busy for the lunch rush in the downtown core.   I commend the workers there for all their hard work and speedy service. I will always choose this Pizzaiolo location for Pizza."}
{"text":"A great pizza requires 2 important things.  1. Great ingredients and recipe 2. A love of pizza making. The guys who work here clearly do not care about making pizza and just try to get the job done. I ordered a pizza that looked butchered. Some slices did not even have any cheese in them. I love pizziaolo but the people working at this location just do not put any passion or care in pizza making."}
{"text":"These guys are new to the area so it's nice to have another option for pizza. Great pizza!!! Great service!! Been there 3 times and Every single time it's the same two guys working. Always nice and engaging in conversation I get the pick up special with two toppings. I rather pay extra for a quality pizza than settle for pizza pizza  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It was one of a handful of places that was open at 8pm on a Sunday evening, so I figured I would give it a try.  The place was well lit and felt clean, but it was a pretty boring interior.   They had a variety of pizzas displayed which you could choose from, with each \"slice\" being equivalent to 1/4 of a large pizza.  Once you choose your slice, they throw it back in the oven to re-heat and will slice it into two before handing to you.  I was disappointed that they didn't have a fountain drink option, but instead had a more expensive option of having bottled drinks.  Overall the pizza was OK, service was good, and the place was clean.  It will not be my new favorite pizza place, but I would eat there again."}
{"text":"After seeing this place everywhere around DT toronto, I decided to finally try it for once, and I ended up trying it a lot more afterwards. They had a walk in deal for a $16 extra large pizza with two topping. The crust is made really well and it was great! Wins best fast-food pizza I've ever had. The XL is good for a small party of 4 or 3 if you're hungry. You can taste the difference of pizzaiolo against pizza pizza or pizza nova."}
{"text":"I am not the kind of guy who goes around reviewing pizza places and I only bought a slice, but seriously this place sucks.  I was scouting around for a decent pizza place for a friend.  She is having a Pizza Wedding and needed to arrange about 40 or so pizzas. (if you have not heard of this sort of wedding, you will, it is becoming popular) anyway walked in and was bashed well not bashed but I might as well be, with tons of bad attitude.  The guy ( young good looking) behind the counter was ridiculously rude.  I order a slice to go.  He took my money and threw the change into my hand, did not say thank you or even look at me and handed me the bag with the pizza in it.  Left the store opened the bag and the pizza was burned a lovely shade of charcoal black.  At least it was crispy.    Gawwd what a crappy experience. Oh the sign near the door reads, \"our aim is to create happy customers\". Well good luck with that.  I was in a good mood when I arrived but after I left I was pissed off.  As for the wedding, this place is a definite NO WAY."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, good price, good service, countless combinations. Not going to blow you away but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite if you're craving pizza"}
{"text":"Between the great crust and ingredients they use Pizzaiolo is definitely my favorite pizza place.  I haven't gone back to the other chains ever since I tried Pizzaiolo's pizza last year."}
{"text":"When at the end of a long walk or not wanting to cook on a Saturday (like today), based on price and quality Pizzaiolo is my go to place.   I've been to a few different locations after long walks but Trinity Bellwoods and the one at 1 Toronto Street seem to be most consistent for fresh and flavorful ingredients and attentive staff.   Yeah, I know it's only a \"pizza place\" but all of that matters to me. By the slice or by the pie, I find the price point great for budget conscious folks like myself. And the quality consistently very high.   My favorite is the \"Casino\" minus the roasted red peppers. My 2nd favorite is the \"Bianca\", my 3rd is the \"Spinotta\". My friend swears by the \"Thai Pie\"... Enjoy"}
{"text":"Looking at the sign and saying the name out loud to myself, the first thing I imagined was a fairly priced pizza place that uses good ingredients, similar to Pizza Nova. Usually when I try something new I go into it with no expectations, and this place is no different.  Upon entering the establishment, It was a quiet little pizza joint that had me feeling as though I was in a pizza shop somewhere in New York. The gentleman who greeted us was very kind, and everything from the way the pizzas were laid out in a colorful array to the variety of smells coming off of each pizza, I was taken in by this pizza place.   Before falling too hard for the Honeymoon phase of any great love, I made sure to remember why I was here, which was for an enjoyable lunch, and to experience my first dining out lunch while at my first official job. I ordered 2 slices of their fresh out of the oven \"Canadian\" Pizza and 1 canned drink. The total came up to $7. For me to tell you that this isn't a great deal would be a flat out lie, because you must see it to believe just how good the quantity you're getting really is.   As for the actual taste of the pizza, which is what you've been waiting for, is fantastic. Now, I'm not a food \"fanatic\" that knows exactly how to describe what I eat to the best of my abilities, but I'll try. Starting with the pizza crust, being that it's something I find most important about any pizza. It is thick, but what you'll notice upon chewing is that it isn't dense. The crust is light, but filling. Such a contradiction that just finds a way to work. Next on to the toppings, which for the \"Canadian\" pizza were the typical Pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers. The toppings tasted great, no cheap tasting, hard to bite into pepperonis that one might get at somewhere like Pizza Pizza. The veggies were just alike, and cut to a reasonable size that doesn't dominate the pizza's surface area and make you forget about the cheese and wonderfully not too acidic sauce that's underneath. If I haven't already made you want to try this Pizza after reading this, please do yourself and your co-workers a favor and try this place.  Also, the inclusion of Olive oil as a free topping is a must have to fully enjoy the pizza, at as my own personal preference and recommendation.   If you couldn't already tell from reading the above, this place is great and has already made a regular out of myself. Hopefully you also enjoy it after giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Open until 4am on Saturday nights.  Went in last night at 3:20am and they didn't have any pizza left but they refused to make anymore.  What's the point of being open until 4am if you don't have any product to sell.  I understand wanting to stop cooking early in order to clean up, but 40 minutes early seems a little bit excessive.  My friends and I left without food, and there were more people coming in as we were leaving who would have left without food. I can only imagine how much was lost in sales during those 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I find Pizzaiolo's pizza to be the best of the chain pizza. It hardly ranks as a chain, from what I can tell, with only a few locations, and the pizza isn't quite uniform as far as I can see. The pizza at this location is delicious, so superior to Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova, and there's a wide variety. The slices are large and I often overindulge and get a second slice and regret it afterwards. The seating is sample and there's a TV in the back so if you're alone you can watch the CP24 news ticker."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery across the street and they were late. Pizza tasted slightly better than pizza pizza, but not great. Hawaiian pizza was very weird had no bacon on it just pineapple and red peppers."}
{"text":"this place blows chunks.  the pizza was quite tasty and for that i feel it deserves the star it gets.  if you had asked me how many stars id give after the first time i ordered from them, i would have given it 3 stars.  when the next 2 times confirmed that this place is run by a group of lackadaisical stoners i was forced to give the the sole star and they stole that from me.  it was coerced from me.  i made it up your honour because of the torture so i could survive.  right.  well to clarify, if it takes you an hour and a half to make and deliver a pizza youve got a major kink in your business.  if you cannot even guarantee the pizza will arrive in that time then im baffled you continue to have electricity to operate your ovens.  go get a coach and start winning games for gods sake."}
{"text":"Decent place. Thin pizza crust with interesting toppings.  Not my fav, but good in a pinch.  Good service at this location gets an extra star.  Like the slice and drink combo."}
{"text":"Decent enough place to get some exotic slices before, say, going to a film at the Varsity. Nice to sit along the window counter and people watch. Unlike some slice places, they always have a good variety of slices ready and waiting."}
{"text":"Good selection of pizzas. Similar to pizza pizza locations where you can pick up a drink and big slice (2 slices) for $6."}
{"text":"I have had the toughest time finding a good slice that didn`t look like it had been sitting there for hours.  I have tried to avoid the chains in the city but sometimes when you want a slice o`pie - it`s an easy choice.  There seems to be something odd here in Toronto. The rockies, the prairies and some land stand in the way between here and Vancouver.  What happened to the pizza world out here?  Oh, how i miss the crazy varieties available out west.  The potatoe pizza trend is not really out here except at this fine establishment.  i wanted to try it but their version looks more like potatoe chips on a pizza not as appetizing.  This place does offers a world of variety. Point for them!  You pay 4.19 a slice for your selection. Not bad except you are paying for two slices and that accounts for the price.  I had to take my other half home.  It tasted like it was freshly made. Mmmmmmmmmm!  The bread reminded me of freshly baked bread. Perhaps it`s because I came at around 6pm.    I would definitely go back again, the only thing I wish is that I could just order a regular size pie piece."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Pizzaiolo since I first saw it appear at Yonge and Sheppard. Sure there are already a dozen pizza joints in the area but none which are amazing. After failing to find somewhere to go, it was time to order a pizza and try this place once and for all!  I ordered the pizza ahead of time and went to pick it up, the store is very clean and offered a good variety of slices. However I do not think they were very fresh, looked as though they had been sitting there all day. It was Saturday, I do not think there is a huge demand for slices as there is throughout the week.  I have to say this pizza was pretty darn good, there was a ton of cheese, without having to ask them to make sure there is cheese like some Pizza Pizza locations which I have stopped going to because they seem to hoard the cheese!   The toppings were very fresh and tasty, you could actually taste the different flavors in the veggies!   Just thinking about it makes me want to have a piece to munch on while writing this review!   My only question is... what is up with all those chandlers ?   Until next time Pizzaiolo!"}
{"text":"This is currently my favourite \"corporate\" pizza place.  Love the crust and I love the price. But beware!  If you're picking up your pizza it will be ready earlier than they predict,  so just order it, then immediately go pick it up."}
{"text":"Not going to eat here again just saw the cook went for a smoke came back in without washing her hands and coughed at her hands and made a pizza ... wtf that's gross..."}
{"text":"My fav neighborhood pizza joint. Doesn't taste mass produced, and not as greasy. The slices are beastly large."}
{"text":"What can really be said about a chain pizza establishment thats not Pizza Pizza? Well, it's certainly better then Dominoes or Papa Johns thats for sure! I ended up stopping here before a Blue Jay's game since I would much rather then 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $5 instead of a bottle of water for $6. The place itself was small but had some benches and seating was available outside. The pizza I got was bigger then expected and tasted pretty good for what it was. Overall, you know what you are getting when you walk into a Pizzaiolo location and it does the trick. I would come back for some quick slices in the future!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this pizzaiolo. I came here late at night so I guess you would not expect much but they only had one type of pizza at that time and it was old and not fresh at all. The place is small and it just for a quick to grab a bite. I would not suggest this place as i have better pizzaiolo from other once."}
{"text":"pizzaiolo has the best (not fast food tasting?) pizza of any of the pizza chains. Their sauce, cheese and bread is all of much higher quality than the other chains. They are more expensive but the price is worth it.  whatever my toppings it tastes like actual food and can make a (sort of bullshit, still nice) romantic dinner if you get a pizza and a nice bottle of wine.   This is what I do for my romantic dinner when I have my anniversary getaway at the westin (3 topping large pizza 23$, hard to beat when it costs that much for a yogurt at the hotel)  This goes for all locations, I think this is the one I order from when I stay at the westin.  They also have amazing customer service that is consistent at all locations.  Without a doubt this is the best pizza chain."}
{"text":"I am not one for fancy, thin crust, pizza-with-toppings-that-have-no-business-on-a-pizza-snow-peas-are-you-kidding-me pizza.  I like a nice crust, a decent amount of cheese, and ingredients that you should be able to find in Italy.  Not a huge fan of conglomerate pizza, I try to find either smaller chains or completely independent pizza places.  Pretty much in all cases I try to support smaller local business where I can.  With that in mind, Pizzaiolo as a small franchise with restaurants that take on a local flavour that hits the bill.  There have been smaller pizzerias in the various neighbourhoods I've lived in that I've come to enjoy and frequent and always feel horrible when I leave them.  Moving out of a local favourite's delivery radius feels like packing up and moving to a foreign country where you don't fully understand what people are saying to you and you have no idea whose number to call for a decent pizza.  I've tried some of the others in the neighbourhood and this particular Pizzaiolo makes it work for me.  It is Queen West, remember that as you walk in.  It's very basic in terms of its décor and fixtures.  But don't be fooled.  This is worth the walk or call in.  The kitchen is open allowing you to watch all the orders going in and out.  There's also a full glass counter with about a dozen or so different types of pizza to choose from.  A few even offer a whole-wheat crust option for a layer of health underneath the cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and bacon.  Hey, it's what makes a slice tasty, innit?"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and Was not happy about this place what so ever. I really thought it would be much better. I got the Mediterranean slice with a garlic dip which came out to about $4.85. First of all, the slice display box they had was no clean and they're were so many fruit flies flying around inside and out of the box. The guy before me literally walked in and walked right out after seeing the slice selection where there were only about 4 slices left in the box. I thought there would be more esp around 7pm. Secondly, the temperature at which I got the pizza was just slightly warm, it was like putting the cold slice in the microwave for 20 seconds and taking it out. I wish it was kept in there for longer so it seemed fresher. Thirdly, I felt like there was not enough tomato sauce cause I mostly tasted the actual bread/crust. Lastly, the tomatoes in the pizza WERE SO SOGGY. I could tell the difference cause pizza pizza's tomatoes do not taste like that. The tomato literally crumbled into pieces and half of my slice barely had toppings. This place seems like it has a lot of potential and maybe I should order a pizza instead of getting a slice but I hope they do better with their slices as well as their environment. Nonetheless, The workers were so nice and friendly. Great service."}
{"text":"Aside from the miserly offering of ingredients and the cardboard like crust, the pizza maker rifled his hands thru a garbage can (looking for God knows what) before he pulled the miserable excuse for a pizza out (named 'Honolulu) of the oven, sliced it and presented to me. Friends told me this was a higher standard of take away pizza in town. This operation doesn't show any indication of this. The basic fare of Pizza Pizza on the corner of Danforth/Broadview need not fear from any competition from this outfit!"}
{"text":"I usually buy the pizza slices during lunch hours at work. In a nutshell, the pizza is cheap, and in line with the cost. You get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less. The slice size is fairly generous; each slice is 1/4 a large or x-large pizza (can't remember). The pizza does not have enough sauce in my opinion, more can be added."}
{"text":"Wide variety, but not really up there in quality. It seems as if people may be intrigued from the wide variety of different pizza slices available. Not horrible pizza, but not a place I would go out of my way for. The Italian name/look is pretty misleading but it does the job I guess."}
{"text":"Although Pizzaiolo is a chain (and I'm usually pretty opposed), they do things right.  If you're rolling solo or in a hurry and don't want the typical greasy slice of za, they have you covered. Thin crust italian, pretty good.  Try the Bianca."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza for about $20 and shared with a friend. To be honest, I've heard raving reviews about this place, and decided to give it a try. I do acknowledge this is a pizza chain, but the pizza was not actually too bad. It is better than most of the other pizza chains, with both taste, and freshness. (I've been served cold pizza before)   Again, paying $20 for a large pizza is a little absurd. It basically is just dough with sauce, cheese, and some toppings, but that's how they make a profit. I got the meat lovers pizza, and it was fairly generous with the toppings. The one thing to note, was that it was fairly oily, but not as oil ladden and deep friend feeling as Pizza Hut. It was almost a medium between the non oily pizza places and pizza hut. Had noticeable oil, but not as much as Pizza Hut. Overall, okay, and wasn't too much of a surprise."}
{"text":"Pizzaiolo requires a discerning eye when picking up your pizza by the slice.  You must carefully eye all the different options and balance flavor with the one that appears to have been cooked in the last hour.    In all seriousness though, this is your only decent choice in a many-block radius for pizza by the slice.  In fact, sometimes the slices can be relatively good....their flavors are many times better than Pizza Pizza!  The two reasons this doesn't get the 4th star: ----Some of the pizzas sit around for way too long.  It's not only a health hazard, it's a flavor hazard. ----The staff lean towards the unfriendly side.   No one ever seems happy to help me...in fact, way more put out is the way I would describe it.  They have a huge back area in the restaurant, but no one ever sits there...this is a 100% takeaway/delivery joint it seems.  They have an easy-to-use online ordering system.  P.S. I chuckled when I saw the review that referred to their stone oven.  They have a super commercial metal job.  No stone or burning wood was harmed in the making of your pizza."}
{"text":"Location has gone downhill... used to be very well run in its early days (around 2010) but now there seems to be zero food handling training/hygiene rules for workers and I started going less and less often... until today, the last day I will ever go after having had the worst case of food poisoning (felt it happening within 30 minutes of eating there...).   Go anywhere but there for pizza if you value your health."}
{"text":"After eating here I am neither fascinated nor compelled to repeat the experience , yet not turned off enough to bash this place either.   Hence the 3 star. Its just...meh...OK at best? It is not all that its made out to be. At least not for me."}
{"text":"Online the price was advertised as lower than what the in store price was. They refused to honour the advertised price.   \"Deep dish\" is just double crust."}
{"text":"Ok -- I have eaten at a number of Pizzaiolo's and had better pizza.  I used to buy here a lot, but I think they have had a recent change in staff (at least on the weekends), and it was not great.  I went in to buy some slices and they did not have a great selection.  The only meat pizza they had was pepperoni.  Anyways, I ordered one veggie slice and one pepperoni slice and asked them to give them extra time in the oven as I like my pizza hot.    They did not give it extra time, and then when they came out, they started sprinkling extra parmesan on -- which I didn't want (they should have asked first).  Plus on top of it, the guy who did it looked like the delivery guy -- and he put his bare hands inside the bag of parmesan to grab a handful cheese for the slice--- ugh!!!! Too gross.  Bring back the other guys please, and also start wearing thin gloves or at least only have the kitchen staff touching the food please.  Also -- if a customer tells you they want the slice \"well done\" then they mean well done.  The slices were tepid.  Probably means I won't be back to this particular location again."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza with good size portions. Every time I pop over for lunch the pizza is fresh. Good service, Quick and friendly.   Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER order from Pizzaiolo again! I ordered a Party pizza and a gluten free pizza online. The order arrived and I had a medium pizza and the \"gluten free\" pizza was not in its usual gluten free box. I immediately called and left the guy know the mix up. I asked about the GF pizza and he told me that they never put them in GF boxes, despite my friend who has Celiac being very clear that every other Pizzaiolo location she has been to has special boxes for their GF pizzas. After another couple minutes of the back and fourth while I tried to ask if the pizza was actually GF or if it would make her sick, he admitted that they had run out of boxes.   He then goes on to tell me that the Medium pizza came to him through the online system as a Medium and not a party, so basically too bad. I asked if the online ordering system could have messed it up. He admits that it could have and asks if I would like a new one made. I tell that I would, but that I have already waited an hour for this pizza and we had to leave in another hour for a hockey game. I asked if it will take under an hour. He tells me it will take 20 minutes. I tell him that I would like it remade. We wait the hour and decide to leave, not wanting to miss our game. A couple friends stay behind to hang out, not wanting to watch.   They met up with us afterwards and told us that the pizza had arrived an 1hr30mins after we'd left, and that they were EXPECTED TO PAY FOR IT! Not for the difference between them either, for the full price. Luckily they apologized to the delivery guy (not his fault) but refused to pay.   I CANNOT believe this poor customer service. Clearly they do not need my business. I suggest not testing them with yours, you might be out $50 like me."}
{"text":"I love the this place. They people who work here are amazing and they deliver great pizza with good quality and unique (compared to other chains) toppings.   Yes pizza is more expensive than 241/pizza pizza but they are that much better.    Love them (also love our local 241)"}
{"text":"If you love pizza and good service this is the place for you. The slice options make it great for everyone. No more compromising over what goes on the pizza, just pick the slice you like.  The staff are always happy to see you!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place a couple of months ago to get a slice of pizza.  The pizza slice felt like holding a steaming hot stack of paper towels with grease on it.  Located in a basement style construct on Adelaide Street West and John Street, the atmosphere was quite humid with the close quarters and large pizza ovens operating.  I highly recommend this place if you plan on breaking up with someone as this place has a lousy atmosphere which suits the feeling of being dumped or potentially breaking someone's heart."}
{"text":"First off - I really do love their pizza.  When it comes to the larger chains of (delivery) pizza, this is till my go-to for awesome (tasting) pizza.  This is now the SECOND time in a row where I have been left wondering how Pizzaiolo gets delivery SO WRONG and how Pizza Pizza gets it so right.  2 weeks ago: ---------------  Ordered 4 pizzas for a lunch & learn at work at 11am to be delivered between 12:30-12:45pm.  The Pizzaiolo is NEXT DOOR to my office, so I figured this would be NO ISSUE!  At 12:45pm, we finish our lunch & learn, and yet no pizza.  So I proceed to call the store and am told that they the driver is just pulling up.  This was not so!!!  At 1pm, I call again and they tell me that they had just sent the driver out NOW.  So I gave it 10 minutes.  Still NO PIZZA.  Then I call back, at which point they tell me that the driver had forgotten the mobile payment machine and had to go back to the store.  The pizza finally arrived at 1:30pm (45 minutes late) and was fine.  No apology from anyone, no mention of a retention type discount or promotional offer, nothing.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  Yesterday: ------------  We had a much larger event and for lunch decided to give it another chance.  Ordered pizza at 11am again for delivery at 12:45pm.  This time, we ordered 7 pizzas.  Within 5 minutes of our order, I got a call asking me for my credit card information because they wanted to ensure that this wouldn't be a fraudulent order and I was assured that I would not be charged for the transaction until the pizza arrived (along with the delivery person and payment terminal).  I gave them my credit card information and as soon as they got it - the first question was if she could NOW charge the card.  I told her that it wasn't okay and that I wanted to pay in person.  The pizza delivery people called to ask the major intersection, which I gladly gave them and then again at 12:45pm unable to find the address.  I had to direct them to a VERY CLEARLY marked building, and wait for them outside so they would know where it was.  The delivery came up to our space and when I took out my credit card to pay, they told me that they had already processed payment - which I told them was unacceptable. Again, NO APOLOGY.  Just a matter of fact'ness about the entire ordeal.  The delivery person left and I proceeded to open up all the pizzas to feed my team.  Much of the pizza had slid around during delivery, with slices and toppings out of place and folded over slices abound.  ===================  OVERALL, if there was a pizza place that actually had better pizza, I would whole-heartedly stop ordering from them.  Unfortunately, Pizza Pizza is like cardboard and Panago does not have sufficiently large enough pizzas to feed my team at a reasonable rate.  --- Severely, doubly disappointed"}
{"text":"Similar experience to the many other 1 star reviews so would highly recommend you get pizza elsewhere, this is Toronto where there are way better options. Specifically asked for it to be heated in the oven longer, which was acknowledged with a Greek head nod. By the time I took my debit card out of the machine for $4.80 my slice was magically heated. Barely warm yet alone hot. Basically they are incredibly lazy and have a complete disregard for customers. The other Pizzaiolo locations should be ashamed of this one on Danforth."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online from this location. $25 for a medium chicken pesto pizza. After 75 minutes, no delivery. Called the restaurant and was told it would be around 2 hours total before delivery. Ridiculous! Pizza arrived cold and had a hair baked into it. So gross - we will never be back. I expected more from a premium brand. No reason this place washouts charge such exorbitant prices, and it you cannot deliver within an hour during normal weather when there are no major broadcast sports happening, you shouldn't be delivering."}
{"text":"I called and spoke to the owner, he was very genuine and concerned and sent me a pizza on the house the following night and it arrived exactly at 7:30 with apologies from the driver.  Their pizza is so good that I am totally thrilled that they've fixed the delivery glitch so quickly. Kudos to you."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in the Annex by far. Forget about Famoso, Hey Lucy, etc., and definitely forget about Pizza Pizza. We walked by this place a million times without noticing it before finally ordering a couple of pizzas and I cannot believe we've been missing out for so long! We are regulars now, and the pizza and service are always great. Our go-to pie is the spinotta on thin whole wheat crust. Crispy, flavorful, and unique. Try this place out immediately!!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered take-out or delivery so I can't rate them based on service or atmosphere.  But as for their pizza, they have now become my favourite pizza chain in Toronto.  My previous fave included Amatto's and Papa Ceo's but the generous toppings and tasty sauce have put Pizzaiolo #1 in my books.  The only gripe I have is the pizza crust is a bit oily.  But I'm not eating pizza to be healthy ;)"}
{"text":"Crap. I did online delivery and I had an invoice for $25.65. (Invoice was emailed to me as well). I had $28 ready for the driver. He turned up with an invoice for $28.04 and started shouting at me. Never again, these people are dishonest.  Pizza was ok but not as good as Amatos."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the first reviewer, it's very good but certainly not gourmet.  I'll be generous though by giving this Pizzaiolo location four stars because it really wasn't bad for a chain restaurant.  I ordered seven extra large pizzas for an office lunch and the service (driver included) was very friendly and professional; the pizzas arrived hot and on time with no errors.  They provided far more than enough disposables, which we really appreciated, considering some places are quite stingy when it comes to giving out napkins.  It cost about $195 for the seven extra large pizzas, which I don't consider too expensive as it fed about 25 people and we had leftovers.  I tried the Soprano and the Capone and they were both pretty good - nice thin crust and good quality, non greasy toppings.  My only complaint was that there was very little gorgonzola on the Soprano which I may bring up to them next time.  The other pizzas we ordered were Meat Lover and Capri and they, along with the rest of the pizzas, were scarfed down by the staff - some people enjoyed it so much that they ate like six slices (ladies included).  Bottom line: will order again!"}
{"text":"Quite good for a non-gourmet pizza place, always satisfied. 100% better than Pizza Pizza a few doors down..."}
{"text":"I frequent the Pizzaiolo at Danforth/Carlaw quite a bit and they are always on point but the past three times I've been to this location(Broadview and Queen) they had no vegetarian or vegan slices available. Not even plain cheese slices were for sale. Every time I ask they say \"Oh there will be some ready in 30 minutes, we were really busy\" which as a former member of the hospitality industry I can understand but it can't be a coincidence that every time I went they didn't have what I wanted. \"Too busy\" is not a suitable excuse to me as when I ran a kitchen I was always able to meet costumer satisfaction regardless of business flow. One of the times I went it was very slow and the counter attendant was just chatting with a delivery driver or someone instead of doing his job.  For a pizzeria that has such a wide variety of vegetarian and vegan pizza to offer and is also very welcoming to non-omnivore types, I find it perplexing that this can happen so consistently.  The Danforth Location always has something to offer me (never once have I went away empty handed) so I will keep frequenting that location, but I will never go back to the 'Jillys' location and will also tell others not to. Get it together Jilly's."}
{"text":"I very good selection of different gourmet and regular pizza.. There's something for everyone here.. I think I just found my new favorite pizza joint.. A must try.."}
{"text":"Thursday night, I was going to meet some old co-workers at Rosewater for cheap drinks after work so I decided to grab a pizza bite before going inside on Toronto Street.  I used to hit up this place for lunch when I worked for George Brown College.  It was delectable many years ago and may be still during working hours.  However, at around 5:45 PM when most of the financial district has gone home, left over pizza from lunch time can be seen from the window and up for sale.  For sure these have been left out for a couple of hours.  At any rate, I was starved so I ordered a slice of GIANNI OLA, here are the ingredients from the Pizzaiolo website: Bacon (Real Canadian), Mushrooms (Fresh), Pepperoni (Dry Cured), Mozzarella Cheese and Pizzaiolo Tomato Sauce.  The lady put it in the oven to re-toast/bake, took it out to cut it in half and I brought it to my table.  What can I say, dry, left-over old pizza is not amazing, no matter if it is reheated.  So I definitely experienced better.  Some of it was still yummy tasting, thanks to the swine meat and cheese!  It was quick and for $3.99 + GST (5%), no PST was a decent 'nuff for me (Restaurant meals (whether dine-in or take-out, and including fast food) under $4 are exempt from the Ontario tax.   Would only return if I was starved and in the area."}
{"text":"The person who took my order had some serious problems understanding what I wanted... I agree with the previous review in the fact that I repeated the order maybe 5 times and then she came to me to ask one more time and she still got it wrong!!! I don't see how a place can be so bad. People were not polite and the place was actually dirty and rather hot in the middle of the summer...   Don't bother coming in here!"}
{"text":"the old guy behind the counter is  extremely rude.  doesn't acknowledge when you are talking to him and when you repeat yourself acts like you have committed a grave sin."}
{"text":"I like this location because it's close to work and truthfully, I never tried it until last year because all along I've been a fan of the other pizza guys. But then one day out of curiosity I went in to try a slice and have been hooked ever since.   For $4.10, you get a really big slice of pizza. It's about the size of two of the regular pizza slices you get down the street. It's also the same price for all the varieties and they sure have a lot of varieties. I'm always holding up the line trying to decide what to get. The Hawaiian and the one with two types of olives is really good but I can't remember the name of it right now.   Here's how I break down the rating.  Value 4 Taste 4 depends which one you get Fresh 4 if you go at lunch, they have fresh out of the oven pizzas due to high turnover Service 2-5 depends on who is behind the counter. One guy was super friendly and the other was not at all and just stood idly and didn't both to help even though there was a line forming and asked for my order multiple times before he rang me in.  Cleanliness  3 again this depends on who is working behind the counter. I have noticed them putting the pizza cutter right by the counter where they put the money... eeeek"}
{"text":"When one is on a budget, what better than to share a large pizza with 3 people?  I was attending a concert last night and had to choose a budget dinner, since we were all low on cash. After reading the overall positive reviews of this restaurant, I decided to try it out. Bonus for the fact it was a frigid night!  We ordered a large Sicilian pizza to eat in, which took 20 minutes to make from scratch. The seating area was quite dirty, but not to the point I would have to hastily clean the table up. The heater wasn't that strong and it was a frigid night last night, so we ate with our jackets on.  The pizza came out steaming hot, which was perfect for us. Better yet, all of us enjoyed the pizza very much! The toppings were all fresh, not frozen, and the pizza was definitely large enough to fill us 3. For a low cost of $20 after tax, it is definitely worth the money if you have 2 or more people and are looking for a budget meal.  Definitely a will come back for me whenever I'm craving pizza!"}
{"text":"The Godfather is always the best slice to have! Their dough is absolutely delicious and everything is all natural :). Definitely going to come back as usual."}
{"text":"I've tried to order delivery from this place twice now and the pizza never arrives. After an hour and 30 mins and calling them back and saying the delivery man never showed they let me know the pizza was free. The delivery man still never showed, horrible service. Don't order from here"}
{"text":"Look, I work in the financial district. That means I'm more important than you, and I need my lunch done right. So I appreciate that pizzaiolo will let me order online, walk in, pick it up, and be on my way.  Plus, you can get pineapple and olive and they won't bat an eye."}
{"text":"This location of Pizzaiolo just opened a couple weeks ago, and has fast become my go-to joint for slices.  Although I'm not a chain restaurant fan, this definitely beats the nearby alternative, Pizza Pizza, by a long shot.  At Pizzaiolo, I actually eat my crust, instead of stopping where the toppings end.  They have a very nice selection of pizza slices, including several vegetarian varieties and a few with whole wheat crust.  It does annoy me though that, with the exception of one or two varieties, the whole wheat crust comes only with the vegetarian options.  I live whole wheat, and I also like meat!  Oh and the pizza slices come out of the oven at a perfect temperature, nice and hot, a simple feat that Pizza Pizza (see my review) could not seem to master."}
{"text":"A great spot for an afternoon slice. With 3 different types of vegan pizza available and $4 a slice, how can you go wrong?  My favourite was originally the Fredo, potatoes with rosemary is a good combo. The only problem is, they cut the potatoes to thin! Honestly, how much are you spending on potatoes? Give me a decent slice! Now I'm leaning more towards the Vittoria, those herbed tomatoes really hit the spot. Wait, how come \"herbed\" isn't a word? What about herbing? Nope. Darn that sucks. I should probably re-write this review then. Hmm... nope, it doesn't look like that's going to happen."}
{"text":"As mid-range pizza chain restaurants go, this is my favourite. I think one of the things they really have going for them is they are in a very popular location, so whenever I ask them what's freshest they point to a slice that's just come out of the oven. Pizza really is best served fresh. They use decent ingredients too. While this is not among our very favourite pizza restaurants in Toronto, it's our favourite local fast food pizza spot for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day. had a horrible experience with the cashier, who didn't follow our basic instructions (pepperoni on top), then started arguing with my pregnant wife about the pizza. The cashier then decided to make a scene and start throwing things around the kitchen. Another member of the staff came by to apologize, but was very disappointed with the service. Another walk-in customer had to wait over an hour for their pizza, only to find out it was sitting on the counter the whole time. The cashier forgot to give it to them.  I emailed Pizzaiolo about this incident and never got a reply back. Very disappointed, usually very good service and food from Pizzaiolo, I would avoid this location at all cost."}
{"text":"Super bonus points for being open so late - saved my life early in the morning more than once. Pizza itself is pretty bland, and the crust is horrible, but their topping selection is very good, even late at night. The clientele here gets a bit weird, especially later in the night.   Still, 4$ for a massive slice that's basically 2 slices of pizza is a lifesaver."}
{"text":"WOW just finished 1/4 pizza (or they'd call it, ONE SLICE).  This is by far the best Pizza I've had in Toronto! (My fave pizza is still the one I had in Vegas). I got Suprano, which is not as meaty as I usually like my pizzas. It's $4.90 for ONE SLICE (1/4 pizza). That's a HUGE bargain, especially in this expensive neighborhood. I usually pay $10 for fast food lunch. And I managed to save half of my budget by eating delicious BIG PORTIONs of PIZZA. (I will never get over the portion and price. ) Unlike my other reviews, I will confess that I'm easily pleased with pizza. I mean, I was eating PizzaPizza for a while with a frown. So anything better was BETTER. And the pizza I had today was SIMPLY pizza dipped in liquid gold!  The thin crust is perfectly crunchy and not overly greasy. The different cheese blend is firm, non-stick, soft and warm. The thin slices of Italian sausage added a kick in flavor.  When I was done with my last bite, I wanted MORE. So I went on their website and determined to have Sicilian tomorrow."}
{"text":"This has super good pizza! It's hard to find good take out pizza in the beaches. Pleasantly surprised! Had a pepperoni, mushroom and bacon kind and also veggie. Great!"}
{"text":"Always been a supporter of pizzaiolo and this location is no different. I am not a huge fan of their individual sold slices however. They are still good but something is always a tiny bit off. Maybe just because it sits there for a bit vs the whole pizzas you order. I have no time for the fancy (frankly disgusting...) pizzas some people like with pineapple, mushrooms etc. I Never get soppressata or any of those speciality Italian styles either as that stays in the Neapolitan restaurants only. In any case great spot for ordering whole pizzas!"}
{"text":"I had 30 minutes for a quick lunch with a friend and there aren't too many places in that part of the town where you can get your food, sit down with someone and have a chat.   The store is located right on the street corner. There floor is below the street level by maybe a foot or two.When you walk in, you face the counter. The seating area is off to the right.   First off, it definitely not the best place to have a conversation in. Sounds and noises bounce off the walls in all directions. Secondly, Pizzaiolo is not the cheapest pizza around. Is it that much better? Well, maybe. Especially if you are into thin crust, something that's hard to find elsewhere. I find it a bit too oily though (and that's quite consistent across several locations)."}
{"text":"10:45pm pizza craving.  Parked up front and ran in and bought 6 slices to go.  It was stacked up on top of each other on paper plates inside a neatly folded paper bag.  Temperature was still warm when I get home and it tasted pretty good.  Pepperoni was a bit salty but what pepperoni isn't?  Crust had some char but it was good char.  Ate all the pizza and ate all the crust.  It was good even cold.  I'd order it again."}
{"text":"Yep, this is my new favourite pizza establishment. Fantastic toppings, fresh, tasty, AND plenty to choose from.  Although I mostly get delivery, I do like that when I walk-in to grab a slice, I have many pre-made choices waiting for me. Truly a very extensive amount.  And, really? Who knew potatos on pizza was the right thing to do? It sounds weird, but the taste buds never lie. They know."}
{"text":"When you order pizzaiolo you should also call the police cause you're going to get raped. I paid $40!!! And the toppings were stingy. This pizza was supposed to have bacon. I ate 3 slices with one piece of fatty bacon."}
{"text":"In theory, one would think this place is awesome. After all its pizza! But there have been times my boyfriend and I have come to this location and not only is the it cold... in the dead of Winter, with their air ventilation system trying to eliminate the hot air from the ovens, but their pizza, goes cold really, really quickly too.   When I ordered a slice, I ate half of the slice and the other half, had hard, cold cheese on it instead of at the premium temperature for eating pizza... FYI: I am sure the air vents are super great in the summertime.  Recently, we decided to order wings and pizza for delivery... well never again! Their wings were so fatty that each bite had a glob of fat in it. The texture of fat in the mouth is rather unpleasant. Needless to say there was a lot of waste.  Apart from that, I do like their variety of options, for vegans and vegheads. As well as the calzones, they are rather tasty according to my boyfriend, as I have yet to try one."}
{"text":"Had a slice of Soprano with absolutely no blue cheese on it today. So it basically was a cheese slice with a few sun dried tomatoes and a few sopressata slices. Pretty disappointing. You know the pizza is lacking toppings when one of the toppings doesn't make it on 1/4 of the pizza.....  Still any Pizzaiolo is better than going to a Pizza Pizza. So still 3 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed. Purchased their deep dish pizza. When I got home, there was very few toppings, hardly any sauce, and I don't even think there was cheese on it. Their deep dish pizza was not buttery and crisp. It was just a lot of pizza dough. The dough wasn't even that good. The dough is what makes the pizza.   It is really sad when the best pizza on Church Street is from Pizza Pizza. Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"In case you were wondering if this location is as good as the others... it is! I haven't had a better pie anywhere in Toronto (fancy-pants places included) and the 2-topping take-out special is great. Licensed, too, although they don't have a huge selection."}
{"text":"I had a slice for lunch today.  It used to be awesome ... now it's awful.  Their lack of customer service is appalling.  I was waiting to pay for my slice and I was ignored while the cashier and owner yakked about something.  Then she took my $$ and gave me my change and no \"thank you\" and continued to ignore me.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Higher end pizza so get what you pay for ... high quality and great-tasting pizza! Their online ordering was convenient, staff were friendly and polite on pickup."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place for a slice. But but it's gone downhill a bit. I only order one thing. Capone and Greek salad. Ok that was two things.   Salad is still fine and good value. Feels like the quality of the slices have slipped a bit. Still ok and good value for the price but just not as good as it used to be.   Last time I was there I asked for some tap water. They usually get a small cup and fill it at the sink directly behind the cashier. This time they gave me the cup and told me to fill it in the washroom.   Um.....no. You just lost a star there. Really? I would have gladly waited I saw you were busy (it was the noon rush). Sure I know it's all coming from the same water main but there's just something a little off if you're drinking water from a public bathroom sink.   Well I haven't been back since. But hey next time I'm parched I will drop in again!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype! I had heard a lot about this pizza place and was excited to try it. I found it pricey and the food was sub par. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza (it came with ham, bacon, and pineapple). It was expensive. You pay by the topping (I think it's $2/topping). I didn't like the sauce. It smelled good but tasted bland. I'll stick to Dominoes."}
{"text":"Ordered the whole wheat vegetarian pizza. Although made promptly - the pizza was garbage. The cut tomato was cubed and whitish. I expect the tomato to be very thinly sliced and ripe. Baking the pizza like that made the entire tomato juice overflow on the pizza and picking up the slice made the entire ingredients fall of the slice. Add to that the pizza thickness in the center was very low which further made it difficult for the ingredients to stick to the pizza. The pizza didn't taste very good and had no salt. Understand that salt can be added later - but for a \"gourmet pizza\" claim - they need to live up to the expectation. I give them an \"F\" overall."}
{"text":"Pizza was yucky. It was super bready and light on flavour and toppings. Delivery took a long time and when it arrived ,SURPRISE, the delivery man had no change, and we were not prepared to pay $40 for a $28 pizza.we were able to use debit at least. We won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are pricy but the crust is nice and thick and yummy."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. Try the \"soprano\", you won't be disappointed! They have such a variety of toppings, and the sauce is so good.  I love it here."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Don't go to this location. We specifically asked for no hot banana peppers on the Brando. The guy refused to write that down. And we ended up with hot banana peppers on the pizza. The whole conversation was very confusing. Just not customer-friendly. The Brando was actually good - maybe I would go to a different location for that one. The other one on the gluten-free crust was disgusting. It was like eating a bunch of toppings on a giant, stale cracker. Another lesson learned."}
{"text":"Great for a quick cheap bite.  They have about a dozen different slice options waiting.  Big slice, crispy crust, good value.  Far tastier than chain competitors.  Options for vegetarians include a tasty whole wheat veggie.  There's a small seating area but most people take it to go."}
{"text":"Good pizza but the service is absolutely terrible. When I say terrible I mean 2.5 hours and did not receive the pizzas for our kids party. All we got was ....oh sorry. Brutal"}
{"text":"Pros: - Quick and cheap - Taste pretty decent  Cons: - Nothing really  Ordered: Hawaiian Slice - Pretty standard.  Conclusion: If you are looking for a quick lunch, Pizzaiolo is a good option. It's quick and cheap for those in a rush. The slice I got, the Hawaiian,  is pretty decent.   Nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either. Would recommend for those in a rush"}
{"text":"Here's what's up with this particular Pizzaiolo...  1. It's fancy. It's got chandeliers. If you like to feel classy when drunkenly ordering pizza then this is the place for you!  2. It's yummy. Like meat? Like olives? Order the Godfather pizza with olives. Trust me.   3. Pick-up! It take 15 ish min if you're ordering a full pie! Seeing as I live around the corner all I ever do is pick-up. So far? So good.   4. OPTIONS! I LOVE HAVING SO MANY OPTIONS! SO MANY DELICIOUS CHOICES OF TASTY PIZZZAAAAA!   So yeah. That's would conclude my \"what's up with this particular Pizzaiolo\" ! Happy pizza eating!"}
{"text":"Godfather pizza is the best on their list. Never goes out of style. The staff are really nice too."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. I am glad they decided to openup in mississauga. Diana is their best  pizza."}
{"text":"I've had this pizza a couple of times - it's damn tasty. They certainly picked up where Amato plummeted into failed business-hood.  I'm giving them a crappy rating because we ordered delivery last week - the guy had a really difficult time taking the order, after an hour and a half of no pizza (and two confusing phone calls) our empty stomachs were eating themselves so I finally canceled the order, opting to go out to eat. The delivery guy showed up shortly thereafter anyhow with a cold bag of food that looked like it had been been kicked around.   He was pushing his way into the apartment, demanding we take the food, as I was trying to close the door after politely declining twice, my boyfriend finally had to yell profanities to get him to leave.  Totally never ordering from them again, but might hit them up on a late night stagger home."}
{"text":"Last week I ordered a pizza using their online ordering (which is TERRIBLE in itself) and it came, and it was wrong.  I kept it anyways (because it takes 1+h for delivery) but I emailed them and told them it was wrong.  No one ever wrote me back.  The driver also took my $20 and didn't even offer me the $3 change.  He was back in his car before I even shut the door.  I was definitely going to give him a tip, but him just taking it and running really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm not going to order delivery again.  The in store experience is good and I don't mind stopping for a slice on occasion."}
{"text":"Maybe I was too excited about Igor riding the all terrain segway last time I reviewed this Pizzaiolo...  Twice since that date I have gone and they have been completely out of beer, so the $9 beer + slice special was unavailable.   The bad: - They are often down to 1 or 2 slice options after 10pm. - Sometimes they are out of pizza and stay open (wtf?) - They close at 11 during the week. I always want pizza at like 1130 on Tuesdays.  Yesterday was the last straw for me. They were out of draught beer, but didn't say anything until after we had already ordered and paid! They offered us bottles of beer but the value proposition was extremely sketchy. Slices are $4.19 individually so having a shitty bottle of beer with it makes it like $5.80 additional for a drink. Why didn't they say something before we cashed out? Donkeys.  Goman ordered a Moosehead and I ordered a Corona and she gave him a Stella (not advertised as available), but then didn't have another one for me so I had to stick with my shitty Corona and he got a good beer (good being subjective considering we were at a Pizzaiolo).  The pizza is still really good and it's still really close to Gomans but the beer situation is unacceptable and also happens ALL THE TIME."}
{"text":"This must be the most amazing pizza in Toronto.  At first glance Pizzaiolo is no different than the dozen other pizza joints on the Danforth - similar look, prices and ambiance. But on a tip from a friend I decided to try it out, and man am I glad I did!  I had a pepperoni with ricotta, which on top of their existing mozzarella and \"Pizzaiolo\" tomato sauce was flat-out incredible. One of the most fantastic pizzas I've had in recent memory.  I can't speak for the single-serve slices for eat-in or carryout, but a fresh pie from Pizzaiolo's is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"am actually a fan of this pizza chain. Though for some stupid reason I always ask for the prices of each pizza slice. And EVERY time they tell me that EVERY slice is the same price. I prefer going for the thick slices, and always ask that they cut them in half - because they are so thick, I end up eating the 2nd half later."}
{"text":"For some reason I always ask what the price for each slice is. They always tell me that every slice is the same price, and yet I can't process this! Anyway, I really like the array of options they offer, and the fact that they are not all thin crust pizzas. I personally like my crust fat! So whatever mood you are in, Pizzaiolo will more than likely have what you are looking for. And more importantly it will cost you under $5 with a drink, and the slice will fill you up (I hate small portions!). :)"}
{"text":"I love the crust at Pizzaiolo, its not super thin, although you can order a full pizza that way, it has softness but also a nice chewy texture, and it just seems to have more flavour than the other pizza chains.  The true test... my dogs rarely get any leftover crust when we order here!  This location has a great deal on an XL 2 topping pizza if you call in your order (NOT through the website) and pick it up.    I live closer to the Church Street location, but I find the pizza at this location much tastier, which is strange considering it's a chain, but I also had a slice at the Queen and Broadview location and it was not as good either.  Weird.  Luckily I am close enough to this location to pick it up and get the special.  A few times I have been in the pool at the YMCA around the corner and looked up to the room above and whatever group that had booked their meeting room had many boxes of Pizzaiolo lined up for lunch... evil temptation while I am swimming laps!  Great selection of slices at lunch, the choices are fewer the later it gets."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Lots of variety and you will be full when you are done especially if you get the godfather."}
{"text":"It is very fast and cheap and good. Pretty much everything you want in a take out restaurant. The staff is a little overly critical it seems, maybe just a bad day or something but other than that, it was a good trip.   2 slices (which ends up being 4 slices) was less than $10 even with a sauce (which I recommend) and by the time I was done, I was very full and satisfied. Will have to go here again."}
{"text":"I am not being dramatic, this is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Ordered a pineapple mushroom (my go to) and I swear, no other pizza place has done it this good. I am so thankful this is a chain restaurant"}
{"text":"Most bland pizza I have had in a while.  Maybe I just picked wrong since there did seem to be quite a selection of pizzas on display.  For real, it seems hard to mess up a white pizza, so I went with the Blanco.  On second thought, maybe that's the problem.  A simple pizza relies on solid ingredients to make it memorable.  And this one had about as much love as an awkward first date.  I tried to spice it up by adding a ton of chili flakes, but that didn't even resuscitate a flutter of a heart beat to this pale lackluster meal."}
{"text":"Delivered pizza arrived burnt; naturally didn't notice until delivery guy left.  What type of business would allow a burnt product to be delivered or served?  Called to complain, but would have to wait 45 minutes for a replacement.  There is so much completion for pizza deliveries out there, I will never  order  from them again."}
{"text":"I love Pizzaiolo. They definitely have Pizza Pizza beat in the flavour department. I find PP pizza so bland. Like eating the box the pizza is suppose to come in. Enough about defaming the competition. Back to business. The slices are very large and are always fresh. I usually fall back on the Honolulu slice with a drink for $6 when I need a quick lunch. The staff here are quick as well. I would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"I love me a plain pizza.  A nice crust, some mushrooms, and cheese, and I am in heaven.  I took me a long time to find a place that made that kind of pizza here, but now, I feel like I will pass out if Pizzaiolio ever leavse me. =D  A nice thin crust pizza with mushrooms and double mozza with herbs and sauce and wow.  So happy.  We've ordered some of the more complex pizzas which are also good, but I am going to stick with this wonderful basic while my friends get the more exotic toppings. =)  Which are really good too.  We ordered one of the vegan potato pizzas and added cheese and well.  It was Carb Heaven.  Basically, I love their pizza and am SO GLAD we found them.  Yay!"}
{"text":"A delicious slice of delivery heaven. If I want to order delivery, this is my favourite place. The Gianni Ola with its bacon and mushrooms and soft and chewy crust makes me so very happy.   This location has always served me tasty slices in store, with plenty of seating and is always prompt in delivery and pick-up situations. Only once did I have a somewhat creepy man hit on me while trying to order over the phone. Just once. Ah well, thems the breaks for tasty pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I almost never get takeout or order pizza - I would much rather go to a restaurant, sit down and have a really good pizza. But, the other day a craving struck, so we ordered Pizzaiolo. We actually ordered our pizza online (extra large honolulu, so we would have leftovers), and we picked it up 20 minutes later. They had just made it, because when my husband got there it was just being cut.   We actually really enjoyed this! As far as fast food goes, this is pretty good. The crust is nice and chewy, not too thick and light on the grease. If we will be ordering fast food pizza again, this is our go to place. It definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Out-of-towners beware -- Pizzaiolo, in itself, is a very delicious, gourmet pizza spot in Toronto. This one, however, is very sub-par. The pizza barely had any sauce and was very oily. Also not a lot of flavour. My brother got a plain pepperoni slice, and I got another slice that I forget the name of. We didn't enjoy it at all. When normally, I'm feeling guilty because Pizzaiolo's so delicious! The atmosphere is kinda blah, unless you're out on the patio. The staff was nice and they have a good drink selection including beer."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm pick up special 13.99 with any two toppings . Great quality pizza, u get what u pay for, being Italian I know good pizza when I taste it ;) quality of ingredients was on point, dough was fantastic.  Great job this evening guys"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, friendly staff and delicious pizza!  Had a craving for pizza after a walk and decided to stop in before heading home.  Ordered a Honolulu and sat down to enjoy the pizza, several other patrons did the same and it was comfortable---also you were able to take advantage of Starbucks wifi!"}
{"text":"Pizza is OK, but nothing special. Awful service, terrible attitude. I only go to this place when I am totally desperate/stuck."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. Stopped in with 3 friends and everyone enjoyed their selection. It's quick and by the slice is 1/4 of a pizza. Great price too. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I can't believe this location has such poor rating because I have been to many pizza iolos in Toronto despite they have same recipe , this location has the BEST pizzas . I just read he previous ratings all due to NONE-Taste related issues rather than delay on delivery time n lost phone number to call back, or mixed up the order with other ones . But I personally don't see any problems here. I am personally picky with pizzas especially in terms thickness, texture, flavour , sauces , freshness. I NEVER really like d outer crust but this is one location I will eat everything of pizza.   The location is VERY clean! Has plenty seating too with expansive Wooden chair with comfortable padding!  Whenever I come in the place is always SPOTLESS! No grease on the wall or anywhere ! The owners r SUPER friendly! I once didn't bring my wallet , n only had 2.5 dollars cash. When I ordered the employee told me it's okay just give him later. Lol I was impressed. I did go back later that day handed in $2 haha :):) whenever I came back they had different employees on different days but they were always polite .   It was random how I got into pizza here. I was walking by one day seeing a guy at front patio table eating the FRESHiest good looking gourmet  pizza n instantly I was like:\"I want that!\" My be thought I was joking but I was serious! We went in I order the chicken with red pepper, my bf had pepperoni!!!! OMG they were delicious! I would not normally use \"delicious\" to describe pizza. But the ones here r so yum! The pizza is thinnish and very soft inside crunchy outside. The pizza guy does fantastic job knitting. It left great memory. The sauces r tasty n not too sour like PizzaPizza.   N since then I have been back so many times and NOT one time I was not blown away by how good their pizzas are! I only did walk in too. They are bit line up at times but always worth it! They aren't cheap on ingredients too u always get a lot of meat on the pizza, def get money worth and it's very satisfying for meat lovers :)   Top 4 best pizza locations I have found last 15 years living in Toronto:    this location;  Big Slice at Yonge /Gerard ;  Cora Pizza at Spadina/Harbor King Slice at Queen/Lizgard   Judging how previous ratings that they were not up to the expectations for online ordering I would probably try to avoid doing that but I would think their walk in ones r top notch. I have since gotten 2 more friends hooked on those at this location haha. And I have tried pizza iolo at 3 other locations they were huge let down after trying this location.  The location at Spadina/Adelaide was really bad n NOT fresh. The pizza was dry , had totally diff texture, meat had odd taste at that location I had to toss the pepperoni one aft a few bites.  Love this one hope eveyone try this location come back to give them a fair review . I think their pizza don't deserve a 1.5 star review for sure !"}
{"text":"I popped in for a slice before beginning a night of drinking next door a Prohibition. This is an odd location. For one, it's really huge for a pizza place. Yet there isn't a ton of seating. The decor is a mix of styles. There's chandeliers hanging from the celing above the order area, exposed brick behind the counter, exposed beams at the entrance, and the walls are painted an odd mustard/egg yolk colour. Also, it's hard to tell if they're fixing the place up or what as there are holes patched in the walls and what looks like a botched job on the installation of the chandeliers.   But the pizza was good."}
{"text":"I had 2 slices of a vegan pizza with added vegan cheese. It was really good and tasty. My only critique is I think the restaurant could improve on its atmosphere. A lot of the tables weren't wiped and the women's toilet was clogged. But other than that, good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in Toronto.  Pizzaiolo offers something for everyone -- they have your typical, white-washed pizza, as well as better homestyle Italian ingredients. They have a whole bunch of vegan and vegetarian options, as well as a substantial amount of vegetables for those who just care about the quality of food they put in their mouths.  You can get a slice and a pop for $5, and they do delivery and takeout as well. Some of the pizzas they offer are strangely delicious...they have one covered in Thai chicken and satay sauce that is actually good! My personal favourite is the Bianca -- mozzarella, zucchini and artichokes. Mmmm...  This location is decent -- my favourite one was a couple blocks down, closer to Spadina, but it was the one that got caught in the Queen St. fire. This location is just as good, I used to grab a slice on my lunch break when I worked on Queen. Totally worth trying a slice, buying a whole pizza can get pricey compared to Pizza Pizza or similar chains, but obviously you are paying for superior pizza with better ingredients and a cooler name. Love this place."}
{"text":"I would give this review five stars if I was only talking about the gluten-free pizzas they make.   As a natural-born North American pizza lover stripped of gluten-crust-eating ability, I can say that, hands down they offer the best gluten-free pizza I've tried in the city. Given that pizza dough pretty much relies on gluten, making a decent crust is a tall order without it, and I'm very impressed with their formula.   With respect to Pizzaiolo's other fine attributes: - Good mobile app - Love the range of extras: you can add garlic, gorgonzola, and a bunch of other stuff to custom-perfect your pizza - They'll have something for your pizza companions who like to get dirty with a thick greasy meat lovers as well as for vegans or people trying to keep the (calorie) costs down  - Generally, their pizza--from Chicago deep dish to hyper-vegan-healthy--is pretty damn good and there has been some thought to creating nice specialty pies that have a finesse that goes just slightly beyond your average pizza joint.  Lastly, I've never had problems with the delivery service, which is all I've used from this location. If the app allowed you to pay with credit card online vs. at the door that would be awesome, but it's not that bad to whip the visa out at the door."}
{"text":"In my continuing quest for 5-star delivery pizza in Toronto, I decided to try Pizzaiolo for the first time. (Yes, I know it's a chain but I never bothered.)  I'm going to cut to the chase. We ordered a couple pies for delivery. We waited an hour. They only brought one pizza and we discovered after opening the box that it was the wrong one. We called to let them know. The delivery man came back 10 minutes later with our correct order. He wanted to know if we still had the other pizza.  That's right: He wanted the pizza back. The one that was delivered incorrectly and sat in a stranger's home for 10 minutes.  HE WANTED. THE PIZZA. BACK."}
{"text":"If you're looking to just grab a slice real quick, Pizzaiolo is the place to go. Nothing out of this world, but the slices are decent. They have a ton of slices to choose from at this location."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Very generous with toppings.  Only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce!!  I don't like too much sauce, but it was a bit dry,  do next time I'll ask for more!    Otherwise outstanding pizza,  great selection of toppings too!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Stupid me.  I have SUCH a terrible memory.  I made the mistake of ordering from these guys again - and it was exactly the same experience.  Nice pizza, but STUNNINGLY expensive for the MINUSCULE toppings you get.  Dumb me just paid $70 for a pizza with WAY TOO little toppings on it.  When am I going to learn?"}
{"text":"Wow...This was a great find. Found it on Yelp as being close to our hotel with a decent rating. It was sort of a hole in the wall, but the pizza was delicious. The employees were fun too. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This is some of the worst pizza I've had in my twenty-some years on this earth.   I found the pizza to be to be excessively dry. Their marinara sauce is paper thin and becomes relatively non-existent when subjected to the heat of the oven.   When asked for a side of marinara sauce, the man informed me that it would be an additional $0.90.   I was less than impressed with Canadian pizza. Take a one-hour flight over to New York for a better meal.  I can't recommend this restaurant in good faith."}
{"text":"Surpasses any fast food pizza expectation. Their crust is wonderfully crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the insides.They have great topping combinations and they are fast. Although I am more of a carnivore than an omnivore, I must say that when I tried some of their vegetarian slices because they looked really cool and different, I was very pleasantly surprised! My favourites are Spinotta and Gianni ola"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have really ambitious Saturday night plans.  And...sometimes those plans end up being thrown off by a last-minute proposed \"Newsroom\" marathon.  PJs, A/C, big screen and...pizza.  Pizzaiolo rounded out our night perfectly.  Pricier (and slower on delivery time) than the average chain, as soon as your Pizzaiolo order arrives it's clear why:    full chunks of roasted tomato with oven-charred skins;   a thick blanket of spinach; generous dollops of cheese    ...this place takes pizza seriously.  The menu gets extra points for having many vegetarian (and even vegan) friendly offerings.  My go-tos are the spinach pie with an olive oil base, and a saucy option featuring a classic tomato base, gorgonzola, red onion, and mozzarella.    And here's the part of the review when I get...crusty.  Oh no, not rough or surly (thanks, online dictionary!)...this is the portion where I review the crust.  I really enjoy it 'CUZ, LIKE:  - it's neither too think nor too thick (it's the Goldilocks of crusts!) - it has a crisp outer texture and provides a stable base for each slice (good for the grab-and-go) but is still tender to the bite - it is delicately flavoured with olive oil, which pairs so nicely with the toppings, especially if you're opting for a white or marinara-free pie - it makes excellent midnight and day-after leftovers (PROVEN)  Yelp note: pass on the dipping sauces which detract from, as opposed to complement, the pizza.  Especially disappointing is the marinara: whereas I was expecting a styrofoam mini-cup of Pizzaiolo's own sauce, what I got what a chilled plastic container of Heinz marinara/ketchup.  WOMP WOMP.  Good thing we had a big bottle of sriracha to come to the rescue."}
{"text":"Just visited here last Saturday night during Nuit Blanche and even in the late hours of the evening they spin a mean 'za at Pizziaolo. I had a Mediterranean-style slice on a wheat-free crust and it was pretty killer. There are always a wide-variety of slices on offer and they were easily able to accommodate a vegan diner in our group.  I also sat here for the first time ever. Pizzaiolo is long and narrow but has lots of seating toward the back. We munched down our slices with enthusiasm. We also saw two dudes that looked exactly like Ben Stiller. Take from that, what you will."}
{"text":"I'll be honest right off the bat and say I have an inherent bias against warmed-up pizza slices. Everything that's good about pizza - the sauciness, the oozing cheese, etc - vanishes once it hits that oven again and the previously delectable foodstuff becomes a dried-up, shriveled-up husk of its former glory.  I was in a hurry and figured I'd give this location of Pizzaiolo a try. Their 'zas, when freshly made, are usually an improvement over your Pizza Pizzas and your Dominos, so I figured a slice from them might not be so bad.  Incorrect, sadly.  I selected a slice of the Sicilian (Bacon (Real Canadian), Red Onions, Sausage (Italian), Mozzarella Cheese and Pizzaiolo Tomato Sauce). The first thing I noticed and what made me immediately regret my choice was that the slice was stiff as a board. It was hot, sure, but the reheating process had sucked all the moisture out of the slice. It was as arid and dry as a nightmarish, punishing desert.  If there was any of the Pizzaiolo Tomato Sauce, I didn't notice it. The sparse cheese didn't help matters, nor did the almost unreasonably thick crust. The toppings were all fine, although there was more onion than anything else. (I think I got maybe two bites with bacon.)  Reheated pizza slices, you truly are the worst."}
{"text":"I saw a list today for \"best pizza in Toronto\" online and Pizzaiolo was rated first. My boyfriend and I (fans of Panago & Dominoes) decided to try it out. MISTAKE. We ordered online and designed our own pizza: tomato sauce, grilled chicken, pineapple, banana peppers with garlic dipping sauce. Someone called to tell us they were experiencing high than usually order volume, so our order would take up to 1hr 10 min. OK, thank you for the warning. Well, 1hr 40 min later, the pizza arrives: NO sauce, grilled chicken, pineapple, banana peppers with CHEESE dipping sauce... not to mention the cardboard crust, and raw dough center. If Pizzaiolo is the best pizza in Toronto, the Queen West location is NOT doing it right. Seriously, just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Order from here on the regular...never had a bad pizza. Never. And that's saying something. The staff are pleasant and friendly. Always get the walk in special over a slice. Prices are good. Plus they play Spanish dance music, which is fun."}
{"text":"I've been to this Pizzaiolo a few times. It's located next to a bridal shop, which makes it easy to find yet awkward to walk into. The pizza itself is really good, though their slices are 2 real slices, which means it's 1/4 of a pizza pie. I like that they have a lot of pre-defined options. I have also ordered from this location for large work events a number of times and it's cheaper and tastier than Pizza Pizza, where we have ordered from in the past. After taxes, 10 extra large pizzas come out to $200-$250. They also have gluten-free pizzas available. The largest gluten-free pizza size is large."}
{"text":"Used to like this Pizzaiolo location but after coming back to this area and eating here a few times for lunch can't recommend it.  Basically Pizzaiolo is a chain that charges a little more for pizza that is a little better.  The problem with this is if you take the pizza and leave it in the over to reheat forever it comes out tasteless and kind of gross.  That is what you get here."}
{"text":"In store experience: 5 stars Delivery experience: 2 stars  For the former, Sarah L and I visited the newly opened location at Broadview and got slices to stay. Counter girl Paula was very friendly and cheerful, although her lack of proper implements with which to open the glass bottle Coke they now sell here was troubling. Someone get this girl a bottle opener...how is this not part of the Pizzaiolo toolset??  For the latter, online ordering was a failure. The new location isn't yet programmed into the database (somebody update the XML, mmkay?) and as such it was pulling The Beaches store as my nearest location (closed at 10pm; I was ordering at 11pm) with an estimated delivery of...14 hours later. Hmm. So I called instead.   The person who picked up the phone answered with \"Hello?\" and I had to repeat my order a few times. She told me it'd arrive within 40 minutes, and when I asked her for the total, she said it'd be \"between $20 and $30.\" WTF.  Fast forward 90 minutes later and our pizza still hadn't arrived. Actually, so much time had passed that I actually forgot I had even ordered a pizza. It was almost 1am by this point, I was hungry as fuck and the store itself was about to close. Pizza finally arrived a few minutes later - the driver didn't ring the doorbell (as I had stated in \"special delivery instructions\" when I ordered the pizza) and had been standing there for god knows how long, knocking faintly on the door. Ugh."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the service. I don't know what everyone else is complaining about.  I ordered an extra-large pizza online with different toppings on both halves. I wanted it ready for 6:45pm.  Around 6PM, I received a call saying that they were out of broccoli for the one half, but that they'd double up another ingredient and give me two free pops. I doubled up on chicken and got two iced teas.  The pizza was ready when I arrived and the girl was very kind. I approached her with a smile and got one in return.  For a regular pizza-chain, the pizza tasted good. It wasn't as good as small ma & pa type restaurants, but it was good enough that I'd go back. I don't know how the slices are, but to order a whole pizza, this place is very acceptable.  The pizza was under $30 and fed three people with a left over slice. 4 slices each."}
{"text":"Pizza is good - not amazing or original. Kinda expensive. We ordered a large with three toppings for $18."}
{"text":"I got what I wanted.  A late night slice(s).  Satisfying, yet the pizza kind of lacked great flavor.  Perfect what what it was....  A late night dive in."}
{"text":"Parking is a disaster but the owners are very nice. The smallest size they start off with is a medium."}
{"text":"Wanted to catch something quick after work so I decided to stop by the Pizzaiolo location around the Yonge and Wellesley area. Now Pizzaiolo is a newer pizza franchise that's pushing hard to gain the pizza lovers of Toronto. I found this to be especially true with a number of locations stretching up Yonge from Dundas to Bloor.  Pizzaiolo marks itself as a gourmet pizza choice with healthier and more distinct ingredients.  They do have a relatively diverse set of pizzas so it's not a bad idea if you want more than just the casual. I stepped in and got the pizza combo which is going for just under $6 after tax at this location. So it's definitely not the cheap pizza choice like Pizza Pizza or 2-4-1.  I got the meat lovers with a fresca.  Pizzaiolo typically makes its pizza with a thinner crust and \"gournmet\" ingredients. And to be honest, this is evident in the presentation and even taste. The meat lovers pizza was nice and it's definitely larger than the Pizza Pizza slices. So size wise, it does offer you more with the price tag. I found the pizza to be good and no complaints in general.  A nice slight crunch with each bite and definitely filling enough that you won't be crying for more food within an hour. And the amount of toppings with each slice was refreshing.  It gives you what Pizza Pizza use to in terms of amount of toppings.  Is it me or does Pizza Pizza really stiff you on the amount of toppings nowadays. The same can be said about Pizza Hut too and I'm not ordering the discounted special. I'm talking 3 toppings large with stuffed crust or something. Friggg.  Overall, I liked Pizzaiolo. It is more expensive and sometimes when you're just craving pizza, this can be too much of an extra buck when a McCain frozen pizza would do just fine. I would say they have a lot of similarities to Mama's Pizza. In fact I have always had positive experiences with them.  So if asked, Mama's or Pizzaiolo, who would you choose?"}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered the \"Capone\" - Chicken Breast, Roasted Red Peppers, Mushrooms, Parmigiano, Mozzarella and Pesto Sauce (no nuts) on thin crust. Wasn't that tasty. Crust was super hard. The tastes didn't go well together. They also don't do whole wheat crusts on small and medium pizzas. Pizza Nova's chicken pizza is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Favourite pizza in toronto . My go to pizza is a meat lovers . It's very rich in flavour . A tad expensive but I swear by this place ."}
{"text":"The crust was fine but it was too much crust. I can feel my carbo count being wasted.  The meat on their meat lovers wasn't a good mix per se. And it was very salty.   Compound with all of that is the expensive price. So overall I wasn't really too happy with what I had, but hungry is as hungry does so I ate.  So far hitting a string of bad or blah restaurant quality. Hope I get out of the rut soon."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Delicious like I remember from my university years, downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how bad this pizza was. I'm not even sure there was cheese on it when it arrived. Literally the worst pizza I have ever seen. Of course I called the store and complained. To their credit they sent me another one. This time it was bigger and a bit hotter. Trouble is it was still terrible. Taking a bite of it all I could think was that every ingredient was measured and that measurement was sadly under represented. There is simply no excuse for allowing this product out the door. They should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"This place blows every single pizza chain restaurant in Canada out of the water in my opinion.   Every time I have a slice from here you can just taste the fresh ingredients and how fresh the actual pizza is, even the slices.   Is it healthy? No. Is it a big restaurant. No. It's a tiny hole in the ground that makes delicious pizza, especially post bar. Simple.   Best pizza in Toronto? Doubtful. But out of the chains like pizza pizza and pizza nova, even Mommas Pizza, all can't be compared to Pizzaiolo!!!   Sicilian is my favourite slice, giani ola is worth a try at least once and even the simplest pepperoni slice is amazing.   3/5 for me!"}
{"text":"A OK, A OK indeed...  Have you ever had one of those days? Those deep, dark, days where it's raining outside and in your heart? Well, try having one of those coupled with a 13 month old. Can I feed her pizza? Yes, but, is that, like, OK?   Pizzaiolo is great because you can pick and choose down to the details of type of crust (whole wheat for her, white for me... do as I say, not as I do, etc.), sauces and a yuuuuge list of fresh veggies. Hot, fresh and at my door in 30 minutes.   Thank you, Pizza Gods. No matter what fresh hell I weather, you are always on my team."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but the service is horrible. I mean you actually feel offended it is that rude.  I came here a year ago, the manager was rude then so I didn't return. After a year went back for a slice and yeah its the same rude service.  Never again."}
{"text":"It's decent pizza, compared to Longo's, Pizza Hut and Pizza Pizza. Not overly salty, fresh ingredients, nothing to rave about though. 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch and value.  Pizza and pop special with  many great selections is a great way to go for fast lunch. Staff are very friendly.  Clean establishment."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Whole Wheat Vegan Slice on Saturday.  This location was also able to work with a giftcard.  I am not sure what the deal is with the location on Spadina north of Adelaide.  This is now 3 out or 4 that was able to work with the gift card."}
{"text":"There are 2 reasons this is a 4star and not a 5.  The one and main reason is the lack of accepting franchise gift cards at this location on Spadina north of Adelaide. As I was thinking of what I should eat, I remembered I had a Pizzaiolo gift card with remaining balance.  Here being alongside the great pizzas Pizzaiolo has presented me with in the past, which drove me to them on Monday May 30th in the evening following sports in need of recovery.  However, after ordering, as I was pulling out my gift card to pay my portion, the friendly server serving me and my friend mentioned to me that the location did not accept the Pizzaiolo franchises gift cards.  There was a reason presented to me which was that it was not correctly configured and annoying for the owners.  I find this to me to be a very poor business practice for the franchise especially in this specific location.  In the past, I also wanted to use a gift card at a different location, they struggled to do the transaction, but eventually seemed to get there.  Part of what franchise gift cards to me are good for is their flexibility across the \"entire\" franchise.  The other reason which was partly my fault, is that I got offended as I am a vegan with the proximity of especially the meat, the server and cooks seemed to do as I asked in regards to separating the pizza, with only a small crossover.  Though there seemed to be only small in the box spread the halves.  However, I do wish I requested for the pizza to be separated before being topped.  I am not sure if this is possible, but in the future it or something else to separate would be ideal for me.  Besides these issues the pizza was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great experience here at Pizzaiolo.  It gets full (5) stars from me.  The only demerits I have are the wait and a few burns.  For both, they tried to do their best.  They did seem to be busy and still tried to accommodate me to have a short waiting period.  The cook also mentioned burns were possible, and if so, seemed open to discussing it further.  I was simply just hungry and it was good enough and still a really nice eat!  Also, this location vs. my previous review of a visit to another location(near by).  They were able to work with my franchise gift card.  It seemed they needed to educate themselves a bit in the process, though they got it done in a decent amount of time!"}
{"text":"This place has hands down the yummiest gourmet pizzas in the neighborhood.. We always go for the Primavera and have never been disappointed.. The taste is very light.. You can taste the freshness of the veggies and the olive oil and oregano give it an extra kick.. I wouldn't recommend the plain cheese from this location though as it was just to bland."}
