{"text":"Great tacos and awesome staff. I recommend this place for anyone in Henderson... Have the Carne Asada Tacos..."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The only drinks they had were beer an Margaritas. Although the menu said red and white wine. We had to ask for a menu because they forgot to bring us one. Beware the chicken quesadilla it was inedible the cheese inside look like kraft cheese squares. The waiter was great an very apologetic. The carne Asada burrito was apparently good."}
{"text":"I love supporting local restaurants and was super excited to see that there is a New Mexican restaurant in my beloved downtown Henderson.  

However, I'm sad to report that this was a first and last trip to Tio Julios.  

1.  I will agree with the other Yelpers that the avocado fries are BOMB!!  They are so, so, so, good!! 
2.  Their salsa is great but it is accompanied by seriously burned chips.  
3.  They charge for soda refills!!  I mean what?!  Really?  They don't even tell you that the refills aren't free.  They just add it on to your bill and 'surprise!' you've been charged for 2 drinks when only one guest had a soda.  Not very cool. 
4.  The meat in my Mom's shredded beef burrito and my carne asada taco was pretty tasty but was served to us just slightly warm and not hot.  I'm not sure about everybody else but I like my food to be HOT!!! 

So while there were some highlights to our little culinary adventure there were definitely more hiccups.

If you're looking for some tasty Mexican food this may not be the place."}
