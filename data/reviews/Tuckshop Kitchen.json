{"text":"Delicious food, terrifically nice people, and a great overall experience. We love getting their lasagnas for dinner. I would recommend checking it out for sure."}
{"text":"Great Burger! Definitely add the bacon.
Seating is all outside but there's plenty of it.
The side of potato salad is delicious but miniscule."}
{"text":"What a find!  

Love the ingenious conversion of a garage into a kitchen.  A great little spot for made to order sandwiches.  

My friend and I had the BLT with roast turkey....house cured and smoked bacon, lettuce,
tomato, basil mayo served on toasted multigrain bread.

There's nothing like a freshly made BLT.  The bacon added fabulous flavour and made the sandwich.  Bread could have been toasted a touch more.  

While there are only 2 seats inside, lots of space outside at the picnic tables to enjoy our sandwiches.

Will definitely be returning for another BLT or other menu items."}
{"text":"Came across this gem while running errands one Saturday. Tucked just off of Dupont, we probably passed it a dozen times without noticing. Yelp highlighted it in the area so we popped in.

We've been twice now. Super friendly service, small tight menu plus the added bonus of a tuck shop/general store with candy, chips, chocolate bars and miscellaneous sundries. 

One of the best burgers we've ever had. Seriously. The turkey, Brie and apple sandwich is fantastic. Absolutely love having a wicked good sandwich, bag of chips, pop and a homemade cookie for lunch. 

Kudos!"}
{"text":"THE BURGER IS MIND BLOWING. Get Glenn's burger, with the added balderson cheese, house smoked bacon and jalapenos. I'm a bit of a burger snob and I never leave reviews but the burger is too damn good not to. I LOVE YOU TUCK SHOP"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Cool little spot! Had BLT (awesome bacon!), breakfast sandwich, burger and kids grilled cheese. All worth getting again."}
{"text":"Tuckshop is a hidden gem that makes really delicious sandwiches. They aren't cheap - but they're really filling and they taste like real ingredients. I'm particularly a fan of their burger, although I have yet to get something off the menu here that I haven't liked. The guys who work here are super friendly too. Definitely give this place 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious. Had the burger and she had the grilled cheese - both great.  Burgers don't come with cheese, but I added it. May not have been necessary. The people in this real small shop were super friendly. The place had a comfortable atmosphere also. Seating was all outside and it was a nice day so that worked. Not sure what they do in the winter/rain, but is seems like they pack everything \"to go\" whether you are dutton at a table or not. 

Cookies were also reallllllyyy good. Overall a cool spot. Not super easy to find as its around the corner off Dupont just a little."}
{"text":"These burgers are great. There is no other word to describe them. I took a group of students from New Hampshire and some of them ordered a second. The mixture of different meats and spices is incredible and the price wasn't horrible. Very small menu but I guess once you find something you do well keep at it. 
The person working tonight get was very personable. She answered a numbered of questions about the area. 
Went there again two days later after eating at a number of other restaurants. They have the best burgers in Toronto. The staff is super friendly and helpful. 
Basically what I'm saying is eat here."}
{"text":"The Royale burger was amazing. The beef itself was perfectly cooked and very tasty, amazing thick bacon and soft cheese which complimented the burger perfectly."}
{"text":"So I'd normally give a 1 Star for this but I do like the food a lot.

I come here pretty often as I work in the area. I love the turkey sandwich but the bread is consistently burnt every single time I've ordered it, like not a little burnt - one side is just totally black. I've mentioned it before and they've just shrugged it off.

The reason I said I should giving this place a 1 star is because of the burger. Yes the burger is great tasting, one of the best I've had in the city, BUT..... I got incredibly sick from it. Not OK. 

I remember taking a bite out and seeing the inside was a bit more pink than I'm used to. But I shrugged it off as me just being paranoid and ate the whole thing anyways. Stupid me. I had nothing else to eat that day so I know it wasn't anything else.

Initially I just wasn't going to say anything because it happens and I have been eating here for months with no problems from any of their menu items aside from constant burnt bread. BUT, food poisoning from an under cooked burger is not okay at all, not even once. I'm really hoping they get it together because as I've said, I do really like their food."}
{"text":"Just tried the BLT sandwich with a side of slaw. Initially thought the sandwich was a little on the small side, but I'm nice and full after eating it. Nice thick chunks of bacon.  Very friendly staff, and I love what they have done to the space inside and out.  Love the mix of tuck shop items.  Cool concept, and aesthetically pleasing.  A great addition to our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This place is a must do!! Very small but the food is AMAZING! The burgers are outstanding, the house cured bacon and Peameal pork is to die for.. The staff is friendly and eager to talk and socialize when there is time. The turkey sandwich with Brie was amazing. I was not disappointed with anything they cooked for me and my family while in Toronto. The next time in Toronto I will be back. Seating is  limited to tables outside. They also prepare meals to be picked up and taken home, don't be shy give them a call I promise you will be very satisfied. If you are in the area you MUST stop by and give them a try..

{"text":"Had their BLT with Balderson Cheddar this weekend - Amazing! The house cured bacon (from a farm in Ontario) was so thick and delicious and the homemade mayo gave it a great kick. Can't wait to try their weekend breakfast sandwich. Also really enjoyed their service and had a great chat while my food was being prepared :)"}
{"text":"Adorable addition to this corner. The patio has plenty of seats and you can dine there while people watching. The burger is also one the best burger I've had. Thanks for the lovely afternoon, Tuckshop! If you are waiting outside they will kindly bring your order outside for you. Even if there's only one person working at the shop. 

Side note: We also ordered a tomato soup, but it was just too salty, seasoned to be more of a sauce and not really a soup. Took it home and made a tomato stew with it, and it was one of the best stew I've made."}
{"text":"The young Newfoundlander that runs this restaurant surprises me every day. This is my new lunch spot. As you can tell by the lineups and the droves of people that come across the street for lunch this place has amazing food. And there's usually a homemade iced tea every day. And even though there's lots of people in line they still pump out lunch at an incredible rate with exceptional flavour. High-quality ingredients from what I can tell homemade pickles and a great attitude. This place is a gem. Don't miss out on this compact establishment, it puts out satisfying food with incredible flavour. did I mention there's a beautiful park covered with shady trees just 25 m up from the restaurant where you can enjoy your lunch in the shade."}
{"text":"If you're tired of bland uninspiring food, with bottled sauces from the store, then head on over to Tuckstop.

Staff said that the owner grew up north and wanted the feel of a convenience store that you would find when you're away at camp, except for the fact that it serves up delicious food. A very kitschy place with miniature picnic tables, \"Where's Waldo\" posters and milk in glass bottles for sale.

I can truly appreciate that they \"grind, smoke, roast and cure all their meats on site\" (says on menu). They also make their hot sauce, croutons, salad dressing, and lemonade in house as well. Everything's made fresh to order so there's a little wait but the enticing aromas are a nice stimulant for your appetite.

OUR ORDER:
- Tuck Royale burger: ground brisket, pork shoulder, smoked back fat, house smoked bacon, 2 year Balderson cheddar, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato, onion, chimichurri mayo. It was cooked well done but it wasn't dry. Man oh man was it flavourful! 
- Grilled Cheese: Gruyère, Swiss and cheddar cheeses, spinach, sundried tomato chutney, roasted red peppers. Another winner in the taste category! The carnivore in me says next time to add their 2x house smoked bacon.
- Caesar salad: so fresh and oh so tasty,  just like the ones prepared table side at those fancy shmancy restaurants.
- Raspberry lemonade: made in house and sweetened with honey. Was ok.
- Green Bastard Hot Sauce made from Serrano chili peppers and lime: spicy AND delish, couldn't  get enough of it. They make different kinds of hot sauces, but this one, they should bottle and sell.

Free parking, free WiFi, cool staff: enjoy your well crafted meal indoors bumpin to some funk and disco or outdoors in their patio surrounded by the lovely neighborhood with pretty flower gardens."}
{"text":"The nicest staff! The first time I went, the girl really took the time to explain the whole menu! I went back the next day with a friend who had just had her wisdom teeth out, and the employees went out of the way to make a sandwich on bread that wouldn't hurt too much to chew! Food is awesome, they have free wifi, and a little patio outside to eat at!"}
{"text":"I just ate an A+ meal.. Thank you TUCKSHOP.  best burger in the city (humble opinion). Also a great salad of the day (chicken/walnuts). The owner couldn't be nicer and more likable. You can't help but wish a place like this all the success possible!  
Only challenge if you don't live in the area (walking) horrible for parking/transit but worth the effort (came from etobicoke). 
Can't wait to return.."}
{"text":"Great burger! The bacon are for real - nice thick pieces, not like the ones from the grocery store. The burger meat was very unique, i think it was ground brisket. The breakfast pulled pork sandwich was decent, but the burger was definitely the star"}
{"text":"I am so addicted to the sandwiches at this place. I've been several times now. The service is great. The menu is small. Any bigger and you'd be unable to choose what to get. All the sandwiches are amazing. The shop also has a small selection of convenience store items. It's a nice neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"Very nice little sandwich and burger joint with serving quality ingredients all made in house.   They cure their own meats and even the sauces ! 
The house potato salad is straight fire yo  

I had the daily special pulled pork frittata - a healthy potion served on a sesame bun for $8 - def worth it! 

Local spots get love"}
{"text":"Lovely little joint with nice people. The burgers have the makings of something delicious, but all I experienced was missed opportunities. Bun could have been warmer, so that it didn't dominate the flavours of the stuff inside. 3/5 on first visit, but I'll give it another go! Do try it out."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick low key breakfast or lunch. It definitely won't break the bank despite the fact that it is all made in house.
I got the club sandwich and potato salad ,it was delicious.  My friend got the burger and It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Incredible burger. Ground brisket, pork shoulder, smoked back fat.... the texture, the flavour. I always order it with the 2-year old cheddar and it's perfect. Super nice staff."}
{"text":"burger was lit af and potato side salad went down too easy but was small. add ons like cheese are a bit pricey"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the tuck shop and food was amazing! We had the Tuck Burger (delicious meat, perfect size) and the Roast Turkey and Apple sandwich (also delicious, the apple flavour really makes a difference!"}
{"text":"The burger was amazing! It was one of the better ones I've had in awhile. I added bacon to mine and I'm glad I did. My boyfriend got the peameal bacon sandwich which he said was really good (I'm not a huge fan of peameal bacon, so it's best to take his word for it). I really wish they had more than two stools inside, but there's not a whole lot of space. They do have tables and benches right outside, so I think it'll be pretty busy in the nicer weather. Tuck Shop also sells coffee, chocolate, chips, bread, milk (Harmony milk, woo!), etc. Good selection of drinks, although I wish they had a better brand of root beer than Dad's. Sandwiches are like $7.50 which I think is very reasonable for the quality of food. 

A definite revisit, but I might wait until it gets a bit warmer so I can eat outside instead of taking it to go."}
{"text":"I have had the burger and breakfast sandwich and they are both very good. The lil buddy should be called kids size, and the big buddy should be the little buddy. Kindof miniature. The food in general is expensive for take out style but it is high quality. 

Today, I had the Tuck Royal burger (bacon, cheese, jalapeno) $11.25, Big Buddy combo (potato salad, Ms. Vicky's chips) $3.25, and can of pop $1.25 +HST

$17.80 total

I will likey get this again because I live down the street but would feel more excited about it if the side was a bigger portion. I stopped going here before because one of the guys was kindof weird and made me feel awkward not sure if he still works there. The person today was cool and chefed up a delicious meal."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Toronto, without a doubt! All their burgers and sandwiches have thought out toppings, all made fresh and to perfection!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for food, and also to pick up treats. The staff are amazing. Super nice and helpful. The burger is really good and well priced. The turkey and brie sandwich is also great. They have loads of candies and chocolates, as well as some home stuff. Really cute concept and unique specials. Their facebook page is helpful. The only annoying thing is there hours make sure you check if they're open before going."}
{"text":"Great peameal sandwich!  Coleslaw was pretty good. Potato salad was pretty bland. All in all, liked the place friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town! Perfectly seasoned and cooked every time. The burger comes preloaded with toppings which I think is cool because the chef wants you to experience the burger a certain way. I love that kind of stuff. But if you don't like a preset burger they have awesome options to top it with. 

Another great option is the bbq chicken sandwich that comes topped with avocado and other good stuff and the turkey burger that pops up as a special done different ways."}
{"text":"Super nice people, excellent turkey sandwich, burger is top notch, great for the neighbourhood. These guys rule!"}
{"text":"Zomygod! The burger. The hype is real. 

This place is the cutest little shop 'tucked' into the side of the building. I had read about this burger on blogTO and Torontolife. So I needed to try what all the praise was about. I soon learned the burger is a mixture of goodness, and better yet, has a much lower fat content.... Okay now really sign me up. 

I had it with the bacon (thick bacon, cut into small pieces) and cheese.  It was cooked perfectly. It was incredible!! I didn't feel heavy after. I also had a side soup -which was a delicious light side. I like a spicy soup and it was just what I wanted. 

Coming back for pulled pork. Oh and the oatmeal/skor cookies (are you kidding me?!)"}
{"text":"Tuck the other guys. This place is the tastiest junk I've had in the Junction! 

I'm smack in the middle of mat leave, and The Greatest Baby Of Them All* and I took a little staycation in the Junction Triangle. Why? Because my baby papa had to take a work trip for the second time in a couple of weeks, and I wanted an extra set of hands. Enter awesome friends who gave us their guest room and cooed at the bae while I took little breaks. Hooray for true blue buddies. 

While checking out their hood, I stumbled upon Tuckshop and I'm obsessed. Delicious handmade sandwiches. Adorable little patio. Sweetest little treats and necessities... just like a real Tuckshop. Grab the BLT add cheese. You won't be disappointed. 

*Trademark. Sorry, Blue Ivy, you're no Ellis Rose."}
