{"text":"Glad to have another location but shocked to find out they don't offer pour overs. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff was really rude. Really deterred me from coming back which is sad because I enjoy NJC."}
{"text":"Not Just Coffee has an incredible new concept with amazing cocktails, craft beer, and small plate with the same great coffee prepared by talented baristas. It's a pleasure to support this Charlotte family owned business."}
{"text":"Super slow service even when not busy. Would hate to see how long they take when they have more than 4 tables. Staff did not know the wifi passcode nor knowledgeable about the beers they have on draft. Would suggest if need a space to work in the area People's Market as far more service oriented and actually know the wifi passcode. Also note they have a no laptops policy on the weekends which further confirms my assumption that they are confused in what they want this location to be. Note the no laptops policy is not communicated on their website. They also gave my food to another customer with the staff member too focused on chatting with friends at the bar to process refund. There are far better options out there... don't bother with this place or just check out their other locations.... too many other great options in this city to have rude and not informed service."}
{"text":"My first visit to Not Just Coffee was wonderful! I will definitely be returning. It is a coffee shop plus bar, so it's perfect for anytime of the day, especially since there is food served too. I had the tangerine ginger-tea and an oat milk latte--both were wonderful! The atmosphere was hip, and the decor was modern yet cozy. The service was great. The man taking my order kindly answered all my questions about the different options and took time to check back in to see how my drinks were later. I 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Not just coffee has exceeded my expectation time and time again. Friendly baristas and great coffee. Upon entering the hip new coffee shop I was greeted by a young woman named Logan, she asked me how my day was. I was honest and said \"Not great\" because while on the way to the coffee shop I got a flat tire. Logan then proceeded to make what I consider the greatest coffee of my life. The atmosphere, and customer service is great. However I did notice that they don't have a lot of vegan and gluten free options for food but o well."}
{"text":"So thrilled to have another Not Just Coffee in Charlotte. This little location is such a sweet gem.

Took my girlfriend here for a birthday tea as she loves tea and she loved her tea latte.

They do coffee well at all of their locations and Counter Culture is delicious.

THRILLED to see a full bar and small bites menu at this location! I can definitely see myself cozying up to this bar this late fall and winter. It is a great spot."}
{"text":"In from WDC and I needed coffee. Found this spot(on Yelp of course) I ordered the nitro cold brew coffee. Super smooth and strong. Basically perfection."}
{"text":"A simple-elegant and modern coffee shop is exactly what Dilworth needed, but NJC is much more than that. This is simply put just a damn good spot for coffee, artfully crafted cocktails, and simple small plates/snacks. The service is always on point and while the prices are not on the cheap side, you're getting what you pay for. All of their ingredients from coffees to cocktails has been carefully considered and it reflects in the taste. 

My one and only qualm...the limited space. Unfortunately I think they may grow out of their space if they haven't already. I make sure to go during off hours, so that it's not too crazy. 

If you're looking for a really unique, niche, and quiet spot for some craft cocktails on a Friday night, this is your spot. 5/5 because they do pretty much everything extremely well. You can tell there is a ton of thought poured into the menu and their ingredients."}
{"text":"Great place but they really need to invest in more comfortable seating. Stools are too low for the window seats, hard and uncomfortable.  A coffee shop is a place where you want to hang out for awhile so cushioned chairs would be a good replacement."}
{"text":"Maybe my new favorite NJC location if not for anything but the food. I love Atherton Mill, but the Leigh waffle...

Almond milk latte was pretty good, but that's a standard across all NJCs.

I came here because I was hungry, and their morning food options were plentiful. I decided on the waffle frankly because I had no clue what Leigh was.

Apparently, it's a crunchier, chewier dough made with pieces of sugar in the dough, causing the waffle to almost caramelize when cooked. It was topped with mandarin oranges, apples, some greens and cinnamon honey. It wasn't too sweet which was awesome, the natural sugars of the fruit and honey were just enough.

I'll for sure be back, can't wait to try for lunch.

Only complaints are the lack of seating with backrests, and laptop use is restricted on weekends and after 5 p.m. on weekdays. Can get pretty loud too when the garage door is closed."}
{"text":"I'm addicted , and it's Not Just Coffee, but I haven't made it past the coffee. It's sooooo good, worth every penny. My first visit was at the 7th Street market location, but the Dilworth location is very cute with indoor and pity industrial chic decor. 

I'd like to come back and try the brunch or even have a drink or too."}
{"text":"Hands down best coffee spot in town. Their food and cocktails are equally impressive. A must try for sure"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee in town, can't get enough of it.  What's more is that this location offers craft cocktails... I had a delicious sazerac and my partner had a daiquiri (house drink not frozen).  Great staff and service with munchies as well.  Tucked in a cozy basement with cool vibe.  Will go every chance I go by."}
{"text":"Bright and modern space. Seating can be a bit of a challenge and rather tight. Several stool style seats at the bar and at one of the big windows. One round table and then long bench style seating (with a back) with tables in the middle and chairs on the other side. Several tables outside a covered patio. Modern piped in music at a good volume. 

Coffee is available in every style genre with some specialty coffee options. I also spotted loose leaf teas and kombucha. They also serve craft cocktails and beer. Zero pastries were available on this visit because they were still trying to figure out a vendor. There was a lunch menu of sorts, but I never saw it. I only knew they had one because I spotted someone eating a salad of sorts and some kind of flatbread situation as well. Prices a little high for some beverages. I got a dark roast Counter Culture drip and it was just over $2 and served in a ceramic mug. Good stuff! 

Staff were friendly and professional and genuine. Parking was abundant since it is located within a grocery store shopping center. Bathrooms were gender specific one at a time style and very clean and modern and roomy! 

I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this establishment. I've been to the one at 7th Street Market, but this one had food!! Let me tell you, the Liegen Waffle was  a-mazing!! I enjoyed every bite. I was sad when it was all gone! I really enjoyed it. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"The only way to make a Not Just Coffee even better-- put a bar in it and serve cocktails!! 

I have been a huge NJC fan for years and a frequent flier to the 7th Street Market location. Love seeing this brand and company continue to grow. 

This Dilworth spot also has full food menu- brunch, bar snacks, and afternoon/pm eats. Lox eggs benedict and avocado toast (make sure to add a poached egg) are both great. Take note: on Fridays, their split boards are half off. $9 for a cheese/charcuterie spread is a great way to kick off your evening. Thursdays, flatbreads are half price. 

Cocktail wise, Ben has done an amazing job crafting drinks. I'm a Fear the Reaper kind of girl. I am in love with their housemade bloody mary mix. It's currently one of my favorites in Charlotte. Other specials: Mondays $4 beer, Tuesdays half off wine, Wednesdays $5 aperol spritz and bellinis. 

James takes a lot of pride in the Not Just Coffee family and you can tell by the guys cranking out lattes and coffees here. Congrats on the new spot, Mr. Yoder. Dilworth, you are so lucky!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this location! The garage doors offer plenty of natural light and I like the open shelf concept they've got going on in the bar area. 

Coffee is delicious and if I can, I would highly recommend the iced matcha. Try it with oat milk and it will change your life. I don't even know how you make oat milk, but it adds an element of deliciousness to the matcha. 

Food is good and the avo toast looks beautiful. Only comments I'd make is that the poached egg was over cooked (the yolk was pretty solid) and the wait for your food can be loooong. Finished my coffee before the food even got to me.  But besides that, I like this place!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little shop! It's set up like an old garage building. Counter service type place. They have everything from traditional coffee drinks to craft cocktails. And my favorite, local kombucha by Lenny Boy. I'm so glad I found this spot. It is in a strip mall type place and can be easy to miss, but don't quit searching!!! It is very affordable and the staff is knowledgeable. I will try to make this a weekly stop!"}
{"text":"Their newest location is KILLING it.  Such a great space and concept.  Sparkling wine and beer on tap, the best avocado toast in Charlotte, best coffee and their staff is always so nice. 

The line for coffee was out the door Saturday.  We were lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar.  Great coffee as I mentioned.  I adore the space so much.  I can't wait to go back for a cocktail! Location is off park road in the food lion and Dilworth nails shopping lot.  I saw a pizza place Nextdoor and a yoga studio up top.  Such a cool space!!"}
{"text":"5 stars even though they spaced and forgot our drink order, the food, atmosphere and service are all top notch. Unique to charlotte where Starbucks and caribou have been the only real coffee shop options for years. The place is something you'd find in bigger gateway cities, great addition, charlottes needs more places like this. It is expensive compared to other options, which may be the only reason I won't visit all the time."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Saturday Brunch place. Mimosas are delicious. For brunch the Muesli and Avocado Toast (add a poached egg) are a must have. This place is really busy on the weekends but you can't go wrong with this place. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite cocktail spot in Charlotte! 

I've had this on my list for a while, and I was so glad to finally have the opportunity to go. I went around 9 pm on a Friday. I love the chill atmosphere and how they had the garage doors open, etc. It also wasn't too packed and not too fancy. 

I sat at the bar and ran into a friend. Everyone sitting at the bar was very nice. Ben is a rockstar and I can't wait to see what he comes up with for each season. I ordered the rye chai and it was fantastic! Watching him make drinks is so fun! A true artist. He spends a few minutes making each drink, so it's worth the wait. 

This guy could make you anything you could ever want. I love seeing he enjoys experimenting. Just tell him what you like and he will make it!

As a snack I got the chicken liver pate toast. So yummy! Great portion for the price I thought. I've been enjoying this snack a while, so I'm happy to find it here in Charlotte. 

This place is a class, stand up act. NJC has done it again!"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite of all the NJC locations - which I'm starting to lose count of!! :) I've been a huge fan of their coffee and concept since the first location, and with each one they only get better. Popped in to the NJC Dilworth location a few days ago on a cold evening with the family, and before my cappuccino even made it's way to me, I had a long mental list of everything i loved about this spot. Let's start with the pristine decor - so fresh, so orderly. Perfect lighting & music. Baristas - super friendly. Food - ahhh, so good!! The cheese toast was delicious, as was the scone.. which I understand is made fresh at the location. My cappuccino was delightful, as expected. I love that they also have a great selection of alcoholic beverages (and a bunch of local options on draft - lenny boy, freerange, wooden robot). Last but not the least, they have great hours! Need an awesome place to hang out and enjoy a cup of coffee (or a drink) on a Sunday evening at 7 pm - this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Super cute spot in Charlotte. Came by Saturday morning for brunch and ordered cinnamon toast and americano coffee. Absolutely enjoyed cinnamon toast! Very tasty!  My friend ordered a savory scone which I don't quite remember the name. It was also delicious. The flavor definitely gives you a wow moment!"}
{"text":"This is a great local spot. Barista really knows his coffee and can make all kinds of things. Live they have wine and cocktails!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location a handful of times now- it's great!

The spot: easy to park, quick in-and-out if needed. The inside is simple and elegant.

Coffee: I've always gotten a caramel latte- delicious every time even though I've had it made by 3 different baristas. Haven't ventured out to other products yet because the caramel latte is just that good. Not too sweet at all, creamy and perfect.

Service: fast and friendly. Barista with short red hair, usually wears a beanie- she's always nice!"}
{"text":"I love this new location! The extended hours are great, but their beer selection is 100% ooohh ya! Delicious whiskey, and oh ya their coffee ain't too shabby either ;) So happy this place exists"}
{"text":"Heard this place has been off the chain recently and checked it out after some pizza a INIZIO next door.  It was super relaxed and I loved all the finishes - industrial modern.  What really struck me were the two large \"garage\" doors that can be opened once the weather stops being stupid cold.  This place is definitely going to kill it in the summer.

Not much of a coffee \"expert\" but I also didn't want to be awake the rest of the night, so I opted for the Masala Chai... which was delicious.

The tables spin like Disney teacups so just be careful if you are trying to brace yourself on them.  I think they are meant to do that so you can adjust the heights.  Small and round, they make for great two-person seating, but the large bench that lines the perimeter can make for some tricky seating.  My buddy was telling me the last time he went here there were two people sitting next to each other on the bench together (it was super crowded too).  

Have yet to try their food menu here, but I will definitely be back.  The full bar is a nice touch too."}
{"text":"NJC is my favorite coffee place in Charlotte. The new location serves good drinks and coffee. But the place is little cramped and small . may be in summer the patio can be a good place to sit and chill."}
{"text":"Another gorgeous Not Just Coffee! Love the garage doors wide open to feel the breeze of spring. The caramel latte still reigns supreme. I love the concept of allowing wifi only during certain times of day. I appreciate the cafe meets bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is not just coffee, people! They have delicious food and cocktails too! The waffle is a must. The seating is limited (with a few tables inside and on a little patio too) but that seems intentional. The bar area is centrally located and beautifully designed. As always, the baristas are super friendly and offer the best customer service. Can you tell I love Not Just Coffee? 
Be it morning, mid day, or evening, this Not Just Coffee has something to offer."}
