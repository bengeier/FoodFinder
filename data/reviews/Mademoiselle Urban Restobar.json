{"text":"Pretty nice venue. I wasn't offered a food or drink menu when I attended a show there during the Fringe festival, so I just ordered a Perrier (the bartender said she had only the standard non-alcoholic options: soft drinks or Perrier.) I enjoyed the Fringe show I saw and would've gone back, with friends this time, to see it again, but the venue cancelled the show at the last minute. As a performer who tries to support other local performers, I don't think I want to go back there. They used to bill themselves as a performance venue, but cancelling live acts is a show of bad faith. It's not like there aren't other bars, cafes, and restaurants in the neighborhood - heck, even on the same block. The next time I want to grab a drink and maybe hear some live music or see a show, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've  been on this crazy pulled pork kick for weeks now, so a girlfriend of mine said that a new local place close to her serves the best pulled pork sliders around, and we should try it out since she only had hers delivered, never actually ate there. Don't have to ask me twice! We decided to go for supper, before we go party downtown. The place is  super cute, I've been there for breakfast a long time ago, it was nice and quite, but this time when we got there, a band was setting up to play. Honestly, did not expect that. We started with a few strong drinks, cheers to the waitress, she's not greedy with her liquor at all, And chatted with the band, Jerry Khan Bangers, what a friendly bunch! Very down to earth and not stuck up at all... Then we, of course, started with the pulled pork sliders, amazzzing and full of flavor, she got the fish and chips platter and I got the steak and poutine, but we ended up just sharing everything, and it was all Yummi! The portions are good too so we were stuffed!! By the time we finished supper, the band was all set up and we decided to put downtown off for a bit and stay and listen. Never heard rock n roll live before, but wow! What a huge difference from the tired old clubs with same beats blowing through the speakers, this was all live, I got to connect to music in a whole different way! By then the place started filling up and people were dancing, so, once we were able to get up after our heavy meal, we joined in on the dance floor. Had an absolute blast! Forgot all about going downtown, we ended up spending our whole evening there! The bartender said they have live events all the time,  so we'll be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"I really like the food they are serving here. Plus, the great ambience and really big choice of alcohol force to stay everytime here for longer that I was planning. Really love to spend a time here during their events."}
{"text":"Were  hiding from the rain  and  stumbled upon  this bar in the heart of the Mile End!  Laid  back  atmosphere where  people  are allowed to show  their music  skills  by playing  the instruments on the stage!  We were  here  for  over  an hour  and 2 dudes  went  on the stage  and were  somewhat  decent.  

We had few drinks  and were ready to chew on something  but  the barmaid  told  us that the  kitchen closes  at 8 and past that  they  only  have typical  sport menu... So  we've ordered  the chicken  wings  that  gave  us  more reason  to get more drinks!  Overall  very  happy!"}
{"text":"Tried  their  pulled pork  sliders  and these are  are  simple  yet one  of the  most delicious little  burgers  I have  ever  tried.  Enjoy  them  with  mozzarella  sticks for  maximum  appreciation! 

Their  poutine  was average  despite  the fact  that  waitress said  it was supposed  to be an amazing  one. 

I really  liked  their  decor  and  the interior  ambiance.  I am waiting  to visit  the place  at night  as they  are holding live  shows."}
{"text":"The room is a music listening room, which is rare these days. The sound system is excellent and the stage is spacious.

Everything else is pretty much a clusterf**k, though. It was like watching teenage kids using a cash register for the first time in their lives.

Unless the Beatles reunite and play here, I'm never going back."}
